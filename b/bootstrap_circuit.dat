This fact has led researchersto develop high speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) with low power consumption. Among all the ADCs, flash ADC is the best choice for faster data conversion becauseof its parallel structure. This thesis work describes the design of such a highspeed and low power flash ADC for analog front end (AFE) of a transceiver. Ahigh speed highly linear track and hold (TnH) circuit is needed in front of ADCwhich gives a stable signal at the input of ADC for accurate conversion. Twodifferent track and hold architectures are implemented, one is bootstrap TnH andother is switched source follower TnH. Simulations show that high speed with highlinearity can be achieved from <b>bootstrap</b> TnH <b>circuit</b> which is selected for the ADCdesign. Averaging technique is employed in the preamplifier array of ADC to reduce thestatic offsets of preamplifiers.

In practice, an ideal voltage bias is difficult to realize because of non-zero internal resistance R-in of the bias voltage source. In order to clearly observe the influence of R-in on the SBC parameters (namely the flux-to-current transfer coefficient (partial derivative I=partial derivative Phi) (SBC) and the dynamic resistance R-d(SBC)) and the noise performance, we introduced an additional adjustable resistor R-ad at room temperature to simulate a variable R-in between the SQUID and the preamplifier.

40|$|We {{present a}} dc superconducting quantum {{interference}} device (SQUID) readout circuit {{operating in the}} voltage bias mode and called a SQUID <b>bootstrap</b> <b>circuit</b> (SBC). The SBC is an alternative implementation of two existing methods for suppression of room-temperature amplifier noise: additional voltage feedback and current feedback.

The circuit branch parallel to the dc SQUID branch contains an inductively coupled voltage feedback coil with a shunt resistor in series for suppressing the preamplifier noise current by increasing the dynamic resistance. We show that the SBC effectively reduces the preamplifier noise to below the SQUID intrinsic noise.

40|$|AbstractRecently, a SQUID direct readout scheme called voltage-biased SQUID <b>Bootstrap</b> <b>Circuit</b> (SBC) is {{introduced}} to reduce preamplifier noise contribution. In this paper, we describe {{a concept of}} SBC with bias reversal technique which can suppress SQUID intrinsic 1 /f noise. When applying a symmetrically rectangular voltage across SBC, two I-Φ characteristics appear at the amplifier output. In order to return to one I - Φ curve, a demodulation technique is required. Because of the asymmetry of typical SBC I-Φ curve, the demodulation method is realized by using a flux compensation of one half Φ 0 flux shift. The output signal is then filtered and returned to one I-Φ curve for ordinary FLL readout. It was found, the reversal frequency fR can be dramatically enhanced when using a preamplifier consisting of two operational amplifiers. A planar Nb SQUID magnetometer with a loop-inductance of 350 pH, fR = 50 kHz and a second order low pass filter with 10 kHz cut off frequency was employed in our experiment.

40|$|The low {{threshold}} voltage of Gallium Nitride enhancement mode FETs {{is a concern}} in synchronous dc-dc buck converters. This paper presents a converter using a gate drive with a negative biased gate voltage on the low-side FET to improve the dV/dt robustness. The resulting much larger voltage drop during the dead time conduction is a concern as it can quickly overcharge the bootstrap capacitor voltage. This paper demonstrates that with a negative biased gate voltage, {{the rise in the}} bootstrap capacitor voltage is predominantly caused by the change in effective dead time conduction due to a variation in output load. A spice model to estimate the change is presented and verified. This paper also found that a change in the bootstrap capacitor voltage must be prevented as it leads to a significant change in turn-on dynamics, resulting in higher dV/dt stress with an increase in output load. To prevent a change in bootstrap capacitor voltage, different techniques such as Zener diode clamping and an external free-wheeling Schottky diode are tested and discussed. Finally, a modification of a standard <b>bootstrap</b> <b>circuit</b> using a series inductor is proposed and tested. It {{has been found to be}} the most effective method in preventing a variation in the bootstrap capacitor voltage and should be included when using a negative gate drive in a GaN dc-dc buck converter...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{demonstrated}} and analysed the {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) <b>bootstrap</b> <b>circuit</b> (SBC). It is {{a direct}} readout scheme for dc SQUID in the voltage bias mode, permitting one to suppress the preamplifier noise. The SBC enables us to control the two key parameters of a voltage-biased SQUID: the flux-to-current transfer coefficient and the dynamic resistance. The flux-to-current, I-Phi, characteristics of SBC are made asymmetric by introducing the additional current feedback. Depending upon the choice of the working point, this feedback can be positive (working point W- 2 on the steeper I-Phi slope) or negative (W- 1 on the less steep slope). The dynamic resistance is controlled by the additional voltage feedback. In our publications to date we presented only the SBC operation at W- 2, while in this paper we demonstrate operation at W- 1 and show that also in this regime the preamplifier noise suppression is possible. We used a liquid-helium-cooled Nb SQUID with a loop inductance of 350 pH and attained white flux noise of 2. 5 mu Phi(0) Hz(- 1 / 2) both at W- 2 and at W- 1. In the latter case, the linear flux range exceeded one half-flux quantum Phi(0). This large linear range should lead to a significantly improved stability and slew rate of the system and also make the tolerable spread in circuit parameters much wider than in all SQUID direct readout schemes known to date. Consequently, operation in this regime opens a new path to possible SBC optimization...|$|E
