2500|$|The {{texture of}} the thick double-coat is {{important}} in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is {{difficult to get a}} Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3–4 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat. [...] The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of <b>brown,</b> <b>sedge</b> or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another.

50|$|The various pits support varied aquatic and marinal flora {{including}} the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil. Other species include the fan- leaved water crowfoot, flowering rush, lesser reedmace, frogbit, blunt-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed and the <b>brown</b> <b>sedge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Scirpus cyperinus, {{commonly}} known as woolgrass, is a herbaceous emergent that is native to the eastern United States and eastern Canada. Other common names include cottongrass bulrush and <b>brown</b> woolly <b>sedge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cranes and capercaillies can {{be heard}} in the bogs during summertime. The willow grouse also inhabits the bogs. The park also has a hectare of fen, where Succisa pratensis, <b>brown</b> beak <b>sedge,</b> {{carnation}} sedge, moor rush, Scottish asphodel, and many rare mosses grow. Lauhanvuori is the southernmost habitat of the Scottish asphodel.|$|R
5000|$|Brown, {{chocolate}} and liver {{are the most}} common terms used to refer to the bb-dilution of black pigment to a dark brown. Depending on breed and exact shade, terms such as mahogany, midtone brown, grey-brown, blackish <b>brown</b> are used. <b>Sedge</b> and deadgrass are used to describe the desired Chesapeake Bay Retriever color that resembles [...] "that of its working surroundings" [...] as closely as possible.|$|R
50|$|On {{the pass}} summit, {{there is a}} {{transitional}} mire: in the mud sedge bog (Caricetum limosae plant community) grow, {{in addition to the}} mud sedge (Carex limosa, endangered) which gives the name of the plant community, also the lesser twayblade (Neottia cordata) and the dwarf birch (Betula nana). In the fen south of the Schwarzsee, a <b>brown</b> <b>sedge</b> marsh (Caricetum fuscae subalpinum community) with the endangered species common sedge (or <b>brown</b> <b>sedge,</b> Carex nigra), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) and bastard sundew (D. x obovata), as well as dwarf birch. There is a vale mire on the Kornock. Aside from the dominant deer-hair sedge (Trichophorum cespitosum), there are alpine bartsia (Bartsia alpina), alpine butterwort (Pinguicula alpina) and bog-bean (Menyanthes trifoliata).|$|E
50|$|Carex adusta, {{commonly}} known as the lesser <b>brown</b> <b>sedge</b> or the browned sedge, is a species of sedge (Carex) in the section Ovales. First described scientifically in 1839 by Francis Boott, it is found in Canada and the United States, where it grows in dry, acidic, sandy soils.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{surrounded}} by rivers, streams and drainage ditches which add to the biological diversity of the site, with many species of bank-side plant present including for slender tufted-sedge (Carex acuta), marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), and great water-dock (Rumex hydrolapathum), tubular water-dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh foxtail (Alopecurus geniculatus), early marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), and <b>brown</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex disticha).|$|E
6000|$|So they did, along a paved {{causeway}} which presently got {{clear of}} the cottages and gables of old factories, and led along, with the brightly glassy sheet of water on one side, and the steep wooded slope on the other, loose-strife and meadow-sweet growing thickly on the bank, amid long weeds with feathery tops, rich <b>brown</b> fingers of <b>sedge,</b> and bur-reeds like German morgensterns, while above the long wreaths of dog-roses projected, the sweet honeysuckle twined about, and the white blossoms of traveller's joy hung in festoons from the hedge of the bordering plantation. After a time they came {{on a kind of}} glade, opening upwards though the wood, with one large oak-tree standing alone in the centre, and behold! on the grass below sat or lay a company-—Mrs. Joseph Brownlow in the midst, under the obnoxious mushroom-hat, reading aloud. Radiating from her were five boys, the biggest of all on his back, with his hat over his eyes, fast asleep; another cross-legged, with a basket between his knees, dividing his attention between it and the book; two more lying frog-like, with elbows on the ground, feet erected behind them, chin in hand, devouring the narrative with their eyes; the fifth wriggling restlessly about, evidently in search of opportunities of mischief or of tormenting tricks. Just within earshot, but sketching the picturesque wooden bridge below, sat one girl. The little one, with her youngest brother, was close at their mother's feet, threading flowers to make a garland. It was a pretty sight, and so intent were most of the party on their occupations that they never saw the pair on the bank till Joe, the idler, started and rolled round with [...] "Hollo!" [...] when all turned, it may be feared with muttered growls from some of the boys; but Carey herself gave a cry of joy, ran down the bank like a girl, and greeted Mary Ogilvie with an eager embrace.|$|R
50|$|A {{colourful}} {{variety of}} flowers {{may be seen}} throughout spring and summer. These include cuckoo flower, marsh-marigold, great burnet, meadowsweet, common knapweed, meadow vetchling, marsh ragwort, meadow buttercup, sorrel, ragged-robin, reed canary-grass, sweet vernal-grass and meadow brome. The wet conditions encourage many sedges including <b>brown</b> <b>sedge,</b> oval sedge, yellow sedge and carnation sedge. The slender spike-rush (Eleocharis uniglumis) grows in this meadow which is rare in Gloucestershire.|$|E
50|$|The {{pastureland}} {{is dominated}} by soft rush (Juncus effusus) and tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa). Locally uncommon plants include meadow rue (Thalictrum flavum), <b>brown</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex disticha), water violet (Hottonia palustris), whorl-grass (Catabrosa aquatica) and the carnivorous bladderwort (Utricularia australis). Five specimens of black poplar (Populus nigra ssp. betulifolia) grow on site; this tree, uncommon in the UK, is near the northwestern limit of its range.|$|E
50|$|The meadows are bordered to {{the south}} west by the River Roding. They form {{one of the largest}} areas of {{grassland}} in Essex which are traditionally managed as hay meadows, flood meadows and marshland. They have a rich variety of plant species, including the largest beds in Essex of the rare <b>brown</b> <b>sedge.</b> The flood meadows have a number of uncommon species, including carex panicea and marsh-marigold. There are nearly ten miles of hedgerows. Management is by hay cutting and grazing by traditional breeds of cattle.|$|E
50|$|The two meres have nutrient-rich or {{eutrophic}} {{open water}} with the dominant aquatic plants being water lilies; Big Mere has both white and yellow water lilies, while Little Mere has predominantly white. Both meres are surrounded by well-developed reed beds, with Big Mere having a particularly large variety of species including common club-rush, greater pond-sedge, lesser reedmace and tufted-sedge, which is rare in Cheshire. Big Mere has a narrow fringe of predominantly alder woodland. The SSSI also encompasses damp grassland between and around the two meres, which contains {{a wide variety of}} plant species including <b>brown</b> <b>sedge</b> and purple small-reed, as well as marsh fern and meadow thistle, which are rarely found in Cheshire. A total of 108 plant species has been recorded at the site.|$|E
5000|$|The coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever {{is given}} the most {{consideration}} of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads [...] "The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others." [...] The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5 inches long. Moderate feathering on {{the rear of the}} hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75 inches long.The texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions.
