5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address {{a meeting at the}} University of Bath <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the {{university}} and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> and funding problems.|$|E
5|$|By the Han dynasty, {{written law}} had matured from its archaic form {{based largely on}} natural law and social customs into a {{rational}} corpus influenced <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> and based on positive law. However, the Han dynasty law code established by Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BCE) was largely an extension of an existing Qin dynasty law code. Evidence for this includes archaeological finds at Qin-era Shuihudi and Han-era Zhangjiashan. The nine chapters of the law code consisted of statutes which dealt with criminality, while two of these chapters dealt with court procedure. Although it survives only in small fragments, it was allegedly a massive written work on 960 written scrolls. The code had 26,272 articles written in 7,732,200 words that outlined punishments. There were 490 articles {{on the death penalty}} alone which contained 1,882 offenses and 3,472 analogies or pieces of case law.|$|E

5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being {{the relationship between the}} personal and the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} of {{remarkable}} creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement {{of the nature of}} human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on <b>by</b> <b>politics.</b> France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E

25|$|Mt. Everest has {{two main}} {{climbing}} routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal {{and the north}} ridge from Tibet, {{as well as many}} other less frequently climbed routes. Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996. This was, however, a route decision dictated more <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{separated}} {{by the new}} border after the Alaska purchase in 1867, Big Diomede had been home to families now living on Little Diomede and the people living on the American {{side of the border}} were very close relatives to those living on the Russian side. The communities on both islands were separated <b>by</b> <b>politics,</b> but connected by family kinships. Despite being officially forbidden, the Eskimos from both islands occasionally visited their neighbors, sometimes under the cover of fog, to meet their relatives and exchange small gifts. The local schoolteachers on Little Diomede counted that 178 people from Big Diomede and the Siberian mainland visited the island only within six months between January and July in 1944.|$|E

Relatives have said that he left the SIM card behind to save money by not surrendering the remaining value of the contract to the telephone company. The prosecutor claimed the SIM card was found inside the vehicle used in the Glasgow Airport attack. This allegation, central to the case, {{has proved to be}} false and investigating British police officers have concluded that the case is being driven <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> rather than policing.|$|E

However, they were at times dictated <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> rather planning: stops in Ruxton, Riderwood, and Village of Cross Keys were removed due to local opposition, while Mt. Royal and Timonium Business Park stations were kept because the University of Baltimore and a local business group funded them. Falls Road station was built with less parking than ridership required because of community requests, and a fence - erected {{in response to a}} homeowner objecting to the visual impact of the station - prevented riders from accessing a nearby commercial building.|$|E
25|$|To be beatified, a posthumous, {{usually an}} unexplainable medical miracle (verified by the prelate {{members of the}} Congregation for the Causes of Saints after an archdiocesan and Vatican-based medical and {{theological}} investigation, and signed by the Pope) {{would need to be}} attributed to an intercession to him, or alternatively, he could be declared a martyr or the Pope could, extremely rarely, use his right to waive both of these requirements for beatification, which, somewhat like canonization is meant to be a definitive statement about his sanctity. The controversy was whether his assassination was solely out of hatred for the faith (the requirement for martyrdom), or was influenced <b>by</b> <b>politics,</b> liberation theology, or by his vocal criticisms of the regime at the time during the civil war.|$|E
25|$|France's bid to {{host the}} World Cup {{centered}} on a national stadium with 80,000 seats and nine other stadiums located across the country. When the finals were originally awarded in July 1992, none of the regional club grounds were of a capacity meeting FIFA's requirements – namely being able to safely seat 40,000. The proposed national stadium, colloquially {{referred to as the}} 'Grand stade' met with controversy at every stage of planning; the stadium's location was determined <b>by</b> <b>politics,</b> finance and national symbolism. As Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac successfully negotiated a deal with Prime Minister Édouard Balladur to bring the Stade de France – as it was named now, to the commune of Saint-Denis just north of the capital city. Construction on the stadium started in December 1995 and was completed after 26 months of work in November 1997 at a cost of ₣2.67billion.|$|E

25|$|Sa Ngalan ng Ina was {{the first}} project of Aunor after her return, she starred with Christopher de Leon and Bembol Roco. It was also the last directorial job of the late Mario O'Hara. Sa Ngalan ng Ina is a movie made for {{television}} or a miniseries is a political drama about a widow that ran as a governor when her husband was assassinated. In his review, film critic Noel Vera {{point out that the}} show is rare creature in Philippine television, the political melodrama. Longer and more complex soap operas have been mounted on Philippine television before, and politics has been touched upon before, but far as I can recall {{there has never been a}} series (the exact name of the genre is, I believe, the teleserye) fully driven <b>by</b> <b>politics,</b> hinging upon the election into office and subsequent administration of the main character. All of the performances were great especially Aunor which gave her a nomination from Golden Screen TV Awards and a best actress trophy from 2012 Star Awards for Television. This miniseries would be the last collaboration between Aunor and O'hara before his death from leukemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} Valley House {{is located}} in The Valley, near Dugort in the north-east of Achill Island. The present building sits {{on the site of}} a hunting lodge built by the Earl of Cavan in the 19th century. Its notoriety arises from an incident in 1894 in which the then owner, an English landlady named Agnes McDonnell, was savagely beaten and the house set alight, allegedly by a local man, James Lynchehaun. Lynchehaun had been employed by McDonnell as her land agent, but the two fell out and he was sacked and told to quit his accommodation on her estate. A lengthy legal battle ensued, with Lynchehaun refusing to leave. At the time, in the 1890s, the issue of land ownership in Ireland was politically charged, and after the events at the Valley House in 1894 Lynchehaun was to claim that his actions were motivated <b>by</b> <b>politics.</b> He escaped custody and fled to the United States, where he successfully defeated legal attempts by the British authorities to have him extradited to face charges arising from the attack and the burning of the Valley House. Agnes McDonnell suffered terrible injuries from the attack but survived and lived for another 23 years, dying in 1923. Lynchehaun is said to have returned to Achill on two occasions, once in disguise as an American tourist, and eventually died in Girvan, Scotland, in 1937. The Valley House is now a Hostel and Bar.|$|E
500|$|In {{the view}} of historians, such as Philip Williamson writing in 2007, the popular {{perception}} {{in the 21st century}} that the abdication was driven <b>by</b> <b>politics</b> rather than religious morality is false and arises because divorce has become much more common and socially acceptable. To contemporary sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while planning to marry Simpson [...] "seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation" [...] for his abdication.|$|E
