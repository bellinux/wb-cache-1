25|$|Varroa destructor, a {{parasitic}} mite, propagates {{within the}} brood cell of bees. The Varroa mite prefers drone brood as it guarantees a longer development period, {{which is important}} for its own propagation success. The number of Varroa mites can be kept in check by removing the capped drone brood and either freezing the <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> or heating it.|$|E
2500|$|If a queen {{suddenly}} dies, {{the workers}} {{will attempt to}} create an [...] "emergency queen" [...] by selecting several brood cells where a larva has just emerged which are then flooded with royal jelly. The worker bees then build larger queen cells over the normal-sized worker cells which protrude vertically {{from the face of}} the <b>brood</b> <b>comb.</b> Emergency queens are usually smaller and less prolific than normal queens.|$|E
2500|$|Galleria mellonella (greater wax moths) do {{not attack}} the bees directly, but {{feed on the}} wax used by the bees to build their honeycomb. [...] Their full {{development}} to adults requires access to used <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> or brood cell cleanings—these contain protein essential for the larval development, {{in the form of}} brood cocoons. The destruction of the comb will spill or contaminate stored honey and may kill bee larvae.|$|E
5000|$|Workers Bees in many eusocial Stingless bees species, Paratrigona subnuda, have ovarian {{development}} and can lay trophic eggs within the <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> that are later eaten by the Queen Bee and her progeny, including workers and future queen larvae.|$|R
5000|$|Beekeepers use {{the ability}} of the bees to produce new queens to {{increase}} their colonies in a procedure called splitting a colony. To do this, they remove several <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> from a healthy hive, taking care to leave the old queen behind. These combs must contain eggs or larvae less than three days old and be covered by young nurse bees, which care for the brood and keep it warm. These <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> and attendant nurse bees are then placed into a small [...] "nucleus hive" [...] with other combs containing honey and pollen. As soon as the nurse bees find themselves in this new hive and realize they have no queen, they set about constructing emergency queen cells using the eggs or larvae they have in the combs with them.|$|R
50|$|Once a nest site is found, the {{existing}} cavity must be cleaned. After the pre-existing container {{is ready to}} be inhabited, the workers build several horizontal <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> {{in the center of the}} nest. This brood chamber is surrounded by layers of cerumen, called the involucrum, which helps maintain a constant climate in the brood chamber.|$|R
2500|$|Queen cells {{start out}} as queen cups. [...] Queen cups are larger than the cells of normal <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> and are {{oriented}} vertically instead of horizontally. Worker bees will only further build up the queen cup once the queen has laid an egg in a queen cup. [...] In general, the old queen starts laying eggs into queen cups when conditions are right for swarming or supersedure. [...] Swarm cells hang {{from the bottom of}} a frame while supersedure queens or emergency queens are generally raised in cells built out from the face of a frame.|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{a colony of}} bees does not swarm until they have completed all of their <b>brood</b> <b>combs,</b> i.e., filled all available space with eggs, larvae, and brood. Th{{is generally}} occurs in late spring {{at a time when}} the other areas of the hive are rapidly filling with honey stores. One key trigger of the swarming instinct is when the queen has no more room to lay eggs and the hive population is becoming very congested. Under these conditions, a prime swarm may issue with the queen, resulting in a halving of the population within the hive, leaving the old colony with a large number of hatching bees. The queen who leaves finds herself in a new hive with no eggs and no larvae but lots of energetic young bees who create a new set of <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> from scratch in a very short time.|$|R
50|$|In {{one study}} that {{examined}} 37 <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> from five colonies of P. remota, {{it was shown}} that 73.40% of the individuals were workers. Workers are produced throughout the entire year and perform many of the functions needed to grow and maintain the nest. Starting from {{a few days after}} their birth until their death, they continually support the hive, from building the nest at an early age, to foraging near the end of their lives.|$|R
40|$|Queen, {{male and}} worker {{production}} was studied during {{one year in}} three Plebeia remota colonies from Atlantic Rainforest in Cunha, Sao Paulo State, and two from a subtropical Araucaria forest in Prudentopolis, Parana State. All the colonies were kept in Sao Paulo city during our study. Plebeia remota has reproductive diapause during autumn and winter, which makes its biology of special interest. Brood production begins before spring, renewing the colony cycle. We sampled <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> monthly in these five colonies. The number of cells in each comb varied significantly with time of the year; the smallest <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> {{appear to be a}} consequence of reduced food availability. However, worker, queen and male frequencies did not differ significantly in time, and this presumably {{is due to the fact}} that they all are necessary for the growth, maintenance and reproduction of the colony. Although some molecular, morphological and behavioral differences have been detected in several studies comparing populations from Cunha and from Prudentopolis, we did not find significant differences between the colonies from these two localities in number of brood cells and worker, queen and male production.

50|$|The <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> {{is usually}} {{found in the}} lower part of the beehive, while the honey comb may {{surround}} the brood area and is found exclusively in the honey supers. When a queen does not have enough <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> to lay eggs, usually due to congestion from pollen or honey, the bee colony may be more prone to swarm.|$|E

50|$|All stingless bees of {{the tribe}} Meliponini build cells in a brood chamber within the nest; unlike bees of other tribes. They do not reuse these brood cells but {{constantly}} build new cells. The brood chamber is surrounded by the involucrum, which is a multilayered envelope. T. hockingsi constructs <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> during the Provisioning and Ovipositioning Process (POP). First, workers construct a new brood cell and provision the cell with liquid food. Next, the queen lays an egg in the provisioned cell {{on top of the}} food. Finally, the workers cap and seal the brood cell, and the POP is complete.|$|R
5000|$|Simply {{keep the}} brood nest open. In {{preparation}} for swarming, bees fill the brood nest with honey. The queen stops laying to be trim enough to fly, and her newly unemployed nurse bees go with her. The concept {{of this method}} is to open the brood nest to employ those nurse bees and get the queen laying again and redirect this sequence of events. This is done by any number of slight variations from empty frames in the brood nest, frames of bare foundation in the brood nest or drawn <b>combs</b> in the <b>brood</b> nest, or moving <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> to the box above to cause more expansion of the brood nest.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} stingless bee species, T. angustula workers {{take part in}} {{different}} activities based on their age. The average lifespan of the worker bees is around 21 days, but many live up to about 60 days. The first tasks that worker bees perform include courting the queen (surround her in the hive) and helping with oviposition (see section on nursing). Young bees (1 to about 15 days old) also assist with putting cerumen on <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> and cleaning the nest. Foraging behavior starts about 16 days after a worker emerges and will continue {{for the rest of}} its life. Grooming behavior and resin manipulation are most common in ‘older’ bees, about 20 to 55 days old.|$|R
50|$|Honeycomb and <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> {{have two}} sides. The vertex where three cells meet one {{one side is}} {{in the center of}} a cell on the other side.|$|E
50|$|When beekeepers {{extract the}} honey, they {{cut off the}} wax caps from each {{honeycomb}} cell with an uncapping knife or machine. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, {{and the type of}} flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the <b>brood</b> <b>comb.</b> Due to the impurities, the wax must be rendered before further use. The leftovers are called slumgum.|$|E
50|$|Freshly created beeswax comb {{may appear}} white at first. After the first {{generation}} of bees hatch from the <b>brood</b> <b>comb</b> it becomes yellow and darker in color (Comb that is exclusively used for honey comb appears lighter). <b>Brood</b> <b>comb</b> that is used for subsequent generations of bee brood becomes darker and darker until it almost appears black. The cocoon sticks to the hexagonal walls of the cell and is not removed. The change in broodcomb color is due to the cocoon that remains inside the cell and also small soil and pollen particles that are tracked in by the bees over time.|$|E
40|$|We {{undertook}} a field {{study to determine}} whether comb cell size affects the reproductive behavior of Varroa destructor under natural conditions. We examined the effect of brood cell width on the reproductive behavior of V. destructor in honey bee colonies, under natural conditions. Drone and worker <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> were sampled from 11 colonies of Apis mellifera. A Pearson correlation test and a Tukey test {{were used to determine}} whether mite reproduction rate varied with brood cell width. Generalized additive model analysis showed that infestation rate increased positively and linearly with the width of worker and drone cells. The reproduction rate for viable mother mites was 0. 96 viable female descendants per original invading female. No significant correlation was observed between brood cell width and number of offspring of V. destructor. Infertile mother mites were more frequent in narrower brood cells. ANPCyT[07...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{considerable}} economic loss to beekeepers worldwide {{and the possible}} public health implications related {{to the presence of}} antibiotics in honey, an American Foulbrood (AFB) monitoring/prevention program for Paenibacillus larvae is regarded as essential. This study investigates the occurrence and distribution of P. larvae genotypes in honey and <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> from Apulia (Italy). Genotyping of P. larvae isolates using ERIC-PCR generated a total of four different ERIC banding patterns (ERIC-A, ERIC-B, ERIC-C, ERIC-D), including fragments ranging from 200 to 3000 bp. Considering that the genotype has an influence on P. larvae infections and multi-genotype infections of colonies or apiaries may increase the complexity of P. larvae infections by influencing the type and speed of the development of clinical symptoms, the findings of the present study could be helpful for training veterinarians, bee inspector's extension staff, and beekeepers, thus improving the detection of AFB infections in the field...|$|R

The experiments were carried out between August 20 th 2011 and July 2012, in Berini locality, Timiș County (Romania), on 32 Apis meliffera honey bee colonies, divided into four experimental variants. Honey bee families were fed in order to supplement the honey food reserves with sugar syrup containing medicinal plants, or with APIMERA product. During the experimental period, there were being studied the number of <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> after hibernation, the quantity of broods at the beginning of spring, as well as the quantity of honey and pollen obtained by the studied bee colonies. The best results regarding the development of honey bee colonies in spring were obtained in honey bee colonies for which food reserves have been supplemented with honey combs, followed by the bee colonies fed with sugar syrup containing medicinal plants supplements. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of mixed {{honeybee}} colonies of Apis mellifera and Apis cerana on the intraspecific and interspecific recognition of female brood stages in the honeybees A. cerana and A. mellifera by transferring <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> between queenright colonies. In the intraspecific tests, significantly more larvae were removed in A. cerana than in A. mellifera, whilst significantly fewer eggs and pupae were removed in A. cerana than in A. mellifera. In the interspecific tests, A. cerana colonies removed significantly more larvae and pupae of A. mellifera than the same brood stages of A. cerana were removed by A. mellifera. We show there are highly significant differences in both intraspecific and interspecific brood recognition between A. cerana and A. mellifera and that brood recognition operates with decreasing intensity with increasing developmental age within species. This suggests that worker policing in egg removal is a {{first line of defense}} against heterospecific social parasites. ...|$|R
5000|$|The bees store pollen {{and honey}} in large, egg-shaped pots made of beeswax (typically) mixed with {{various types of}} plant resin; this {{combination}} is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "cerumen" [...] (which is, incidentally, the medical term for earwax). These pots are often arranged around a central set of horizontal <b>brood</b> <b>combs,</b> wherein the larvae are housed. When the young worker bees emerge from their cells, they tend to initially remain inside the hive, performing different jobs. As workers age, they become guards or foragers. Unlike the larvae of honey bees and many social wasps, meliponine larvae are not actively fed by adults (progressive provisioning). Pollen and nectar are placed in a cell, within which an egg is laid, and the cell is sealed until the adult bee emerges after pupation (mass provisioning). At any one time, hives can contain 300-80,000 workers, depending on species.|$|R

Low and high doses of powdered sugar (0. 3 and 0. 6 g per 151. 5 ± 1. 0 cells, respectively) caused significant egg removal of 62. 2 ± 5. 1 % and 86. 1 ± 5. 1 %, respectively, when compared to eggs that received no powdered sugar (t = 16. 91; df = 29; P = 0. 0001).

40|$|The Small Hive Beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, is an {{invasive}} pest {{of honey}} bee colonies that causes significant {{damage to the}} beekeeping sector.

After three years of observations of SHB in Calabria (2014 - 2016), we provide here some practical tips for improving control measures.

Prioritizating the inspection of pollen and honey <b>combs</b> rather than <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> is advised.

40|$|The {{transmission}} of honeybee pathogens by free-flying pests, such as small hive beetles (=SHB), would {{be independent of}} bees and beekeepers and thereby constitute a new challenge for pathogen control measures. Here we show that larval and adult SHB become contaminated with Paenibacillus larvae spores when exposed to honeybee <b>brood</b> <b>combs</b> with clinical American foulbrood (=AFB) symptoms in the laboratory. This contamination persists in pupae and newly emerged adults. After exposure to contaminated adult SHB, honeybee field colonies showed higher numbers of P. larvae spores in worker and honey samples after five weeks. Despite these results, the rather low number of P. larvae spores on adult SHB suggests that clinical AFB outbreaks are not likely. However, even small spore numbers can be sufficient to spread P. larvae. Therefore, our data clearly show that SHB are vectors of P. larvae. We suggest considering the role of SHB in AFB control in areas where both pests are established...|$|R
