25|$|Although {{covered in}} {{industry}} technical standards, {{there is still}} some disagreement on the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted current paths for fault current, potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment {{as close as possible to}} the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An alternative solution is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable terminated with XLR connectors.|$|E

2500|$|One of the torpedoes had hit Ozawa's flagship, the 31,000-ton {{aircraft}} carrier Taihō, the newest and {{largest in the}} Japanese fleet. The explosion jammed the enemy ship's forward aircraft elevator, and filled its pit with gasoline, water, and aviation fuel. However, no fire erupted, and the flight deck was unharmed.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to preliminarily {{identify}} the Granada Relocation Center (Amache) as {{a place that has}} traditional cultural significance and to evaluate the eligibility of Amache as a traditional cultural property for listing on the National Register of Historic Places using the guidelines developed in National Register Bulletin 38. This evaluation focuses on how the Amache site maintains the continuing Amache community identity through traditional cultural practices and beliefs that are rooted in the community???s history. The thesis also evaluates how the artifacts at Amache contribute to the site as a traditional cultural property, identifies and assesses the level of disturbances to the artifacts, and evaluates the effects of the disturbances on the site???s significance as a traditional cultural property. Methods: The thesis uses an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates history, anthropology, and archaeology to provide data needed to evaluate Amache???s National Register eligibility as a traditional cultural property. This interdisciplinary approach uses multiple lines of evidence, including archival research, participant observation, oral interviews, and archaeological surveys. Archival materials referenced included newspapers; pilgrimage, reunion, and internment-related documents; and previously conducted interviews. These are used to evaluate Amache???s traditional cultural significance and eligibility as a traditional cultural property. Participant observation included two pilgrimages to Amache that were used to understand the significance of the event and develop questions for the interviews. The oral interviews included Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei; some of the interviews consisted of multiple generations of a single family. One interview participant was the Buddhist reverend who conducted the pilgrimage ceremony in 2009. The interviews were used to provide data on the significance of the Amache site as a traditional cultural property. The archaeological surveys included a gridded ceramics survey and a problem-oriented artifact survey in the Amache historic main dump. The surveys identified site disturbances and assessed the level of disturbance occurring at the site. The survey was also a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> provide interview participants with the types and extent of artifacts present at the site so the participants could impart an understanding of the role in which artifacts play in the site as a traditional cultural property. Findings: The data demonstrate that Amache has traditional cultural significance to a living community and is eligible as a traditional cultural property for National Register inclusion. Furthermore, the artifacts located within the site contribute to the site???s significance as a traditional cultural property. Artifact disturbances have included cattle trampling, looting, and target practice, but these disturbances are currently minimal and have no effect on the integrity of the site as a traditional cultural property. Cattle are no longer allowed on the site, so that disturbance has been eliminated. Future archaeological work, development of the area, and presence of more non-community members at Amache may increase disturbance to the artifacts, particularly looting. One of the <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> potential disturbances is to educate the public about the effects of looting on the site and the Amache community. Conclusions: This body of work supports an argument for Amache as a traditional cultural property eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Based on the guidelines for evaluating and documenting traditional cultural properties, Amache appears to be eligible for NRHP inclusion as a traditional cultural property under Criterion A, for its association with events contributing to the broad pattern of history for the Amache community. Although the National Park Service is currently reviewing and revising the guidelines {{as a part of the}} Director???s Call to Action, no major changes are anticipated that would change this evaluation of Amache as a traditional cultural property. This preliminary evaluation can serve as a guide to identifying and evaluating other internment locales or other types of non-indigenous places in the United States as traditional cultural properties eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places...|$|R
