40|$|Much of the {{business}} transacted over the Internet today is in {{the business}}-to-business sphere. Outside of specialised niche areas like information technology and other information-based products, <b>business-to-consumers</b> commerce is relatively undeveloped. One principle that holds true in the marketspace is that before cybermarketers can effectively respond to consumer demand, they must understand consumer behaviour. Internet marketers should revisit traditional models of consumer behaviour, examine their underlying assumptions, and explore their validity in the new Internet context. A standard model of the consumer buying behaviour processes is applied to purchasing situations on the Internet, {{with a view to}} comparing traditional marketplace transactions with the emerging virtual marketspace. Understanding consumer behaviour in Internet purchasing remains the marketing management imperative. ...|$|R
40|$|Professor Jean Braucher greatly {{contributed to}} the {{exploration}} of consumer and contract law by questioning how the law operates {{in the real world}} and highlighting the importance of “law in action. ” In recognition of that contribution, this Article focuses on law in action with respect to consumers’ quest to obtain remedies regarding their <b>business-to-consumers</b> (“B 2 C”) contracts. Currently, consumers often have no practical recourse with respect to B 2 C purchase problems due to the complexity, cost, and inconvenience of the processes for obtaining remedies. Accordingly, stated legal rights become meaningless for individuals living in the real world. This Article, therefore, explores access to consumer remedies and proposes ideas for expanding that access through development of fair and efficient online dispute resolution (“ODR”) processes...|$|R

The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (<b>business-to-consumer)</b> market tanked, and we realized we could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when we realized we were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E

The system provides a highly powerful method for allowing users to filter out large set of information and the product places. The researchers from the same field are still working on how the recommender methodology is implemented in a particular domain. The software product engineering uses Feature Models (FMs) technology in a broad manner for helping and validating each product structure and it also provides support for the domain analysis. The creation of FM is tedious and very time-requiring technology. Now a day, it’s popular to buy a product online and online product shopping is a new trade in E-Commerce domain. The customers can choose their preferred products and buy many products online from the Online shopping website or portal.

40|$|In the {{new economy}} Small and Medium Enterprises face new {{challenges}} in their <b>Business-to-Consumers</b> transactions, {{such as the use}} of new Information and Communication Technologies. Electronic commerce may represent a competitive strategy to make enterprises of the agro-food sector more visible to consumers, if usability is adequately taken into account. The main barrier to the development of successful e-commerce business is represented by websites not meeting basic accessibility and usability features. To tackle this issue, heuristic evaluation and the gap analysis approach has been adopted. The parameters taken into account stemmed from World Wide Web Consortium recommendations. Website usability issues have been measured by a panel of consumers assessing a selected website each. Potential e-consumers simulated an online purchase, thereby allowing them to acquire insights on the importance and satisfaction on each of the usability issues taken into consideration. The success factors for ecommerce mainly involve efficiency of navigations (useful navigation tools or sequence of navigation), accuracy in content and supplied information. Consumers are more conduced to purchase by easy structure of websites than design and style. Additional information underlining the connection of producers to its territory enhances end-consumers’ feel in supply chain identification. The adoption of e-commerce, as innovative communication challenge, in rural development and in regional identity is a crucial issues of dynamic food chains. agro-food e-commerce, usability testing, gap analysis, customer satisfaction analysis, on line wine market., Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. Consumer {{trust is}} a core element for any {{e-commerce}} website. This study {{aimed to explore}} attributes of <b>business-to-consumers</b> (B 2 C) e-commerce websites that can communicate and engender trust from the users’ perspective using user-centred design. E-commerce websites {{are known to have}} features such as security certificates and encryption methods to ensure trust, but this requires technical knowhow to understand. The technologies used to develop websites have improved so far, but it has little effect on improving the trust of the users of e-commerce mostly in developing countries (Africa in particular). E-commerce users do not realise that these features have been put in place for the trustworthiness of the websites which contributes to their reluctance to conduct business transactions online, thus reducing their buying intentions. There is a need to design e-commerce websites to communicate/ convey trust from the users’ perspective. The study explored various sources of data to obtain insight and understanding of the research problem—user-centred design (UCD) group activity with users, interviews with developers, and secondary prior literature. Using UCD as the main methodology, an intensive UCD workshop activity with a group of eight e-commerce users was carried out. Furthermore, to obtain the view of experts (developers) on what is currently done to engender trust in B 2 C e-commerce websites, interviews with four respondents were also carried out. These interviews were intended to reduce any prejudice or bias and to obtain a clearer understanding of the phenomenon being studied. The findings from the study revealed six main attributes to engender trust, namely aesthetics design, security and information privacy, functionality design, trustworthiness based on content, development process, and vendor attributes. Proposed guidelines for each of the attributes were outlined. The findings from the users showed that those who were acquainted with the e-commerce technologies were those whose backgrounds are computer and technology related. Most users focused on aesthetics design, functionality, and security of their privacy and private details. Less emphasis was placed on the technology behind the e-commerce websites. Users use their aesthetic and cognitive value in their judgement for trust. The findings from the research were further validated using the Domestication of Technology Theory (DTT), which resulted {{in the development of a}} user-centred e-commerce trust model...|$|R
40|$|Online social {{shopping}} {{is a new}} business model emerging in E-Commerce world and becoming quite popular in recent years. Online social-shopping website is where people can recommend their favorite products for others to discover and purchase online. Online social shopping combines Business-to-Business, <b>Business-to-Consumers</b> and Consumers-to-Consumers services together and blends two powerful elements of real-world shopping otherwise lost for online consumers: word-of-mouth recommendations from trusted sources {{and the ability to}} browse products in the way that naturally leads to discovery. Attracted by the market perspective of online social shopping, many start-ups have entered in the market in recent years. In addition, some large Internet media companies have seen the potential in the market and tend to take a share of the market, such as Amazon’s aStore. The goal {{of this study is to}} analyze the business model of the case company and compare its business model with its selected main competitors’ (namely YELP, Kaboodle, and Zlio) in order to find out the success factors for an online social shopping company in the fiercer competition. The research framework is adapted from Osterwalder’s business model framework. Qualitative research methods, e. g. case study and interviews, are applied in this research. RunToShop Oy, the first Finnish social shopping company is the case company of this study. According to the business models analysis, YELP’s unique business model which emphasizes on providing localized reviews in USA has achieved great success in the USA market. Kaboodle’s business model which focuses on facilitating online shopping for consumers makes it very popular among young females so that it is acquired by Hearst as an online marketing channel in May 2008. Zlio’s business model which aims at building the largest sales forces in the world with high commissions rewards seems not to be accepted in the market. Its aggressive money making business model causes problems in trust from consumers and conflicts with its business partners. RunToShop’s business model would like to bring personality and trust which are missing in online shopping. At the beginning of the business development, the biggest challenge for RunToShop is how to attract more users in order to build up an active and loyal online community. Based on the lessons learnt from the selected International competitors, some managerial recommendations are made to RunToShop’s management team. It is important to propose a unique value proposition according to the actual needs of consumers. Startups should consider focusing on niche market in order to gain competitive advantages over International competitors. It is critical to focus on developing an active local community and encouraging the loyalty and trust. Maintaining good relationship with business partners is a key to success. The revenue model should be carefully designed to get as many revenue streams as possible in order to make good profits. Fast International expansion does not always guarantee success so it should be considered only after the business model is accepted in the local market...|$|R
