40|$|This paper evaluates bank exit {{regimes in}} {{selected}} financial centres using econometric methods. The {{focus is on}} bank exit regimes applicable to commercial banks in New York, London, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Tokyo in 1998 – 2002. Bank exit regimes are studied {{from the perspective of}} bank creditors and bank shareholders. In order to apply econometric methods, the exit regimes are indexed and then evaluated by comparing them with market indicators that reflect the interests of bank creditors and shareholders. These market indicators comprise <b>bank</b> <b>refinancing</b> costs and bank growth rates. In other words, two specific questions are addressed: (1) Do differences in bank exit regimes of significance to bank creditors explain differences in <b>bank</b> <b>refinancing</b> costs? (2) Do differences in bank exit regimes significant to bank shareholders explain differences in bank growth? The study shows that in those financial centres where the probability of bailout is higher, refinancing costs for banks are lower. evaluation, bank, regulation, supervision, reorganisation, liquidation...|$|E

As a consequence, the markup reflected in the spread between the central <b>bank</b> <b>refinancing</b> interest rate and the market interest rate is endogenously determined by the total demand and supply of liquidity-money.

40|$|The single {{currency}} {{was expected to}} make balance of payments irrelevant between the euro-area member states. This benign view has been challenged by recent developments, especially as imbalances between euro-area central banks have widened within the TARGET 2 settlement system. Current-account developments can be misleading as indicators of financial account developments in countries that receive significant official support. Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain experienced significant private-capital inflows from 2002 to 2007 - 09, followed by unambiguously massive outflows. We show that such reversals qualify as ‘sudden stops’. Euro-area sudden-stop episodes were clustered in three periods: the global financial crisis, a period following the agreement of the Greek programme and summer 2011. The timeline suggests contagion effects were present. We find evidence of substitution of the private capital flows with public components. In particular, weak banks in distressed countries took up a major share of the central <b>bank</b> <b>refinancing.</b> The steady divergence of intra Eurosystem net balances mirrors this. In the short term, TARGET 2 imbalances could be addressed by tightening collateral requirements for central bank liquidity.

40|$|Financial {{liberalization}} {{was carried}} out during a period when the nonfinancial corporate sector was in financial distress due to reduced profitability. The consequent emergence of substantial nonperforming loans in the banking sector, especially among smaller banks, created fierce competition for financial rates. Instead of forcing insolvent borrowers into bankruptcy, <b>banks</b> <b>refinanced</b> nonperforming loans {{as a way to}} prolong their own survival, and real credit in the private sector increased dramatically. An analysis of firm-level data reveals that nonfinancial corporations were subject to both an earnings shock and an interest rate shock.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the transmission of}} central bank liquidity to bank deposit and loan spreads of European firms over the January 2006 to June 2010 period. When the European Central Bank (ECB) allocated liquidity to banks in a competitive tender {{at the beginning of}} the crisis, higher “aggregate ” central bank liquidity (i. e. the total liquidity in the banking system that is held at the ECB) reduces bank deposit rates of low risk banks but has no effect on deposit rates of high risk banks or on corporate loan spreads of high or low risk banks. After the ECB started to fully allot all liquidity requested by <b>banks</b> via its <b>refinancing</b> operations on October 8, 2008, an increase in liquidity decreases deposit rates of both high and low risk banks. While loan spreads of low risk banks decrease, those of high risk banks remain unchanged also under full allotment of liquidity. We find that borrowers of high risk <b>banks</b> <b>refinance</b> term loans drawing down loan commitments. They have lower payouts, lower capital expenditures and lower asset growth compared with borrowers of low risk banks.

From 2010 onwards, however, governments, but also banks and non-financial companies in several euro-area countries have had difficulty getting access to non-resident financing.

40|$|The Bank of England, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) {{have responded}} to the crisis with {{exceptional}} initiatives resulting in a major increase in their balance sheets. After the ECB’s end- 2011 launch of three-year <b>bank</b> <b>refinancing</b> (LTRO), there has been speculation that all three have de facto embarked on ‘quantitative easing’. However, major differences remain: the Bank of England and Fed have mostly relied on large-scale purchases of government bonds, while the ECB has relied on lending to financial institutions with repurchase agreements of collateral (repos). The LTRO has successfully mitigated funding needs and reduced interbank stress, and has {{had a significant impact on}} sovereign bond yields in southern euro-area countries, and increased southern banks’ government debt holdings, while northern banks have reduced sovereign exposure. The LTRO has had only weak effects on funding for households and non-financial corporations; credit dynamics remain weak particularly in the southern euro area.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{creating}} a new concept of the financial mechanism, it is important, in our opinion, to construct a mechanism for depreciation of fixed assets of enterprises, adequate to the goals of the national economy modernization. It seems appropriate to establish a depreciation model which will allow the state to conduct depreciation policy differentiated by branches of the national economy and on specific territories. In addition, depreciation deductibles must be real, that means, they should be accumulated on the accounts and not just be tax exemptions. There are expressions of the Russian economists, {{that it is possible to}} ensure the realization of revenues depreciation on special accounts under threat of possible penalties. The solution of this problem, it seems, can be achieved through mandatory enrollment of depreciation amounts into the escrow bank accounts without withdrawing the funds before the expiration of the depreciation period of fixed assets of the owners. The yield on bank deposits in the Russian market, as a rule, does not exceed the Central <b>Bank</b> <b>refinancing</b> rate. Keeping money in the long term on such conditions is not economically feasible - a negative return on these investments is guaranteed, but if the federal government has helped to ensure a nominal rate of return of deposits to 10 % (in a given period of time) at the expense of its resources, then our proposal could have lost the character of economic voluntarism. If all accrued depreciation (2 348 641 million rubles) will be placed on deposit accounts and the credit system of the Russian Federation will provide holders an annual yield of 10 % (at the rate of inflation 8. 8 %), the annual subsidy amount will be 28 183. 7 million rubles. In this case, the credit system receives a resource for the issuance of long-term loans.

40|$|Major {{competitors}} {{of commercial}} <b>banks</b> frequently <b>refinance</b> consumer loans before maturity. They may do so either {{to maintain an}} ongoing credit relationship with a customer or to alleviate payment problems for customers experiencing credit difficulties. From a legal standpoint, creditors who engage in refinancings often are subject to laws regulating calculations of interest rebates on prepaid obligations. In addition, occasionally, as in Maine, refinanced balances nay be subject to different finance rate ceilings, etc., depending {{on the length of}} time unpaid balances are left outstanding. However, practically nothing is known {{about the extent to which}} commercial banks engage in consumer loan refinancings and whether, in fact, they need be much concerned about such laws. Little is known, also, about the types of loans banks are most likely to refinance and of their motives for doing so (to maintain bank-customer relationships or to reduce customer payment difficulties). This paper analyzes data on over 30, 000 consumer loans made from 1965 - 71 in five regions of the country by banks that participated in a Federal Reserve survey of bank consumer lending practices. By analyzing the frequency with which consumer loans were paid off by refinancing and the reasons for the refinancing it provides several useful insights into bank behavior. In particular, this analysis suggests that <b>banks</b> <b>refinance</b> only a small and declining portion of their total consumer loans. They do not appear to use refinancings as a way to maintain ongoing customer relation ships; however, they refinance loans more frequently to allow customers to make new expenditures than to meet payment problems. Nonetheless, refinancings to meet payment difficulties rose consistently during the 1969 - 70 recession. Data computed in this study suggests that riskier types of loans were not more likely to be refinanced than better quality types of loans however, individual bad loans were more likely to be refinanced than individual good loans. Finally, over time, possibly because of the growth of revolving credit, loans were les-s likely to be <b>refinanced</b> to allow <b>bank</b> customers to make new expenditures. I...|$|R
40|$|The authors look at {{strategies}} {{for dealing with}} banking crises in 12 transition economies [...] five from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) : Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, and Poland; the three Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; and four countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) : Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Ukraine. Three types of strategies were used {{to deal with the}} crises. The CEE countries generally pursued extensive restructuring and recapitalizing of banks; most CIS countries pursued large-scale liquidation; and the Baltic states generally pursued a combination of liquidation and restructuring. The strategy pursued reflected macroeconomic conditions and the level of development in a country's banking sector. There were more new banks in the former Soviet Union (FSU-the CIS and Baltic states), but they tended to be small, undercapitalized, and not deeply engaged in financial intermediation. The CEE countries generally incurred higher fiscal costs than the FSU countries but ended up with sounder, more efficient banking systems, with many of the recapitalized banks being privatized to strategic foreign investors. The CIS countries pursued a less fiscally costly approach but have been left with weak banking systems and low levels of intermediation. The Baltic states appear to have struck a good balance, incurring modest fiscal costs while making their systems sounder and more efficient. The findings suggest the following: a) Operational, financial, and institutional restructuring should be undertaken in parallel. b) Financial restructuring should involve adequate recapitalization to deter moral hazard and repeated recapitalization. c) Operational restructuring should entail privatization to core investors (particularly to reputable foreign banks). d) The enterprise problems underlying banking problems must also be addressed. e) Fiscal costs were reduced when governments dealt only with bad debt inherited from the socialist period; when small banks that held few deposits were allowed to fail, where the social costs of such failure were low; and when only banks that got into trouble because of external shocks were rescued while those suffering from poor management were liquidated. f) The government, not the central bank, should undertake bank restructuring.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the current crisis a {{vigorous}} debate is taking place with regard to its’ cause. A debate which has important policy implications {{in the sense that it}} justifies or condemns the main reaction policy to the evolution of the crisis i. e. the persistent securitization of financial capital on a global scale through trillions of government and central bank money resting in private bank vaults until proven insufficient, triggering a new round of <b>bank</b> <b>refinance</b> and / or recapitalization. The main question to be answered, in order to understand the present crisis, is whether the explosion of interest rates and the lack of credit is the cause or the trigger of a depression and why. If financial turmoil is the cause of depressions then each crisis is unique, the result of a «black swan» game and securitization will prove efficient since no risk arises from capitalist production and the reproduction of capital. Of course, history has taught us that capitalist economies experience periods of prosperity followed by depressions with almost periodical recurrence. However, the present crisis poses additional questions for Marxist and heterodox economics, since it prevailed following a period of stable (not declining) profit rates associated with weak corporate growth side by side with an explosion of financial sector growth a phenomenon referred to as financialization of capital.
