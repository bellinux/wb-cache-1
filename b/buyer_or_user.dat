It is often completed as a record of formal protocol conformance test results, and some automated testing systems machine-author a PICS as output. A potential <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> <b>user</b> of the implementation can consult the PICS to determine if it meets his or her requirements.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "software evangelist" [...] {{was coined}} by Mike Murray of Apple Computer's Macintosh {{computer}} division. The first so-identified technology evangelist was Mike Boich — who promoted the Macintosh computer. The job is often {{closely related to}} both sales and training, but requires specific technology marketing skills. For example, convincing a potential <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> <b>user</b> to change from older methods to new ones. Technology evangelism is sometimes associated with an internal employee assigned to encourage new practices within an organization. The marketing aspect of the role was strongly influenced by Geoffrey Moore and his books concerning the technology adoption lifecycle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - Due to {{the rapid}} growth of Internet users in the last decades and illegal use of {{software}} from piracies without granting authorities from legal vendors, besides expensive of software products and draw backs in distribution, this paper offers a suitable technique to protect software from piracy. It relies on elliptic curve cryptography technique achieved via processor ID of the <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> <b>user.</b> The bought software after downloading will be protected from illegal distribution through mechanism of elliptic curve with ElGamal cryptographic technique. In order to protect server from piracies and latencies causes from network communication, this paper offers software downloading during virtual computer or VMware. Time consuming for encryption and decryption will be shown. This paper concludes that using Elliptic curve offers equal security for small bit size, thereby reducing processing overhead.

40|$|Licensing {{agreement}} {{is one of}} the mechanisms to secure the interest of database producers. A breach of any contractual term in the agreement will entitle a database producer to a contractual remedy. As regards to contractual protection, there are two important issues to be addressed. First, the clauses in the licensing agreement, and secondly, the issue of enforceability of certain database agreement, such as shrink wrap or click wrap license. The second issue must be resolved before a database producer is able to implement the terms and conditions provided in the database licensing agreement. This is because it determines the validity of the contract. With a valid contract, the contractual terms may be used to protect the interest of the database producers. The unconscionability of the terms in the database licensing seems to be a major issue. This issue arises {{due to the fact that}} the contractual terms are not read by licensee upon the conclusion of agreement and the inequality of bargaining power exists. Asymmetrical or unfair terms will cause unfairness to database users who will be prevented through the principle of undue influence or the common law doctrine of unconscionability. Although no clear statutory provision has provided a solution to the problem, there are two ways of dealing with it. First, the database producer must ensure that he does not use his dominant position to exercise unconscionable dealings. Secondly, it is advisable to incorporate a term providing that the <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> <b>user</b> has the opportunity to reject the contract if he disagrees with the terms. To ensure the interest of the database producers the agreement should provide notice as to the database’s terms of usage. This may form the basis of a breach of contract in the event that the stipulated terms are violated. A good contractual {{agreement is}} an agreement which protects the interest of both parties; i. e., the database producers and the users. To achieve that, both parties should come to a mutual agreement on the terms in the contract. The license should incorporate necessary provisions such as restrictions on use to protect the legitimate interest of the database producer. However licensees should also be given sufficient freedom to use the database content to meet their legitimate needs and should be prohibited from using the information in ways that would diminish the value of the database producer’s investment in the database. </p...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} {{explosion in the}} quantity of information produced, {{which in turn has}} created vast opportunities for information-based businesses. Thus, advertisers of information products (IPs) often use daily issues of newspapers to create public awareness on the nature, availability and the prices of their products. The types of advertising strategies adopted by the advertisers of the IPs vary and greatly determine the level of patronage of the products. It is against this background that this study empirically examined the trends in advertisement of IPs in the Nigerian Guardian Newspaper from 2008 to 2012. A research design, based on a content analysis of the Guardian Newspaper was used in the study. Descriptive statistical analysis using frequency tables and cross tabulations were employed to analyse the various trends. The study found that, during the period, advertisements of conduit IPs were more than content IPs, majority of advertised IPs had combination of information and image, and majority of the advertisers adopted humorous techniques. This study would be valuable to policy and decision makers as it can help develop appropriate frameworks or policies to promote the development of content IPs in addition to the thriving conduit IPs. In addition, the outcome of this study can also help advertisers of IPs devise new strategies in advertising their products in the modern competitive environment so that <b>buyers</b> <b>or</b> <b>users</b> of the products can make good decisions on the choice of products to buy or use...|$|R

The application is developed to cater needs of a potential car <b>buyer.</b> The <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> the <b>user</b> of this application is able to get useful information regarding the car they intend to buy. The users of this application can gather valuable information based on the analysis of the cars and the manufacturers, and the car sales over the years to make an inference and thereby able to make the right decision while buying a car. It also focuses on the predictive analysis of the car sales with respect to the analysis of the sales over the past years in Ireland. This aspect will cater the needs of a businessman who intends to become a car dealer in making the right choice with the respect to the area and the make of cars that he intends to take the dealership...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss {{analytically}} the use of informational communication technologies (ICT) in education so that education system could have greater benefits from its carefully planned use. In this paper we tried to show the specificity of the relations between education and ICT. Many things in that relation are accepted for granted, often without much analyzing. We selected some of typical misconceptions which contribute to erroneous ideas about education and ICT relation resulting in limited opportunities for using up new technologies in education. When analyzing ICT in education there is no room for the question whether to use new technologies in the teaching/ learning process or not, but when, why and how to use them. In order to bring these decisions and use ICT potentials for educational purposes, thorough understanding of the nature of teaching and learning is necessary. Education should not be just a <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> a prudent <b>user</b> of numerous ICT possibilities but it should carefully and thoughtfully transform the teaching/learning process in order equip future and nowadays citizens with skills necessary for living and working in the environment with significantly changed technology. Much more researching and theoretical work is needed in order to fully understand how ICT really influences the learning process and how to use that influence in order to enhance the quality of education...|$|R

40|$|Digital watermarks have {{recently}} been proposed {{for the purpose of}} copy deterrence of multimedia content. Copy deterrence using digital watermarks is achieved by inserting a unique watermark into each copy of the image sold which could be used to trace unauthorized copies to the erring buyer. However, all the schemes proposed in the literature suffer from the following major limitation which is generally glossed over. The owner of the image reveals the embedded watermark to the <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> to a "trusted" third party in the process of proving that a pirated copy originated from a specific buyer. Needless to say that the watermark could subsequently be removed from the watermarked image by the <b>buyer</b> <b>or</b> the "trusted" third party.
