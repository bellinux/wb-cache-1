Just two months later, her son George and daughter-in-law Mary left on an {{extensive}} tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on their grandchildren. On George's return, preparations for Edward and Alexandra's coronation in Westminster Abbey were well in hand <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few days before the scheduled coronation in June 1902 the king became seriously ill with appendicitis. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended the Royal Ascot races without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm. Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation performed by Frederick Treves of the London Hospital to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: he by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, and she by the Archbishop of York, William Dalrymple Maclagan.|$|E

And so the British War Cabinet and the War Office agreed to Murray's proposal to attack Gaza but without replacing the departed infantry division or offering any other reinforcements and the attack could not take place until 26 March.|$|E

There, a small, ply skinned fin carried a largely fabric covered, rounded, wide chord, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The straight tapered tailplane, also largely fabric covered, was set forward of the fin {{and at the top}} of the fuselage, so the elevators required only a small cut-out for the rudder to move in. The pilot sat upright just ahead of the wing leading edge under a multi-piece canopy which merged into the aft fuselage. The 703 had no landing wheel <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> sprung skid from the nose to behind the cockpit, on the deepest part of the fuselage. It was assisted by a tail bumper.|$|E
25|$|By November 2008, {{however, the}} {{published}} {{cost of the}} memorial had risen sharply to $86 million. (The $86 million figure included the maintenance trust fund donation.) The DVLMF accepted another $200,000 combined donation that month from the DAV, which reported that it had contributed less than $2 million of its $3 million matching-fund commitment. The DAV's donation pushed the total funds raised for the memorial past the $70 million mark. On December 1, Lois Pope made good on her matching-grant pledge and presented the DVLMF with a check for $5 million. By this time, Pope's total contributions to the memorial foundation totaled $8.6 million. Fundraising continued in fits and starts. By April 2009, the DVLMF still had only about $70 million on hand. <b>But</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> month later, donations reached $80.1 million.|$|E

He shared a cell with his colleague, N. T. Orăşanu, a noted adversary of Carol's rule. He was also an associate of the writer Alexandru Odobescu, and, after 1861, collaborated on his monthly literary magazine Revista Română. It was here that he published a critical review of Ciocoii vechi şi noi, a novel by his friend Nicolae Filimon, which upset the latter (as a consequence, relations between the two soured). For a while during those years, Ghica edited two satirical magazine, Păcală (named in honor of the eponymous folk hero) and Scrânciobul.|$|E

In the 1927 cricket season, Hill played three further matches for Somerset and in the second of these, against Derbyshire at Taunton he finally made an impression as a bowler, taking four wickets for 98 runs in Derbyshire's first innings. He then improved on this in 1928, his best season, by taking five Worcestershire wickets for 36 in the match at Stourbridge, the best return of his career. In his next Somerset match, against Surrey at Taunton, Hill took five for 85 in Surrey's first innings. <b>But</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> week later he broke down in the match against Sussex at Hove. He returned for one final first-class match in 1929 but was not successful.|$|E
25|$|The River Loddon rises at West Ham Farm in Basingstoke, and in {{its first}} mile flows under the Festival Place {{shopping}} centre that forms {{the main part of}} the central area of that town; the adjacent bus station sits on the site of the wharf at the start of the Basingstoke Canal. The river emerges again in Eastrop Park, where it now runs alongside and just below Eastrop Way which follows the course of the disused canal. Eastrop Park was the site of Basingstoke Corn Mill in 1873, but by 1932 it was called Vince's Farm, although the buildings still spanned the river. The river then passes through some water meadows where it is joined by small streams from springs and ponds at Black Dam. The flow from these previously had to pass under a wide bend of an embankment which held the Basingstoke Canal. Basingstoke Upper Mill was to the south of the embankment. Again it was a corn mill in 1873, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> farm in 1932. The area near where the streams meet was a peat moor, and parts of it were used for growing watercress. The Basingstoke Union Workhouse was on the north bank. It later became a hospital and is now the site of a private hospital. The river then flows close by the village of Old Basing and the ruins of Basing House. It is crossed by a brick-built railway viaduct, with four arches, which carries the Southern Railway line to Basingstoke railway station. Just beyond it was Old Basing Mill, still marked as a corn mill in 1932 but now called Barton's Mill. There were more watercress beds to the north of the mill. Pyotts Hill and The Street meet at a narrow bridge over the river, which is built of brick and has three arches. Funding to construct it was obtained by public subscription, and it was opened in 1826.|$|E
