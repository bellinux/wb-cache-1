5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and <b>Bush</b> <b>himself</b> did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Bush {{becomes a}} born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his {{relationship}} with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although <b>Bush</b> <b>himself</b> suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential {{to make a name for}} himself. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not to invade Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein. After his father loses the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton, Bush blames the loss on his decision not to depose Saddam.|$|E
2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} never officially {{commented on}} the film. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who is portrayed in the film, called the sibling rivalry portrayed in the film [...] "high-grade, unadulterated hooey" [...] and said that Stone's exploration of the family dynamic could have benefited from actual conversations with the Bush family. Slate magazine's Timothy Noah, however, noted that [...] "most [...] the film's more ludicrous details" [...] are actually directly taken from non-fiction sources, and argued that the film was too kind to Bush in omitting certain historically recorded dramatic events, most notably Bush's alleged mocking of murderer Karla Faye Tucker, a woman put to death during his tenure of the Texan governorship. However, the incident is disputed by <b>Bush</b> <b>himself,</b> and as such is also unconfirmed. In a March 2010 [...] "Screen Test" [...] interview with The New York Times Lynne Hirschberg, Josh Brolin claims Bush did in fact watch the film. [...] Brolin said Oliver Stone met with Bill Clinton in China and Clinton told Stone he'd lent his copy of W. to Bush. [...] Reportedly, <b>Bush</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "liked it very much" [...] and [...] "thought there were sad moments." ...|$|E
25|$|Busher did {{not play}} any cricket in 1909, but August of the {{following}} year he appeared twice more for Worcestershire, against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham and against Somerset at Taunton. Worcestershire lost the former match by an innings but won the latter by 295 runs. <b>Busher</b> <b>himself</b> also experienced mixed fortunes in these games: against Gloucestershire he could manage only one wicket, but after a wicketless first innings against Somerset he recorded 5-13 in the second; his last first-class wicket was that of wicket-keeper Arthur Newton.|$|R

This fails to stop the Road Runner, who mows down the Coyote and leaves him spread-eagled on the track to be flattened again by a train which appears on the track.

2500|$|The {{correspondence}} between Muench and Pius XII focused {{almost exclusively on}} the various opinions shared by the two men, often with great levity, but rarely touched {{on the issues of}} anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, the wartime relationship between the church and Nazi Germany, and the situation of the postwar Jewry. According to Brown-Fleming, in one private audience between the two in May 1957 Pius XII told Muench a joke about Hitler dying, going to Heaven, and meeting the Old Testament Prophet Moses, who forgives Hitler; Hitler then asks Moses if he set fire to the burning <b>bush</b> <b>himself,</b> a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Reichstag fire, which apparently elicited a [...] "big laugh" [...] from Pius XII.|$|E
60|$|As for the {{railroad}} man--quite so, the reader knows {{it as well}} as I do--you can tell him because he carries a pole that he cut in the <b>bush</b> <b>himself,</b> with a ten-cent line wrapped round the end of it. Jones says he can catch as many fish with this kind of line as Kernin can with his patent rod and wheel. So he can too. Just the same number.|$|E
60|$|But the queerness of {{the place}} it's more {{difficult}} to tell of, unless to {{one who has been}} alone in the high <b>bush</b> <b>himself.</b> The brightest kind of a day it is always dim down there. A man can see to the end of nothing; whichever way he looks the wood shuts up, one bough folding with another like the fingers of your hand; and whenever he listens he hears always something new--men talking, children laughing, the strokes of an axe a far way ahead of him, and sometimes a sort of a quick, stealthy scurry near at hand that makes him jump and look to his weapons. It's all very well for him to tell himself that he's alone, bar trees and birds; he can't make out to believe it; whichever way he turns the whole place seems to be alive and looking on. Don't think it was Uma's yarns that put me out; I don't value native talk a fourpenny-piece; it's a thing that's natural in the bush, and that's the end of it.|$|E

By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|R
