5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the <b>bending</b> <b>force</b> caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{forces are}} {{involved}} in the process of slab rollback. Two forces acting against each other at the interface of the two subducting plates exert forces against one another. The subducting plate exerts a <b>bending</b> <b>force</b> (FPB) that supplies pressure during subduction, while the overriding plate exerts a force against the subducting plate (FTS). The slab pull force (FSP) is caused by the negative buoyancy of the plate driving the plate to greater depths. The resisisting force from the surrounding mantle opposes the slab pull forces. Interactions with the 660-km discontinuity cause a deflection due to the buoyancy at the phase transition (F660). [...] The unique interplay of these forces is what generates slab rollback. When the deep slab section obstructs the down-going motion of the shallow slab section, slab rollback occurs. The subducting slab undergoes backward sinking due to the negative buoyancy forces causing a retrogradation of the trench hinge along the surface. Upwelling of the mantle around the slab can create favorable conditions for the formation of a back-arc basin.|$|E
40|$|Sheet metal bending {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely applied sheet metal {{operations}}. The bending operations present several technical problems in production, such as prediction of spring-back and the punch load. In this paper, the value of the spring-back and <b>bending</b> <b>forces</b> are investigated for a low carbon steel material. Two thicknesses of material (0. 95 and 0. 75 mm) are applied. Sheet metal components, which are used in the experiments, have oblong holes on their bending surfaces. The influence of the area of the holes, die angles, die widths and punch radius on the value of the spring-back and the <b>bending</b> <b>forces</b> in V-die <b>bending</b> is studied. It is found that all these parameters affect the spring-back and the <b>bending</b> <b>forces,</b> but not in the same way.

2500|$|Pendulums {{in clocks}} (see example at right) are usually {{made of a}} weight or bob (b) [...] {{suspended}} by a rod of wood or metal (a). [...] To reduce air resistance (which accounts {{for most of the}} energy loss in precision clocks) [...] the bob is traditionally a smooth disk with a lens-shaped cross section, although in antique clocks it often had carvings or decorations specific to the type of clock.

A common weight for seconds pendulum bobs is [...] [...] Instead of hanging from a , clock pendulums are usually supported by a short straight spring (d) of flexible metal ribbon. This avoids the friction and 'play' caused by a pivot, and the slight <b>bending</b> <b>force</b> of the spring merely adds to the pendulum's restoring force. A few precision clocks have pivots of 'knife' blades resting on agate plates. The impulses to keep the pendulum swinging are provided by an arm hanging behind the pendulum called the crutch, (e), which ends in a fork, (f) whose prongs embrace the pendulum rod. The crutch is pushed back and forth by the clock's escapement, (g,h).|$|E
50|$|Quarter buckle - This {{is a rare}} defect {{where the}} fibers are {{elongated}} in the quarter regions (the portion of the strip between {{the center and the}} edge).

50|$|However, {{for high}} overtones with short {{wavelengths}} that approach {{the diameter of}} the string, the string behaves more like a thick metal bar: its mechanical resistance to bending becomes an additional force to the tension, which 'raises the pitch' of the overtones. Only when the <b>bending</b> <b>force</b> is much smaller than the tension of the string, are its wave-speed (and the overtones pitched as harmonics) unchanged. The frequency-raised overtones (above the harmonics), called 'partials' can produce an unpleasant effect called inharmonicity. Basic strategies to reduce inharmonicity include decreasing the thickness of the string or increasing its length, choosing a flexible material with a low <b>bending</b> <b>force,</b> and increasing the tension force so that it stays much bigger than the <b>bending</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

If a shear stress [...] is exerted on the slip plane then a force , where b is the Burgers vector of the dislocation and x is {{the distance between}} the pinning sites A and B, is exerted on the dislocation line {{as a result of the}} shear stress. This force acts perpendicularly to the line, inducing the dislocation to lengthen and curve into an arc. The <b>bending</b> <b>force</b> caused by the shear stress is opposed by the line tension of the dislocation, which acts on each end of the dislocation along the direction of the dislocation line away from A and B with a magnitude of , where G is the shear modulus. If the dislocation bends, the ends of the dislocation make an angle with the horizontal between A and B, which gives the line tensions acting along the ends a vertical component acting directly against the force induced by the shear stress. If sufficient shear stress is applied and the dislocation bends, the vertical component from the line tensions, which acts directly against the force caused by the shear stress, grows as the dislocation approaches a semicircular shape.
