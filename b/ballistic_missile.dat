5|$|The Commission to Assess the <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> Threat to the United States, {{also called}} the Rumsfeld Commission, was an {{independent}} commission formed by the US Congress to evaluate the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> threat posed to the United States.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012 the Green Pine radar has {{a proven}} track record {{demonstrated}} in over 20 successful <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> intercepts.|$|E
5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile,</b> {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM. Funding was not allocated for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967.|$|E
50|$|ICBMs are {{differentiated}} {{by having}} greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles: intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (IRBMs), medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (MRBMs), short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SRBMs) and tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (TBMs). Short and medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are known collectively as theatre <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} missile {{forces have}} in their inventory 20 or more intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs), between 130 and 150 intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> one Xia class submarine carrying 12 submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> and about 335 or more short-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of a joint <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This resulted in an agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British Medium Range <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> (MRBM) development project codenamed Blue Streak. The United States pursued Intermediate Range <b>Ballistic</b> <b>Missile</b> (IRBM) development in parallel. Indeed, it had two IRBM projects: the US Army's Jupiter and the USAF's Thor. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the United States in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|Having {{brought in}} the project on time and on budget, Shea {{established}} a reputation in the aerospace community. In 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with Space Technology Laboratories, a division of TRW Inc., where he continued to work on <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{tasked with}} {{investigating}} {{the disappearance of}} British and Soviet <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarines and the subsequent offer to sell a submarine tracking system. Bond works alongside Major Anya Amasova of the KGB. The pair track the plans across Egypt and identify {{the person responsible for}} the thefts as shipping tycoon, scientist and anarchist Karl Stromberg.|$|E
50|$|<b>Missiles</b> using a <b>ballistic</b> {{trajectory}} usually {{deliver a}} warhead over the horizon, at distances {{of thousands of}} kilometers, {{as in the case}} of intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs) and submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SLBMs). Most <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> exit the Earth's atmosphere and re-enter it in their sub-orbital spaceflight.|$|R
5000|$|An {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) is a surface-to-air missile {{designed}} to counter <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (see <b>missile</b> defense). <b>Ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> {{are used to}} deliver nuclear, chemical, biological or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. The term [...] "anti-ballistic missile" [...] is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat, however {{it is commonly used}} for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs).|$|R
50|$|Finland {{does not}} have attack helicopters, submarines, {{long-range}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (Finland has however updated its M270 MLRSs capable to shoot ATACMS tactical <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles).</b> Legislation forbids nuclear weapons entirely.|$|R
5|$|The High Virgo, {{also known}} as Weapons System 199C (WS-199C), was a {{prototype}} air-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ALBM) jointly developed by Lockheed and the Convair division of General Dynamics during the late 1950s. The missile proved moderately successful and aided {{in the development of}} the later GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. It was also used in early tests of anti-satellite weapons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile.</b> They were seen {{as an attempt to}} display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two Polaris nuclear <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.|$|E
50|$|Modern submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> {{are closely}} related to {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (range of over 5500 km), and in many cases SLBMs and ICBMs may be part of the same family of weapons.|$|R
50|$|The superpowers {{developed}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> {{to enable}} them to use nuclear weaponry across great distances. As rocket science developed, the range of missiles increased and intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBM) were created, which could strike virtually any target on Earth in a timeframe measured in minutes rather than hours or days. In order to cover large distances <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are usually launched into sub-orbital spaceflight.|$|R
50|$|Fear {{spread through}} the United States that the Soviet Union would invade and spread communism, so Eisenhower wanted to not only create a {{surveillance}} satellite to detect any threats but <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> that would protect the United States. In strategic terms, it was Eisenhower who devised the American basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of B-52 bombers, land-based intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs), and Polaris submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SLBMs).|$|R
5|$|The Bold Orion missile was {{developed}} {{as part of}} Weapons System 199, initiated by the United States Air Force (USAF) {{in response to the}} U.S. Navy's Polaris program, with funding authorised by the United States Congress in 1957. The purpose of WS-199 was the development of technology that would be used in new strategic weapons for the USAF's Strategic Air Command, not to deliver operational weapons; a primary emphasis was on proving the feasibility of an air-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bold Orion missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 199B (WS-199B), was a {{prototype}} air-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ALBM) developed by Martin Aircraft during the 1950s. Developed in both one- and two-stage designs, the missile was moderately successful in testing, and helped {{pave the way for}} development of the GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. In addition, the Bold Orion was used in early anti-satellite weapons testing, performing the first interception of a satellite by a missile.|$|E
5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The course {{taken by}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> has two {{significant}} desirable properties. First, <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> that fly above the atmosphere {{have a much}} longer range than would be possible for cruise missiles of the same size. Powered rocket flight through thousands of kilometers of air would require vastly greater amounts of fuel, making the launch vehicles larger and easier to detect and intercept. Powered missiles that can cover similar ranges, such as cruise missiles, do not use rocket motors {{for the majority of}} their flight, but instead use more economical jet engines. However, cruise missiles have not made <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> obsolete, due to the second major advantage: <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> can travel extremely quickly along their flight path. An ICBM can strike a target within a 10,000 km range in about 30 to 35 minutes. With terminal speeds of over 5,000 m/s, <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are much harder to intercept than cruise missiles, due to the much shorter time available. Therefore, <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> {{are some of the most}} feared weapons available, despite the fact that cruise missiles are cheaper, more mobile, and more versatile.|$|R
50|$|Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms (SALT I) 1972: The Soviet Union and the United States {{agreed to}} a freeze {{in the number of}} {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs) and submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SLBMs) that they would deploy.|$|R
50|$|Since then, North Korea has {{continued}} development tests of various missiles, such as intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBM) designed {{for nuclear weapons}} delivery and submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SLBM), while concentrating on miniaturization, weight-reduction and diversification of nuclear weapons.|$|R
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{designed}} in the 1960s by the US Army to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the Soviet Union's intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ICBM) fleet during the Cold War. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and {{was supposed to be}} replaced by a more appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter defense system known as Sentinel.|$|E
5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> would need three hours of preparation time.|$|R
50|$|The HCOC is {{the result}} of {{international}} efforts to regulate access to <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> which can potentially deliver weapons of mass destruction. The HCOC is the only multilateral code in the area of disarmament which has been adopted over the last years. It is the only normative instrument to verify the spread of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles.</b> The HCOC does not ban <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles,</b> but it does call for restraint in their production, testing, and export.|$|R
25|$|The {{maximum range}} of fire against <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> is 20km, and the maximum target speed is 1200 m / s. Its {{capacity}} of protecting against <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> are comparable {{with that of}} the Patriot PAC-2. However, the height is less.|$|R
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-142 (142; NATO {{reporting}} name: Bear F/J) is a maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft {{derived from}} the Tu-95 turboprop strategic bomber. A specialised communications variant designated Tu-142MR was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> submarines. The Tu-142 was designed by the Tupolev design bureau, and manufactured by the Kuibyshev Aviation and Taganrog Machinery Plants from 1968 to 1994. Formerly operated by the Soviet Navy and Ukrainian Air Force, the Tu-142 currently serves with the Russian Navy.|$|E
5|$|George {{accepted}} {{a position at}} Hughes Aircraft to work for Howard Hughes, along with fellow bomber advocate Ira C. Eaker. Eaker and George transformed Hughes Aircraft into a very profitable military contractor, reaching $100M in sales in 1948. George expanded the company beyond the manufacture of aircraft {{to focus on the}} new field of military electronics, primarily by bringing together expert electronics designer Dean Wooldridge and engineer-businessman Simon Ramo, both hired by George in 1946. In August 1953, Ramo and Wooldridge resigned. George followed a few months later to help form the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, competing directly with Hughes by developing <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> defenses. In 1958, Ramo-Wooldridge would merge with Thompson Products, to become Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, which was shortened to TRW in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Col. Iceal Hambleton had 29 {{years of}} {{military}} service. He {{had served in}} the Army Air Force as a radio operator during World War II, though not in combat. After World War II, he was recalled to active service by the USAF in the early 1950s. During the Korean War he flew 43 combat missions as a navigator in a B-29 bomber. He then worked during the 1960s on various USAF <b>ballistic</b> <b>missile</b> projects including the PGM-19 Jupiter, Titan I ICBM and Titan II ICBM. He had been the deputy chief of operations for the USAF Strategic Air Command 390th Strategic Missile Wing before the Vietnam War.|$|E
50|$|After Egypt's {{defeat in}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Egypt started the missile program and became {{interested}} in <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> after the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the 1956 Suez Crisis, as the importance of <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> had arisen to penetrate Israeli airspace.|$|R
50|$|Previously, it was {{primarily}} focused on developing <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> and rockets {{to increase the}} nation's strategic deterrent capability. Today it is also involved in civilian projects and has modified some of its intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> into launch vehicles {{to be used for}} satellites.|$|R
5000|$|Currently only Aegis has a {{possible}} boost-phase capability, but—in {{the case of}} the SM-2—it needs to be within 40 km of a launch point. [...] This is acceptable for submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (SLBMs), but not likely for land-based intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> <b>missiles</b> (ICBMs).|$|R
