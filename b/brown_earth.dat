Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E

Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E
25|$|Soil in {{the borough}} is principally of poor to {{moderate}} agricultural quality although high grade land {{is present in}} pockets. The south of the borough has acid soils and gravels, but poorly drained clays predominate in the north. Most of the borough is covered {{by a series of}} clays and marls, with sandy and lignitic beds, part of the Bracklesham Group of beds. As well as clay soils, the Bracklesham Beds result in some bands of sandy soil to the north of West End, and podzol soils around the M27 motorway west of Hedge End and on small areas of the gravels on top of the beds themselves. However most of the soil over the beds is more fertile <b>brown</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Further east in Europe, in more {{continental}} climates, {{the soils}} show greater leaching of clay and other minerals, and are mapped as luvisols in the WRB. These are rather similar to <b>brown</b> <b>earths,</b> {{and some other}} classifications, including the British and French, call these soils argillic <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> (sol brun lessive), because they have an argillic, i.e. clay-enriched horizon at some depth well below the A horizon. The argillic character is rather weakly expressed in the oceanic climate of the UK, and the differences between <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> proper (cambic <b>brown</b> <b>earths)</b> and argillic yellow earths are not apparent to the general observer.|$|R

500|$|... "A parish, in the poorlaw {{union of}} Cardiff, hundred of Kibbor, county of Glamorgan, in South Wales, 3½ miles (N. W. by W.) from Cardiff; {{containing}} 279 inhabitants. This parish probably derives its name, signifying [...] "a cataract," [...] from the rushing {{waters of the}} river Tâf, by which it is bounded on the north-east. It was formerly comprehended within the hundred of Miskin, but has been recently separated therefrom. It comprises about eleven hundred acres of arable and pasture land, inclosed and in a profitable state of cultivation: the surface is in some parts elevated, and in others flat, but no where subject to inundation; the soil is a strong <b>brown</b> <b>earth,</b> favourable {{to the production of}} good crops of grain of all kinds, potatoes, and hay. The substratum is partly a hard brown stone, and partly limestone of very good quality. Radyr Court, formerly the seat of the family of Matthew, ancestors of the late Lord Llandaf, has been partially taken down, and the remainder has been modernised, and converted into a farmhouse. The turnpike-road leading from Cardiff to Llantrissent passes a little to the south of the parish; and the Tâf-Vale railway runs through it, nearly parallel with the river, which is crossed by the line in this vicinity. Some of the inhabitants are employed at the iron-works in the parish of Pentyrch.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) is {{a species}} of New World mouse. It is usually 5–8inches (12–25cm) in body length, and has a soft pelage that ranges from golden-brownish to burnt orange in color. The genus name comes from the Greek words, [...] "ochre", a yellow or <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> pigment, and [...] "mys," [...] meaning mouse.|$|E
2500|$|As one can see, Donegal {{is an area}} of low ringfort concentration. It is {{therefore}} odd to find a hillfort of the size and scope of Aileach in this area. [...] The ringfort density of Northwest Ulster as a whole is 0.16 per square kilometre. [...] Northwest Ulster includes all of Donegal and the western portions of Londonderry and Tyrone. Ringforts are virtually absent from the areas of Derryveagh, the Blue Stacks, Slieve League and Inishowen. Ringforts are rarely found in similarly elevated areas of Londonderry and Tyrone, including the Sperrin Mountains and west of the Roe River. Due to the inhospitable nature of these areas due to blanket bogs and thin rock, they were sparsely populated. There were pockets of settlement such as southwest Donegal. Ringsforts can be found along the eastern slopes of Derryveagh Mountains, the Roe River valley and the Mourne River basin. Although some Early Christian settlement is present, the areas as a whole was relatively sparsely settled with ringforts despite the Mourne and Foyle river valleys being extremely suitable for agricultural exploitation. [...] Other forms of secular settlement are also thinly distributed in the area although several souterrains have been found. Northwest Ulster maintained a low population density throughout the Early Christian Era. Barrett examined ringforts in southern Donegal. [...] She identified 124 ringforts in an area reaching from Glen Head to Lough Ekse and south along the county boundary to Bundoran. Thirty-two of the ringforts were cashels and 15% were bivallate sites. Ringfort builders avoided land below 30 metres preferring land between 30 and 60 metres. [...] Soil quality was statistically proven to be a key determinant of settlement density. [...] <b>Brown</b> <b>earth</b> and grey-brown podzolic soils were particularly favoured explaining the concentration of sites west of Donegal Bay. The <b>brown</b> <b>earth</b> soils and the podzolic soils of St. John's peninsula also attracted a high proportion of sites. The distribution of ecclesiastical sites corresponds broadly with that of ringforts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>Earths</b> are important, {{because they}} are {{permeable}} and usually easy to work throughout the year, so they are valued for agriculture. They also support a much wider range of forest trees than {{can be found on}} wetter land. They are freely drained soils with well-developed A and B horizons. They often develop over relatively permeable bedrock of some kind, but are also found over unconsolidated parent materials like river gravels. Some soil classifications include well-drained alluvial soils in the <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> too.|$|R
5000|$|The {{susceptibility}} of soil types to drought is a {{major concern}} in Akkaraipattu where three main soil types can be found: Alluvial soils of variable drainage and texture, Reddish <b>Brown</b> <b>Earths,</b> and Solodized Solonetz. The Alluvial soils are generally located on flat flood plains. Poorly drained alluvial soils are grey in colour whilst those with better drainage are coloured brown to yellowish brown. The Reddish <b>Brown</b> <b>Earths</b> have a reddish-brown surface colour when dry and then turn a dark reddish - brown colour when wet. Solodized Solonetz is not a fertile soil with a pH value greater than 8.5.|$|R

50|$|Typically the <b>Brown</b> <b>Earths</b> have dark <b>brown</b> topsoils with loamy {{particle}} size-classes {{and good}} structure - especially under grassland. The B horizon lacks the grey colours and mottles characteristic of gley soils. The rich colour {{is the result}} of iron compounds, mainly complex oxides which, like rust, have a reddish-brown colour. Some of these soils are, in fact, red. For example, in the UK reddish <b>brown</b> <b>earths</b> occur on the Old Red Sandstone (Devonian) and the New Red Sandstone (Permian), and are red because the rocks from which they formed are derived from strongly oxidised deposits that were laid down under desert conditions millions of years ago.|$|R
