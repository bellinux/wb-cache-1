The {{local chapter of the}} Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the British and Irish Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and Irish Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and Irish Lions {{did not have an}} anthem to represent them before any of their matches until 2005.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (Little Brothers). However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate. After that, Verro <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mafiosi, and – according to police reports – became their most bitter enemy. He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E

Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, {{for which he was}} disinherited, {{but the rest of the}} family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lead group to try for the victory. As if {{the success of the}} breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E

Right now, the Aztecs are left without a dominant male, since Zaphod has died.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The two fleets sailed within view of {{each other}} for several days, but de Grasse {{preferred}} to lure the British away from the bay where de Barras was expected to arrive carrying vital siege equipment.

Two of these, the Aztecs and the Mayans, represent the New World and have new distinctive architectural style. Other new civilizations are the Spanish, Huns, and Koreans. Age of Mythology, released in 2002, <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> historical trend and instead focused on Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. It shared many gameplay elements with The Age of Kings and was considered a spin-off of the main Age of Empires series.|$|E
5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but the pope refused. This started {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> authority of the pope. In lieu of the pope, Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal supremacy over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Buena Vista Games {{pitched a}} concept for an Oswald-themed video game to Disney President and COO Bob Iger, who then became {{committed}} to bringing Oswald back to Disney. In 2006, nearly 80 years after <b>the</b> Disney studio <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Universal, <b>The</b> Walt Disney Company managed {{to acquire the}} intellectual property of Oswald and the catalog of Disney-produced Oswald films (with NBCUniversal effectively trading Oswald for the services of Al Michaels as play-by-play announcer on NBC Sunday Night Football).|$|R

5|$|The destroyers Yukikaze and Asagumo plucked 950 {{survivors}} of Kyokusei Maru from the water. These two destroyers, being {{faster than the}} convoy since its speed was dictated by the slower transports, <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group to disembark the survivors at Lae. The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day. The convoy – without the troop transport and two destroyers – was attacked again {{on the evening of}} 2 March by 11 B-17s, with minor damage to one transport. During the night, PBY Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF took over the task of shadowing the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, {{both of whom were}} gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E
5|$|James Dudley {{began working}} for Jess McMahon in the 1950s, when McMahon was a {{co-owner}} of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. When McMahon and his partners <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> National Wrestling Alliance to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1963, Dudley continued to work for McMahon. Dudley performed many different jobs, from carrying buckets of waters to counting ticket sales. Dudley {{was a close friend}} of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father; in particular, he drove McMahon's limousine and served as his bodyguard. He has said that he thought of McMahon as a father figure. McMahon later increased Dudley's responsibilities with the company several times, and eventually assigned him to manage Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C., which made Dudley the first African-American to hold such a position in the United States. His role required him to oversee several other events, including the Town and Country Jamboree television show.|$|E
50|$|In many ways, Democratic Labour {{can be seen}} as a {{forerunner of}} the Social Democratic Party, which was formed by many of the {{viewpoints}} as Taverne, that <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Labour in <b>the</b> early 1980s. Taverne himself twice stood as a Social Democratic Party candidate but failed to be elected again.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} born in the era known like El Dorado, in Colombia, when <b>the</b> {{football}} league <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> FIFA, because <b>the</b> Colombia football league turned professional in 1948.

5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) {{and three other}} Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and {{it took more than}} a minute for his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers' new {{neighbours}} {{were the}} Zappa and the Starsky. Although {{smaller than the}} Whiskers, the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the Whiskers – in a rare occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was no threat to the Whiskers. Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers, the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, {{and a lack of}} new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a jackal. Former Whiskers female Maybelline <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group {{at the end of the}} third series, forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.|$|E
5|$|The peloton {{remained}} intact for roughly {{the first half}} of the sixth stage. Luigi Ganna and Carlo Galetti <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pack and made it to the finish in Rome where Ganna then edged out Galetti for the stage victory. During the next stage, a group of six riders lead for the most part before Galetti and Ganna broke away again. The two riders made their way to the finish in Genoa, where a large crowd of spectators came to see the finish. Ganna went on to win his second consecutive stage, while Galetti extended his lead over the rest of the field. The race's eighth stage contained some harsh climbs, most notably the Giovi. The finish of the stage was hotly contested as Galetti, Ganna, and Eberardo Pavesi finished at the same time, with Galetti winning the stage in the end.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the age of}} the dinosaurs, as {{the island}} moved north due to the effects of {{continental}} drift, some geologists assert that it may have been fully submerged at various intervals. Botanists, however, argue that there must have been some areas that remained above sea level, serving as refugia for the descendants of the original flora that inhabited the island when it <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Gondwana. <b>The</b> isolation of New Caledonia was not absolute, however. New species came to New Caledonia while species of Gondwanan origin were able to penetrate further eastward into the Pacific Island region.|$|R
