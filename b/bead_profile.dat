A combi-nation of commonly applied solid-phase extraction proce-dures for clean-up may {{increase the number of}} detectable peptides and proteins. In this study, we have evaluated whether the classification performance of breast cancer profiles improves by using two serum workup procedures. Methods Serum samples from 105 breast cancer patients and 202 healthy volunteers were processed according to a standardized protocol implemented on a high-end liquid-handling robot. Peptide and protein enrichments were carried out using weak-cation exchange (WCX) and reversed-phase (RP) C 18 magnetic <b>beads.</b> <b>Profiles</b> were acquired on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} a {{study of}} laser welding in terms of basic laser material interaction parameters. This includes power density, interaction time and specific point energy. A detailed study of {{the correlation between the}} laser material interaction parameters and the observed weld <b>bead</b> <b>profiles</b> is carried out. The results show that the power density and the specific point energy control the depth of penetration, whilst the interaction time controls the weld width. These parameters uniquely characterise the response of the material to the imposed laser energy profile, which is independent of the laser system. It is demonstrated that by studying the laser welding with respect to the basic laser material interaction parameters also helps explain some phenomenological phenomena in laser welding, such as the effect of beam diameter on the weld profile. In addition a new approach for parameter selection in laser and hybrid laser welding is investigated. A phenomenological model allowing achievement of a particular laser weld on different laser systems is developed. In the proposed method the user specifies the required weld profile, according to the quality requirements and then the model provides combination of laser parameters, which lead to this particular weld on a given laser system. This approach can be potentially used to transfer laser data between different laser systems with different beam diameters. An extensive study of residual stains in laser and hybrid laser welding is carried out. Both processes are compared either at a constant total heat input or at conditions required to achieve the same depth of penetration. The results demonstrate that there is a trade-off between the fit-up tolerance and the residual stress-induced distortion. Hybrid laser welding provides better ability to bridge gaps than the laser welding, but for the price of increased residual stress and distortion. Additionally, industrial study of the sensitivity to fit-up of hybrid laser welding with high deposition rate MIG sources is carried out.

After purification with surface-active magnetic <b>beads,</b> MALDI-TOF <b>profiling</b> experiments were performed on tryptic digests of serum samples of prostate cancer patients with metastases (n = 27) and controls (n = 30). This resulted in the reproducible detection of eight differentially expressed peptides, which were then identified by nanoLC-MALDI-TOF/TOF and confirmed by MALDI-FTMS exact mass measurements. All differentially expressed peptides are derived from two homologous parts of human serum albumin; two of the eight peptides were tryptic and six were nontryptic. The presence of the nontryptic fragments indicates that a proteolysis process occurs which is not mediated by trypsin. Since the nontryptic fragments were found at significantly higher levels in control samples compared with metastases samples, it is proposed that a specific proteolytic inhibition process is in effect in the serum of prostate cancer patients. Experiments using synthetic peptides showed that this proteolytic activity occurs ex vivo and is sequence specific.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} set of parameters controlling the <b>bead</b> <b>profile</b> of deposits in powder melting, based on the spatial energy distribution of laser. Four parameters, identified as the laser material interaction parameters were used to study the <b>bead</b> <b>profile</b> formation in powder melting. The focus is put on control of the dimensional accuracy of powder deposits independently of the optical set-up and laser system. In the initial stage to understand the effect of welding parameters {{on the development of}} the fusion zone, a solid metal with homogenous and known thermal properties was used. The results indicate that for large beam diameters, typically used in cladding, power density and interaction time control the depth of penetration and beam diameter and interaction time controls the weld width. However, for small beam diameters, typically used in powder bed additive manufacturing, it was found that it is more difficult to achieve steady state conduction welds due to high conduction losses to the bulk material and rapid transition to keyhole regime. Therefore, with small beam diameters it is challenging to achieve pure conduction welds, which should guarantee good quality of deposits and low spatter. In the second part, the melting behaviour of solid material and powder for the same material type was compared. The build height in powder melting depends on layer thickness of the deposited powder and energy density, which needs to be provided to fuse the powder to the workpiece, which is equivalent to penetration in laser welding of solids. Similar to solid melting, the build width in powder melting is controlled by beam diameter and the interaction time. It was also found that with small beam diameters and large particle sizes it is more difficult to generate keyhole in the base plate, as compared to solid material. Therefore, despite the presence of spatter in the process, a full keyhole is often not generated. A set of parameters to describe the conduction welding process based on spatial distribution of laser energy has been developed. This enables achievement of a particular weld profile with various optical set-ups and potentially transfers of results between machines. However, more complex melting characteristics of powder requires some additional factors to be included to develop a similar model for powders...|$|E

The bead underwent rotational motion in response to rotational magnetic fields. In the case of bead without rotation, the amount of drug release into a phosphate buffer solution obeyed non-Fickian diffusion. The spontaneous drug release reached a saturation value of 0. 90 [*]mg at 25 minutes, which corresponds to 92 % of the perfect release. The drug release was accelerated with increasing the rotation speed. The shortest time achieving the perfect release was approximately 3 minutes, which corresponds to 1 / 8 of the case without rotation. Simultaneous with the fast release, the bead collapsed probably due to the strong water flow surrounding the bead. The beads with high elasticity were hard to collapse and the fast release was not observed. Hence, the fast release of ketoprofen is triggered by the collapse of beads. Photographs of the collapse of <b>beads,</b> time <b>profiles</b> of the drug release, and a pulsatile release modulated by magnetic fields were presented...|$|R
