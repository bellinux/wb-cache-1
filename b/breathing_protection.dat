50|$|Because {{there is}} not a {{significant}} pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the breathable-air balloon, any rips or tears would cause gases to diffuse at normal atmospheric mixing rates rather than an explosive decompression, giving time to repair any such damages. In addition, humans would not require pressurized suits when outside, merely air to <b>breathe,</b> <b>protection</b> from the acidic rain and on some occasions low level protection against heat. Alternatively, two-part domes could contain a lifting gas like hydrogen or helium (extractable from the atmosphere) to allow a higher mass density. Therefore putting on or taking off suits for working outside would be easier. Also working outside the vehicle in non pressurized suits would be easier.|$|R

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} two new pieces of emergency response equipment that recognize {{and address the}} constraints of a confined space environment. One piece of equipment is a respirator designed {{for use in a}} post fire environment. Traditional first responders generally use supplied air respirators - they provide cool, dry, safe breathing air to the first responder, and because they are supplied at above ambient pressure, the system is tolerant to a loose-fitting mask. Supplied air respirators have a limited supply of air, but because the traditional first responder intends to address the emergency from outside and then retreat, this limited air supply does not pose a serious problem. NASA uses a supplied oxygen respirator for first response to an emergency affecting air quality on the International Space Station. The air supply is rated for 15 minutes - ISS program managers sponsored a hardware development activity to provide the astronauts up to 8 hours of <b>breathing</b> <b>protection</b> after the supplied air system is exhausted. Size and weight limitations prevent the use of a supplied air system for 8 hours for six crew members. A trade study resulted in the selection of a filtering respirator system over a re-breather system; due to design simplicity, operational simplicity, and likely threats to air quality on ISS. The respirator cartridge that filters smoke particles, adsorbs organics and acid gases, and catalytically converts carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide has been qualified for use on ISS, and was delivered on STS- 135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle Program...|$|E
40|$|Current cellular-based connectomics {{approaches}} aim {{to delineate}} the functional or structural organizations of mammalian brain circuits through neuronal activity mapping and/or axonal tracing. To discern possible connectivity between functionally identified neurons in widely distributed brain circuits, reliable and efficient network-based approaches of cross-registering or cross-correlating such functional-structural data are essential. Here, a novel cross-correlation approach that exploits multiple timing-specific, response-specific and cell-specific neuronal characteristics as coincident fingerprint markers at the systems, network and cellular levels is proposed. Application of this multiscale temporal-cellular coincident fingerprinting assay to the respiratory {{central pattern generator}} network in rats revealed a descending excitatory pathway with characteristic activity pattern and projecting from a distinct neuronal population in pons to its counterparts in medulla that control the post-inspiratory phase of the respiratory rhythm important for normal <b>breathing,</b> airway <b>protection</b> and respiratory-vocalization coordination.

40|$|Stoffenmanager is an {{exposure}} and risk assessment tool {{that has a}} control banding part, with risk bands as outcome and a quantitative exposure assessment part, with the 90 th percentile of the predicted exposure as a default outcome. The main aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether multiple users of Stoffenmanager came to the same result when modelling the same scenarios. Other aims were to investigate the differences between outcomes of the control banding part with the measured risk quota and to evaluate the conservatism of the tool by testing whether the 90 th percentiles are above the measured median exposures. We investigated airborne exposures at companies in four different types of industry: wood, printing, metal foundry, and spray painting. Three scenarios were modelled and measured, when possible, at each company. When modelled, 13 users visited each company on the same occasion creating individual assessments. Consensus assessments were also modelled for each scenario by six occupational hygienists. The multiple users' outcomes were often spread over two risk bands in the control banding part, and the differences in the quantitative exposure outcomes for the highest and lowest assessments per scenario varied between a factor 2 and 100. Four parameters were difficult for the users to assess and had a large impact on the outcome: type of task, <b>breathing</b> zone, personal <b>protection,</b> and control measures. Only two scenarios had a higher measured risk quota than predicted by the control banding part, also two scenarios had slightly higher measured median exposure value than modelled consensus in the quantitative exposure assessment part.

40|$|Background - This study {{investigated}} the effect controlling the phase of respiration {{on the development of}} nausea provoked by periodic motion at 0. 2 Hz which is maximal for provocation of motion sickness. Methods - Subjects were exposed to 60 ° peak–peak, pitch backwards from upright motion while viewing a video of the environment with 180 ° phase delay. Motion duration was a maximum of 30 min and frequency was set to match individuals' spontaneous respiration. Conditions were: A, spontaneous breathing; B, inspiration cued to begin when head-down; C, inspiration cued to begin when upright; D, inspiration cued with a ± 18 ° desynchronizing phase drift with respect to the tilt cycle. Nausea was rated and ventilation was recorded. Results - Magnitudes of nausea ratings were ordered D < C < B < A (p = 0. 008) and speed at which nausea developed were ordered A < B < C < D (p = 0. 001). Discussion - The lower sickness ratings and prolonged times to develop nausea in B, C, D confirm that controlled <b>breathing</b> gives some <b>protection</b> against motion sickness. The differences between B, C and D in the development of nausea support the hypothesis of Von Gierke and Parker [von Gierke HE, Parker DE. Differences in otolith and abdominal viscera graviceptor dynamics: implications for motion sickness and perceived body position. Aviat Space Environ Med. 65 : 747 – 51, 1994. ] that motion sickness can be provoked by a conflicting mismatch between visceral and otolithic signals of orientation to the vertical. The mismatch is greatest in the more provocative condition B because the viscera are mechanically unloaded due to exhalation when the body attains uprightness whereas mismatch is lessened by the mechanical reinforcement afforded by inspiration in (C) and by inconstant relationships between visceral and otolithic signals in (D), both of which afford better protection against sickness. ...|$|R
40|$|Processes {{currently}} {{used throughout the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to remove corrosion and coatings from structures, ground service equipment and small components results in waste streams consisting of toxic chemicals, spent media blast materials, and waste water. When chemicals are used in these processes they are typically high in volatile organic compounds (VOC) and are considered hazardous air pollutants (HAP). When blast media is used, the volume of hazardous waste generated is increased significantly. Many of the coatings historically used within NASA contain toxic metals such as hexavalent chromium, and lead. These materials are highly regulated and restrictions on worker exposure continue to increase. Most recently the EPA reduced the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hexavalent chromium. The new standard lowers OSHA's PEL for hexavalent chromium from 52 to 5 micrograms of Cr(V 1) per cubic meter of air as an 8 -hour time-weighted average. Hexavalent chromium {{is found in the}} pretreatment and primer coatings used within the Shuttle Program. In response to the need to continue to protect assets within the agency and the growing concern over these new regulations, NASA is researching different ways to continue the required maintenance of both facility and flight equipment in a safe, efficient and environmentally preferable manner. The use of laser energy to remove prepare surfaces for a variety of processes, such as corrosion and coating removal, weld preparation and non destructive evaluation is a relatively new technology that has shown itself to be environmentally preferable and in many cases less labor intensive than {{currently used}} removal methods. The development of a Portable Laser Coating Removal System (PLCRS) started as the goal of a Joint Group on Pollution Prevention (JG-PP) project, led by the Air Force, where several types of lasers in several configurations were thoroughly evaluated. Following this project, NASA decided to evaluate the best performers on processes and coatings specific to the agency. Laser systems used during this project were all of a similar design, most of which had integrated vacuum systems in order to collect materials removed from substrate surfaces during operation. Due {{to the fact that the}} technology lends itself to a bide variety of processes, several site demonstrations were organized in order to allow for greater evaluation of the laser systems across NASA. The project consisted of an introductory demonstration and a more in-depth evaluation at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Additionally, field demonstrations occurred at Glenn Research Center and Kennedy Space Center. During these demonstrations several NASA specific applications were evaluated, including the removal of coatings within Orbiter tile cavities and Teflon from Space Shuttle Main Engine gaskets, removal of heavy grease from Solid Rocket Booster components and the removal of coatings on weld lines for Shuttle and general ground service equipment for non destructive evaluation (NDE). In addition, several general industry applications such as corrosion removal, structural coating removal, weld-line preparation and surface cleaning were evaluated. This included removal of coatings and corrosion from surfaces containing lead-based coatings and applications similar to launch-structure maintenance and Crawler maintenance. During the project lifecycle, an attempt was made to answer process specific concerns and questions as they arose. Some of these initially unexpected questions concerned the effects lasers might have on substrates used on flight equipment including strength, surface re-melting, substrate temperature and corrosion resistance effects. Additionally a concern was PPE required for operating such a system including eye, <b>breathing</b> and hearing <b>protection.</b> Most of these questions although not initially planned, were fully explored as a part of this project. Generally the results from tesng were very positive. Corrosion was effectively removed from steel, but less successfully from aluminum alloys. Coatings were able to be removed, with varying results, generally dark, matte and thin coatings were easier to remove. Steel and aluminum panels were able to be cleaned for welding, with no known deleterious effects and weld-lines were able to have coatings removed in critical areas for NDE while saving time as compared to other methods...|$|R
40|$|Várias técnicas para a reconstrução da laringe, pós laringectomias parciais verticais, são citadas na literatura, algumas utilizando estruturas da própria laringe, como a prega {{vestibular}}, porém, poucas dão destaque à análise das funções laríngeas após estas reconstruções. Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar as funções laríngeas em pacientes submetidos à cordectomia completa (tipo IV), reconstruídos com retalho de prega vestibular. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Estudo de coorte transversal. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Dez pacientes, nove do sexo masculino e um do sexo feminino, com idades entre 45 e 75 anos, e média de 64, 5, com carcinomas glóticos tratados por cordectomias totais ou completas (tipo IV) e reconstruídos com retalho de prega vestibular, foram submetidos a videolaringoestroboscopia, onde se avaliou a permeabilidade laríngea, o posicionamento do retalho, o fechamento laríngeo, a movimentação das aritenóides e a característica da fonte sonora: vibrátil ou friccional, e quando vibrátil, a localização e as estruturas que a compunham. A qualidade vocal foi analisada por avaliação perceptiva auditiva e objetiva computadorizada. A função de proteção das vias aéreas durante a deglutição foi realizada pela avaliação endoscópica da deglutição. RESULTADOS: Os resultados evidenciaram que não houve necessidade de manter a traqueostomia no pós-operatório tardio, pois a luz laríngea reconstruída mantinha-se pérvia. A função de proteção estava mantida em todos os casos, a coaptação completa em 30 % e somente um paciente teve a movimentação da aritenóide limitada devido à imobilidade do lado operado. Evidenciaram, também, que havia fonte sonora vibrátil em 90 % dos casos e que em todos a prega vestibular participava da sua composição. Em sete pacientes a fonte sonora vibrátil se localizava na região glótica. A análise computadorizada revelou freqüência fundamental média de 177, 5 Hz, jitter médio de 1, 11 % e shimmer de 7, 04 %. Pela escala GRBAS, um paciente apresentou voz normal e 4 tiveram disfonia discreta. CONCLUSÕES: A reconstrução laríngea pós-cordectomia realizada com o retalho da prega vestibular tornou possível emissão de voz normal (freqüência fundamental 205 Hz, jitter 0, 13 %, shimmer 1, 16 %), proporcionando coaptação completa em 30 % dos casos, fonte sonora vibrátil na região glótica em 70 % e participação do retalho como estrutura vibrátil em 90 %, além de preservar as funções laríngeas de respiração e proteção das vias aéreas durante a deglutição. Several {{reports of}} techniques for larynx reconstruction after partial vertical laryngectomy {{are available in}} the literature, some of them using structures of the larynx itself such as the vestibular fold, but few have emphasized analysis of laryngeal function after reconstruction. Thus, the objective {{of the present study was}} to assess laryngeal function in patients submitted to total or complete cordectomy (type IV) followed by reconstruction with vestibular fold flap. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort transversal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients, nine males and one female aged 45 to 75 years (mean age: 64. 5 years), with glottis carcinomas treated by total or complete cordectomy (type IV) and reconstructed with vestibular fold flap were submitted to videolaryngostroboscopy for assessment of laryngeal permeability, flap positioning, laryngeal closure, arytenoid movement, characteristics of speech sound source (vibrating or frictional) and, when the source was vibrating, location and structures of the sound source. Voice quality was evaluated by perceptual acoustic assessment and by objective computer analysis. The function of lower airway protection during swallowing was analyzed by endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. RESULTS: There was no need to maintain tracheostomy during the late postoperative period since the reconstructed laryngeal lumen remained pervious. The function of airway protection during swallowing was preserved in all patients, with full coaptation of laryngeal structures in 30 % of the cases and one patient presented immobility of the operated hemilarynx in midline position. Vibrating sound source was detected in 90 % of the cases and was located in the glottic region in seven patients. The vestibular fold flap participated in the composition of the vibrating sound source in all cases. Computerized analysis revealed the following mean values: fundamental frequency, 177. 5 Hz, jitter 1. 11 % and shimmer 7. 04 %. Using GRBAS scale we observed normal voice in one patient and four patients with discrete dysphonia. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal reconstruction with vestibular fold flap after cordectomy was able to maintain laryngeal function, providing normal voice according to perceptive auditory or acoustic analysis (fundamental frequency, 205 Hz, jitter 0. 13 % and shimmer 1. 16 %), with full coaptation of laryngeal structures in 30 % of the cases, vibrating sound source in the glottic region in 70 % and participation of the flap as a vibrating structure in 90 %, as well as the maintenance of the laryngeal functions of <b>breathing</b> and airway <b>protection</b> during swallowing...|$|R
