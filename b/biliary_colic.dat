5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of <b>biliary</b> <b>colic</b> (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
25|$|Cholecystitis is {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (<b>biliary</b> <b>colic)</b> precede acute cholecystitis. The pain lasts longer in cholecystitis than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment, recurrent episodes of cholecystitis are common. Complications of acute cholecystitis include gallstone pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or {{inflammation of}} the common bile duct.|$|E
25|$|A {{gallstone}} is a stone formed {{within the}} gallbladder out of bile components. The term cholelithiasis may {{refer to the}} presence of stones in the gallbladder or to the diseases caused by gallstones. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) never have symptoms. In 1–4% of those with gallstones, a crampy pain in the right upper part of the abdomen, known as <b>biliary</b> <b>colic,</b> occurs each year. Complications of gallstones include inflammation of the gallbladder, inflammation of the pancreas, and liver inflammation. Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, or tea-color urine.|$|E

40|$|Fibromyalgia, {{a chronic}} {{syndrome}} of diffuse musculoskeletal pain and somatic hyperalgesia from central sensitization, is very often comorbid with visceral pain conditions. In fibromyalgia patients with gallbladder calculosis, this study assessed {{the short and}} long-term impact of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on fibromyalgia pain symptoms. Fibromyalgia pain (VAS scale) and pain thresholds in tender points and control areas (skin, subcutis and muscle) were evaluated 1 week before (basis) and 1 week, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in fibromyalgia patients with symptomatic calculosis (n = 31) vs calculosis patients without fibromyalgia (n. 26) and at comparable time points in fibromyalgia patients not undergoing cholecystectomy, with symptomatic (n = 27) and asymptomatic (n = 28) calculosis, and no calculosis (n = 30). At basis, fibromyalgia+symptomatic calculosis patients presented a significant linear correlation {{between the number of}} previously experienced <b>biliary</b> <b>colics</b> and fibromyalgia pain (direct) and muscle thresholds (inverse) (p< 0. 0001). After cholecystectomy, fibromyalgia pain significantly increased and all thresholds significantly decreased at 1 week and 1 month (1 -way ANOVA, p< 0. 01 -p< 0. 001), the decrease in muscle thresholds correlating linearly with the peak postoperative pain at surgery site (p< 0. 003 -p< 0. 0001). Fibromyalgia pain and thresholds returned to preoperative values at 3 months, then pain significantly decreased and thresholds significantly increased at 6 and 12 months (p< 0. 05 -p< 0. 0001). Over the same 12 -month period: in non-fibromyalgia patients undergoing cholecystectomy thresholds did not change; in all other fibromyalgia groups not undergoing cholecystectomy fibromyalgia pain and thresholds remained stable, except in fibromyalgia+symptomatic calculosis at 12 months when pain significantly increased and muscle thresholds significantly decreased (p< 0. 05 -p< 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} recurrent biliary events in the period after mild biliary pancreatitis but before interval cholecystectomy and to {{determine the}} safety of cholecystectomy during the index admission. BACKGROUND: Although current guidelines recommend performing cholecystectomy early after mild biliary pancreatitis, consensus on the definition of early (ie, during index admission or within the first weeks after hospital discharge) is lacking. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for studies published from January 1992 to July 2010. Included were cohort studies of patients with mild biliary pancreatitis reporting on the timing of cholecystectomy, number of readmissions for recurrent biliary events before cholecystectomy, operative complications (eg, bile duct injury, bleeding), and mortality. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed. RESULTS: After screening 2413 studies, 8 cohort studies and 1 randomized trial describing 998 patients were included. Cholecystectomy was performed during index admission in 483 patients (48 %) without any reported readmissions. Interval cholecystectomy was performed in 515 patients (52 %) after 40 days (median; interquartile range: 19 - 58 days). Before interval cholecystectomy, 95 patients (18 %) were readmitted for recurrent biliary events (0 % vs 18 %, P < 0. 0001). These included recurrent biliary pancreatitis (n = 43, 8 %), acute cholecystitis (n = 17), and <b>biliary</b> <b>colics</b> (n = 35). Patients who had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography had fewer recurrent biliary events (10 % vs 24 %, P = 0. 001), especially less recurrent biliary pancreatitis (1 % vs 9 %). There were no differences in operative complications, conversion rate (7 %), and mortality (0 %) between index and interval cholecystectomy. Because baseline characteristics were only reported in 26 % of patients, study populations could not be compared. CONCLUSIONS: Interval cholecystectomy after mild biliary pancreatitis {{is associated with a}} high risk of readmission for recurrent biliary events, especially recurrent biliary pancreatitis.

The investigation included gallbladder ultrasonography, administration of a questionnaire on personal and family history, physical examination and blood chemistry. A total of 1809 subjects (attendance rate 87. 7 %) participated in the study. Personal history and physical examination showed that Chianciano inhabitants have a low {{prevalence of}} obesity (4. 3 %) and only 4. 4 % of the female population had more than two pregnancies. Overall prevalence of gallstone disease (cholecystectomy + cholelithiasis) was 5. 9 % (3. 7 % for males and 8. 4 % for females). Age standardized relative risk of gallstone disease for females was 2. 25 (95 % confidence limits = 1. 68 - 2. 68). Prevalence of cholelithiasis was 3. 5 % (2. 7 % for males and 4. 2 % for females). Prevalence of gallstone disease increased with increasing age in both sexes, being extremely low in the age interval of 15 - 29 years (0. 25 %). The overall gallstones/cholecystectomy ratio was found to be lower(l:l) in females than in males (2. 7 : 1).

Data collected included demographics, pain score and analgesia data. The primary outcome was comparison of TTA between workload groups. Data were analysed using Cox regression and multivariate analyses. Sample size required was 50 per group. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients were studied (52 % male; median age 57 years). Demographics were similar between groups. Ninety-three per cent received analgesia with median TTA of 53 min (interquartile range 30. 5 - 114. 5). No significant association was found between workload and TTA (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 02, 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 02). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with delay to analgesia included advanced age (HR 0. 35, P= 0. 006), language other than English (HR 0. 55, P= 0. 010), lower triage acuity (HR 0. 20, P= 0. 000) and delay to pain assessment (HR 0. 16, P= 0. 000).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the role of computed tomography in different encountered non-renal, non-biliary acute abdominal disorders using 64 -multislice technology. Subjective and methodsOver two years, a total of 500 patients having different acute abdominal disorders were encountered from those attending big trauma and emergency center and were retrospectively studied in this work. Each patient was thoroughly asked about the detailed clinical history after reviewing the referring imaging request and laboratory findings, except for non-cooperating patients. Exclusion criteria for CT were as follows: severe previous allergic reactions to iodine contrast media, renal insufficiency (creatinine level, > 120 μmol/L or ⩾ 1. 5 mg/L) and hemodynamic instability. All patients with clinically proven acute <b>biliary</b> or renal <b>colic</b> were also excluded from the study (U/S was the frontline imaging modality). CT examination was performed using a 64 -multislice CT machine. ResultsCT examination was performed in a total of 500 patients. The average age of the patients was 45 yrs (range: 20 – 71 yrs) and nearly two thirds of the patients were male. All patients had severe abdominal pain. Fifty patients were alcoholic and 60 were diabetic. T. B. was seen in 10 patients and AIDS in one patient. Fever and constitutional symptoms were seen in 100 patients. Vomiting and/or constipation were seen in the majority of the patients. Acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, perforated duodenal ulcer, peritonitis, diverticulitis, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, retroperitoneal infective fasciitis, torsion ovarian cyst and hemorrhagic adrenal tumor were the different acute abdominal disorders encountered in this work. ConclusionMultidetector CT provides an excellent means to detect a number of acute abdominal disorders and allows rapid assessment with high diagnostic accuracy.
