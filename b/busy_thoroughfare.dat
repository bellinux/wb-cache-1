25|$|Branca was {{appointed}} to the bench of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 1963, where he served until his retirement in 1978. A statue of Christopher Columbus was erected in 1986 on Clark Drive at the Piazza Italia. It was dedicated to Branca for his leadership in the local Italian community and was donated by the Italian City of Genoa. In 2000, the monument mysteriously disappeared, apparently stolen, only to later reappear at the Italian Garden at Hastings Park. The likely reason for the guerrilla relocation is that the original Clark Drive site, to the dismay of the Italian community, became a <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> for transport trucks and hence unfriendly to pedestrian traffic.|$|E
25|$|Since 1962 {{no fewer}} than 121 planes have crashed {{at or near the}} airport, killing a total of 19. Most {{noteworthy}} of these was on September 25, 2004 when a 1985 Stout Bushmaster 2000 (a spinoff of a Ford Tri-Motor) crashed during an airport exhibition. The plane's rudder locked to a left position during the takeoff roll, causing the plane to veer left off the runway. The pilot was able to get the plane airborne before rolling into a crowd of spectators; the plane then narrowly missed the airport's control tower, rolled hard left and crashed onto a <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare.</b> In all, four were injured: the 2-person flight crew and two in a moving car. The cause of the accident was due to failure of the flight crew to remove a gust lock—improvised from a nylon cargo strap—from the plane's empennage before flight.|$|E

500|$|If the {{candidate}} was manic, {{he was also}} dedicated and filled with good humor, {{and he had a}} particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978. [...] (In that letter he called Jones [...] "a man of the highest character," [...] and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to [...] "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|James opened [...] "The Malting Shovel" [...] Tavern on {{the shores}} of Parramatta River, in the Eastern Farm {{district}} of Kissing Point which is almost halfway between Sydney town and Parramatta.

2500|$|The {{acquisition}} of the remaining bus services of Midland Motorways by the Board in November 1982 gave it access to several towns and settlements north of Christchurch, which it apportioned to both the Papanui Road and Cranford Street routes.

2500|$|In 1912 {{during the}} {{construction}} of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered [...] below the road level. It was [...] wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence for the existence here of a <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> even before {{the construction of}} the earliest bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} and the corporation {{did not allow}} the architects a free hand. The developers demanded a closed building with little natural light and rejected a more open, roof-lit, design. The corporation insisted on a bus station, market, car parking, an underground railway station, and provision for deck access to subsequent developments. Cannon Street was to be kept open with no shop frontages. Corporation Street and High Street were allowed shop fronts on the returns to Market Street. Market Street, a <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> had shop fronts as pedestrianisation was proposed, though this did not happen until 1981. The architects, developers, and city council did not communicate well. Display windows were forbidden {{on most of the}} external walls of the centre and were inside the centre. The architects realised that [...] "the brief [...] given... would produce a very introverted building. And we said this would not be attractive".|$|E

60|$|Somewhere along Theater Street he {{had lost}} it. He remembered being hustled {{somewhat}} roughly on the bridge {{over one of the}} canals that cross that <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare.</b> Possibly some slant-eyed, light-fingered pickpocket was even then enjoying the fifty-odd yen his purse had contained. And then again, he thought, he might have lost it himself, just lost it carelessly.|$|E
60|$|The blue flames danced, and {{disclosed}} a few vehicles hurrying past swiftly in the night, huge tramways lumbering along, {{and one or}} two flying motor cabs. And far ahead--right in {{the heart}} of the glow--the distant lights of a more <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare.</b> Now the wide street was more dark and lonely than before, only the solitary female figure appeared in the fiery picture, walking among the trees. The last of the lumbering tramways had been merged in the distant lights: only from afar came flying on the blue flames, a taxicab at lightning speed.|$|E
60|$|He {{folded the}} letter {{up and put}} it into his pocket, and then waited until he heard the three knocks on the door.

60|$|We glided up {{the long}} level of K Street,--once a cheerful <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare,</b> now {{distressing}} in its silent desolation. The turbid water, which seemed to meet the horizon edge before us, flowed at right angles in sluggish rivers through the streets. Nature had revenged herself on the local taste by disarraying the regular rectangles by huddling houses on street corners, where they presented abrupt gables to the current, or by capsizing them in compact ruin. Crafts of all kinds were gliding {{in and out of}} low-arched doorways. The water was {{over the top of the}} fences surrounding well-kept gardens, in the first stories of hotels and private dwellings, trailing its slime on velvet carpets as well as roughly boarded floors. And a silence quite as suggestive as the visible desolation was in the voiceless streets that no longer echoed to carriage-wheel or footfall. The low ripple of water, the occasional splash of oars, or the warning cry of boatmen were the few signs of life and habitation.|$|E
60|$|Presently Sabatini {{began to}} talk, rousing himself as though with an effort, and asking {{questions}} concerning Ruth, about her accident, her tastes.

Their progress grew slower and slower as they passed {{into the heart of}} this strange land, down the narrow yet <b>busy</b> <b>thoroughfare</b> which seemed to be the main artery of the neighborhood. Strange names were above the shop-windows, strange articles were displayed behind them. Stalls were set out in the streets. Men and women, driven by the sulphurous heat to seek air, leaned half-dressed from the windows, or sat even upon the pavement in front of their houses. More than once they were obliged to come to a standstill owing to the throngs of loiterers. As they neared the last corner, Arnold leaned out and his heart sank. In front he could see the crowd kept back by a line of police.|$|E
