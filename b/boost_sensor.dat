This correlated to a change in the ignitor unit, which went from a two socket 4/6 pin configuration, to a 4/9 pin configuration, with the left/right orientation of the two sockets reversed.|$|E
50|$|MAP sensors measure {{absolute}} pressure. Boost sensors or gauges {{measure the}} amount of pressure above a set absolute pressure. That set absolute pressure is usually 100 kPa. This is {{commonly referred to as}} gauge pressure. Boost pressure is relative to absolute pressure - as one increases or decreases, so does the other. It is a one-to-one relationship with an offset of -100 kPa for boost pressure. Thus a MaP sensor will always read 100 kPa more than a <b>boost</b> <b>sensor</b> measuring the same conditions. A MaP sensor will never display a negative reading because it is measuring absolute pressure, where zero is the total absence of pressure. Vacuum is measured as a negative pressure relative to normal atmospheric pressure. Vacuum-Boost sensors can display negative readings, indicating vacuum or suction (a condition of lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere). In forced induction engines (supercharged or turbocharged), a negative boost reading indicates that the engine is drawing air faster than it is being supplied, creating suction. The suction is caused by throttling in spark ignition engines and is not present in diesel engines. This is often called vacuum pressure when referring to internal combustion engines.|$|E
40|$|Effective use of Machine Learning {{to support}} extracting maximal {{information}} from limited sensor data {{is one of}} the important research challenges in robotic sensing. This thesis develops techniques for detecting and characterizing patterns in noisy sensor data. Our Bayesian Aggregation (BA) algorithmic framework can leverage data fusion from multiple low Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR) sensor observations to boost the capability to detect and characterize the properties of a signal generating source or process of interest. We illustrate our research with application to the nuclear threat detection domain. Developed algorithms are applied to the problem of processing the large amounts of gamma ray spectroscopy data that can be produced in real-time by mobile radiation sensors. The thesis experimentally shows BA’s capability to <b>boost</b> <b>sensor</b> performance in detecting radiation sources of interest, even if the source is faint, partiallyoccluded, or enveloped in the noisy and variable radiation background characteristic of urban scenes. In addition, BA provides simultaneous inference of source parameters such as the source intensity or source type while detecting it. The thesis demonstrates this capability and also develops techniques to efficiently optimize these parameters over large possible setting spaces. Methods developed in this thesis are demonstrated both in simulation and in a radiation-sensing backpack that applies robotic localization techniques to enable indoor surveillance of radiation sources. The thesis further improves the BA algorithm’s capability to be robust under various detection scenarios. First, we augment BA with appropriate statistical models to improve estimation of signal components in low photon count detection, where the sensor may receive limited photon counts from either source and/or background. Second, we develop methods for online sensor reliability monitoring to create algorithms that are resilient to possible sensor faults in a data pipeline containing one or multiple sensors. Finally, we develop Retrospective BA, a variant of BA that allows reinterpretation of past sensor data in light of new information about percepts. These Retrospective capabilities include the use of Hidden Markov Models in BA to allow automatic correction of a sensor pipeline when sensor malfunction may be occur, an Anomaly- Match search strategy to efficiently optimize source hypotheses, and prototyping of a Multi-Modal Augmented PCA to more flexibly model background and nuisance source fluctuations in a dynamic environment...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a low input-current chopper amplifier. Chopper amplifiers are attractive in applications where high DC precision is required, due to their low offset, drift & 1 /f noise. They are generally used in the analog signal chain to <b>boost</b> weak <b>sensor</b> signals and buffer them to an analog-to-digital converter. Till recent years, research related to chopper amplifiers has focused on techniques to reduce their low frequency voltage errors and exploring effective techniques to suppress chopper-ripple. A superior performance on both these fronts has been achieved. However, at the cost of significantly large input currents (> 100 pA) and input current noise (> 100 fA/ Hz), thus limiting their usage to sensors with low source impedance (1 M?) application.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{high-speed}} Single-Photon Camera for demanding applications in biology, astrophysics, telecommunications, 3 D imaging and security surveillance. The camera {{is based on}} a 32 -by- 32 array of "smart pixels" processed in a standard high-voltage technology. Every pixel is a completely independent photon-counting channel. Sensitivity is at the single-photon level and no readout noises affect the measure. The camera has high Photon-Detection Efficiency (PDE) in the blu/green visible spectrum (45 % at 450 nm) and low Dark-Counting Rate (DCR) even at room temperature (usually lower than 2 kcps). The use of microlenses makes it possible to further increase the effective pixel fill-factor. The camera can be configured by means of a cross-platform user-friendly software that communicates with the camera through a fast USB link. The integration time window may range from few tens of nanoseconds to milliseconds. The maximum frame rate for the whole 1, 024 pixels is about 100 kframe/s, while the minimum 20 ns dead-time between frames <b>boosts</b> the <b>sensor</b> dynamic range.

In this paper, we analyze a loosely coupled INS/GNSS including evaluation of the inertial error propagation and robustness of the corresponding navigation integrity concept with respect to the inertial system parameters. Moreover, we analyze the system integrity performance in terms of overall system protection level dependent on the inertial sensor error model.

Our system is not only compatible with the future smart spaces and ubiquitous computing systems, but also suitable for large-scale indoor localization. The use of low-complexity Gaussian Filter (GF), Wheel Graph Model (WGM) and Probabilistic Localization Algorithm (PLA) make the proposed algorithm robust and suitable for large-scale indoor positioning from uncertainty, self-adjective to varying indoor environment.

40|$|The current {{supernova}} {{detection technique}} used in IceCube {{relies on the}} sudden deviation of the summed photomultiplier noise rate from its nominal value during the neutrino burst, making IceCube a ≈ 3 Megaton effective detection volume - class supernova detector. While galactic supernovae can be resolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains unconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to supernova core collapse models. The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect supernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and time. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented detector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume for such coincidental hits is much smaller (≳ 35 kton, about the scale of SuperK), {{a wealth of information}} is obtained due to the comparatively low coincidental noise rate. We demonstrate that a neutrino flux from a core collapse supernova will produce a signature enabling the resolution of rough spectral features and, {{in the case of a}} strong signal, providing indication on its location. We further discuss the enhanced potential of a rather modest detector extension, a denser array in the center of IceCube, within our one dimensional analytic calculation framework. Such an extension would enable the exploration of the neutrino sky above a few GeV and the detection of supernovae up to a few 100 's of kilo parsec. However, a 3 - 4 Mpc detection distance, necessary for routine supernova detection, demands a significant increase of the effective detection volume and can be obtained only with a more ambitious instrument, particularly the <b>boosting</b> of <b>sensor</b> parameters such as the quantum efficiency and light collection area.

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. Motivated by the widespread applications of teams of mobile sensor nodes that collectively accomplish a common objective, this thesis has focusee on the study of the coverage control problem and its implementation. The objective of coverage control problem is to deploy multiple sensor nodes in an environment, often termed "mission space", so as to maximize a certain objective function. The main contribution ofthis thesis is propose provide a theoretical analysis and experimental implementation of coverage control algorithm, which extends a prior one in the literature. The convergence analysis for the gradient based coverage control algorithm developed previously in the CODES lab is first presented. This is achieved first by recognizing the non-smooth nature ofthe objective function and understanding the solution to the coverage control problem in the Filippov sense. Then, it is shown that the solution converges to an invariant set via the generalized LaSalle's Invariance Principle. Furthermore, to get an improved deployment of sensor nodes, a self-boosting algorithm is proposed. By the self- <b>boosting</b> algorithm, each <b>sensor</b> node has a modified objective function to optimize, which induces it to explore more uncovered areas and finally converges to the common objective function defined for the original coverage control problem. Thus, the final deployment yielded by the self-boosting algorithm is an improved maximum of the original problem. The implementation of the coverage control algorithm studied in this thesis motivates another research problem, which is the localization of sensor nodes. Sensor nodes are initially randomly deployed in the mission space and an algorithm is designed in this thesis localizes the sensor nodes based on a line-feature-based map of the mission space. Each sensor node is able to find its accurate location after collecting information from the environment, reasoning and estimating its locations based on the collected data. The coverage control and localization algorithms proposed in this thesis are all validated in experiments performed in the hallways of the photonics building at Boston University...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a sensor for the precise and selective measurement of biological analytes (such as dopamine (DA), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and L-Cysteine (L-Cys)) at the low levels characteristic of living systems can make a great contribution to disease diagnosis. The discovery of an electrochemical technique {{for the detection of}} various biological analytes was induced by the strong demand on developing a sensing technique that able to offer a rapid response, high sensitivity, simplicity and low operating cost. In order to enhance the analytical performance of electrochemical biosensor, several challenges associated with the sensors need to be solved including: (i) sluggish electron-transfer rate properties at the electrode's surface which led to the poor response signal; (ii) limited sensitivity and selectivity capabilities towards target analyte detection due to occurrence of fouling effect; and (iii) overlapping voltammetric response caused by the co-existence of various interfering species. We have sought to address these problems through chemical modification of conventional working electrode surface with an electrochemically active material, which is reduced graphene oxide (rGO) -based material. The thesis reports the preparation of novel reduced graphene oxide-nafion@metal (rGO-Nf@metal) nanohybrid materials which were then used to modify glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the detection of various biological analytes. The strategy of using these nanohybrid materials is driven by the excellent individual properties owned by rGO and metal nanoparticles which essential in boosting the sensing performance. There are four important studies that have been presented in this thesis; (i) reduced graphene oxide-nafion (rGO-Nf) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of DA and NO; (ii) reduced graphene oxide-nafion@silver (rGO-Nf@Ag) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of H 2 O 2; (iii) reduced graphene oxide-nafion@gold (rGO-Nf@Au) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of NO; (iv) reduced graphene oxide-nafion@palladium (rGO-Nf@Pd) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of L-Cys. To sum up, we have successfully developed a simple, highly sensitive, and selective electrochemical sensor using rGO-Nf@metal-based nanohybrids for the detection of various biological analytes. The novelty of presented work lies in the used of simple, rapid, and facile method for synthesis that is hydrothermal method, and the used of small amount of metal which could reduce the cost of production. Moreover, the combination of three individual materials (rGO, Nf, and metal nanoparticles) to form a ternary nanohybrid material proven to be suitable material for <b>boosting</b> the electrochemical <b>sensor</b> performance, thus open up a new path to develop new catalyst for electrochemical sensor...|$|R
