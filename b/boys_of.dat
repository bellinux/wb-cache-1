She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the team's support base {{consists}} of fans of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue <b>Boys</b> <b>of</b> Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated with hooliganism, though violence between the two groups does not usually occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly from fans of Zrinjski Mostar. The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called Uvijek Vjerni (Always Faithful).|$|E

She spent her early years in the prairies of Canada under difficult conditions. She attended elementary school at Dandas until 1921.

5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for <b>boys</b> <b>of</b> ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} main actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Heroes for Sale was {{directed}} by prolific pre-Code director William Wellman and featured silent film star Richard Barthelmess as a World War I veteran cast onto the streets with a morphine addiction from his hospital stay.

Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, São Paulo {{rose from}} being a mere great in Brazil to become an {{international}} powerhouse. Manager Telê Santana turned to the Paulistas youth and instilled his style of quick, cheerful, and decisive football. Led by stars such as Zetti, Müller, Raí, Cafu, Palhinha, São Paulo beat Newell's Old <b>Boys</b> <b>of</b> Argentina to begin a dynasty. In 1993 São Paulo successfully defended the title by thumping Universidad Católica of Chile in the finals. The Brazilian side became the first club since Boca Juniors in 1978 to win 2 consecutive Copa Libertadores. Like Boca Juniors, however, they would reach another final in 1994 only to lose the title to Vélez Sársfield of Argentina in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|In July 1906, Ernest Thompson Seton sent Baden-Powell {{a copy of}} his 1902 book The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians. Seton, a British-born Canadian-American {{living in}} the United States, met Baden-Powell in October 1906, and they shared ideas about youth {{training}} programs. In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called Boy Patrols. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 <b>boys</b> <b>of</b> mixed social backgrounds (from boy's schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth, and Winton Boys' Brigade units) and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, England. His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.|$|E
5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle.

The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E
