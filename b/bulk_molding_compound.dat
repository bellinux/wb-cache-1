2500|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{is widely}} used as an extender in paints, in particular matte emulsion paint where typically 30% by weight of the paint is either chalk or marble. It is also a popular filler in plastics. Some typical examples include around 15 to 20% loading of chalk in unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) drain pipe, 5 to 15% loading of stearate coated chalk or marble in uPVC window profile. PVC cables can use calcium carbonate at loadings of up to 70 phr (parts per hundred parts of resin) to improve mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) and electrical properties (volume resistivity). [...] Polypropylene compounds are often filled with calcium carbonate to increase rigidity, a requirement that becomes important at high use temperatures. Here the percentage is often 20–40%. It also routinely used as a filler in thermosetting resins (sheet and <b>bulk</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compounds)</b> and has also been mixed with ABS, and other ingredients, to form some types of compression molded [...] "clay" [...] poker chips. [...] Precipitated calcium carbonate, made by dropping calcium oxide into water, is used by itself or with additives as a white paint, known as whitewashing.|$|R

Our purpose is use bagasse fiber as a reinforcement and filler of BMC, and fabricate product by injection molding and injection compression molding. The mechanical properties of product were improved after adding bagasse fiber. Viewing the fracture surface on tensile test specimen through SEM, we could observe the glass fibers were penetrated into the bagasse fibers longitudinally. Along with the UP resin solidifying, the glass fibers were firmly fixed into the bagasse fibers and finally united weth them. This effect indicated the glass fiber length was prolonged so that the adhesion interface with UP resin became larger, and leaded to increase the mechanical properties. Otherwise, it was observed the UP resin was sufficiently permeated through the bagasse fibers and solidified. These phenomena also contributed to enhance the mechanical properties drastically...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- An {{original}} {{approach to}} compute the longitudinal tensile break stress of multiphase composite materials with short fibers reinforcement is presented. The most obvious mechanical model which reflects a multiphase composite material is a pre-impregnated material, known as prepreg. In the class of prepregs the most known are Sheet- and <b>Bulk</b> <b>Molding</b> <b>Compounds</b> (SMCs and BMCs). The model is seen as consisting of three phase compounds: resin, filler and fibers, model that is reduced to two phase compounds: substitute matrix and fibers. The Sheet Moulding Compounds reinforced with discontinuous and almost parallel fibers, subjected to longitudinal tensile loads, presents a specific note by {{the existence of a}} shear mechanism between fibers and matrix. This shear mechanism transfers the tensile load through the fibers. The Young’s moduli for the substitute matrix and for the entire composite are computed and a comparison between the theoretical approach and the experimental data is accomplished. The paper presents also an original homogenization method to predict the elastic properties of these materials. The upper and lower limits of the homogenized coefficients for a 27 % fibers volume fraction SMC are computed. It is presented a comparison between the upper and lower limits of the homogenized elastic coefficients of a SMC material and the experimental data.

The thin polymer {{composite}} bipolar plates (the thickness < 1. 5 mm) {{for use in}} polymer electrolyte membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) containing vinyl ester resin, graphite powder, organoclay have been fabricated by <b>bulk</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound</b> (BMC) process. Organoclay prepared by ionic exchange of montmorillonite (MMT) with three different Mw of diamine intercalating agents was used to reinforce the mechanical properties of the composite bipolar plates. Results indicate that the basal spacing and content of MMT varied with Mw of POP-diamines are critical in determining the resultant mechanical properties for bipolar plates. The flexural strength and the unnotched impact strength of the plate were ca. 38 % (from 30. 21 MPa to 45. 66 MPa) and ca. 30 % (from 58. 11 J/m to 80. 21 J/m) higher than the pristine graphite plate, respectively, as the basal spacing of MMT (2 phr) was increased from 1. 71 to 5. 43 nm. The limiting oxygen index (L. O. I.) and the UL- 94 test revealed that the bipolar plate possesses excellent flame retardant with L. O. I. higher than 50 and UL- 94 -V 0. In addition, the electrical conductivity of the bipolar plates with different MMT contents and basal spacing of MMT is higher than 100 S/cm...|$|E
30|$|In this research, the {{synthesis}} of a suitable nanocomposite in terms of properties and economics for use in bipolar plates in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) {{has been carried out}} successfully. Nowadays, bipolar plates {{play a significant role in}} fuel cells which is absolutely important in renewable energy industry. So, epoxy/graphite/nano-copper nanocomposite bipolar plates are prepared by <b>bulk</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound</b> process. Graphite and nano-copper were added as primary and secondary fillers to the composite, respectively. Epoxy resin was selected since fabrication bulk molding can be done with ease and also because of its lower cost compared to other materials. Although graphite could increase conductive characteristics, it is not sufficient for bipolar plates. Therefore, we boost the conductive properties by increasing nano-copper. Due to the small size of nanoscale copper, it can be well dispersed in polymer and graphite matrix; nano-copper can release conductive properties perfectly throughout the composite. Different percentages of nano-copper, graphite and constant percentage of epoxy are used for this purpose. The electrical resistance, flexural strength, and density of composites were measured according to the applicable standards. The morphology of the prepared plate was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) found that fillers disperse well in the matrix. Innovations in this work include improving properties and increasing the efficiency of the nanocomposite by adding metal nanoparticles (copper).|$|E

These are the most promising power sources for road transportation and portable devices. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. A fuel cell stack consists of bipolar plates and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). The bipolar plate is by weight, volume and cost one of the most significant components of a fuel cell stack. Major functions of bipolar plates are to separate oxidant and fuel gas, provide flow channels, conduct electricity and provide heat transfer. Bipolar plates can be made from various materials including graphite, metals, carbon / carbon and carbon/polymer composites. Materials for carbon–polymer composites are relatively inexpensive, less corrosive, strong and channels can be formed by means of a moulding process. Carbon– polymer composites are of two type i. e; thermosetting and thermoplastic. For thermosetting composite a <b>bulk</b> <b>molding</b> <b>compound</b> (BMC) was prepared by adding graphite, vinyl ester resin, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthalate. The BMC was thoroughly mixed, poured into a die mould of a bipolar plate with channels and hot pressed at a specific temperature and pressure. A bipolar plate was formed according to the die mould. Design of the mould is also discussed. Conducting polymers were also added to BMC to increase the conductivity of bipolar plates.
