5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with <b>big</b> <b>win</b> over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E

25|$|Quetta {{began their}} 2016 {{campaign}} with comfortable wins over Islamabad United and Karachi Kings before edging past Peshawar Zalmi in a closely fought match. A defeat against Lahore Qalanders {{was followed by}} a <b>big</b> <b>win</b> over Islamabad in which New Zealand all-rounder Grant Elliott, who had just joined the team, proved instrumental in the win as he took 3 key wickets to restrict United to 117.

25|$|In the {{campaign}} of 1996, Olympiatravet was once more the first major target. Copiad defended the title, but {{that was to be}} the last <b>big</b> <b>win</b> in his career. In Finlandia-Ajo, the stallion was disqualified, and in Elitloppet, the two-time champion failed to reach the final after going off-stride in the elimination race. After winning a small race in early July, Copiad galloped in Årjängs Stora Sprinterlopp. On July 23, in Hugo Åbergs Memorial, Copiad was parked outside leader Triple T. Storm by driver Berglöf. The two trotters kept a staggering pace and Copiad gave up before the stretch. Copiad was later confirmed to be unwell, and his connections decided to end the racing career.|$|E

25|$|The Blues easily {{put away}} the Cheetahs in the sole Good Friday game. The next day saw the Chiefs beat the Highlanders before a startling {{mountain}} backdrop in Queenstown. The Crusaders annihilated the Force 53–0. It was the largest score ever conceded by the Force and the largest losing margin – but for the Crusaders it didn't come close to their 96–19 win against the Waratahs in 2002. The Sharks continued the high scoring – putting 57 points on the Reds in Brisbane for a <b>big</b> <b>win.</b> The Stormers upset the Lions 30–8 in Cape Town. In the sole Easter Sunday clash the Waratahs failed to resurrect their season against the Brumbies – going down 36–10 in the interstate grudge match between the rivals. The win put the Brumbies into the top four {{for the first time}} in 2007.|$|E
25|$|On 13 July 1776, Harris had {{his best}} known {{performance}} to date {{when he took}} four 1st innings wickets for Hampshire v. Kent at Windmill Down, Hampshire winning the game by 1 wicket.

On 8–12 August of the same year, Harris played for the White Conduit Club against Kent at Bishopsbourne Paddock and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's <b>big</b> <b>win</b> was due to Tom Walker and Tom Taylor becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming {{the first player to}} score two centuries in a match.|$|E
25|$|Toronto {{lost their}} second {{game in a}} row and again a series of errors {{in a short period of}} time helped the opponents to score but this time it was the offence and {{turnovers}} that gave the Stampeders a <b>big</b> <b>win.</b> The Argonauts gave up the ball five times in all but the game broke open with two turnovers within 75seconds in the second half. On the final play of the third quarter, Stampeders linebacker Dwaine Carpenter stripped the ball from quarterback Kerry Joseph and returned it 55yards for a touchdown and on the next Argos drive, Calgary defensive back Dwight Anderson intercepted a Joseph pass and ran it back 52yards for another touchdown to make the score 34 to 9. Yet another interception later in the fourth quarter by cornerback Brandon Browner gave the Stampeders three defensive touchdowns and a commanding 44 to 9 victory.|$|E
