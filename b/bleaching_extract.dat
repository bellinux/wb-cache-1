40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} previously demonstrated reductions in photoreceptor sensitivity to light in n- 3 fatty-acid-deficient rats {{can be explained by}} alterations in rhodopsin content, and/or function. Methods. Sprague-Dawlcy rats were reared throughout gestation, lactation, and up to 24 weeks of age on a diet containing sarTlower oil (n- 3 fatty-acid-deficient) or soybean oil as the sole source of lipids. Dark-adapted content and in vivo regeneration of rhodopsin after bleaching were measured by detergent extraction. The regeneration rate constants and number of photons absorbed by rhodopsin under steady-state bleach conditions were calculated from these values. The rate of metarhodopsin II (Mil) formation in vitro was determined by flash <b>bleaching</b> <b>extracted</b> pigment and native rod outer segment membranes. Rod outer segment length and photoreceptor cell density were determined in histologic sections through the inferior central retina. Results. Dark-adapted rhodopsin content of retinas from rats reared on sarTlower oil was 12 % to 15 % higher than that of rats raised on soybean oil at every age measured. The rate of rhodopsin regeneration was significantly slower in rats reared on sarTlower oil while the level o...|$|R

Comparison of the hydroxylamine difference spectrum and of the absorption maximum of the purest retinal extract located the mudsucker photosensitive pigment maximum at 512 ± 1 mµ. Extraction of retinal tissue with a fat solvent after exposure to white light gave a preparation which after the addition of antimony chloride reagent developed the absorption band maximal near 664 mµ, which is characteristic of retinene 1.

This method has been increasingly used in archaeological, geological and geomorphological contexts for the last 30 years. However, its successful application is highly dependent on the geological context, the type {{and quality of the}} sampled material, but also its preparation. In most of the ESR dating studies, Equivalent Dose calculation uses the multiple ali-quot additive dose (MAAD) approach. Accuracy of the ED is the slightly correlated with the dose response of different aliquots of quartz grains to irradiation. In most of the measured quartz samples, a single saturating exponential dose response curve or a two components combining an exponential with a linear term are classically used in ESR dating to fit the experimental ESR data points derived from the aluminum (Al) or the titanium (Ti-Li, Ti-H) centers in quartz. However, large deviation and large associated errors may occasionally be observed. Heterogeneous bleaching (incomplete resetting) of the ESR dating signal can sometimes explain such deviations. Scattering of the dose response to irradiation may also be due to heterogeneous dose response of the different aliquots related to various nature and/or origin of the quartz grains constituting the dating sediment. Quartz grains extracted from several sediments were measured by ESR and observed using cathodoluminescence (CL) technique. The CL colours of quartz are weak, compared with emission of other minerals such as carbonates or phosphates, but are highly variable and can be related to genetic conditions of quartz formation. Hence, lumines-cence microscopy can be used to reveal internal structures, growth zoning and lattice defects in quartz crystals not discernible by means of other analytical techniques, but also to reveal heterogeneity of the quartz grains within the sample, or even the presence of other minerals, not removed during the chemical process of quartz purification. The cathodoluminescence gave evidence of several types of situation within our quartz samples. Some of them are made of monocrystalline quartz grains, emitting a uniform CL within the grain but with a light heterogeneity of the wavelength emission between the grains. Some are made of polycrystalline quartz grains, displaying a strong heterogeneity of the luminescence within and between the quartz grains. Finally we also observed some CL attributed to plagioclase and K-feldspar, which may contaminate, even strongly, the quartz samples. The presentation will report this variability and discuss about its effect on the dose response curve when using the ESR dating of quartz grains...|$|R

The acute oral toxicity study indicated that methanol extracts of both Gynura spp. have negligible level of toxicity when administered orally and have been regarded as safe in experimental rats. Six chemical constituents, 5 -p-trans-coumaroylquinic acid (1), 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid (2), rutin (3), kaempferol- 3 -O-rutinoside (4), 3, 5 -dicaffeoylquinic acid (5) and kaempferol- 3 -O-glucoside (6) were isolated and identified from ethyl acetate extract of G. bicolor. Whilst, guanosine (7) and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (8) were successfully isolated and identified from water extract of G. bicolor. These eight chemical constituents were isolated from G. bicolor leaves for the first time, except rutin (3). The 3, 5 -dicaffeoylquinic acid (5), guanosine (7) and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid iv (8) showed selective cytotoxicity against HCT 116 cancer cells compared to CCD- 18 Co normal cells. Cell death and cell cycle arrest effects were observed when HCT 116 cells were treated with 3, 5 -dicaffeoylquinic acid (5) and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (8). The addition of cell impermeable catalase and reduced glutathione protected HCT 116 cells from cell death and cell cycle arrest effects. It was also observed that 3, 5 -dicaffeoylquinic acid (5) and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (8) generated extracellular hydrogen peroxide and green pigment (presumably quinone products) which contributed to cell death and cell cycle arrest. Current investigation revealed that the anti-proliferation effect of guanosine (7) on HCT 116 cells was resulted from cell cycle arrest associated with the activation of ERK 1 / 2, p 38 and JNK. The decreased activation of AMPK was also observed. Furthermore, the cell cycle arrest was accompanied by decreased of cyclin D 1 level. These observations suggest that cell cycle arrest induced by guanosine (7) may be mediated through activation of ERK 1 / 2, p 38 and JNK pathways along with attenuation of AMPK pathway. The findings in present study provided scientific validation {{on the use of}} both Gynura spp. as natural remedies in folk medicine. Further studies on the mutagenic and toxicity effect {{over a longer period of}} time involving detection of effects on vital organ functions should be carried out to ensure that the plants are safe for human consumption...|$|R
