25|$|The <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippage</b> {{with the}} Public–private {{partnerships}} (PPPs): between 2008 and 2010 the accounts slipped 560.2 million euros, mainly {{due to the}} rents paid to road concessions, to which were paid more 425.5 million euros than it was budgeted. In 2011 the slippage in the rents with the road concessions rose 28% to 197.4 million euros above what was budgeted and rose 42.3% to 266.3 million euros above what had been forecasted for 2010. The State spent a total of 896.6 million euros in rents to the road concessions. The rents paid to the PPPs in the health and rail sectors also slipped considerably.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} budgetary subsidy {{policy issues}} that arise when centrally planned economies {{move toward a}} market economy. The analysis suggests that subsidy reduction, to be successful, has to be embedded into an overall economic reform program and that during the program’s execution, former implicit subsidies {{are likely to become}} budgetized. Furthermore, additional pressure on the budget, caused by enterprise restructuring or the introduction of social safety net provisions, necessitates careful policy design. Comprehensive budgetary reform is required to prevent <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> during the transition process. ...|$|R

Performance {{under the}} program at end-December 2001 was broadly satisfactory, despite delays in foreign {{assistance}} disbursements and recurring weaknesses in program implementation owing to limited institutional capacity. At end-December 2001, eight of the eleven quantitative and structural benchmarks were met. The program remained on track at end-March 2002 as the authorities took expenditure-reducing measures to correct for <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> {{that occurred in the}} last quarter of 2001. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{budgeting}} {{process has}} been recently reformed in Italy (L. 196 / 2009) {{in order to improve}} control of budget and transparency in the provision of clear information on government fiscal policy. Indeed, the general government final expenditures often deviate significantly from the initial forecasted amounts. Therefore, although the initial budget is often formulated in contractionary stance compared with the previous year’s final account, the final outcome turns out to be expansionary. As a consequence, confidence in the reliability of expenditure estimates in the initial budget and {{in the value of the}} initial budget as an indicator of the stance of fiscal policy have been undermined. Using real-time data for Italy, reported in the Relazione Previsionale e Programmatica (RPP) and in the Relazione Unificata sull’Economia e la Finanza Pubblica (RUEF), we explore fiscal plans and their implementation for GDP and general government aggregated and disaggregated items of revenue, expenditure and budget balance over the period 1998 - 2009. Both reports are employed with the aim of measuring the budgetary policy implementation error, following the methodology of Beetsma et al. (2009). We focus on the first year of the fiscal plans because <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> mainly occur in this year (Balassone et al. 2010). The main findings suggest that implemented budgetary adjustment falls systematically short of planned adjustment for GDP, for primary balance and overall balance. Actually, the main determinants of the implementation error of both primary and overall balance are the expenditures, in particular, the capital expenditures. Moreover, it seems that errors in macroeconomic forecasts cannot be considered the driving force of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages.</b> Our results are in line with the strand of literature (von Hagen 1992; von Hagen and Harden 1994; Alesina and Perotti 1999; Tanaka 2003) according to which credible plans are the conditio sine qua non for healthy budget outcomes and resorting fiscal transparency and accountability. To improve public budgeting in Italy, we deem necessary a renewed commitment by policy makers in term of planning and control of public expenditures. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of expenditure {{rules in the}} next future in Italy has been made viable by recent domestic and European budget reforms. Expenditure rules could improve the difficult conditions of the Italian public finance and could remedy to some of its main flaws, in particular, ‘unexpected’ <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> and poor expenditure control. The analysis {{is focused on the}} comparison of some relevant characteristics of three kinds of expenditure rules (a ceiling set in terms of a rate of expenditure growth, a fixed term/rolling basis spending limit and an expenditure ceiling within a debt brake mechanism) and on the impact that their adoption could have on the soundness of the country’s fiscal position. The expenditure counterfactual paths we trace use a real-time data set covering all stages of the budget process. Political acceptability, coherence with the EU and the domestic fiscal frameworks, predictability of resources and transparency differ according to the rule adopted and prevent a clear ranking of the expenditure rules to single out the best solution. However, the expenditure ceilings within the debt brake unquestionably grant better results in terms of fiscal performance...|$|R
40|$|When it {{was adopted}} in 1997 the {{stability}} and growth pact was considered {{as one of the}} cornerstones of the European monetary union. However, against the background of the economic downturn starting {{at the turn of the}} century, this perception changed and some observers criticised the pact for unduly constraining governments’ fiscal room for manoeuvre. This sparked a long debate on the appropriateness of the fiscal rules in the monetary union that has finally ended in March 2005 when a political agreement was reached in the Council of the European Union that announces substantial changes to the pact. This article first recalls the reasons for fiscal rules, especially in a monetary union with a fragmented budgetary policy, and the main provisions of the original pact. It then shows that despite the strengthening of the fiscal rules nearly all EU- 15 Member States have significantly relaxed budgetary discipline after 1997, i. e. the year in which compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria was tested, which led to significant <b>budgetary</b> <b>slippages</b> in a number of countries. It is argued that this is due to specific institutional, political and statistical factors. Finally, the reform of the pact is assessed. Without prejudging the application of the new framework, the fiscal rules are found to be significantly weakened and there is a clear shift towards a more judgement-based institutional framework. Stability and growth pact, fiscal rules, European monetary policy...|$|R
