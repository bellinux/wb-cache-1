5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
5|$|In Thrud the Destroyer, To-Me Ku-Pa is {{revealed}} {{as being in}} service to The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> and is providing him with an army of warriors drawn from throughout time, including daleks and Imperial stormtroopers. To-Me Ku-Pa also appears as the villain in issue 1 of the full-length Thrud the Barbarian comic.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Thrud {{was created by}} the then 18-year-old Critchlow in 1981 while he was at foundation art college. His graphic design tutor, Bryan Talbot, gave him the project of producing a comic strip. At the time, Critchlow was reading the Conan books by Robert E. Howard, and this inspired him to produce Thrud. The initial five-page strip was published in comics fanzine Arken Sword. When Critchlow moved on to art college in Liverpool, Thrud made a further appearance in the comic Dead 'Ard, which Critchlow co-authored with artist Euan Smith. Dead 'Ard also featured a strip titled The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant,</b> subsequently re-published in the 26th and final issue of the Warrior comic anthology. The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> would later appear as one of Thrud's many enemies.|$|E

40|$|Cell wall polysaccharides from <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> and {{bilberries}} were characterised {{in three}} approaches. First, compositions of skin, pulp, and seeds show {{the distribution of}} polysaccharides over these tissues. A sequential extraction of cell wall material with different aqueous extractants informs about the extractability of the different polysaccharides, viz. pectins, hemicellulose, and cellulose. Finally, by isolation of cell wall polysaccharides from juice and press cakes obtained by the conventional juice manufacturing. The polysaccharide distribution was followed during juice processing. The main difference between bilberries and <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> is the dominant sugar residue in seeds: mannose for <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> and xylose for bilberries. Most of the hemicellulolytic sugars and cellulose can be found back in the press cake. The sugar composition of the press cake {{is similar to the}} composition of the residue after sequential extraction. <b>Black</b> <b>currants</b> contain more pectic sugars than bilberries. Consequently, a commercial enzyme used during processing releases more pectic material into the juic...|$|R

Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent. On first meeting Croneman, Thrud slices him in half with a sword. When Croneman returns to join a group of mercenaries fighting The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> in Thrud the Destroyer, he is depicted with a line of sutures running down the middle of his face and chest.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the white}} grapes, Chardonnay {{is the most}} common. Another grape found in the region, Aligoté, tends to produce cheaper wines which are higher in acidity. Aligoté from Burgundy is the wine {{traditionally}} used for the Kir drink, where it is mixed with <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> liqueur. Sauvignon blanc is also grown in the Saint Bris appellation. Chablis, Mâcon wines and the Côte d'Or whites are mostly produced from 100% Chardonnay grapes.|$|E

25|$|Wines {{made from}} Sangiovese tend to exhibit the grape's {{naturally}} high acidity {{as well as}} moderate to high tannin content and light color. Blending can have a pronounced effect on enhancing or tempering the wine's quality. The dominant nature of Cabernet can sometimes have a disproportionate influence on the wine, even overwhelming Sangiovese character with black cherry, <b>black</b> <b>currant,</b> mulberry and plum fruit. Even percentages as low as 4 to 5% of Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm the Sangiovese if the fruit quality is not high. As the wine ages, some of these Cabernet dominant flavours can soften and reveal more Sangiovese character.|$|E

Thinking {{her to be a}} damsel in distress, Thrud storms the tower, killing Lymara's father, five brothers, two uncles, ten cousins and fiance in the process. Seeking revenge, Lymara attempts to poison Thrud with a bottle of Acme [...] "Mammoth Poison", but succeeds only in putting him to sleep as part of The Three Tasks of Thrud series of strips. Subsequently, Lymara joins Thrud as one of the group of mercenaries brought in to fight The <b>Black</b> <b>Currant</b> in Thrud the Destroyer. [...] In this latter series of strips, Lymara is depicted with oversized breasts barely covered by an off-the-shoulder leather bra.|$|E
500|$|In North America, {{there is}} a need for this fruit to have {{resistance}} to white pine blister rust. New cultivars such as 'Crusader', 'Coronet' and 'Consort' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. ussuriense and these show resistance to the disease. However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self-fertile. Back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'Titania' that have a higher yield, better disease resistance, are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting. [...] Two new releases from a <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> breeding program in British Columbia, Canada, 'Blackcomb' and 'Tahsis', were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance.|$|E

40|$|Red {{currants}} (Ribes rubrum L.), <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> (Ribes nigrum L.), red {{and green}} gooseberries (Ribes uva-crispa) were evaluated for the total phenolics, antioxidant capacity based on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and functionality such as in vitro inhibition of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) relevant for potential management of hyperglycemia and hypertension. The total phenolics content ranged from 3. 2 (green gooseberries) to 13. 5 (<b>black</b> <b>currants)</b> mg/g fruit fresh weight. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The major phenolic compounds were quercetin derivatives (<b>black</b> <b>currants</b> and green gooseberries) and chlorogenic acid (red currants and red gooseberries). Red currants had the highest alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase and ACE inhibitory activities. Therefore red currants could be good dietary sources with potential antidiabetes and antihypertension functionality to compliment overall dietary management of early stages of type 2 diabetes.

40|$|This diploma´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of total antioxidant activity of red and white gooseberries and red, white and <b>black</b> <b>currants.</b> There are available information about small fruits, an overview of natural and synthetic antioxidants and {{a summary of the}} methods to determine the total antioxidant activity in the theoretical part. Frozen fruit samples were provided by Research and Breeding Institute of Pomology Holovousy Ltd. in the project QI 111 A 141 – Research of new technologies in the cultivation of gooseberries and currants with a focus on quality and use of fetuses (Ministry of Agriculture). The total antioxidant activity of red and white gooseberries and currants was measured by spectrophotometric methods using free radicals ABTS•+ and DPPH and was expressed as a Trolox equivalent. The total antioxidant activity of <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> was measured by electron paramagnetic resonance using free radicals ABTS•+ and DPPH and expressed as a TEACABTS and a TEACDPPH. There were measured 8 species of red gooseberries, 6 species of white gooseberries, 12 species of red currants, 6 species of white currants and 8 species of <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> in this thesis. The highest values of total antioxidant activity showed species of red and white gooseberries Alan, Karmen, Pax and Invicta and species of red and white currants Rovada, Orion and Olin.

2500|$|In {{professional}} wine tasting, {{there is}} generally a distinction made between [...] "aromas" [...] and a wine's [...] "bouquet" [...] while in casual wine tasting these two terms are used interchangeably. An aroma {{refers to the}} smells unique to the grape variety and are most readily demonstrated in a varietal wine—such as lychees with Gewürztraminer or <b>black</b> <b>currant</b> with Cabernet Sauvignon. These are smells that are commonly associated with a young wine. As a wine ages, chemical reactions among acids, sugars, alcohols and phenolic compounds create new smells that are known as a wine's bouquet. These can include honey in an aged Sauternes or truffles in a Pinot noir. The term bouquet can also be expanded to include the smells derived from fermentation and exposure to oak. In Burgundy, the aromas of wines are sub-divided into three categories-primary, secondary and tertiary aromas. Primary aromas are those specific to the grape variety itself. Secondary aromas are those derived from fermentation. Tertiary aromas are those that develop through either bottle or oak aging.|$|E
2500|$|The Melange {{ecoregion}} {{is characterized}} by dissected mid-elevation mountains with the complex geology typical of mélange formations. Elevation varies from 3,500to7,500feet (1,067to2,286m). The mountains are mostly blanketed in Tertiary basalt but have a core of mixed metamorphic, metavolcanic, metasedimentary, and sedimentary rocks. Soils are droughty and high in magnesium, creating a poor medium for plant growth; reforestation problems limit logging. Placer mining for gold altered the structure of many stream channels and left extensive tailings piles in riparian areas. Lithology affects soil, vegetation, and {{the quantity and quality}} of surface water, which vary across the region. Forests are dominated by Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with subalpine fir, western larch, and grand fir; elsewhere, juniper steppe woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands are found. Understory plants include mountain-mahogany, snowberry, serviceberry, grouse huckleberry, snowberry, prince’s pine, sidebells pyrola, twinflower, pinegrass, elk sedge, heartleaf arnica, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Riparian areas support mountain alder, red-twig dogwood, prickly currant, <b>black</b> <b>currant,</b> Columbia monk’s hood, and bluebells. The region covers [...] in Oregon and [...] in Idaho, including parts of the Malheur, Umatilla, and Payette national forests and lower elevations in the Strawberry Mountain, Monument Rock, and North Fork John Day Wildernesses.|$|E

40|$|The genus Ribes L., {{known as}} {{currants}} and gooseberries, {{contains more than}} 150 diverse species indigenous throughout the northern hemisphere and along the Rocky Mountain, Sierra Nevada and Sierra Madres in North America through mountain ranges of Central America to the Andes in South America. Beginning in the 1400 s, four main crop types, <b>black</b> <b>currants</b> (Ribes, subgenus: Ribes, section: Botrycarpum), red and white currants (Ribes, subgenus: Ribes, section: Ribes) and gooseberries (Ribes, subgenus: Grossularia) were domesticated from European species.
