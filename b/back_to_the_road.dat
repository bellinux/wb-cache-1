5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> with views of the gorge. A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built {{up the side of the}} gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} part of this 25 {{kilometre}} (16 mile) Blitzkrieg-like attack Watanabe, now in control of the road bridge, sent a force of three tanks under the command of Ensign Toichero Sato to explore {{the other side of the}} river. Sato travelled 4km (3 miles) before encountering more British artillery, in the form of two 4.5 inch Howitzers from the 155th Field Artillery Regiment, RA. Sato's tank opened fire on the first gun, turning it over and blocking the road. The gunners from the second gun managed to lower their barrels in time to fire on the tanks at point blank range. Sato's tank was hit and destroyed, killing him, and forcing the other two tanks in his force to retreat <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> bridge.|$|E

500|$|The team's {{fortunes}} took {{a dramatic}} turn the next day. On {{the same day}} that breakaway riders Flecha and Johnny Hoogerland were sideswiped by a car {{at the front of the}} race, Vinokourov crashed along with Jurgen Van den Broeck, Andreas Klöden, and David Zabriskie, all of whom eventually left the race due to their injuries. Vinokourov's injuries were quite clearly serious immediately [...] he could not walk <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from which he fell, needing to be held up by Di Gregorio and Grivko. He was revealed to have sustained a broken right femur. Fofonov also crashed, witnessing what took place from his position directly behind Vinokourov. He described that the race had been extremely fast, and the road wet, with Hushovd and a rider from [...] taking a line around a left-hand curve that resulted in those behind taking it much too widely and falling off the road. Vinokourov was quoted as saying [...] "I never expected such a dramatic end on the Tour de France" [...] and said that he expected the team to fight on for a stage win. He had surgery in Aurillac the next day, with the scheduled recovery time for the injury ruling him out for the remainder of the season, also meaning that it would likely end his professional career. A week later, Vinokourov indeed announced his retirement from the sport, for a second time. After his first four weeks of rehabilitation went better than anticipated, Vinokourov announced that he would ride the Giro di Lombardia before retiring. Later this plan changed, to have him ride the Chrono des Nations instead, due to the lesser risk of crashing in an individual time trial than in a hilly classic. In September, Vinokourov came out of retirement altogether and announced that he would return as an active rider in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Some crushers are {{mobile and}} can crush rocks {{as large as}} 60 inches. Primarily used in-pit at the mine face these units are able to move with the large infeed {{machines}} (mainly shovels) to increase the tonnage produced. [...] In a mobile road operation, these crushed rocks are directly combined with concrete and asphalt which are then deposited on to a road surface. [...] This removes the need for hauling oversized material to a stationary crusher and then <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface.|$|E
2500|$|The {{morning of}} 17 November came with rain and mist {{but not the}} {{expected}} Serbian attack. By 10 in the morning, Alexander ordered three battalions to advance on the right. They surprised the Danube division, who eventually rallied and pushed them back. The main Serbian attack began on the centre largely unsupported by artillery which had insufficient range. The weight of Bulgarian fire forced them back with some 1,200 casualties. A relief column led by Captain Benderev recaptured the heights {{on the right and}} forced the Danube division <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

Slowly, with many turns, they <b>backed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> where Maurie swung the ambulance around and then stopped with a jerk that drew several groans from the interior of the car.|$|R
50|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about the {{environmental}} damage moving <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> {{by some of the}} larger ferry operators that ship substantial amounts of freight and passenger traffic via these routes affected by IMO standards. They claim that MARPOL will drive up ferry costs for the consumer and freight forwarding companies pushing them back onto the European roadways as a financially more cost effective measure compared to increased ferry costs, thereby defeating the object of reducing water pollution.|$|R
2500|$|On the Confederate line to {{the east}} of the Emmitsburg Road, only {{infantry}} troops were involved. The four brigades of Hood's division, under the command of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law, had occupied the area from Round Top, through Devil's Den and <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> since the battle on July 2. Initially, Law had just the 1st Texas Infantry (from Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade) facing Farnsworth to the south, but he soon reinforced them with the 47th Alabama Infantry, the 1st South Carolina and artillery. To the west of the road, facing Merritt, was the Georgia brigade of Brig. Gen. George [...] "Tige" [...] Anderson.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the line}} of march west toward the Confederate Army's {{rendezvous}} point of Amelia Court House on Bevill's Bridge Road, Lieutenant General Anderson had the remaining men of George Pickett's and Bushrod Johnson's divisions build earthworks and form a line of battle at Tabernacle Church Road to protect the forces in retreat from attack from the pursuing Union forces to their south. Nearby, Union cavalry were working to clear a sabotaged ford on Deep Creek Road {{in an effort to}} catch up with Lee's army. The ford proved too deep for the cavalry to cross when they finished dragging away obstructions and the Union horsemen had to take a long alternate route <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> George Custer's cavalry division rode west toward Jetersville, Virginia on the Richmond and Danville Railroad, [...] southwest of Amelia Court House and [...] of Burkeville Junction, Virginia.|$|E

A third-place finish at the Kenyan 10,000 m trials earned him {{a place at the}} 2013 World Championships in Athletics, where he managed seventh position overall. After that, he was runner-up at the Valencia Half Marathon.|$|R
