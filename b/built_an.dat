5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who <b>built</b> <b>an</b> {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open.

5|$|In 1939 the {{employees}} at the PRR's Altoona, Pennsylvania, workshops <b>built</b> <b>an</b> operable replica of the locomotive for further exhibition duties, as the Smithsonian desired to keep the original locomotive in a more controlled environment.

The replica John Bull is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
