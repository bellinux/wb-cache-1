They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach.

5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who <b>built</b> <b>an</b> {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open.

Much of the present day Prospect Park neighborhood, and the areas surrounding Lake Harriet and Lake Calhoun, were developed by Menage and his companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, as World War I was ending, the Royal Air Force <b>built</b> <b>an</b> {{airfield}} for two planes, and in November the Ottomans {{retreated from}} Zor Sanjak without a fight.

However, the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the French Mandate after Syria's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 the {{employees}} at the PRR's Altoona, Pennsylvania, workshops <b>built</b> <b>an</b> operable replica of the locomotive for further exhibition duties, as the Smithsonian desired to keep the original locomotive in a more controlled environment.

The replica John Bull is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E
