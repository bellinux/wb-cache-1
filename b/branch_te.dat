40|$|We have {{synthesized}} brushlike p-Te/n-SnO 2 hierarchical heterostructures by a two-step thermal vapor transport process. The morphologies of the <b>branched</b> <b>Te</b> nanostructures can {{be manipulated}} by adjusting the source temperature or the argon flow rate. The growth of the <b>branched</b> <b>Te</b> nanotubes on the SnO 2 nanowire backbones can be ascribed to the vapor-solid (VS) growth mechanism, in which the inherent anisotropic nature of Te lattice and/or dislocations lying along the Te nanotubes axis should play critical roles. When exposed to CO and NO 2 gases at room temperature, Te/SnO 2 hierarchical heterostructures changed the resistance in the same trend and exhibited much higher responses and faster response speeds than the Te nanotube counterparts. The enhancement in gas sensing performance can be ascribed to the higher specific surface areas and formations of numerous Te/Te or TeO 2 /TeO 2 bridging point contacts and additional p-Te/n-SnO 2 heterojunctions...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{synthesized}} Te/SnO 2 hierarchical nanostructures by a {{two step}} vapor transport method {{and studied the}} effects of process parameters on their surface morphologies. We also investigated the growth mechanism of Te/SnO 2 hierarchical nanostructures by observing the structural evolution during the synthesis process. The gas sensors based on the hierarchical Te/SnO 2 nanostructures are fabricated and their sensing properties for CO and NO 2 were measured. The {{results showed that the}} hierarchical nanostructures could be formed at the second step, where the source and substrate temperatures were set at 560 ℃ and 115 ℃, respectively, and the holding time was kept at 40 min. The diameters of the secondarily <b>branched</b> <b>Te</b> nanoscreens were found to be in the range of 500 ~ 600 nm, and the lengths were several um. By XRD and TEM analysis, we can prove that the SnO 2 nanowire backbones and <b>Te</b> <b>branched</b> nanoscreens are single crystalline and have the tetragonal rutile and hexagonal structures, repectively. The growth directions of the SnO 2 nanowires and <b>Te</b> <b>branched</b> nanoscreens are determined to be along [001] and [0001], repectively. The growth mechanism of the Te/SnO 2 hierarchical nanostructures can be divided into several steps. First, Te nanoparticles and discontinuous islands are formed on SnO 2 backbone nanowires. Then these nanoparticles and islands will gradually cover backbone nanowires. In order to reduce the surface energy, these nanoparticles and islands are assembled and developed into nanosheets. With steady source gas supplied, some of the nanosheets which have certain angles respect to backbone nanowires will begin to grow out of the backbone nanowires, and gradually develop into nanoscreens. For the room-temperature gas sensing properties to CO and NO 2 gases at different concentrations, the Te/SnO 2 hierarchical nanostructures showed enhanced gas sensing performance in comparison with the film and nanotubes counterparts. It can be attributed to higher surface-to-volume ratio, more networking contact points between electrode materials, and the formation of PN junctions between the SnO 2 backbone nanowires and <b>Te</b> <b>branched</b> nanoscreens. 本研究利用兩階段氣相傳輸製程合成出Te/SnO 2 多階層奈米結構，並探討不同的製程參數其對表面形貌的影響，此外，我們還利用分段實驗觀察成長過程Te旁支奈米結構的演化來討論其成長機制，最後再將Te/SnO 2 多階層奈米結構製成氣體感測元件量測對CO與NO 2 氣體的感測特性。實驗結果發現，將第二階段原料端溫度設為 560 ℃、基板端溫度 115 ℃，持溫 40 分鐘後，可以在SnO 2 奈米線主幹上合成出長數微米，線徑約 500 ~ 600 奈米的一維Te奈米屏風狀結構。經XRD與TEM的分析，可證明SnO 2 主幹與Te奈米屏風均為單晶結構，SnO 2 奈米線主幹為正方晶系(Tetragonal) 金紅柱石(rutile) 結構，成長方向為[001]；Te奈米屏風分支為六方晶系結構，成長方向為[0001]。在成長機制方面，Te一開始在SnO 2 奈米線主幹上先形成奈米顆粒與不連續的島狀物，並逐漸包覆住奈米線主幹，之後為了要降低界面能便開始聚集形成片狀奈米結構，並與奈米線主幹產生夾角關係，隨著原料氣體穩定供應，與奈米線主幹有夾角關係的片狀結構長度持續增長並逐漸往兩側形成屏風狀結構。在氣體感測性質方面，Te/SnO 2 多階層奈米結構能在室溫下偵測CO與NO 2 。由於此種多階層奈米結構較Te一維奈米結構具有更大的比表面積、電極材料間的網狀交接點的數量也較多、加上SnO 2 奈米線主幹與Te旁支結構間的PN接面產生的載子互相擴散和能障效果，因此可得到比單純Te一維奈米結構還要高的靈敏度。目次 摘要I AbstractII 目次III 圖目次V 表目次VII 第一章、緒論 1 第二章、文獻回顧 2 2. 1 氣體感測器的重要性 2 2. 2 常見的金屬氧化物半導體感測材料與其維度發展趨勢 3 2. 3 金屬氧化物半導體氣體感測材料的工作原理 4 2. 4 金屬氧化物半導體氣體感測材料面臨的問題 5 2. 4. 1 室溫下操作 5 2. 4. 2 長期穩定性 7 2. 4. 3 氣體選擇性 8 2. 5 多階層奈米結構氣體感測器 9 2. 5. 1 多階層奈米結構 9 2. 5. 2 多階層奈米結構在氣體感測器上的應用 10 2. 6 多階層奈米結構提升氣體感測性質的機制 15 2. 7 多階層奈米結構材料的製備方法 18 2. 7. 1 水熱法 18 2. 7. 2 氣相傳輸法 18 2. 8 研究動機與目的 19 第三章、實驗方法與步驟 3. 1 實驗設計與流程 20 3. 2 基板的準備與前處理 22 3. 3 氣相傳輸法 22 3. 4 表面形貌的觀察 25 3. 5 晶體結構分析 25 3. 6 氣體感測元件製作與性質量測 25 第四章、結果與討論 4. 1 第一階段製程 27 4. 2 SnO 2 奈米線晶體結構分析 27 4. 3 製程參數對Te/SnO 2 多階層奈米結構的影響 29 4. 3. 1 原料端溫度的影響 29 4. 3. 2 基板位置的影響 31 4. 3. 3 氣體流量的影響 33 4. 3. 4 持溫時間的影響 35 4. 4 Te/SnO 2 多階層奈米結構晶體結構分析 37 4. 5 Te/SnO 2 多階層奈米結構的成長機制 38 4. 6 氣體感測性質 42 第五章、結論 46 參考文獻 4...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} direction- and wavelength-dependent {{polarization}} anisotropy in light scattering at the air-photonic crystal interface {{as a function}} of angle of incidence for TE and TM polarized light. This is done using optical reflectivity measurements at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone of a three-dimensional photonic crystal with fcc symmetry. Polarized reflectivity measurements indicate the presence of stop gap <b>branching</b> for <b>TE</b> polarization, which is absent for TM polarization till the Brewster angle at K point. In contrast, stop gap branching is present for both TE and TM polarizations at W point due to the intricate mixing of crystal planes. This characteristic behavior signifies the inevitable role of energy exchange in the stop gap branching. The measured polarization anisotropy shows a prominent shift in the Brewster angle for on-resonance wavelength as compared to the off-resonance along both K and W points, and that, in accordance with theory. Our results have implications in polarization-induced light scattering in sub-wavelength photonic structures like plasmonic crystals, and meta-materials. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{separate}} Maxwell's equations for background {{media that}} allow for both electric and magnetic time-dependence in a generalized Lorenz gauge. In a process analogous to the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) we discuss how surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) s can be created out of vacuum, via the time-dependent variation of a dielectric and magnetic insulator at a metal interface for TM and <b>TE</b> <b>branches,</b> respectively. We suggest how to extend currently proposed DCE experiments {{to set up and}} detect these excitations. Numerical simulations (without any approximation) indicate that vacuum excited SPPs can be of a similar magnitude to the photon creation rate in such experiments. Potential benefits of detecting vacuum excited SPPs, as opposed to DCE photons, are that parametric enhancement does not require a sealed cavity in the axial direction and the detection apparatus might be able to use simple phase matching techniques. For the case of constant permeability, μ, TM branch SPPs and photons do not suffer from detuning and attenuation like TE photons.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{generators}} (TEG) and coolers (TEC) {{consist of}} a plurality of n-type and p-type semiconductor TE leg elements, which can be utilized to convert heat into electricity, or conversely, create temperature gradients. The efficiency of a TE device {{is directly related to}} the material 2 ̆ 7 s dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT = S 2 σT/ K, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, sigma is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and k is the thermal conductivity. Bulk-alloy bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3) as the most widely used TE material has a room temperature ZT around unity. Recent research progress in nanostructured materials and composite materials enlightened the path to enhance the ZT above 1. Nanowire array topologies offer promise for engineering the electrical conductivity and phonon scattering effects, both of which have been studied extensively since the 1990 s. Conventional porous anodic alumina (PAA) was used for successful fabrication of Bi 2 Te 3 nanowire arrays, but with array thicknesses limited to tens of microns, too thin for high performance TE devices. The parallel nanowire arrays also suffer from mechanical fragility, low Bi 2 Te 3 volume fraction, limited thermal conductivity suppression, vulnerability to shear load and slow template fabrication. ^ In this work, I investigated the Bi 2 <b>Te</b> 3 <b>branched</b> nanowire array (BNA) topology that features nanostructure-to-bulk-like materials integration and radially modified nanowire compositions, allowing for thermal conductivity reduction, multiscale nanostructure creation, preservation of power factor, strain relaxation and shear compliance. <b>Branched</b> Bi 2 <b>Te</b> 3 nanowire arrays were fabricated from the bottom up by electrochemically depositing Bi 2 Te 3 into 300 - 500 micron thick branched porous anodic alumina (BPAA) templates followed by vapor annealing. The annealing process homogenizes the native point defects and can be used to introduce Se as an axially-graded dopant, which also forms nanocrystalline Bi 2 SeTe 2 phonon scatterers. The thickness of the nanowire array device can be fabricated up to 350 micron (wire aspect ratio 3 ̆e 1000 : 1), which is approaching commercialized bulk-form TE elements. Various characterization techniques including XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, EDS, AFM, etc. were employed to analyze the morphologic, structural and stoichiometric properties of the material. At room temperature, characterization of electrical, thermal and Seebeck properties were performed to demonstrate the device-level fabrication viability. At 300 K, thermal conductivity was measured to be 0. 5 W/m-K. Electrical conductivity was measured at ∼ 1. 43 x 104 S/m. An effective bulk ZT of 0. 31 was measured and the microscopic corrected value was 0. 39. To demonstrate the p-type TE counterpart, pulsed laser assisted electrodeposition was used to fabricate Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 nanowires. In addition, in order to calculate the optimum thermoelectric element leg length under different heat transfer conditions, a numerical model of thermoelectric device for both n- and p-type legs was developed in Matlab and powered by Rappture on nanoHUB. org. ^ The demonstration of Bi 2 <b>Te</b> 3 <b>branched</b> nanowire array structures enables a nano-to-bulk, composition-modulated and potentially scalable method to fabricate thermoelectric materials. The BNA structure maintains the nanowire electrical conduction continuity by electrochemical deposition, and offers extensive control over the wire radial composition and nanostructure. Moreover, the BNA 2 ̆ 7 s phonon scattering effect is attributed to nanowire array branching, high surface-to-volume ratios, grain boundaries, Bi 2 SeTe 2 nanocrystals and atomic alloying, covering length scales ranging from tens of microns down to less than a nanometer. Overall, the <b>branched</b> Bi 2 <b>Te</b> 3 nanowire array as a bulk-like thermoelectric material is a promising structure for enhancing the figure of merit, ZT, and has promise to lead to the development of superior engineered nanomaterials as a substitute for bulk Bi 2 Te 3 alloy materials.

40|$|Every year, {{thousand}} of surgical treatments are performed {{in order to}} fix up or completely substitute, where possible, organs or tissues affected by degenerative diseases. Patients with these kind of illnesses stay long times waiting for a donor that could replace, in a short time, the damaged organ or the tissue. The lack of biological alternates, related to conventional surgical treatments as autografts, allografts, e xenografts, led the researchers belonging to different areas to collaborate to find out innovative solutions. This research brought to a new discipline able to merge molecular biology, biomaterial, engineering, biomechanics and, recently, design and architecture knowledges. This discipline is named Tissue Engineering (TE) and it represents a step forward towards the substitutive or regenerative medicine. One of the major challenge of the TE is to design and develop, using a biomimetic approach, an artificial 3 D anatomy scaffold, suitable for cells adhesion {{that are able to}} proliferate and differentiate themselves as consequence of the biological and biophysical stimulus offered by the specific tissue to be replaced. Nowadays, powerful instruments allow to perform analysis day by day more accurateand defined on patients that need more precise diagnosis and treatments. Starting from patient specific information provided by TC (Computed Tomography) microCT and MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging), an image-based approach can be performed in order to reconstruct the site to be replaced. With the aid of the recent Additive Manufacturing techniques that allow to print tridimensional objects with sub millimetric precision, it is now possible to practice an almost complete control of the parametrical characteristics of the scaffold: {{this is the way to}} achieve a correct cellular regeneration. In this work, we focalize the attention on a <b>branch</b> of <b>TE</b> known as Bone TE, whose the bone is main subject. Bone TE combines osteoconductive and morphological aspects of the scaffold, whose main properties are pore diameter, structure porosity and interconnectivity. The realization of the ideal values of these parameters represents the main goal of this work: here we'll a create simple and interactive biomimetic design process based on 3 D CAD modeling and generative algorithmsthat provide a way to control the main properties and to create a structure morphologically similar to the cancellous bone. Two different typologies of scaffold will be compared: the first is based on Triply Periodic MinimalSurface (T. P. M. S.) whose basic crystalline geometries are nowadays used for Bone TE scaffolding; the second is based on using Voronoi's diagrams and they are more often used in the design of decorations and jewellery for their capacity to decompose and tasselate a volumetric space using an heterogeneous spatial distribution (often frequent in nature). In this work, we will show how to manipulate the main properties (pore diameter, structure porosity and interconnectivity) of the design TE oriented scaffolding using the implementation of generative algorithms: "bringing back the nature to the nature". ...|$|R
