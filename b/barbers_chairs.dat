50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, US-based <b>barber</b> <b>chair</b> {{manufactures}} sold about 10,000 chairs {{a year to}} the 100,000 barber shops. Chicago-based Emil J. Paidar Company was a leading manufacturer of <b>barber</b> <b>chairs</b> in the late 1950s (Belmont and American <b>Barber</b> <b>Chair</b> Company from 1948 to 1956 whose chairs were spinoffs of the Koken chair). Starting in 1957, Belmont joined Osaka, Japan's Takara Belmont Company began importing almost exact duplicates of Paidar chairs—at 20%-30% less cost. In June 1969 Takara purchased the Koken <b>Barber</b> <b>Chair</b> building and production equipment in St. Louis Mo and in 1970 they purchased the Koken name, trademarks and patents this purchase was the main reason that by 1970, Takara had 70% of the US market, beating out Paidar who once held the same amount.|$|R
