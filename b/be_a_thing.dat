25|$|If it were {{possible}} for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages {{at the expense of}} profits.|$|E

It {{is one of the few}} Heinlein novels which intersperses his typical linear {{narrative}} structure with a series of flashbacks. These flashbacks are frequently to Rico's History and Moral Philosophy course in school, in which the teacher discusses the history of the structure of their society. Rico is depicted as a man of Filipino ancestry, although there has been disagreement on this matter among fans. He is from a wealthy family, whose members had never served in the army. Rico's ancestry is depicted to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of no consequence; the society he lives in appears to have abandoned racial and gender-based prejudice.|$|E

500|$|The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 {{provide that}} the English and Welsh {{languages}} be treated on {{a basis of}} equality, and both are used as working languages within the National Assembly. Both English and Welsh are considered official languages of Wales, with Welsh further recognised in law as having [...] "official status". English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language {{in most of the}} country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [...] "Wenglish" [...] is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has [...] "been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh". Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh is recognised to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past.|$|E

[...] " [...] just a world where people love people for who they are and not what they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters. It is representative of the world that we live in today, but it also doesn't make it out to be this statement—it's not a social/cultural statement," [...] she said.

During Gandhi's time in office, public sector telecom companies MTNL and VSNL was developed. According to Pitroda, Gandhi's ability to resist pressure from multi-national companies {{to abandon his}} plan to spread telecommunication services {{has been an important}} factor in India's development. According to news website Oneindia, [...] "About 20 years ago telephones were considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> {{for the use of the}} rich, but credit goes to Rajiv Gandhi for taking them to the rural masses". Pitroda also said their plan to expand India's telephone network succeeded because of Gandhi's political support. According to Pitroda, by 2007 they were [...] "adding six million phones every month". Gandhi's government also allowed the import of fully assembled motherboards, which led to the price of computers being reduced. According to some commentators, [...] the seed for the information technology (IT) revolution was also planted during Rajiv Gandhi’s time. As Prime Minister he set up the National Informatics Centre and made it easier to import computers while setting up Technology Missions that today provide communication to each village across the country.|$|E
