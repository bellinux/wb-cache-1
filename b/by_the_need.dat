CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|Achilles, {{named after}} the Greek mythological hero, was ordered on 10 April 1861 from the Chatham Dockyard. She was the first iron-hulled warship to be built at a royal {{dockyard}} and her construction was delayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to acquire the necessary machinery to handle iron and to train the workers to use it. The ship was laid down on 1 August 1861 in a drydock and was floated out rather than being launched on 23 December 1863. Achilles was completed on 26 November 1864 {{at the cost of}} £469,572.|$|E

5|$|The LS3/5A is {{a commercially}} {{produced}} loudspeaker driven <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> of the BBC {{to monitor and}} assess broadcast programme quality. It {{was derived from the}} LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{collectivization}} {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, as well as <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} was driven <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive.

Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E
5|$|After showing {{interest}} {{in natural sciences}} in his youth, he studied at the University of Innsbruck. However, his university career was interrupted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to complete military service. He was stationed as a translator in eastern Europe during World War II, before being captured {{and placed in a}} prisoner of war camp. He was released in 1948, subsequently returning to Innsbruck to complete his studies. After completing his doctorate in 1950, Moser worked in England for six months, researching the symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi. Upon his return to Austria, he took up a position with the Federal Forestry Research Institute, where he remained until 1968, taking part in influential research on the use of mycorrhizal fungi in reforestation. He began lecturing at the University of Innsbruck in 1956, and in 1972 he became the inaugural head of the first Institute of Microbiology in Austria. He remained with the Institute until his retirement in 1991. His studies continued until his death in 2002. An influential mycologist, he received a number of awards throughout his life, and numerous fungal taxa have been named in his honour.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to keep the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming {{that many of those}} first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Design 1047, {{also known}} as Project 1047, {{was a series of}} plans for a class of Dutch battlecruisers prior to the Second World War. The ships were {{intended}} to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, leaving heavy and light cruisers, along with seaplane carriers, as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies. As such, the 1047s were shaped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to be able to fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers. It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{appears as}} a {{character}} in several modern plays and films. He is a central character in James Goldman's 1966 play The Lion in Winter, set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king although, as Goldman acknowledges, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional. The Lion in Winter {{has proved to be}} an enduring representation of Henry, being turned into an Academy-Award-winning film and remade in 2003 for television. Henry also appears in the play Becket by Jean Anouilh, filmed in 1964; once again, however, the character of the King is deliberately fictitious, driven <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for drama between Henry and Becket in the play. The Becket controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and Becket form the basis both {{for a discussion of the}} more superficial events of Becket's death, and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.|$|E

5|$|In 550, {{together}} with his younger brother Justinian, he joined their father in his expedition against Ostrogoth Italy, but Germanus died suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 550, before the army had left the Balkans, where it was assembling. After this, Justinian and Germanus's son-in-law, John, led the army towards Salona (modern Split, Croatia), where the eunuch Narses assumed command in late 551. In early 551, Justin was attached to a force under the eunuch Scholasticus that campaigned against a Slavic raid in the eastern Balkans. The Byzantines were initially defeated near Adrianople but went on to score a victory, after which the Slavs left Byzantine lands. In early 552, Justin and Justinian were placed at the head of another expedition against a Slavic raid against Illyricum, but their forces were too small to confront the raiders directly. Instead, the brothers had to content themselves with harassing them. Shortly after, they were ordered north to assist the Lombards against the Gepids along with Aratius, Suartuas, and Amalafridas, but the Byzantines were detained from advancing too far north <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to suppress religious strife in the city of Ulpiana.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The decision to use firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E
