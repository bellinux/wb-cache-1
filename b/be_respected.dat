5|$|Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury). Mahavira {{taught that}} every living being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} and it should <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> just as one expects one's own sanctity and dignity to <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b> Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The concept applies to action, speech, and thought.|$|E
5|$|Other critics emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and {{the opposite of}} Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b>|$|E

The patient's participation in his or her treatment is a right, not an obligation, and although reduced involvement may result in less-than-optimal pain management, such choices should <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b>|$|E

5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b> Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
5|$|In February 1989 {{one hundred}} {{construction}} workers were assembling temporary housing {{for themselves in}} Leninakan {{with a plan to}} start on the local population's housing {{by the end of the}} month, though schools and factories were also on the list of facilities to be rebuilt. Deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes like those in the United States were being drafted (along with a strict requirement that the new protocols <b>be</b> <b>respected)</b> and that the new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with the highest seismic risk. Other officials decided that the town would be relocated several miles to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

5|$|The New-York Tribune {{reported}} in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5million offer for Moreno alone, {{which would have}} netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12million). The United States, worried that its neutrality would not <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did. Similarly, news outlets {{reported in}} late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of Rio de Janeiro, but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell {{one or both of}} the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin {{believed}} that the breakout of European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of Béla Kun's communist government in Hungary in March 1919, followed by the communist government in Bavaria and various revolutionary socialist uprisings {{in other parts of}} Germany, including that of the Spartacus League. During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, all of which were officially independent of Russia, while further east it {{led to the creation of}} communist governments in Georgia, and then in Outer Mongolia. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should <b>be</b> <b>respected,</b> but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the de facto authority of Sovnarkom.|$|E

5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b> After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Three bills {{directing}} {{that the}} battleships be sold were {{introduced into the}} Argentine National Congress {{in the summer of}} 1914, but all were defeated. Still, soon after the beginning of the First World War, the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State Department that Britain's Royal Navy was going to take over the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate, and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country (as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany). Italy, the Ottomans, and Greece were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro. The United States, worried that its neutrality would not <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> and its technology would be released for study to a foreign competitor, put diplomatic pressure on Argentina to keep the ships, which it eventually did.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1374, Louis granted various {{concessions}} to the Polish nobility by the Privilege of Koszyce, {{in exchange for their}} promise that a daughter of his would succeed him and that he, Elizabeth or his mother could indicate which one. In Hungary, he focused on the centralization of power as means of ensuring that his daughters' rights would <b>be</b> <b>respected.</b> Securing marriage to one of the princesses was a priority in European royal courts. Mary was scarcely one year old when she was promised to Sigismund of Luxembourg. In 1374, Catherine was betrothed to Louis of France, but died towards the end of 1378. The same year, Hedwig, promised to William of Austria in a sponsalia de futuro, left her mother's court and moved to Vienna, where she spent the next two years. The Polish lords swore to uphold Mary's rights in 1379, while Sigismund received this recognition three years later. Elizabeth was present, along with her husband and mother-in-law, at a meeting in Zólyom on 12 February 1380, whereby Hungarian lords confirmed Hedwig's Austrian match; this indicates that Louis may have intended to leave Hungary to Hedwig and William.|$|E
