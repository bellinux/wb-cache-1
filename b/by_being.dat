5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the Smithsonian Institution spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is diurnal and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the black rat but possibly also the Indian mongoose, {{is thought to be}} a factor. Graves points out that {{there is little evidence that}} habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected <b>by</b> <b>being</b> near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected <b>by</b> <b>being</b> near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E

5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either <b>by</b> <b>being</b> unfiltered, or <b>by</b> <b>being</b> filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E

5|$|Vowel length. The {{pronunciation}} of {{long and}} short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long vowel has about 208% {{the length of a}} short vowel. In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables <b>by</b> <b>being</b> only 71% as long and <b>by</b> <b>being</b> centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|E
