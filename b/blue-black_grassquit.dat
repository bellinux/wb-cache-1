50|$|The <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquit</b> (Volatinia jacarina) {{is a small}} bird in the tanager family, Thraupidae. It was {{previously}} classified in the bunting and American sparrow family, Emberizidae. It breeds from southern Mexico through Central America, and South America as far as northern Chile, Argentina and Paraguay, and on Trinidad and Tobago. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Volatinia.|$|E
50|$|Birds of the Veracruz dry forests {{include the}} sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus), merlin (Falco columbarius), white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), lesser {{roadrunner}} (Geococcyx velox), Mexican sheartail (Doricha eliza), Couch's kingbird (Tyrannus couchii), Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceous), magnolia warbler (Dendroia magnolia), and <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquit</b> (Vilatinia jacarina). The area {{is rich in}} herpetofauna such as the black-spotted newt (Notophthalmus meridionalis), and Tabasco mud turtle (Kinosternon acutum).|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquits</b> are 10.2 cm {{long and}} weigh 9.3 g. They have a slender conical black bill. The male is glossy blue-black, {{with a black}} tail and wings; the white inner underwing is visible in flight or display. Female and {{immature}} birds have brown upperparts and dark-streaked buff underparts.|$|R
40|$|Iridescent {{coloration}} {{plays an}} important role in the visual communication system of many animal taxa. It is known that iridescent structural colours result from layers of materials with different refractive indexes, which in feathers usually are keratin, melanin and air. However, the role of these materials in the production of structural iridescent coloration is still poorly documented. Despite the great interspecific variation in the organization of such structures in bird plumage, melanin layers are usually considered too opaque, suggesting its main role is to delineate the outermost keratin layer and absorb incoherently scattered stray light. We combined spectrometry, electron microscopy and thin-film optical modelling to describe the UV-reflecting iridescent colour of feather barbules of male <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquits</b> (Volatinia jacarina), characterized by a keratin layer overlying a single melanin layer. Our models indicate that both the keratin and the melanin layers are essential for production of the observed colour, influencing the coherent scattering of light. The melanin layer in some barbules may be thin enough to allow interaction with the underlying keratin; however, individuals usually have, on an average, the minimum number of granules that optimizes absorbance by this layer. Also, we show that altering optical properties of the materials resulted in better-fitting models relative to the empirically measured spectra. These results add to previous findings concerning the influence of melanin in single-layer iridescence, and stress the importance of considering natural variation when characterizing such photonic structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{handicap}} principle {{proposes that}} male sexual ornaments and displays provide honest indicators of quality. Female preference for high-quality males, however, may be driven {{not only by}} genetic benefits but also by indirect benefits. We investigated the impact of parasitism on morphological, ornamental, and behavioral characteristics {{of male and female}} <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquits</b> (Volatinia jacarina) in captivity. First, we tested whether male displays and morphology were influenced by parasitism. Second, we assessed if females were attentive to variation in male morphology and displays linked to parasitism. Third, we tested whether parasitism in females influenced health and mate preferences. We maintained 2 groups of birds in captivity: nonmedicated birds developed high levels of coccidian parasitism, whereas medicated birds were free of parasitism. Parasitized males developed, relative to nonparasitized males, lower weight/tarsus indices and mass. They also showed relative deficiencies in their displays, with less persistence and lower rates. Despite the negative effects of parasitism on males, females did not prefer nonparasitized males. This held for both parasitized and nonparasitized females. Our data suggest that coccidian parasitism has adverse effects on morphological condition and expression of displays. These effects, however, appear not to be attended to by females; moreover, female mate preferences appear not to be impacted by the threat of parasitism. It thus seems that female mate preferences may not depend only on sexual characters affected by parasitism in this species. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{these might}} not be {{monophyletic}} relatives, and warrant the splitting off of some species or merging this genus in another. Phylogenetic studies have hitherto failed to place this genus firmly {{with respect to a}} large number of species in the group called [...] "Tholospiza", which typically build nests covered by a dome of material. This group consists of radiations out of Central America, into the Caribbean and into the Pacific. The latter group of these American sparrow-like tanagers are the famous Darwin's finches (including the Cocos finch, Pinaroloxias inornata). The former group includes the Caribbean bullfinches (Loxigilla), the Saint Lucia black finch (Melanospiza richardsoni), the yellow-shouldered grassquit (Loxipasser anoxanthus) [...] - [...] though not the <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquit</b> (Volatinia jacarina) [...] - , and probably other Caribbean genera too (e.g. orangequit, Euneornis campestris and the puzzling bananaquit, Coereba flaveola).|$|E
40|$|The {{song of the}} <b>Blue-black</b> <b>Grassquit</b> Volatinia jacarina is {{different}} for every individual and the structural differences between individuals are quite complex. Samples of songs from different Brazilian localities, {{as well as from}} Venezuela and Mexico, were studied through a comparative analysis of their sonograms. From the structural point of view, the results show a song composed of a single note that is compacted in a ''window'' between 2 and 13 kHz and rarely occupying more than half of a second. The note is essentially pure and is repeatedly uttered {{with a high level of}} fidelity. A global frequency modulation decreases from the beginning to the end of the song. The main song components are referred to as ''Blocks'' and are of three types: ''Vibrations'' (Buzzes or Vibratos), ''Arabesques'' (complex notes) and ''Isolated Modulations'' (simple syllables). Among other characteristics are double voices, which are quite diverse and probably function as codes for individual recognition. This song is considered a special case where a signature system has been developed to a high level of inter-individual variability...|$|E
40|$|During the {{reproductive}} season <b>Blue-black</b> <b>grassquit</b> (Volatinia jacarina) males {{are found in}} clusters, wherein they exhibit a distinctive display that consists of repeated, vertical leaps while simultaneously producing a brief vocalization. The main objective {{of this study was}} to describe details of the species' reproductive behavior in a "Cerrado" area of central Brazil and compare these data with some studies carried out in other areas. The data obtained concerning different aspects of nesting, laying and hatching were generally similar to those obtained in previous studies in other areas. However, we found that the typical clutch size of two eggs per nest is lower, and egg and nestling mortality rates higher in our area than what has been reported elsewhere. Our results suggest that males differ in time expended with different activities according to their reproductive condition and also provide extensive parental care. We found that display execution rates peak in the early morning and in the late afternoon and are higher in the middle of the breeding season. We also found that there is an inverse relation between the height of the display leap and the height of the perch...|$|E
40|$|Mate {{choice is}} a primary {{mechanism}} driving the evolution of sexually selected traits such as elabo-rate displays and ornaments. In a majority of taxa studied to date, females are seen to actively sampleand evaluate multiple males, presumably to optimize mating opportunities. During this process femalesmay encounter males both familiar and novel, a distinction that might influence how mate choice pro-ceeds. Using a socially monogamous passerine, the <b>blue-black</b> <b>grassquit</b> (Volatinia jacarina), we studiedhow females respond to novel versus familiar (“paired”) males, and how encounters with novel malesinfluence subsequent interactions with their paired males. Additionally, we measured the hormonalresponse of males after visualizing their paired females interacting with novel males. We found thatfemales were attentive to novel males irrespective of these males’ phenotypic attributes, suggesting thatin these interactions novelty is highly relevant. After exposure to novel males, females tended to respondaggressively towards their paired males; by contrast, the behaviour of males towards their paired femalesdid not change. Moreover, we did not detect any hormonal responses of males to viewing their pairedfemales interacting with novel males. Together {{these results suggest that}} the distinction between famil-iarity and novelty may hold special relevance for females in mate choice, a finding that bears upon ourunderstanding of the evolution of extra-pair paternity and reproductive behaviour.

40|$|Bird-window {{collisions}} are {{a dramatic}} cause of bird mortality globally. In Latin America, statistics are generally very scarce and/or inaccessible so {{the frequency of}} such incidents is still poorly understood. Nevertheless, civilians have applied preventive methods (e. g. adhesive bird-of-prey decals) sparsely but, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated their effectiveness in Brazil. Here, we estimated the mortality rate of bird-window collisions and tested the effectiveness of bird-of-prey decals at preventing such accidents. We undertook daily searches for bird carcasses, presumably resulting from window collisions, near all buildings on a university campus over seven months. Adhesive bird-of-prey decals were then applied to the two buildings with the highest mortality rates and surveys continued for over 12 more months. The mortality rates {{before and after the}} application of decals and between seasons were then compared using Friedman test. We recorded 36 collisions, 29 around the two buildings with the highest collision rates 19 prior and 10 after our intervention with associated collision rates of 0. 08 and 0. 04 collisions/day. Although mortality was reduced by almost half, this difference was not statistically significant. The <b>Blue-black</b> <b>grassquit,</b> Volatinia jacarina (Linnaeus, 1766), and Ruddy ground dove, Columbina talpacoti (Temminck, 1810) suffered the highest number of collisions, followed by the Rufous-collared sparrow, Zonotrichia capensis (P. L. Statius Müller, 1776). Our bird-of-prey decals and efforts were insufficient to prevent or dramatically reduce the number of bird-window collisions. Therefore, we recommend that different interventions be used and additional long-term studies undertaken on their efficacy...|$|E
