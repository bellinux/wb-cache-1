Specifically, results shown in this section are with ACI, and results shown in Section 3 are without ACI. The simulation parameters are specified in Table  1, if not otherwise indicated. To {{examine the effects of}} ACI on a given receiver, consider two transmitters: one transmitter is desired and generates the desired signal, and the other transmitter is not desired and generates ACI. Presented in this section are the following three scenarios. In the first scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another PU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU. In the second scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another SU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PU.

5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves {{got a sense of}} <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E

5|$|English Salukis (chiefly {{descendants}} of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, {{but by the}} mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal – just {{enough to keep the}} breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanized entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels survived the war, and along with fresh imports <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began again.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium {{published}} a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris {{in the section}} Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. Unique to the section, all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma. The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different clade within the Sterculioideae.|$|E

These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, the stairs, some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|Of all Serbian epic or {{historical}} figures, Marko {{is considered to}} have given the most inspiration to visual artists; a monograph on the subject lists 87 authors.

An 18th-century drawing of Marko {{is found in the}} Čajniče Gospels, a medieval parchment manuscript <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Serbian Orthodox church in Čajniče in eastern Bosnia. The drawing is simple, unique in depicting Marko as a saint and reminiscent of stećci reliefs.

5|$|Subfossil {{bones of}} the Mascarene grey parakeet found on Mauritius were first {{described}} in 1973 as <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> smaller relative of the broad-billed parrot in the genus Lophopsittacus. Apart from their size, the bones were {{very similar to those}} of other Mascarene parrots. The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey parrots on Mauritius and Réunion, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus Psittacula.|$|E

Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition.
