5|$|On 4 July 1941, Edwards led a {{daylight}} attack ("Operation Wreckage") {{against the}} port of Bremen, {{one of the most}} heavily defended towns in Germany. Edwards' force of twelve Blenheims attacked at a height of about 50 feet through telephone wires and high voltage power lines. The bombers successfully penetrated fierce anti-aircraft fire and a dense balloon barrage, but further fire over the port itself resulted in the loss of four of the attacking force. Edwards brought his remaining aircraft safely back, although all had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> and his own Blenheim (serial V6028) had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> over 20 times. His actions in the raid earned him the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Targeting bore little {{resemblance}} to reality in that the sequence of attacks was uncoordinated and the targets were approved randomly – even illogically. The North's airfields, which, according to any rational targeting policy, should have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> first in the campaign, were also off-limits.|$|E
5|$|Brian McCoy was {{the first}} to die, having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> in the back by nine rounds from a 9mm Luger pistol in the initial volley of gunfire. Fran O'Toole {{attempted}} to run away, but was quickly chased down by the gunmen who had immediately jumped down into the field in pursuit. He was then machine-gunned 22 times, mostly in the face, as he lay supine on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Thus tennis shots can be {{categorized}} according to when they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> (serve, groundstroke, volley, half volley), how they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> (smash, forehand, backhand, flat, side spin, block, slice, topspin shot), or where they <b>are</b> <b>hit</b> (lob, passing shot, dropshot, cross-court shot, down-the-line shot).|$|R

5|$|Geißhardt, who {{was flying}} Fw 190 A-4 (Werknummer 7051—factory number) in Priller's Schwarm, was {{severely}} wounded in combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress of the 306th Bomb Group on 5 April 1943. He had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by the defensive {{fire from the}} bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but managed to make a smooth landing on the airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries {{early the next morning}} on 6 April 1943.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012 the Israeli {{government}} set {{up another}} inquiry {{at the request}} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. In May 2013 it published a 44-page report concluding that the al-Durrahs had not <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by IDF fire and may not have been shot at all.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{experiences}} {{at least one}} minor earthquake per day on average, and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity. During the last 100years, Iran has <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by more than 130events stronger than magnitude5, with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360, 1703, 1884, 1897, 1902, and 1905. The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper crust, close to the surface, {{which means that they}} are potentially more destructive.|$|E
5000|$|One-handed backhands should <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> more {{in front}} of the body than the forehand, which allows them to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> with a deeper hit spot.|$|R

50|$|The fiery Jennings {{was also}} {{known as one of}} the most fearless players of his time, {{allowing}} himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches more than any other player. In one game, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch three times. In 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was unconscious for three days.|$|R
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these had she been underway, and if she had <b>been</b> <b>hit,</b> damage control teams would have kept the ship afloat.|$|E
5|$|Starting in April 2012, Iran's {{consumers}} have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> {{with a wave}} of rising prices that has now touched laundry detergent and food items such as cooking oil, rice, eggs and dairy products. Since April 2012, the price of food and other consumer products have risen between 10 and 20% in some cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E
5000|$|Housemates can <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> (figuratively) with a {{poisonous}} arrow. Big Brother will {{decide to do}} something to the housemate who <b>was</b> <b>hit.</b> For instance, in the Week 1, Ema <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> with {{a poisonous}} arrow by Duško (who was evicted from the main house to the Dumps). Big Brother then decided to take away all the personal stuff from Ema. In Week 2, Bojana <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by an arrow (which was shot by Soraja) and had to do all of the house chores by herself.|$|R

5|$|The {{track of}} Tropical Storm Gert was {{slightly}} {{more to the}} north than the National Hurricane Center's initial predictions, giving the storm more time to develop. As a result, the NHC predicted that Gert could intensify further, but this did not occur. The primary emphasis of the forecasts was on the impact the rainfall from Gert could cause, particularly on this area of Mexico, which had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> previously in the season by other hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro {{increased}} speed, {{but she had}} <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by two to four torpedoes, {{and after}} two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45 degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.|$|E
5|$|According to the London Naval Treaty, {{the ship}} was {{to be removed from}} front-line service. To this end, she had her main battery guns removed and she was {{converted}} into a radio-controlled target ship. She was redesignated AG-16, and served in this capacity after 1931. In the mid-1930s, she was rebuilt again, as an anti-aircraft gunnery training ship. In 1941, additional anti-aircraft guns were installed to increase her training capacity. Later in 1941, she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor. She was present in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941; after having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by two torpedoes, she capsized and sank. A few years later, the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island, where the wreck remains today.|$|E

50|$|Jachigi is a {{game where}} a long stick and two short sticks <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> and caught. First, a {{circular}} hole is dug on the ground, and a circle is drawn on the outside. After placing a short stick around {{the outside of the}} hole, it <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> with the long stick, and the rebounding stick (the short one that <b>was</b> just <b>hit),</b> <b>is</b> <b>hit</b> again with the long stick in mid-air, sending it flying far away.|$|R
5|$|Banks {{made what}} he {{believed}} to be three of the best saves {{of his career in}} a Stoke shirt. In the first instance he saved and caught a powerful and well-placed header from Manchester City's Wyn Davies from just eight yards out; in the second case he saved a Francis Lee header at Maine Road; and he made his third great save for the club by catching a volley from Tottenham Hotspur's Alan Gilzean that had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> from just six yards out at White Hart Lane.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going as she had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{his course}} at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8 September with orchitis. Discharged on 6 October, he served briefly as a flying {{instructor}} with No.22 Squadron RFC, {{before returning to}} No.1 Squadron. McNamara flew with CFlight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams. On his first sortie, a reconnaissance mission over Sinai, McNamara was unaware that his plane had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by anti-aircraft fire; he returned to base with his engine's oil supply almost exhausted. Flying B.E.2s and Martinsydes, he undertook further scouting and bombing missions in the ensuing months.|$|E

5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|For the Viet Cong, the Battle of Ap Bac {{marked the}} first time they stood and fought a large South Vietnamese formation—despite being outnumbered by more than five to one. Against {{overwhelming}} odds, the Viet Cong had achieved their first de facto victory; they had successfully held off well-equipped ARVN forces supported by artillery and armored units as well as by American airpower. Viet Cong casualties were limited to 18 soldiers killed and 39 wounded, even though their positions had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by more than 600 rounds of artillery, napalm and other ordnance released by 13 warplanes and five UH-1 gunships.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, RSP studied natural phenomena such as volcanoes, instead of relying on archived footage of atomic blasts, and recreated the effects digitally. They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> by poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E
