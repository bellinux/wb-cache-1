500|$|Beagles {{are used}} as sniffer dogs for termite {{detection}} in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection. Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital. In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number. [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} 2010 Haiti earthquake, a Beagle search and rescue dog with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the Hôtel Montana, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble. Beagles were hired by New York City to help with <b>bedbug</b> detection, while the role of such dogs in this type of detection may have doubts.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>bedbugs</b> {{were almost}} {{eradicated}} in the North America {{through the use}} of DDT and organophosphates, populations of <b>bedbugs</b> resistant to both have developed. The use of DDT for this purpose was banned, and its reintroduction would not offer {{a solution to the problem}} of <b>bedbugs,</b> due to resistance. Pyrethroids became more commonly used against <b>bedbugs,</b> but resistant populations have now developed to this as well.|$|R
25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} <b>bedbugs</b> in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the <b>bedbugs</b> as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find <b>bedbugs</b> scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the <b>bedbugs,</b> the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|R

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger noted [...] "I use {{the phrase}} 'funny forgives a lot' in my 30 Rock reviews when an episode fails to cohere but is still entertaining. [...] That changed with 'Audition Day', which still wasn't 30 Rock at its peak but which had one perfect, hilarious sequence that almost singlehandedly redeemed the episode for me." [...] He enjoyed Jack's scene in the subway, calling it [...] "the funniest moment" [...] from the episode, and [...] "one of the funniest things Alec Baldwin has done on the show in a long time". TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote {{that he did not}} enjoy Jack's plot, explaining that the <b>bedbug</b> bit [...] "got to be a little too much", and much preferred Jenna and Tracy's storyline [...] "because it fit in with the auditioning plot." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this was an [...] "amusing episode overall", and was glad that it gave Scott Adsit's Pete [...] "something to do" [...] here. Los Angeles Timess Meredith Blake was favorable towards [...] "Audition Day", writing it was a [...] "fine return to form", following the airing of [...] "Stone Mountain", which she disliked. IGN contributor Robert Canning said this episode of 30 Rock had fun, comedic chaos, and that it [...] "worked well, but never quite reached the hilarity tipping point." [...] He disliked that Brian Williams' cameo was ruined by the promos [...] "because the surprise of the bit would have been far funnier than what the bit actually turned out to be." [...] Canning said the auditions were [...] "fun, though not a complete knockout", enjoyed the fact that Kathy participated in the auditions and her Susan Boyle reference [...] "had great timing", and was [...] "let down" [...] by the revelation that Jayden was psychotic, noting it [...] "eemed like a bit of a cop out to the story as a whole." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave this episode an 8.2 out of 10 rating.|$|E

2500|$|Méliès began {{shooting}} {{his first}} films in May 1896, and screening {{them at the}} Théâtre Robert-Houdin by that August. At the end of 1896 he and Reulos founded the Star Film Company, with Korsten acting as his primary camera operator. Many of his earliest films were copies and remakes of the Lumière brothers' films, made {{to compete with the}} 2000 daily customers of the Grand Café. This included his first film Playing Cards, which is similar to an early Lumière film. However, many of his other early films reflected Méliès' knack for theatricality and spectacle, such as A Terrible Night, in which a hotel guest is attacked by a giant <b>bedbug.</b> But more importantly, the Lumière brothers had dispatched camera operators across the world to document it as ethnographic documentarians, intending their invention to be highly important in scientific and historical study. Méliès' Star Film Company, on the other hand, was geared more towards the [...] "fairground clientele" [...] who wanted his specific brand of magic and illusion: art.|$|E
