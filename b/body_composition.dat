40|$|Abstract Background It is {{well known}} that excess {{adiposity}} during childhood may influence pubertal development. However, the extent to which <b>body</b> <b>compositions</b> vary in throughout puberty in boys and girls is currently unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether obesity and <b>body</b> <b>compositions</b> correlate with the timing of puberty in boys and girls. Methods By random cluster sampling, our study analyzed data from 1472 students (690 girls, 782 boys) aged 6 – 17  years from two schools in the Chongqing area. Data were collected by physical examination of weight, height, and skinfold thicknesses. Testicular volume was measured in boys and breast development in girls. By which we got the indicators of obesity, timing of puberty and <b>body</b> <b>compositions.</b> Probit regression analysis was used to group subjects into early puberty (>P 25), on-time puberty (P 25  ~ P 75), and delayed puberty (  0. 05). Conclusions In girls, delayed puberty was negatively correlated with Obesity, percentage of body fat, fat mass and fat-free mass, and positively correlated with body density. But in boys, delayed puberty was only negatively correlated with Obesity, the relation between puberty and <b>body</b> <b>compositions</b> was not found...|$|R

25|$|The ash {{remaining}} represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because {{the weight}} of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in <b>body</b> <b>composition</b> (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect {{the weight of}} cremated remains, {{the weight of the}} remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.|$|E

Still, a low GI diet, in which a significant part of total carbohydrates are obtained from fruit, vegetables, and whole-grain sources, has resulted in greater menstrual regularity than a macronutrient-matched healthy diet.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{and being}} {{underweight}} {{are more common}} in the elderly than in adults of other ages. If elderly people are healthy and active, the aging process alone does not usually cause malnutrition. However, changes in <b>body</b> <b>composition,</b> organ functions, adequate energy intake and ability to eat or access food are associated with aging, and may contribute to malnutrition. Sadness or depression can play a role, causing changes in appetite, digestion, energy level, weight, and well-being. A study on the relationship between malnutrition and other conditions in the elderly found that malnutrition in the elderly can result from gastrointestinal and endocrine system disorders, loss of taste and smell, decreased appetite and inadequate dietary intake. Poor dental health, ill-fitting dentures, or chewing and swallowing problems can make eating difficult. As a result of these factors, malnutrition is seen to develop more easily in the elderly.|$|E

Class-based political requirements steered artists toward crafts, and the designing of household or industrial goods. There was significant pressure in this respect by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, that in 1926, 1927, and 1928, required a student <b>body</b> <b>composition</b> [...] "of worker and peasant origins", and several demands for [...] "working class" [...] elements. This push for design economy resulted in a tendency towards working, functional designs with minimised luxuries.

The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production, although they cultivated a factory aesthetic—Popova, Stepanova, and Tatlin even designed worker's industrial apparel.

In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on <b>body</b> <b>composition,</b> size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance".
