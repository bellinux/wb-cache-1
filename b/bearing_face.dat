50|$|Tapered roller thrust {{bearings}} consist of small tapered rollers arranged {{so that their}} axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and {{the diameter of the}} wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the <b>bearing</b> <b>face</b> without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture.|$|E
40|$|Six {{photoelastic}} {{frozen stress}} models of I S 0 nut-bolt connections loaded in pure tension were studied. Four {{of these models}} had modifications to the threads at the load bearing end of the nut. These modifications included tapered truncation of the thread crests and taper of the whole thread form {{for a portion of}} the nut length. The maximum stress in the bolt always occurred within one pitch of the load <b>bearing</b> <b>face</b> of the nut. Truncating threads increased the maximum bolt stresses. Tapering the whole thread form reduced the maximum stress and produced a more uniform load distribution in the bolt. The conditions at the load <b>bearing</b> <b>face</b> of the nut were found to influence the load distribution in the bolt threads more than the stress concentrations in the bolt. ...|$|E
40|$|A gas {{lubricated}} bearing {{model is}} derived which {{is appropriate for}} a very small <b>bearing</b> <b>face</b> separation by including velocity slip boundary conditions and centrifugal inertia effects. The bearing dynamics are examined when an external harmonic force is imposed on the bearing due to bearing begin situated within a larger complex dynamical system. A compressible Reynolds equation is formulated for the gas film which is coupled to the bearing structure through an axial force balance where the rotor and stator correspond to spring-mass-damper systems. Surface slip boundary conditions are derived on the bearing faces, characterised by the slip length parameter. The coupled bearing system is analysed using a stroboscopic map solver with the modified Reynolds equation and structural equations solved simultaneously. For a sufficiently large forcing amplitude a apping motion of the bearing faces is induced when the rotor and stator are in close proximity. The minimum bearing gap over the time period of the external forcing is examined {{for a range of}} bearing parameters...|$|E
5000|$|When {{a roller}} or ball is heavily loaded, fluid {{bearings}} have clearances that change less under load (are [...] "stiffer") than mechanical bearings. It might seem that bearing stiffness, as with maximum design load, {{would be a}} simple function of average fluid pressure and the bearing surface area. In practice, when bearing surfaces are pressed together, the fluid outflow is constricted. This significantly increases {{the pressure of the}} fluid between the <b>bearing</b> <b>faces.</b> As fluid <b>bearing</b> <b>faces</b> can be comparatively larger than rolling surfaces, even small fluid pressure differences cause large restoring forces, maintaining the gap.|$|R

40|$|An {{incompressible}} fluid flow {{model for a}} thin-film thrust bearing with slip flow is derived, leading to a modified Reynolds equation for a highly rotating rotor that incorporates a slip length shear condition on the bearing faces, extending previous bearing studies for new bearing applications associated with decreasing film thickness. Mathematical and numerical modelling {{is applied to the}} coupled process of the pressurized fluid flow through the bearing, with a Navier slip condition replacing a no-slip condition, and the axial motion of the rotor and stator. The derived modified Reynolds equation is coupled with the dynamic motion of the stator through the pressure exerted by the fluid film, with explicit analytical expressions for the pressure and force determined and the equation for the bearing gap reduced to a non-linear second-order non-autonomous ordinary differential equation. A mapping solver is used to investigate the time-dependent bearing gap for prescribed periodic motion of the rotor. A parametric study focuses on bearing operation under close contact motion to examine the minimum film thickness and possibility of <b>bearing</b> <b>face</b> contact...|$|E

The {{article presents}} six options of process diagrams for installation of driven piles in penetrated wells, listing the main procedures: for well-compacted weak soils, {{for the case}} when the water ingress is excluded, for the case when {{it is necessary to}} increase the load-bearing capacity of pile's <b>bearing</b> <b>face</b> in the waterlogged soils, for the case when the load-bearing capacity of the pile shall be increased both for the end and for the sides, for the case when peat or other biogenous water-saturated soils are present {{at the bottom of the}} well, and for the case when there is no contracted zone nor practical possibility to ensure the stability of the walls. The proposed six options of process diagrams for installation of the driven piles in penetrated wells provide expansion of their area of application regarding the soil conditions, increase of load-bearing capacity, and possibility of using jack systems for driving the piles under conditions of dense urban development...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of complex}} micro parts requires five-axis machining accuracy {{that is not}} covered by currently available machine systems. For this reason, the Fraunhofer IPT investigates strategies for the enhancement of positioning accuracy, stiffness and damping of five-axis machine systems. The 'Integral Design' describes one possibility to follow precision design rules by integrating several functions in one item {{in order to reduce}} error activating cantilevers andjoint patches. Hence, the volumetric positioning accuracy as well as the overall machine stiffness can be enhanced and thermal errors can be reduced, too. This work exemplifies the integration of a hydrostatic radial bearing into a torque motor in order to decrease the error influences of a rotary swivel stage by reducing the Steiner Distance (from centre of gravity to pivot axis) and the Pivot Distance. Hereby, a carbon fibre bushing with hydrostatic bearing pockets is integrated into the primary part of a torque motor while a magnet coating realises the hydrostatic counter <b>bearing</b> <b>face.</b> The principal project idea, the design and the manufacturing of the components with bearing function is described in the following. The integral design follows precision design fundamentals and focuses on the reduction of cantilevers affecting Abbe, Pivot and Thermal Errors as well as the static and dynamic machine behaviour. The described integral rotary axis is realised by the integration of a hydrostatic radial bearing into a torque drive. A fibre composite bushing with five integrated hydrostatic pockets and oil supply is manufactured and fitted into the primary part whereas the bearing counter face is made by a 2 K-epoxy mass, that is cast on the rotor side, also protecting the magnets. The axial bearing is directly placed under the workpiece table for highest damping and stiffness against tilt movement. Due to a magnet restrictive measuring system only one non-contact sealing system needs to be integrated, separating the drive, bearing and measuring system towards the process. In comparison to a given partial design rotary stage, the Steiner Distance is reduced by 27 %, the Steiner Inertia by more than 50 % and the torque drive by 35 %. This provides the potential to increase the accuracy of five-axes machines as required. Furthermore, the given integral design can be translated to conventional machine tools supporting further accuracy enhancements...|$|E

Thus, the durability of air bearings is unlimited if they are designed and calculated correctly. Especially roller and friction <b>bearings</b> <b>face</b> a high friction when applied at high speed or acceleration or small strokes, causing high abrasion such that the precision decreases which in turn causes a breakdown.|$|R

50|$|The {{thread angle}} is the {{included}} angle, measured at a section {{parallel to the}} axis, between the two <b>bearing</b> <b>faces</b> of the thread. The angle between the axial load force and the normal to the bearing surface is approximately equal to half the thread angle, so the thread angle has a great effect on the friction and efficiency of a screw, {{as well as the}} wear rate and the strength. The greater the thread angle, the greater the angle between the load vector and the surface normal, so the larger the normal force between the threads required to support a given load. Therefore, increasing the thread angle increases the friction and wear of a screw.|$|R
50|$|Using {{spectral}} analysis {{as a tool}} to identify the faults in the <b>bearings</b> <b>faces</b> challenges due to issues like low energy, signal smearing, cyclostationarity etc. High resolution is often desired to differentiate the fault frequency components from the other high-amplitude adjacent frequencies. Hence, when the signal is sampled for FFT analysis, the sample length should be large enough to give adequate frequency resolution in the spectrum. Also, keeping the computation time and memory within limits and avoiding unwanted aliasing may be demanding. However, a minimal frequency resolution required can be obtained by estimating the bearing fault frequencies and other vibration frequency components and its harmonics due to shaft speed, misalignment, line frequency, gearbox etc.|$|R
