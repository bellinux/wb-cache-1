25|$|The Valée system {{consisted}} {{in various}} technical {{improvements to the}} Gribeauval system and Napoleon I's Year XI system. The system mainly improved the mobility of the artillery train, and simplified maintenance by standardizing limber usage and wheel size, and {{reducing the number of}} carriage types to two. It also allowed for cannoniers to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the ammunition chests of the battery itself during transportation, allowing the whole artillery train to move as fast as the infantry or cavalry.|$|E
25|$|The djed pillar {{was often}} used as amulets for {{the living and the}} dead. It was placed as an amulet near the spines of mummified bodies, which was {{supposed}} to ensure the resurrection of the dead, allowing the deceased to live eternally. The Egyptian Book of the Dead lists a spell which when spoken over a gold amulet hung around the mummy's neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up. It was also painted onto coffins.|$|E
25|$|The F121 engine had a rare set {{of design}} {{parameters}} {{as it is}} designed to be used only once. As a cruise missile engine, it was designed to have a long shelf life (<b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> around unused for long periods of time) and then operate when needed for several hours. It was designed to power the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, which was to be a stand-off anti radiation missile. Its first flight was on July 30, 1984. The AGM-136 program was canceled several years later.|$|E

25|$|The new {{parliament}} met on 6 March 1679, and on 25 March, Shaftesbury delivered a dramatic {{address in the}} House of Lords in which he warned {{of the threat of}} popery and arbitrary government; denounced the royal administration in Scotland under John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale and Ireland under James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde; and loudly denounced the policies of Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby in England. Shaftesbury supported the House of Commons when they introduced a Bill of Attainder against Danby, and voted in favour of the bill in the House of Lords on 14 April 1679. Shaftesbury attempted to neutralise the influence of the episcopal bench in favour of Danby by introducing a bill moving that the bishops should not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in the House of Lords during capital trials.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} views on optimal timing of surgery after a spinal cord injury. The general consensus is {{to operate the}} patient {{when he or she}} is neurologically stable. Some surgeons try to operate a patient as early as possible. The advantages of this are that the patient {{can take advantage of the}} new functional possibilities before new adjustments and apaptations develop. Other surgeons operate when it becomes feasible. This is usually 12–18 months after injury (can be shortened to 6–7 months) and only after stabilization of motor function. Important spasticity (see further) and neurovegetative complications (i.e. bladder function, bowel function, pulmonary function and pressure sores) must have been treated already. The patient must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> in a wheelchair so that he/she can move the arm against gravity. Usually a compromise is found between the patient’s wishes and the surgeon when timing the surgery.|$|E
500|$|Controversy arose about seating {{rules for}} {{wheelchair}} users, after two disabled mothers accused LOCOG of having discriminatory policies. One claimed {{she had been}} told by a LOCOG staff member that spectators in a wheelchair area at the Velodrome could only be accompanied by one adult, and children could not attend without being accompanied by another able-bodied adult, while another was told that her ability to sit in a wheelchair area with her children at ExCeL London was [...] "not guaranteed." [...] A petition for improved access for disabled families, started by one of the mothers on Change.org, quickly collected over 30,000 signatures. LOCOG denied having discriminatory policies, stating that disabled parents could steward their children in wheelchair seating areas at events with unreserved seats, but may not all <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> together at events with reserved seating.|$|E

500|$|The International Union of Operating Engineers (called Operators for short) {{represented}} {{the men and}} women who sat at the controls of the heavy equipment used on the construction of the pipeline. This equipment included bulldozers, cranes, drilling rigs, and sidebooms—a cross between a bulldozer and a crane that could lay a section of pipe in a trench parallel to its tracks. Because most of the heavy equipment was unheated, six operators were typically assigned to each piece of equipment, allowing for frequent breaks. A popular joke on the pipeline was that the sole qualification to be an Operator was, [...] "Must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on a sideboom at 40 below and not freeze up." [...] More seriously, one laborer wrote, was that there was nothing more terrifying than to be in a trench and have a drunken or unskilled Operator handling the pipe that was being laid in the trench.|$|E

2500|$|The Teledyne CAE J402 {{is a small}} {{turbojet}} engine designed to power unmanned air vehicles such as missiles and target drones. Developed in the 1970s for the Harpoon anti-ship missile, the J402 was the first jet engine to be designed as a [...] "wooden round", meaning that the engine had to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> for long periods without maintenance or inspection and work right away. Several variants of the engine have been developed, some of which power unmanned aerial target drones.|$|E

2500|$|Frames {{was made}} {{over the course of}} a year and a half. Unlike on his {{previous}} album, Live It Up, DeWyze served as a producer on Frames. Toby Gad was the only producer and co-writer to collaborate with DeWyze on both albums. DeWyze described the co-writing process on Live It Up as having been like speed-dating, but said that on Frames it felt like [...] "a full on collaboration." [...] He said that the recording process felt organic and that there was no [...] "pressure [...] to make a 'certain' type of record." [...] Free of this obligation, he chose not to confine himself to only writing folk rock songs and also included the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride," [...] which have been compared to the music of the Beatles, [...] "Fire Away," [...] which has been described as a combination of roots music and rockabilly, and [...] "Who Would've Known," [...] which has been described as a combination of pop and bluegrass. DeWyze specifically set out to write Frames so that it would [...] "flow as one," [...] harkening back to the kind of albums that he had listened to as a kid with his dad. He said, [...] "I wanted the vibe of the album as a whole to be cohesive. I wanted you to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and listen to the whole thing and have a musical experience with it." ...|$|E
