50|$|When the T & G Building was constructed, {{there were}} no <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> limits imposed by the City of Perth on multistorey developments, and the <b>building</b> had a <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{approximately}} 7:1. However, subsequent to the construction, a limit of 5:1 was imposed. As a result, in the 1980s when the tower was already outdated and showing signs of age, the owners found {{that they would be}} unable to replace the tower with a new one of a similar size. As a result, a decision was made to extensively refurbish the building.|$|R

The shape of the tower is not truly triangular but with its three corners cut off to provide better internal office spaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on the {{legislation}} in force concerning the spatial planning. The spatial planning documents in general, their structure as well as prescribed spatial limits defined in different spatial planning documents are described. The practical part of the thesis intends to indicate to what extent the spatial limits affect the effectiveness of the investment in real estate. In the selected case study, on the basis of five multi-story dwellings Dolge njive at Ankaran, the investment costs are estimated, and {{on the basis of the}} known selling prices of dwellings, the profit of the whole project is calculated. The simulation of the changed profit due to the changed spatial limits is performed. The calculated profit is compared to the profits obtained from three different assumed buildings in the same location wherein the ratio between the lay-out of the building and the area of the <b>building</b> <b>plot,</b> the <b>ratio</b> between the gross area of all lay-outs and the area of the <b>building</b> <b>plots</b> as well as the function of the building are varied. The investment costs are estimated for all three buildings in the same way as for the selected buildings at Dolge njive, Ankaran. In two assumed models the selling prices are determined by a comparative method and in one assumed model the selling price is proportionally increased against the basic case, namely Dolge njive, in respect of the bigger layout...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} high rise {{building}} in Mashhad has been considerably increased {{during the last}} years. Despite of solving the problem of shortage of land and housing, this caused many problems in different environmental, physical-spatial, functional, social, and demographic aspects. In fact, loading of land-use intensity (<b>plot</b> <b>ratio)</b> affects different aspects of urban environment. In the present study, {{the aim is to}} discuss <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> and high rise building policies in Mashhad, and its physical-spatial effects. This study is conducted on Sajad Blvd. and North-South Janbaz Blvd. trading corridors, as a sample of tall buildings erected on the trading corridor in Mashhad, in which the growth of high rise building during the recent years in these two corridors has been strictly increased. Then, it analyzes <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> indices through documentary and library studies and field approach. Finally, SWOT method is used in order to evaluate advantages and disadvantages of high rise building in both corridors. The results from the studies conducted show that current <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> and high rise building policies, in terms of physical-spatial effects, have caused damages to access network and aesthetics, and only has a considerable financial contribution economically. ...|$|R

40|$|The Urban Heat Island (UHI) {{effect can}} result in higher urban densities being {{significantly}} hotter (frequently more than 4 °C, even up to 10 °C) compared to their peri-urban surroundings. Such artificial heat stress increases the health risk of spending time outdoors and boosts the need for energy consumption, particularly for cooling during summer. Urban structure, land cover and metabolism are underlined as key contributors in city scale. Under question is which urban configurations can make urban precincts and their microclimates more resilient to the surface layer Urban Heat Island (sUHI) effect? The City of Sydney is increasingly experiencing the UHI effect due to its numerous urban development projects and changes in climate. In the Sydney context, this ongoing research aims to explore the most heat resilient urban features at precinct scale. It covers five high density precincts in central Sydney {{and is based on}} a nocturnal remote-sensing thermal image of central Sydney taken on 6 February 2009. Comparing the surface temperature of streetscapes and buildings’ rooftops (dominant urban horizontal surfaces), indicates that open public spaces and particularly streetscapes are the most sensitive urban elements to the sUHI effect. The correlations between street network intensity, open public space <b>plot</b> <b>ratio,</b> urban greenery <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> and sUHI effect is being analysed in Sydney’s high density precincts. Results indicate that higher open space <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> and street network intensity correlate significantly to higher sUHI effect at precinct scale. However, higher urban greenery <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> can effectively mitigate the sUHI effect in high density precincts. Ehsan Sharifi & Steffen Lehman...|$|R
30|$|The <b>plot</b> <b>ratio</b> (also called ‘floor area ratio’, FAR; or ‘floor space ratio’, FSR) {{describes}} {{the ratio of}} a building’s total floor area (also called: gross floor area, GFA) divided {{by the size of}} the site (piece of land or plot) upon which it is built. The term frequently refers to limits imposed on such a ratio, for example the maximum allowable ratio. For instance, a FAR of 3.0 indicates that the total floor area of a building is three times the gross area of the plot on which it is built, as would be found in a multiple-storey <b>building.</b> The allowable <b>plot</b> area has a major impact on the value of the land, as higher allowable plot areas yield a higher land value [9].|$|R

5000|$|Siðmennt, the Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association, {{issued a}} {{statement}} about it in general terms and did not criticise this particular decision because {{of the principle of}} equal treatment. According to Siðmennt, it was not part of municipality's functions to grant <b>building</b> <b>plots</b> to religious or life-stance organizations, such as the Evangelic-Lutheran State Church, the Catholic Church, or the Association of Muslims in Iceland, free of charge. However, since that system is in place it must be applied equally to all.

40|$|The need {{has been}} {{established}} for a computer based decision support tool to use during the conceptual stages of architectural design. The main functions are being designed in order to check design compliance {{with the requirements of}} local planning authorities, with regards to <b>building</b> size, height, <b>plot</b> <b>ratios,</b> circulation and accessibility, and the preservation of natural features on site. The measures to determine proper evaluation will be based upon site-development briefs, and design guides produced by the local planning authorities. This tool is being developed to operate under AutoCAD environment, the construction industry standard computer aided design software, following standard layering convention, integrated command lines, and pull-down menus. It will also provide many functions for editing two and three dimensional drawings specifically for the environmental analysis tasks. In addition to the common graphical output of Aut 0 CAD, i. e. plans, elevations and three dimensional models, the tool will generate textual analysis of the design in report format to use as part of the Environmental Impact Statement of proposed development. The speculative tool's functions will be based upon the result of two types of field studies. First, interviews and questionnaires will be carried out tailor-made for architects and planners of both private and public sectors. These will cover issues related to the performance of Computer Aided Architectural Design applications with regard to the evaluation of design schematics, and decision-making for the production of materials for environmental statements. Second, field observation will be carried out to observe the concerned professionals as decision-makers while assessing building design proposals. A prototype will be designed and then tested against the expectations of the tool designer, then the tool performance will be evaluated by a team of professionals participated in the field studies. A critical analysis of the prototype design methodology and the concluding study findings will be documented as part of a postgraduate research thesis to be completed in June 1995...|$|R
