5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way into the mainstream nursery business and can often <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects should <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> other {{attributes}} {{connected to}} the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of Candida {{subspecies}} discrimination on Sabouraud-triphenyltetrazolium agar is reported. Five hundred sixty-two strains of Candida and Torulopsis glabrata, previously identified by conventional mycological methods, were studied. Each strain received a three-letter code {{and a number}} based on its colonial morphology. Sixteen morphotypes <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> Candida albicans, 6 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> Candida parapsilosis, 4 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> both Candida guilliermondii and Candida krusei, and 12 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> Candida tropicalis. None of the 56 T. glabrata strains studied grew on this agar. A reproducibility of 95 % <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> C. albicans. The simplicity and low cost could make this method useful for typing Candida spp...|$|R

5|$|The pyramid was {{excavated}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century by two different teams who reported conflicting estimates regarding its size and number of subterranean chambers.

5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice being to bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{successive}} offensives of early August, exact Canadian casualties for Operation Tractable {{are not known}} but losses during Totalize and Tractable are put at 5,500 men. German casualties during Operation Tractable are also uncertain; approximate figures can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> casualties within the Falaise Pocket {{but not for the}} Canadian operations during Tractable. After the Falaise Pocket, the German 7th Army was severely depleted, having lost from 50,000–200,000 men, over 200 tanks, 1,000 guns and 5,000 other vehicles. In the fighting around Hill262, the Germans lost 2,000 men killed, 5,000 taken prisoner, 55 tanks, 44 guns and 152 armoured vehicles. Polish casualties for Operation Tractable (until 22 August) are 1,441 men, of whom 325 were killed (including 21 officers), 1,002 were wounded (35 officers) and 114 missing, which includes 263 men lost before the Chambois and Ormel actions from 14–18 August.|$|E
40|$|Six field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Giza Agricultural Research Station, Egypt during 2010, 2011 and 2012 growing seasons to study the effect of two types of N fertilizers (urea and urea form as slow-release (UF)) on intercropping cowpea with sunflower and intercropping wheat with pea. A split plot design with three replications was used. The results indicated that insignificant effect of cropping systems <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> sunflower and significant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> cowpea yield. Significant effect of N fertilizers <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on sunflower and insignificant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> cowpea yield. Furthermore, insignificant effect of interaction of cropping systems and N fertilizers <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> sunflower and significant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> cowpea yield. With respect to wheat and pea intercropping, both crops were significantly affected by intercropping system. Significant effect of N fertilizers <b>was</b> <b>found</b> on wheat and insignificant effect <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> pea yield. Both wheat and pea were significantly affected by the interaction of cropping system and N fertilizers. Yield advantage was achieved because land equivalent ratio exceeded 1. 00. Dominance analysis proved that leguminous crop is dominated component. Thus, the studied intercropping systems could be recommended to farmers due to its beneficial returns...|$|R

5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|However, some job {{still had}} to <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> Chotiner, who had wound up his California {{practice}} and sold his home. Haldeman refused to have him in the White House, and Nixon's aides deemed that the Democratic-controlled Senate was unlikely to confirm Chotiner for any post requiring its approval. On April 10, 1969, acting Special Representative for Trade Negotiations Theodore R. Gates appointed Chotiner as General Counsel to his office, as almost simultaneously, the White House announced Gates' replacement, Carl J. Gilbert. On April 1, Nixon had issued Executive Order 11463, making the position of general counsel in that office a Schedule C, or political appointment, and significantly raising the salary of the position. Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler stated that the salary had been raised because the new incumbent was expected to play {{a more active role}} than had previous holders of the position.|$|E
5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>for</b> the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers would do so with his client.|$|E
