40|$|Codebook-based single-microphone noise suppressors, which exploit prior {{knowledge}} about speech and noise statistics, provide better performance in nonstationary noise. However, as the enhancement involves a joint optimization over speech and noise codebooks, {{this results in}} high computational complexity. A codebook-based method is proposed that uses a reference signal observed by a <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>microphone,</b> and a mapping between air- and bone-conduction codebook entries generated during an offline training phase. A smaller subset of air-conducted speech codebook entries that accurately models the clean speech signal is selected using this reference signal. Experiments support the expected improvement in performance at low computational complexit...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{communication}} is significantly more difficult in severe acoustic background noise environments, especially when low-rate speech coders are used. Non-acoustic sensors, such as radar sensors, vibrometers, and <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>microphones,</b> offer significant potential in these situations. We extend previous work on fixed waveform fusion from multiple sensors to an optimal dynamic waveform fusion algorithm that minimizes both additive noise and signal distortion in the estimated speech signal. We {{show that a}} minimum mean squared error (MMSE) waveform matching criterion results in a generalized multichannel Wiener filter, and that this filter will simultaneously perform waveform fusion, noise suppression, and crosschannel noise cancellation. Formal intelligibility and quality testing demonstrate significant improvement from this approach. Index Terms â€” Non-acoustic sensor, waveform fusion 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPersonal {{portable}} {{information technology}} is advancing at a breathtaking speed. Google has recently introduced Glass, {{a device that}} is worn like conventional glasses, but that combines a computerized central processing unit, touchpad, display screen, high-definition camera, <b>microphone,</b> <b>bone-conduction</b> transducer, and wireless connectivity. We have obtained a Glass device through Google's Explorer program and have tested its applicability in our daily pediatric surgical practice and in relevant experimental settings. MethodsGlass was worn daily for 4 consecutive weeks in a University Children's Hospital. A daily log was kept, and activities with a potential applicability were identified. Performance of Glass was evaluated for such activities. In-vitro experiments were conducted where further testing was indicated. ResultsWearing Glass throughout the day for the study interval was well tolerated. Colleagues, staff, families and patients overwhelmingly had a positive response to Glass. Useful applications for Glass were hands-free photo/videodocumentation, making hands-free telephone calls, looking up billing codes, and internet searches for unfamiliar medical terms or syndromes. Drawbacks encountered with the current equipment were low battery endurance, data protection issues, poor overall audio quality, as well as long transmission latency combined with interruptions and cut-offs during internet videoconferencing. ConclusionGlass has the some clear utility in the clinical setting. However, {{before it can be}} recommended universally for physicians and surgeons, substantial improvements to the hardware are required, issues of data protection must be solved, and specialized medical applications (apps) need to be developed...|$|R
