In order to compile an accurate technical paper on such a complex system, {{it was necessary to}} design, construct, and calibrate a system for the in situ measurement of various physical and chemical properties of sea water. A unique digital encoding circuit was developed which utilizes the basic principles of null <b>balance,</b> <b>resistance</b> ratio bridge and potentiometer measurements. The circuit is a uniquely loaded binary ladder resistance network. Variation of the loading allows resistance ratio and potentiometric measurements to be made over different ranges with a constant high degree of resolution. The developed system has the capability of measuring any parameter which can be converted into a varying voltage, current, or resistance. The range over which the measurement can be made is adjustable; and the resolution equals ± 0. 006...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} percentage of patients with end-stage renal disease are malnourished and/or muscle wasted. Uremia is associated with decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation. Fortunately, nutritional status {{has been shown to}} be a modifiable risk factor in the dialysis population. It has long been proposed that exercise could positively alter the protein synthesis-degradation <b>balance.</b> <b>Resistance</b> training had been considered as the only form of exercise likely to induce anabolism in renal failure patients. However, a small, but growing, body of evidence indicates that for some dialysis patients, favourable improvements in muscle atrophy and fibre hypertrophy can be achieved via predominantly aerobic exercise training. Moreover, some studies tentatively suggest that nutritional status, as measured by SGA, can also be modestly improved by modes and patterns of exercise training that have been shown to also increase muscle fibre cross-sectional area and improve functionalcapacity. Functional capacity tests can augment the information content of basic nutritional status assessments of dialysis patients and as such are recommended for routine inclusion as a feature of all nutritional status assessments...|$|E
40|$|Background Previous reviews {{have shown}} balance in older adults to be {{improved}} with exercise. However, it is currently unclear whether postural control, indicated by centre of pressure (COP) measurement, can be improved in older adults and thus whether postural control could be a mechanism to improve balance. Objectives The purpose of this systematic review {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of force platform COP variables to identify changes in postural control following exercise interventions in older adults. In addition, a secondary purpose was to determine whether the exercise types (<b>balance,</b> <b>resistance</b> or multi-component exercise interventions) are equally effective to improve postural control. Methods Randomised controlled trials were identified using searches of databases and reference lists (PROSPERO registration number CRD 42014010617). Trials performing exercise interventions, reporting force platform COP measurements, in participants {{with a mean age of}} ? 60 years were included. Risk of bias assessments were performed following the Cochrane guidelines. Data were pooled in meta-analyses, and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Twenty-three trials met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Twenty-two trials could be defined as either utilising a <b>balance,</b> <b>resistance</b> or multi-component exercise intervention. These 22 trials were used in the meta-analyses. All trials reported measurements of double leg stance; eight trials reported additional stance conditions. The meta-analyses of double leg stance showed that balance exercise interventions significantly decreased total sway path length/velocity [SMD ? 1. 13, 95 % CI ? 1. 75 to ? 0. 51 (eyes open); SMD ? 0. 79, 95 % CI ? 1. 33 to ? 0. 26 (eyes closed) ] and anterior-posterior sway path length/velocity [SMD ? 1. 02, 95 % CI ? 2. 01 to ? 0. 02 (eyes open); SMD ? 0. 82, 95 % CI ? 1. 46 to ? 0. 17 (eyes closed) ] in both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. Balance exercise interventions also decreased sway area in eyes closed conditions (SMD ? 0. 57, 95 % CI ? 1. 01 to ? 0. 13) and medio-lateral sway path length/velocity in eyes open conditions (SMD ? 0. 8, 95 % CI ? 1. 48 to ? 0. 12). In contrast, neither resistance nor multi-component exercise interventions affected any of the included COP measurements. Conclusions Postural control is improved by balance exercise interventions. In contrast, strength or multi-component exercise interventions did not influence postural control measurements in older adults. In addition, a lack of standardisation in collection protocol and COP variables calculated across trials was identified. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Exercise has a {{profound}} effect on muscle growth, which can occur only if muscle protein synthesis exceeds muscle protein breakdown; there must be a positive muscle protein <b>balance.</b> <b>Resistance</b> exercise improves muscle protein balance, but, in the absence of food intake, the balance remains negative (i. e., catabolic). The response of muscle protein metabolism to a resistance exercise bout lasts for 24 - 48 hours; thus, the interaction between protein metabolism and any meals consumed in this period will determine the impact of the diet on muscle hypertrophy. Amino acid availability is an important regulator of muscle protein metabolism. The interaction of postexercise metabolic processes and increased amino acid availability maximizes the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and results in even greater muscle anabolism than when dietary amino acids are not present. Hormones, especially insulin and testosterone, have important roles as regulators of muscle protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy. Following exercise, insulin has only a permissive role on muscle protein synthesis, but it appears to inhibit the increase in muscle protein breakdown. Ingestion of only small amounts of amino acids, combined with carbohydrates, can transiently increase muscle protein anabolism, but it has yet to be determined if these transient responses translate into an appreciable increase in muscle mass over a prolonged training period...|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to assess the effect of a 3 -month strength-training {{programme}} on functional performance and self-rated health in a group of home-dwelling older hip fracture patients. Design: randomised, controlled; single-blind parallel-group trial. Setting: intervention at outpatient’s clinic. Subjects: one hundred and fifty patients with surgical fixation for a hip fracture. Methods: strength training was integrated into all stages of the programme. The programme comprised four exercises, half of them in a standing position, performed at 80 % of maximum. Measurements were taken after the 3 -month intervention. The primary outcome measurement was the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Secondary outcomes were results of the sit-to-stand test, Timed Up-and-Go test, maximal gait speed, 6 -min walk test, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale and the SF- 12 health status questionnaire. Results: at baseline, there were no significant between-group differences. At follow-up, the intervention group showed highly significant improvements both in the primary endpoint (BBS, mean difference 4. 7 points) and in secondary endpoints of tapping strength, mobility and instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusion: home-dwelling hip fracture patients can benefit from an extended supervised strength-training programme in a rehabilitation setting.

30|$|After the tax-sharing reform, central fiscal {{revenue was}} {{transferred}} down to local governments in three forms: tax rebates, general-purpose transfer payments, and special purpose transfer payments. 6 The three {{are designed for}} different goals and correspondingly have different intergovernmental authority-accountability features. First, the form of tax rebates is designed to encourage local tax extraction, and the main goal of tax rebates is to <b>balance</b> <b>resistance</b> to the economic reform, especially from developed regions in eastern China. Thus, tax rebates have an unfair effect. In {{the early years of}} the reform, tax rebates increased to almost 80 % of government expenditures, while it remained at the rate of 50 % before 2000, and the majority went to developed regions. Second, the general-purpose transfer payment was designed to balance expenditure gaps among regions, and it contributed the political effect of achieving social equality and maintaining social stability (Treisman 1999; Wang 2002). The majority of these funds flowed to the western or frontier areas, minority regions, rural areas, and impoverished areas. Third, the form of special transfer payments is unique in its purpose, special distribution mechanism, and practical results. According to economic analyses, special transfer payments are a modification for externality through subsidies to regional marginal revenue and altering relative prices to solve the financial shortage of public goods, especially goods that have strong externality. However, scholars have pointed out that the function of special transfer payments works by political logic (Dixit and Londregan 1998). The profit of special transfer payments belongs to specific regions while the national fiscal system bears the costs; thus, local government may over-apply for special transfer payments. The distributors of special transfer payments make decisions politically rather than economically, so there are a considerable number of inefficient projects (Weingast et al. 1981).|$|E

In the cluster, PigmR confers broad-spectrum resistance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress resistance. PigmS expression, and thus PigmR-mediated resistance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. PigmS increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by PigmR.

We evaluated resistance and tolerance to the fungus in experimental and human vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) {{as well as}} in recurrent VVC (RVVC). Resistance and tolerance mechanisms were both activated in murine VVC, involving IL- 22 and IL- 10 -producing regulatory T cells, respectively, with a major contribution by the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase 1 (IDO 1). IDO 1 was responsible for the production of tolerogenic kynurenines, such that replacement therapy with kynurenines restored immunoprotection to VVC. In humans, two functional genetic variants in IL 22 and IDO 1 genes were found to be associated with heightened resistance to RVVC, and they correlated with increased local expression of IL- 22, IDO 1 and kynurenines. Thus, IL- 22 and IDO 1 are crucial in <b>balancing</b> <b>resistance</b> with tolerance to Candida, their deficiencies are risk factors for RVVC, and targeting tolerance via therapeutic kynurenines may benefit patients with RVVC...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{resistance}} {{of both the}} electrodes of a lead-acid battery increases during discharge due to formation of lead sulfate, an insulator. Work of Metzendorf 1] shows that resistance increases sharply at about 65 % conversion of active materials, and battery stops discharging once this critical conversion is reached. However, these aspects are not incorporated into existing mathematical models. Present work uses the results of Metzendorf 1], and develops a model that includes the effect of variable resistance. Further, it uses a reasonable expression {{to account for the}} decrease in active area during discharge instead of the empirical equations of previous work. The model's predictions are compared with observations of Cugnet et al. 2]. The model is as successful as the non-mechanistic models existing in literature. Inclusion of variation in {{resistance of}} electrodes in the model is important if one of the electrodes is a limiting reactant. If active materials are stoichiometrically <b>balanced,</b> <b>resistance</b> of electrodes can be very large at the end of discharge but has only a minor effect on charging of batteries.

Methods: Seventy-five healthy community-dwelling older adults aged 65 – 80 years, were assigned to three intervention groups: M-SRT, M-URT and F-URT. Over a period of ten weeks, all participants exercised two times per week with each session lasting ~ 60 min. Tests included assessment of leg muscle strength (e. g., maximal isometric leg extension strength), power (e. g., chair rise test) and balance (e. g., functional reach test), carried out before and after the training period. Furthermore, maximal training load of the squat-movement was assessed during the last training week. Results: Maximal training load of the squat-movement was significantly lower in F-URT in comparison to M-SRT and M-URT. However, lower-extremity resistance training conducted on even and uneven surfaces meaningfully improved proxies of strength, power and balance in all groups.
