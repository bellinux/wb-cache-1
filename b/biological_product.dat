I cannot help suspecting that this is precisely one of those points on which Stoicism, in company with almost all philosophy up to the present time, has gone astray through not sufficiently realising its dependence on the human mind as a natural <b>biological</b> <b>product.</b> For it is very important in this matter to realise that the so-called belief is not really an intellectual judgment so much as a craving of the whole nature.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} produce a desired product, {{suitable}} yeast strains are transformed with a vector that contains all necessary genetic elements for production of a <b>biological</b> <b>product</b> of interest. Vectors must also contain a selection marker, which is required to select yeast which have successfully taken up the vector from those which have not. Vectors also contain certain DNA elements allowing the yeast to incorporate the foreign DNA into the chromosome of the yeast and to replicate it. Most importantly, vectors contain a segment responsible {{for the production of}} the desired compound, called an expression cassette. The cassette contains a sequence of regulatory elements that control how much and under which circumstances a certain product is eventually made. This is followed by the gene for the <b>biological</b> <b>product</b> itself. The expression cassette is terminated by a terminator sequence that stops of the transcription of the expressed gene.|$|E
