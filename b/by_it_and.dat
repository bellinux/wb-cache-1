5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, was inspired <b>by</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> wrote a {{play in the}} same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the story as a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{is notable}} for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes {{generated}} <b>by</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> the destruction it produced on its path, causing {{a total of}} nine fatalities and $ (1997USD, $ USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71inches (932mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred {{in many areas of}} the Gulf Coast, and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused a great amount of damage. Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four occurred in Georgia, two occurred in South Carolina, and two occurred in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for outsourcing of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially amongst young college graduates. The number of professionals employed <b>by</b> <b>IT</b> <b>and</b> ITES sectors is estimated at around 1.3million as of March 2006. Also, Indian IT-ITES is estimated to have helped create an additional 3 million job opportunities through indirect, induced and in helpful manner have created employment.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based {{on the history of}} the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several of the {{characters}} in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelg√§nger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> refused to see it.|$|E

5|$|The Completion Force sailed on 10February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a Royal Navy submarine. However, {{attempts}} <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> several United States Navy submarines {{to attack}} between 11 and 14February were unsuccessful. More than 88 USAAF aircraft attempted {{to bomb the}} Completion Force on 13 and 14February, but were {{unable to do so}} because of bad weather. A further submarine attack on 16February did not damage any of the Japanese ships. As a result, the Completion Force reached its destination of Kure in Japan on 20February without having suffered any casualties. Despite this success, the Japanese Government was forced to discontinue its efforts to ship oil from Southeast Asia to Japan in March due to the heavy losses Allied submarines were inflicting on oil tankers, and all the ships of the Completion Force were sunk in or near Japanese home waters {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E

5|$|This amendment, {{as well as}} the Fourteenth, is {{undoubtedly}} self-executing, without any ancillary legislation, so far as its terms are applicable to any existing state of circumstances. By its own unaided force and effect, it abolished slavery and established universal freedom. Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases and circumstances to be affected <b>by</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit. And such legislation may be primary and direct in its character, for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced <b>by</b> <b>it),</b> <b>and</b> both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E
