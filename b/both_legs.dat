5|$|In early 1944, Freyberg {{was made}} {{commander}} of the New Zealand Corps, newly formed for the Battle of Monte Cassino, while Kippenberger was promoted to temporary major-general and made {{commander of the}} 2nd Division. This was the pinnacle of his military career. The division had moved into the line around Cassino, replacing the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, which had been attacking the strongly defended German positions. The first attack by the New Zealanders on 17 February was unsuccessful despite {{the bombing of the}} Monte Cassino abbey, which Kippenberger supported. A second attack was planned for 20 February, but it was delayed by bad weather. On 2 March, Kippenberger climbed the slopes of nearby Mount Trocchio to gain an overview of the Cassino battlefield. Near the top of the mountain, he triggered a land mine which exploded and injured <b>both</b> <b>legs</b> to the extent that one foot was severed in the blast. He was evacuated to a medical centre, and the other foot and the lower portions of <b>both</b> <b>legs</b> were amputated. When the news of his injuries spread to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it was met with some disbelief and shock, greatly affecting morale.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionSeveral studies {{reported}} better clinical results with total hip resurfacing than with conventional total hip replacement, including in young patients, but without comparative stabilometry assessment. HypothesisResurfacing arthroplasty provides better functional performance than conventional total hip replacement. ObjectivesTo test the above hypothesis in a stabilometry study comparing balance and functional performance {{in patients with}} total hip resurfacing or conventional total hip replacement and healthy controls. Materials and methodsResults were analyzed on three cohorts of 20 patients: healthy control subjects, with unilateral total hip replacement or unilateral total hip resurfacing. The 40 operated patients were comparable in gender, age, weight (body-mass index), date of operation and clinical results. The 20 control subjects were younger and served as reference. Balance analysis employed a force platform commonly used in stabilometry, standardizing <b>both</b> <b>leg</b> or single leg stance balance analysis. The software interpreted individual balance by measuring plantar pressure center variation during the analysis so as to contour an individual <b>both</b> <b>leg</b> or single leg area of balance (statokinesigram, in mm 2). ResultsBalance analysis on <b>both</b> <b>leg</b> found comparable results in the control and resurfacing groups. The weight-bearing statokinesigraphic <b>both</b> <b>leg</b> balance area was greater in the hip replacement than in either {{of the other two}} groups (p< 0. 05), and five times greater than in the resurfacing group (p< 0. 05). The single leg weight-bearing balance results were significantly better in the resurfacing group, with a statokinesigraphic balance area half that of the hip replacement group, whether on the operated or the non-operated side (p< 0. 001). Discussion and conclusionThe present functional performance results confirm the advantage of resurfacing over conventional hip replacement, and help explain the excellent radioclinical results reported for total hip resurfacing. Level of evidenceIII, comparative case-control study...|$|R

5|$|After José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to second}} place, the club {{offered him a}} new two-year {{contract}} as manager in June. As a condition to renewing the contract, Camacho requested that the club sign more established players, but budget restraints allowed for limited investment.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of functional balance training on static and dynamic balance performance, kicking velocity and to define the relationship between balance ability and kicking velocity of adolescent soccer players. Material and Methods: Sixteen male players randomly divided into 2 groups (Control Group: age 14, 23 ± 0, 44; Training Group: age 14, 31 ± 0, 48). While the control group (n= 8) followed regular soccer training, the training group (n= 8) performed a functional balance training program additively. The balance training was performed on both stable ground and unstable surface (BOSU ball).
