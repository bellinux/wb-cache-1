40|$|AbstractThe parallel, Double Wall, {{hypervelocity}} {{impact shield}} configuration has been heavily tested and characterized for ballistic performance for normal and oblique impacts for the ISS and other programs. However, in many locations with spacecraft designs, the rear wall cannot be modeled as being parallel or concentric with the outer bumper wall and in cases with a cylindrical outer wall, the effective non-parallel angle commonly varies as the outer wall impact location changes. This complicates micrometeoroid and orbital debris assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls. Based {{on a study}} combining hypervelocity impact testing and hydrodynamic impact simulations on multiple shield configurations including non-parallel first and rear walls, this paper provides equation adjustments for use with the double wall Ballistic Limit Equation (<b>BLE)</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of impact speeds, non-parallel wall angles and impact obliquities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCalcium looping (CaL) {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} as a lower-cost method of CO 2 capture for power plants. This paper {{presents the results of}} a techno-economic assessment of <b>a</b> <b>CaL</b> system <b>for</b> post-combustion CO 2 capture at a pulverized coal (PC) power plant. Comparisons are made with a conventional MEA-based CO 2 capture process in terms of performance and cost. Considering the significant quantities of solid flows required <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>CaL</b> process, the applicability and operational feasibility of <b>a</b> <b>CaL</b> system <b>for</b> new or existing PC power plants also is studied. It was found that though the CaL system has better performance than the MEA-based CO 2 capture process, the capital cost of the power plant and the cost of electricity is much higher than when the MEA-based system is used...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to identifying semantically similar words across languages. The approach is based on an idea that two words in different languages are similar if they are likely to generate similar words (which includes both source and target language words) as their top semantic word responses. Semantic word responding is a concept from cognitive science which addresses detecting most likely words that humans output as free word associations given some cue word. The method consists of two main steps: (1) it utilizes a probabilistic multilingual topic model trained on comparable data to learn and quantify the semantic word responses, (2) it provides ranked lists of similar words according to the similarity of their semantic word response vectors. We evaluate our approach in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction (<b>BLE)</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of language pairs. We show that in the cross-lingual settings without any language pair dependent knowledge the response-based method of similarity is more robust and outperforms current state-of-the art methods that directly operate in the semantic space of latent cross-lingual concepts/topics. ...|$|R
