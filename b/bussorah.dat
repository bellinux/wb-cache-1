60|$|Amongst {{the several}} breeds {{sent to me}} from Madras by Sir W. Elliot there {{is a pair of}} the Kali Par, black birds with the beak {{slightly}} elongated, with the skin over the nostrils rather full, and with a little naked skin round the eyes. This breed seems more closely allied to the Carrier than to any other breed, being nearly intermediate between the <b>Bussorah</b> Carrier and the rock-pigeon.|$|E
60|$|All the breeds have twelve {{cervical}} vertebrae. (5/36. I am {{not sure}} that I have designated the different kinds of vertebra correctly: but I observe that different anatomists follow in this respect different rules, and, as I use the same terms in the comparison of all the skeletons, this, I hope, will not signify.) But in a <b>Bussorah</b> Carrier from India the twelfth vertebra carried a small rib, a quarter of an inch in length, with a perfect double articulation.|$|E
60|$|The rock-pigeon has twelve sacral vertebrae; {{but these}} vary in number, {{relative}} size, and distinctness, {{in the different}} breeds. In Pouters, with their elongated bodies, there are thirteen or even fourteen, and, as we shall immediately see, an additional number of caudal vertebrae. In Runts and Carriers there is generally the proper number, namely twelve; but in one Runt, and in the <b>Bussorah</b> Carrier, there were only eleven. In Tumblers there are either eleven, or twelve, or thirteen sacral vertebrae.|$|E

6000|$|The names {{applied in}} {{different}} parts of Europe and in India to the several kinds of Carriers all point to Persia or the surrounding countries as the source of this Race. And it deserves especial notice that, even if we neglect the Kali Par as of doubtful origin, we get a series broken by very small steps, from the rock-pigeon, through the <b>Bussorah,</b> which sometimes has a beak not at all longer than that of the rock-pigeon and with the naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils very slightly swollen and carunculated, through the Bagdad sub-race and Dragons, to our improved English Carriers, which present so marvellous a difference from the rock- pigeon or Columba livia.] ...|$|E
60|$|In {{all these}} breeds the seventh pair was very small, and was {{destitute}} of processes, in which respect it {{differed from the}} same rib in the rock- pigeon. In one Tumbler, and in the <b>Bussorah</b> Carrier, even the sixth pair had no process. The hypapophysis of the second dorsal vertebra varies much in development; being sometimes (as in several, but not all Tumblers) nearly as prominent {{as that of the}} third dorsal vertebra; and the two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified arch. The development of the arch, formed by the hypapophyses of the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae, also varies considerably, as does the size of the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra.|$|E

60|$|During {{that period}} the {{remittances}} to the Mogul's treasury from Bengal were never very large, {{at least for}} any considerable time, nor very regularly sent; and the impositions of the state were soon repaid with interest {{through the medium of}} a lucrative commerce. But the disorders of Persia, since the death of Kouli Khân, have wholly destroyed the trade of that country; and the trade to Turkey, by Jidda and <b>Bussorah,</b> which was the greatest and perhaps best branch of the Indian trade, is very much diminished. The fall of the throne of the Mogul emperors has drawn with it that of the great marts of Agra and Delhi. The utmost confusion of the northwestern provinces followed this revolution, which was not absolutely complete until it received the last hand from Great Britain. Still greater calamities have fallen upon the fine provinces of Rohilcund and Oude, and on the countries of Corah and Allahabad. By the operations of the British arms and influence, they are in many places turned to mere deserts, or so reduced and decayed as to afford very few materials or means of commerce.|$|E
6000|$|Lieut. Cruttenden of the I. N., {{writing in}} 1848, thus {{describes}} the place:--"The annual fair {{is one of}} the most interesting sights on the coast, if only from the fact of many different and distant tribes being drawn together for a short time, to be again scattered in all directions. Before the towers of Berbera were built [2], the place from April to the early part of October was utterly deserted, not even a fisherman being found there; but no sooner did the season change, than the inland tribes commenced moving down towards the coast, and preparing their huts for their expected visitors. Small craft from the ports of Yemen, anxious to have an opportunity of purchasing before vessels from the gulf could arrive, hastened across, followed about a fortnight to three weeks later by their larger brethren from Muscat, Soor, and Ras el Khyma, and the valuably freighted Bagalas [3] from Bahrein, <b>Bussorah,</b> and Graen. Lastly, the fat and wealthy Banian traders from Porebunder, Mandavie, and Bombay, rolled across in their clumsy Kotias [3], and with a formidable row of empty ghee jars slung over the quarters of their vessels, elbowed themselves into a permanent position in the front tier of craft in the harbour, and by their superior capital, cunning, and influence soon distanced all competitors." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{may look}} in vain in Aldrovandi's work for any bird {{resembling}} our prize Carriers; the C. persica et turcica of this author comes the nearest, but {{is said to}} have had a short thick beak; therefore it must have approached in character a Barb, and have differed greatly from our Carriers. In Willughby's time, in 1677, we can clearly recognise the Carrier, yet he adds, [...] "the bill is not short, but of a moderate length;" [...] a description which no one would apply to our present Carriers, so conspicuous for the extraordinary length of their beaks. The old names given in Europe to the Carrier, and the several names now in use in India, indicate that Carriers originally came from Persia; and Willughby's description would perfectly apply to the <b>Bussorah</b> Carrier as it now exists in Madras. In later times we can partially trace the progress of change in our English Carriers: Moore, in 1735, says [...] "an inch and a half is reckoned a long beak, though there are very good Carriers that are found not to exceed an inch and a quarter." [...] These birds must have resembled or perhaps been a little superior to the Carriers, previously described, now found in Persia. In England at the present day [...] "there are," [...] as Mr. Eaton (6/43. 'Treatise on Pigeons' 1852 page 41.) states, [...] "beaks that would measure (from edge of eye to tip of beak) one inch and three-quarters, and some few even two inches in length."] ...|$|E

The main focus of education in As-Sibyan was the memorization of the Qur’an. As-Sibyan relocated to Lorong Engku Aman in Geylang Serai sometime around 1923. Unfortunately, little is known about As-Sibyan after that year. However, what is evident is that As-Sibyan had long since ceased operations because no pondok schools currently exist in Singapore today.|$|E

Thomas noted that [...] "it would be a work of no ordinary magnitude".The land base for the construction of the light was Erraid near Iona. Fourteen miles distant from Dhu Heartach across open sea, the little island provided a granite quarry and a shore station once the work on the lighthouse was completed. Initial construction on the rock, which began on 25 June 1867 under the supervision of Alan Brebner, required a barrack for the workmen made of iron. Summer gales brought high seas, which resulted in breaking water falling on the roof 77 ft above sea level. It held firm, although fourteen men including Brebner were trapped there for five days, and at one point seawater poured in through the trapdoor, swirled around them and exited with their remaining food supplies. Describing a similar occasion, R. L. Stevenson wrote: The men sat high up prisoned in their iron drum, that then resounded with the lashings of the sprays ... It was then that the foreman builder, Mr. Goodwillie, whom I see before me in his rock-habit of indecipherable rags, would get his fiddle down and strike up human minstrelsy amid the music of the storms.|$|E
