5|$|In 1995, a gas of {{rubidium}} atoms cooled down to {{a temperature}} of 170 nK was used to experimentally realize the <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>condensate,</b> a novel state of matter originally predicted by S.

5|$|Rubidium had minimal {{industrial}} value {{before the}} 1920s. Since then, {{the most important}} use of rubidium is research and development, primarily in chemical and electronic applications. In 1995, rubidium-87 was used to produce a <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>condensate,</b> for which the discoverers, Eric Allin Cornell, Carl Edwin Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle, won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} condensed phases are solids and liquids while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>condensate</b> found in ultracold atomic systems. The study of {{condensed matter physics}} involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} interferometers that sort <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> into their vortex components. The <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> {{in the two}} arms of the interferometer are rotated with {{respect to each other}} through fixed angles; different vortex components then exit the interferometer in different directions. The method we use to rotate the <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> involves asymmetric phase imprinting and is itself new. We have modeled rotation through fixed angles and sorting into vortex components with even and odd values of the topological charge of two-dimensional <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> {{in a number of states}} (pure or superposition vortex states for different values of the scattering length). Our scheme may have applications for quantum information processing...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the integrability of an inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which has several applications in many branches of physics, as in <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> and fiber optics. The main issue deals with Painlevé property (PP) and Liouville integrability for a nonlinear Schrödinger-type equation. Solutions of the integrable equation are obtained {{by means of}} the Darboux transformation. Finally, some applications on fiber optics and <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> are proposed (including <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>condensates</b> in three-dimensional in cylindrical symmetry) ...|$|R
5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} lose all resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>condensate.</b> These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Einstein {{received}} {{a description of}} a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms {{as well as to the}} proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>condensate</b> phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.|$|E

25|$|A <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>condensate</b> (BEC) is a {{state of}} matter of a dilute gas of weakly {{interacting}} bosons confined in an external potential and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero.
