5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group can <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with {{the same way as}} other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E
5|$|Threshold {{issues are}} legal {{requirements}} in Singapore administrative law {{that must be}} satisfied by applicants before their claims for judicial review of acts or decisions of public authorities can <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with by the High Court. These include showing that they have standing (locus standi) to bring cases, and that the matters are amenable to judicial review and justiciable by the Court.|$|E
50|$|Each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> eight (8) cards, thus all cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another variant {{is played}} by {{reducing}} to four betting rounds: one after the hole cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> but before any community cards are, then another after {{the left and right}} cards of the cross <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> at the same time, a third after the top and bottom cards of the cross <b>are</b> <b>dealt,</b> and a final round after the center card <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
50|$|A game {{consists}} of 15 hands; {{in the first}} hand, 8 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> to each player. In the second hand, 7 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt,</b> and so on until the eighth hand, when only one card <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> to each player. Following this, each hand increases the number of cards dealt to each player by one, until the fifteenth hand, in which 8 cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Over {{the first}} queen, the cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> over it until another queen appears. This new queen becomes {{the base for}} a new tableau column and cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> over it. This is {{repeated}} until all eight queens are uncovered and all cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> {{into eight}} columns of six cards. They <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> {{in such a}} way that no two cards in the same column have the same rank. To avoid that, the identically ranking card is placed at the bottom of the deck and a new one <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with promptly.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with by Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that can usually <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam {{due to its}} stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5000|$|Players <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> 5 cards each. Each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> three {{cards at}} once, {{starting}} with the player left of the dealer and continuing in a clockwise-direction, then each player <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> two cards at once in the same order. The dealer never deals more than three cards at a time.|$|R

2500|$|The {{result of}} {{this section of the}} Act is that any case worth less than £25,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> with in the County Courts, any case worth between £25,000 and £50,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> with in either the County Court or the High Court {{depending}} on the complexity and any case worth more than £50,000 <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> with in the High Court. Claims worth under £3,000 <b>are</b> automatically <b>dealt</b> with by the small claims track of the County Court. This has drastically speeded up proceedings in the High Court by making sure that only [...] "important" [...] and valuable cases <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> with by them.|$|R
5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, {{it was possible to}} consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E
5|$|Tute in Pairs {{is played}} by four players—two teams of two players each—and every player {{receives}} ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means {{that all of the}} cards in the deck are dealt). The last card to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> is shown {{to the rest of the}} players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.|$|E
5|$|A decree in April 1919 {{resulted}} {{in the establishment of}} concentration camps, which were entrusted to the Cheka, later administered by a new government agency, Gulag. By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates. Those interned in the camps were used as slave labour. From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Bolshevik government were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Russia altogether; Lenin personally scrutinised the lists of those to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with in this manner. In May 1922, Lenin issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths. The Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected; the government's anti-religious policies also impacted on Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, Jewish synagogues, and Islamic mosques.|$|E
5000|$|Stud poker, which {{comprises}} Game 3, {{allows for}} up to four players. The computer, as the dealer, issues a card {{to each of the}} players and itself. Before the first card <b>is</b> <b>dealt,</b> and after each subsequent hand, until five cards have <b>been</b> <b>dealt,</b> each player must either make a bet or fold. If the left difficulty switch is set to [...] "A", the dealer's first card <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> face down; otherwise, it <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> face up; likewise for the right difficulty switch for each player.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} more betting rounds. Before each round each player draws an {{additional}} card. Cards {{five and six}} <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> face up, card seven <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> face down.|$|R
50|$|From a {{standard}} deck use 13 cards for every player, {{in the first}} hand. Every hand after first, one card less <b>is</b> <b>dealt,</b> until only one card <b>is</b> <b>dealt.</b> Then for the next 4 hands (in the case of 4 player game), including the first one, only 1 card <b>is</b> <b>dealt</b> so every player {{gets a chance to}} be a dealer.|$|R
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the whole}} {{existence}} of the Byzantine Empire, the garrison {{of the city was}} quite small: the imperial guards and the small city watch (the pedatoura or kerketon) under the urban prefect were the only permanent armed force available. Any threat to the city would have to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with by the field armies in the provinces, before it could approach the city itself. In times of need, such as the earthquake of 447 or the raids by the Avars in the early 7th century, the general population, organized in the guilds and the hippodrome factions, would be conscripted and armed, or additional troops would be brought in from the provincial armies.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2012, the State Attorney {{brought a}} motion to remand Blythe in pre-trial detention, as he {{considered}} Blythe a flight risk. During a hearing conducted the same day, judge Petr Fassati of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe {{will be held on}} remand, with the possibility of a bail of CZK 4,000,000 (~ US$ 200,000), Blythe's alleged annual income; Blythe was held in Pankrác Prison. Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court.|$|E
50|$|This version {{also allows}} four players to play, {{in which case}} four cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> before the bid, and two cards <b>are</b> <b>dealt</b> after the bid, per player.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the French cemeteries was complicated by even more heated arguments over how {{the bodies of the}} war dead should <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with. During the conflict the French war dead had ended up being split between special war cemeteries, local civilian cemeteries and some had been returned to their original villages. Catholic traditionalists in the government called for the bodies to be buried together in special cemeteries along the Western front, while others campaigned for them to be returned to local cemeteries. In 1919, the decision was taken to use special war cemeteries and to ban the repatriation of bodies, but by 1920 this decision had been reversed and 300,000 French bodies were repatriated to their original homes. The French war cemeteries were typically much larger than their IWGC equivalents and used concrete Catholic crosses for all the graves, {{with the exception of the}} Islamic and Chinese war dead.|$|E
5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can <b>be</b> <b>dealt,</b> both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships. The portal finally closes, leaving their home planet in peace and quiet.|$|E
5|$|Here the Japanese {{held the}} high ground in well-concealed {{positions}} that had clear fields of fire into the narrow gorge below. With no other options, the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences frontally, advancing straight up the gorge. Amidst torrential rain and stiff defence, progress was slow as each defensive position had to <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> with individually. As the water level in the creek rose steadily, the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades lobbed from the heights above. The supply situation grew desperate too, but by 28 October the 2/3rd Battalion had managed to work its way around the Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack. In the afternoon, the battalion launched its attack, breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position. The defenders were overwhelmed {{and many of them}} abandoned their weapons as they fled. That night, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position. The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action.|$|E
