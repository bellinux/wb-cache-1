5|$|The Australians {{chose to}} bat first, and <b>Brown</b> <b>top</b> scored with 140, his first 50 taking three hours. He shared century stands with Bradman, who made 62, and Miller (57). Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away {{late in the}} innings, losing 7/142. Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57, while Miller, Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece. The county {{followed}} on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs. In their second innings they made 182, with Denis Smith making 88, the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians. However, only one other player reached double figures, as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9/72, taking 6/77, while Loxton took 3/16. There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day.|$|E
25|$|In {{situations}} where identification is needed quickly, the colour of the King George whiting {{is also very}} distinctive, with a pale golden brown to olive <b>brown</b> <b>top</b> colour and white to silver colour on its underside.

The caudal, anal and pectoral fins are usually a light brown, with some having olive green caudal fins.|$|E
25|$|The run {{of success}} {{came to an}} end in 2005 when an ageing Surrey team was relegated to Division Two of the Championship, but an {{immediate}} recovery took place in 2006 as Surrey won promotion as champions of Division Two. This proved short-lived however, and they were once again relegated to Division Two in 2008, failing to win a single game {{for the first time since}} 1871 and losing their last two games by an innings. Despite the end of a successful period, Surrey did post a List A world record score of 496–4 from 50 overs, the first of which was a maiden, against Gloucestershire at The Oval on 29 April 2007; Ali <b>Brown</b> <b>top</b> scored with 176 from just 97 deliveries.|$|E

25|$|After {{the horrors}} of the Brisbane Test the MCC got to play another upcountry game played in a rodeo dustbowl. Hutton won the toss, batted and put on 112 with Bill Edrich (74), who seemed to have regained his form, before he was out for 40. Peter May made 69 and Jim Wilson 61, but the last five wickets fell for 26 runs., from 291/5 to 317 all out, with the retired Queensland leg spinner Donald Watt taking 5/56 with help from fellow leggie Kenneth Jenkins (4/44). The innings had reduced the {{makeshift}} wicket to the consistency of a golf bunker and Hutton allowed it to be rebuilt for the next day. Opener Wilfred <b>Brown</b> <b>top</b> scored with 22 in the Country innings as they collapsed to 95 off 42.1 eight-ball overs with Peter Loader (3/22), Johnny Wardle (2/22), Bob Appleyard (2/18) and Tom Graveney (2/8) sharing the wickets. Hutton put them straight back in again and this time they did better, Brown making 78 and adding 108 for the second wicket with Renald Sippel (45), but Appleyard (7/51) spun his way {{through the rest of the}} batting order with some help from Graveney (2/49). The home team agreed to play past stumps so that the MCC could dismiss them, and the tourists won by an innings and 12 runs. This received some criticism in the Australian press, who forgot that Hutton had sportingly allowed the wicket to be remade.|$|E
60|$|Some {{way down}} the glen, the stream, already grown to a good bulk of water, was rudely dammed across, and {{about a third of}} it {{abducted}} in a wooden trough. Gaily the pure water, air's first cousin, fleeted along the rude aqueduct, whose sides and floor it had made green with grasses. The path, bearing it close company, threaded a wilderness of briar and wild-rose. And presently, a little in front, the <b>brown</b> <b>top</b> of a mill and the tall mill-wheel, spraying diamonds, arose in the narrows of the glen; {{at the same time the}} snoring music of the saws broke the silence.|$|E
