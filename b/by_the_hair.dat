But the warrior follows him in, and beheads him at the altar before help can arrive. The murderer then mutilates the boy's body. The mourning of the Trojans at Troilus' death is great.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines with coffee, and returned to pitch. In August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups. The Pirates {{told him not to}} wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted a spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> curlers.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E

Sometimes, an incident involving Jim Carrey forgetting a line led to animosity between the two actors during filming. Between scenes Jim Carrey often remained in character as Andy Kaufman {{and at one point}} spit on Jerry, just as Kaufman had done in 1982.

25|$|A {{shocking}} {{series of}} incidents {{occurred in the}} locality of Hessilhead, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge {{and the next morning}} Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead Castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> pulled her onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only {{a few feet from the}} ground.|$|E

500|$|As well as {{the many}} {{augmented}} and adapted editions of Raspe's text, the fictional Baron has occasionally appeared in other standalone works. In 1838–39, Karl Leberecht Immermann published the long novel Münchhausen: Eine Geschichte in Arabesken (Münchhausen: A History of Arabesques) as an homage to the character, and Adolf Ellissen's Munchausens Lügenabenteur, an elaborate expansion of the stories, appeared in 1846. In his 1886 philosophical treatise Beyond Good and Evil, Friedrich Nietzsche uses one of the Baron's adventures, {{the one in which}} he rescues himself from a swamp, as a metaphor for belief in complete metaphysical free will; Nietzsche calls this belief an attempt [...] "to pull oneself up into existence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> out of the swamps of nothingness".|$|E
500|$|The toothcomb {{is usually}} used for grooming. While licking the fur clean, the animal {{will run the}} toothcomb through the fur to comb it. Fine grooves or {{striations}} are usually cut into the teeth during grooming <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and may {{be seen on the}} sides of the teeth when viewed through a scanning electron microscope. The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or, in the case of lemuriforms, the sublingua, a specialized [...] "under-tongue". The toothcomb can have other functions, such as food procurement and bark gouging. Within lemuriforms, fork-marked lemurs and indriids have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions. In some lemurs, such as the aye-aye, the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition.|$|E
40|$|A dosimetric {{technique}} has been employed {{to establish the}} amount of erythemal UV radiation protection provided <b>by</b> facial <b>hair</b> considering <b>the</b> influence of solar zenith angle (SZA) and beard/moustache length. <b>The</b> facial <b>hair</b> reduced <b>the</b> exposure ratios to approximately one third of those to the sites with no <b>hair.</b> <b>The</b> variation of the exposure ratios over the different sites was reduced compared to the case with no beard. The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> facial <b>hair</b> ranged from 2 to 21. The UPF decreases with increasing SZA. The minimum UPF was for the 53 - 62 o range. <b>The</b> longer <b>hair</b> provides a higher UPF at the smaller SZA, but the difference between <b>the</b> protection provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> longer <b>hair</b> compared to <b>the</b> shorter <b>hair</b> reduces with increasing SZA.
