40|$|A {{traditional}} symbolic {{representation of}} the idea of ‘object’ (a chair) was offered up to an instrument of musical measure (a musical keyboard) in order to produce metric readings, which were then organised/interpreted so as to provide material for a musical realisation of the object. Thus a musical instrument (the keyboard) is used as a measuring instrument and, by process of inversion, the physical subject/object (the chair) becomes a representation of musical measures. An archetypal chair was chosen from the Ikea catalogue, and the accompanying instructions for its assembly used as a way of deciding upon a measuring procedure and sequence. In this way the instructions also function as a graphic score for the piece. There are five main structural components in a BERTIL chair. These were colour-coded in the score and then ‘played’ in sequence by pressing them into the keyboard, with the direction of motion required in order to achieve an adequate measure of their dimensions suggested by the score. It was decided that only the white notes (which permitted a more consistent and continuous form of contact) would be used. This harmonic restriction not only provides a pleasant tonal centre for the piece (C major/A minor), but middle C also acts as the literal tonal centre for the measurement procedure, with each component offered up to the keyboard symmetrically in relation to that central point. Pitch values are thus dependent upon how the components are constructed (e. g. the width of a chair leg was found to depress two adjoining keys), as well as how they are shown in relation to each other within the assembly instructions. This practical procedural decision exerts a basic contrapuntal compositional device (a sort of ‘contrary motion’) which in turn produces balanced motival form. A moderate tempo of 60 bpm was used so as to provide a suitable rate of movement for accurate readings. This tempo/rate was also chosen in order to provide a comfortable pace in which to ply the components into the keyboard (60 bpm@ 64 mm per second), whilst also allowing the components’ physical dimensions to be directly mirrored in standard rhythmic divisions, i. e. /e. g. at 60 bpm, a beat (a crotchet) lasts one second = 64 mm. A sixteenth note (a semiquaver) thus lasts ¼ of a second = 16 mm. A whole note (a semi-breve/ 4 crotchet beats) last 4 seconds = 256 mm, while at the other extreme of our conversion table a 256 th note lasts 1 / 64 th of a second = 1 mm. The ‘readings’ (pitch values and durations) were then entered into a MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) sequencing computer programme, where a separate musical part was created for each component part, with each assigned a different keyboard sound in order to facilitate identification, clarity and timbral variety. The more drawn out drones tend to be the chair’s legs or the side braces. The larger clusters, relatively short in duration, are when lateral pieces such as back braces depress an extended <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>keys</b> (the seat produces a somewhat longer cluster about three quarters in). The sequence of four short stabs, which reappear at regular intervals, are produced by/representational of the tips of the four upturned chair legs. The piece lasts 2 ’ 25 ”...|$|E

40|$|Weed {{control and}} farming system {{practices}} are being assessed {{for their ability}} to reduce the seed <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> weed species that have developed herbicide resistance. In six long-term field experiments in southern Queensland, we are testing a wide variety of management practices to deplete soil seed <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> annual weed species, such as wild oat, common sowthistle, liverseed grass, barnyard grass and awnless barnyard grass. Irrigation increased the emergence of all species with timing of irrigation being important. Higher stubble levels increased the emergence of larger seeded species including wild oat and awnless barnyard grass, but decreased the emergence of sowthistle. Cultivation reduced emergence of sowthistle and summer grasses, but had little effect on wild oat emergence. The wild oat seed bank was reduced by up to 70 % in the top 5 cm of soil either with or without cultivation. However, cultivation increased the number of wild oat seeds persisting below 5 cm. Data suggest that wetter environments will encourage a more rapid depletion of summer grasses and sowthistle through increased emergence.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, a {{significant}} number of industrialized countries have successfully adopted inflation targeting as a framework of monetary policy.

30|$|Despite the {{enormous}} damage {{of the financial}} crisis of 2008 effective reforms in the financial system have been curbed by those with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. For example, the banking establishment is well aware that the government will guarantee <b>bank</b> liabilities <b>of</b> <b>key</b> credit and insurance institutions whose failure would certainly provoke a systemic contagion in the entire financial system, putting in jeopardy the payment system. Thus, the main bottleneck may not be technical but political [18, 19]. A strong political will is required to curb the control that “too big to fail banks” hold on the entire economic system. Nonetheless, political action in order to be effective and serve the common good must be informed by up to date scientific studies. For example, in 2009 one major Spanish bank was created -with a broad consensus among the parliamentary political groupings- from the conglomeration of seven small regional saving banks. Some months later the government nationalized the bank. Were those policy makers aware of network-based studies of financial contagion, this could have resulted in a much less harmful outcome for the taxpayer. As it is shown in [20], the creation <b>of</b> conglomerates <b>of</b> <b>banks,</b> lowers diversity across the system as whole, and increases the systemic risk of failure.|$|R
