The present study proposes a noninvasive, real-time communication assistive methodology for those with restricted communication ability, employing a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor. The communication assistive methodology comprises a <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> analyzer using an FBG sensor, which acquires the exhalation force that is converted into strain variations on a cantilever. The FBG <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> analyzer along with specific breath patterns, which are programmed to give specific audio output commands, constitutes the proposed fiber Bragg grating sensor-based communication assistive device. The basic communication can be carried out by instructing the patients with restricted communication ability to perform the specific breath patterns. The present approach is intended to be an alternative to the common approach of brain-computer interface in which an instrument is utilized for learning of brain responses.

In this study, 418 breath samples were collected from 65 patients with CRC, 22 with advanced or nonadvanced adenomas, and 122 control cases. All patients, including the controls, had undergone colonoscopy. The samples were analysed with two different techniques. The first technique relied on gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The T-test was used to identify significant VOCs (p values < 0. 017). The second technique relied on sensor analysis with a pattern recognition method for building a <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> to identify different groups. Blind analysis or leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for validation. The GC-MS analysis revealed four significant VOCs that identified the tested groups; these were acetone and ethyl acetate (higher in CRC), ethanol and 4 -methyl octane (lower in CRC). The sensor-analysis distinguished CRC from the control group with 85 % sensitivity, 94 % specificity and 91 % accuracy.

40|$|Background Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) is highly {{prevalent}} and associated with cardiovascular and metabolic changes. OSA is usually diagnosed by polysomnography which is time-consuming and provides little {{information on the}} patient’s phenotype thus limiting a personalized treatment approach. Exhaled breath contains information on metabolism which can be analyzed by mass spectrometry within minutes. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify a breath-profile in OSA recurrence by use of secondary-electrospray-ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS). Methods Patients with OSA effectively treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) were randomized to either withdraw treatment (subtherapeutic CPAP) or continue therapeutic CPAP for two weeks. Exhaled breath analysis by untargeted SESI-MS was performed at baseline and two weeks after randomization. The primary outcome was the change in exhaled molecular <b>breath</b> <b>pattern.</b> Results 30 patients with OSA were randomized and 26 completed the trial according to the protocol. CPAP withdrawal led to a recurrence of OSA (mean difference in change of oxygen desaturation index between groups + 30. 3 /h; 95 %CI: 19. 8 /h, 40. 7 /h, p< 0. 001) which was accompanied by a significant change in 62 exhaled features (16 metabolites identified). The panel of discriminating mass-spectral features allowed differentiation between treated and untreated OSA with a sensitivity of 92. 9 % and a specificity of 84. 6 %. Conclusions Exhaled breath analysis by SESI-MS allows rapid and accurate detection of OSA recurrence.

40|$|Although {{there is}} growing {{evidence}} that breathing is modulated by various motor and cognitive activities, the nature of breathing in musical performance has been little explored. The present study examined the temporal <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> in piano performance, aiming to elucidate how breath timing is related to musical organization/events and performance. In the experiments, the respiration of 15 professional and amateur pianists, playing 10 music excerpts in total (from four-octave C major scale, Hanon’s exercise, J. S. Bach’s Invention, Mozart’s Sonatas, and Debussy’s Clair de lune), was monitored by capnography. The relationship between breathing and musical characteristics was analyzed. Five major results were obtained. 1) Mean breath interval was shortened for excerpts in faster tempi. 2) Fluctuation of breath intervals was reduced for the pieces for finger exercise and those in faster tempi. Pianists showing large within-trial fluctuation also exhibited large inter-excerpt difference. 3) Inter-trial consistency of the breath patterns depended on the excerpts. Consistency was generally reduced for the excerpts that could be performed mechanically (i. e., pieces for finger exercise), but interestingly, {{one third of the}} participant showed consistent patterns for the simple scale, correlated with the ascending/descending sequences. 4) Pianists tended to exhale just after the music onsets, inhale at the rests, and inhibit inhale during the slur parts. There was correlation between breathing pattern and two-voice polyphonic structure for several participants. 5) Respiratory patterns were notably different among the pianists. Every pianist showed his or her own characteristic features commonly for various musical works. These findings suggest that breathing in piano performance depends not only on musical parameters and organization written in the score but also some pianist-dependent factors which might be ingrained to individual pianists...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the evolution of}} a water drop saturated with NaCl and the growth of pure water droplets in a <b>breath</b> figure <b>pattern</b> (BF) condensing around it. This salty drop acts as a humidity sink, inhibiting the BF inside a ring at a distance r=δ from the sink center and slowing down BF growth outside the ring. The initial salty drop is taken either from a salt-saturated solution (type I experiment) or by placing an NaCl crystal on the substrate (type II experiment). The results are similar, provided that the initial time for type II evolution is taken {{at the end of the}} crystal dissolution. The evolution of the salty drop radius R is deduced from the establishment of a three-dimensional hyperbolic concentration profile around the salty drop. This profile scales with r/δ. Accounting for the salt concentration decrease with salty drop growth, R is seen to grow as t 5. In the region r>δ, water droplets nucleate and grow. The rate of evolution of the water droplets at constant r/δ can be used to determine the local water pressure. The corresponding data reasonably agree with a hyperbolic water vapor profile around the salty drop.

40|$|The breath-hold {{is one of}} the {{techniques}} to obtain the dose escalation for lung tumors. However, the change of the patient's <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> can influence the stability of the inhaled air volume, IAV, used in this work as a surrogate parameter to assure the tumor position reproducibility during dose delivery. MATERIALS AND METHOD: In this paper, an Elekta active breathing coordinator has been used for lung tumor irradiation. This device is not an absolute spirometer and the feasibility study here presented developed (i) the possibility to select a specific range epsilon of IAV values comfortable for the patient and (ii) the ability of a transit signal rate S(t), obtained by a small ion-chamber positioned on the portal image device, to supply in real time the in vivo isocenter dose reproducibility. Indeed, while the selection of the IAV range depends on the patient's ability to follow instructions for breath-hold, the S(t) monitoring can supply to the radiation therapist a surrogate of the tumor irradiation reproducibility. RESULTS: The detection of the S(t) in real time during breath-hold was used to determine the interfraction isocenter dose variations due to the reproducibility of the patient's breathing pattern. The agreement between the reconstructed and planned isocenter dose in breath-hold at the interfraction level was well within 1. 5 %, while in free breathing a disagreement up to 8 % was observed. The standard deviation of the S(t) in breath-hold observed at the intrafraction level is a bit higher than the one obtained without the patient and this can be justified by the presence of a small residual tumor motion as heartbeat. CONCLUSION: The technique is simple and can be implemented for routine use in a busy clinic...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of human respiratory signals {{is crucial in}} cyberbiological systems. A disordered breathing pattern can be the first symptom of different physiological, mechanical, or psychological dysfunctions. Therefore, a real-time monitoring of the respiration patterns, as well as respiration rate is a critical need in medical applications. There are several methods for respiration rate measurement. However, despite their accuracy, these methods are expensive {{and could not be}} integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based platform for both monitoring the respiration rate and <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> classification, remotely. The proposed system is designed particularly for patients with breathing problems (e. g., respiratory complications after surgery) or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud-computing model. We also suggest a procedure to improve the accuracy of respiration rate for patients at rest positions. The overall error in the respiration rate calculation is obtained 0. 53 % considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the reference. Five types of respiration disorders, Bradapnea, Tachypnea, Cheyn-stokes, Kaussmal, and Biot’s breathing are classified based on hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) with seven different features. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed classification while it is individualized to every subject (case 1) as well as considering all subjects (case 2). Since the selection of kernel function is a key factor to decide SVM’s performance, in this paper three different kernel functions are evaluated. The experiments are conducted with 11 subjects and the average accuracy of 94. 52 % for case 1 and the accuracy of 81. 29 % for case 2 are achieved based on Radial Basis Function (RBF).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Before {{a patient}} can be {{connected}} to a mechanical ventilator, the controls of the apparatus need {{to be set up}} appropriately. Today, this is done by the intensive care professional. With the advent of closed loop controlled mechanical ventilation, methods will be needed to select appropriate start up settings automatically. The objective of our study was to test such a computerized method which could eventually be used as a start-up procedure (first 5 - 10 minutes of ventilation) for closed-loop controlled ventilation. DESIGN: Prospective Study. SETTINGS: ICU's in two adult and one children's hospital. PATIENTS: 25 critically ill adult patients (age > or = 15 y) and 17 critically ill children selected at random were studied. INTERVENTIONS: To stimulate 'initial connection', the patients were disconnected from their ventilator and transiently connected to a modified Hamilton AMADEUS ventilator for maximally one minute. During that time they were ventilated with a fixed and standardized <b>breath</b> <b>pattern</b> (Test Breaths) based on pressure controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (PCSIMV). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Measurements of airway flow, airway pressure and instantaneous CO 2 concentration using a mainstream CO 2 analyzer were made at the mouth during application of the Test-Breaths. Test-Breaths were analyzed in terms of tidal volume, expiratory time constant and series dead space. Using this data an initial ventilation pattern consisting of respiratory frequency and tidal volume was calculated. This ventilation pattern was compared to the one measured prior to the onset of the study using a two-tailed paired t-test. Additionally, it was compared to a conventional method for setting up ventilators. The computer-proposed ventilation pattern did not differ significantly from the actual pattern (p > 0. 05), while the conventional method did. However the scatter was large and in 6 cases deviations in the minute ventilation of more than 50 % were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of standardized Test Breaths allows automatic determination of an initial ventilation pattern for intubated ICU patients. While this pattern {{does not seem to be}} superior to the one chosen by the conventional method, it is derived fully automatically and without need for manual patient data entry such as weight or height. This makes the method potentially useful as a start up procedure for closed-loop controlled ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is one of}} the leading causes of death in the world. In the United States alone, it is {{estimated}} that approximately every 25 seconds, a new CAD event will occur, and approximately every minute, someone will die of one. The detection of CAD during in its early stages is very critical to reduce the mortality rates. Magnetic resonance imaging of myocardial perfusion (MR-MPI) has been receiving significant attention over the last decade due to its ability to provide a unique view of the microcirculation blood flow in the myocardial tissue through the coronary vascular network. The ability of MR-MPI to detect changes in microcirculation during early stages of ischemic events makes it a useful tool in identifying myocardial tissues that are alive but at the risk of dying. However this technique is not yet fully established clinically due to fundamental limitations imposed by the MRI device physics. The limitations of current MRI schemes often make it challenging to simultaneously achieve high spatio-temporal resolution, sufficient spatial coverage, and good image quality in myocardial perfusion MRI. Furthermore, the acquisitions are typically set up to acquire images during breath holding. This often results in motion artifacts due to improper <b>breath</b> hold <b>patterns.</b> This dissertation deals with developing novel image reconstruction methods in conjunction with non-Cartesian sampling for the reconstruction of dynamic MRI data from highly accelerated / under-sampled Fourier measurements. The reconstruction methods are based on adaptive signal models to represent the dynamic data using few model coefficients. Three novel adaptive reconstruction methods are developed and validated: (a) low rank and sparsity based modeling, (b) blind compressed sensing, and (c) motion compensated compressed sensing. The developed methods are applicable to a wide range of dynamic imaging problems. In the context of MR-MPI, this dissertation show feasibilities that the developed methods can enable free breathing myocardial perfusion MRI acquisitions with high spatio-temporal resolutions (3 ̆c 2 mm x 2 mm, 1 heart beat) and slice coverage (upto 8 slices) ...|$|R
60|$|The spell upon it {{was more}} wasting than the spell that used to set enchanted houses {{sleeping}} once upon a time, but left their waking freshness unimpaired. The passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about it. Within doors, curtains, drooping heavily, lost their old folds and shapes, and hung like cumbrous palls. Hecatombs of furniture, still piled and covered up, shrunk like imprisoned and forgotten men, and changed insensibly. Mirrors were dim as with the <b>breath</b> of years. <b>Patterns</b> of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint, like the memory of those years' trifling incidents. Boards, starting at unwonted footsteps, creaked and shook. Keys rusted in the locks of doors. Damp started on the walls, and as the stains came out, the pictures seemed {{to go in and}} secrete themselves. Mildew and mould began to lurk in closets. Fungus trees grew in corners of the cellars. Dust accumulated, nobody knew whence nor how; spiders, moths, and grubs were heard of every day. An exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable upon the stairs, or in an upper room, as wondering how he got there. Rats began to squeak and scuffle in the night time, through dark galleries they mined behind the panelling.|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] To analyse {{the breath}} of {{patients}} with schizophrenia {{for the presence of}} abnormal volatile organic compounds. METHODS [...] A case comparison study was performed in two community hospitals in Staten Island, New York. Twenty five patients with schizophrenia, 26 patients with other psychiatric disorders, and 38 normal controls were studied. Alveolar breath samples were collected from all participants, and volatile organic compounds in the breath were assayed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy. Differences in the distribution of volatile organic compounds between the three groups were compared by computerised pattern recognition analysis. RESULTS [...] Forty eight different volatile organic compounds were observed in the breath samples. Three separate pattern recognition methods indicated an increased differentiation capability between the patients with schizophrenia and the other subjects. Pattern recognition category classification models using 11 of these volatile organic compounds identified the patients with schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 80. 0 % and a specificity of 61. 9 %. Volatile organic compounds in breath were not significantly affected by drug therapy, age, sex, smoking, diet, or race. CONCLUSIONS [...] Microanalysis of volatile organic compounds in <b>breath</b> combined with <b>pattern</b> recognition analysis of data may provide a new approach to the diagnosis and understanding of schizophrenia. The physiological basis of these findings is still speculative...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Colorectal {{carcinoma}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cancers in the Netherlands. Every year, approximately 12, 000 people are diagnosed with colon cancer. Screening and early treatment of cancer is important; it increases the chance of survival. At present there is no good screening method available. The options for screening include faecal occult blood examination and a colonoscopy. The screening of faeces for occult blood is not invasive but has low sensitivity and specificity: not very suitable as a screening tool. Colonoscopy is an invasive examination that is expensive. An optimal screening method has a high sensitivity and specificity, is not invasive and inexpensive: so currently there is no such screening method for colorectal carcinoma. Japanese studies indicate that there is evidence of metabolic changes in the blood of patients with colorectal cancer compared with healthy controls. These metabolic changes were found by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC MS) techniques. Perhaps herein lays an opportunity for a new screening method. But GC MS is technically difficult and the laboratory requirements are expensive so this method is not a good tool for screening. Recent studies have shown that on a small-scale the electronic nose can distinguish between patients with lungcancer and their healthy controls by exhaled breath. This exhaled air contains a mixture of many volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which is read as a pattern (“breathprint”) by the electronic nose without identifying the solitary compounds. The idea behind this mechanism in patients with lung cancer is that the electronic nose detects the metabolic changes in the breath that at least partly mirror the metabolic changes in the blood. This gave rise to the thought that the technique of the electronic nose could be of use to distinguish between patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls by their <b>breath</b> <b>pattern.</b> Hypothesis: Patients with colorectal cancer have a different breathprint compared to healthy controls. Question: Can the electronic nose discriminate between the VOC pattern in exhaled air (breathprint) of patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls? Method: We performed a case-control observational study with patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls, matched based on age, sex and smoking history. Patients with histological proven colorectal cancer, without diabetes could be enrolled from the Gastro Enterological outpatient department of the Medical Centre Leeuwarden. They performed a breath test in which exhaled breath was collected in a Tedlarbag, followed by lung function test (spirometry). Then the exhaled breath was analyzed by the electronic nose (Cyranose 320) and the breathprints of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: Eventually, 8 colorectal carcinoma patients and 8 matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly except for (cardiovascular) co-morbidity. The complex breathprint-data was reduced to 4 principal components capturing more than 98 % of the variance of the original raw sensordata. Statistical analysis on these principal components revealed no discrimination between the groups. There was no distinction between the exhaled VOC pattern of these patients with colorectal cancer and their healthy controls. Conclusion: In this small pilot study no significant difference was found between the exhaled VOC pattern of patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls analyzed by the electronic nose Cyranose 320. Implication: this study should be repeated with a larger number of participants to reach sufficient power to confirm this result. ...|$|E

Therefore, efficient prodn. processes are needed for high surface area, porous membranes with distinct catalytic nanoparticles {{on opposite sides of}} a support that resists oxidn. and separates the products, e. g., hydrogen and oxygen. <b>Breath</b> figure (BF) <b>patterning</b> is an established method to create microstructured honeycomb-patterned porous polymer films. This research shows that surfaceactive nanoparticles can self-assemble onto the interfaces between the templating BF water droplets and the polymer soln. to control micrometer and nanometerscale hierarchical structure. Here, amphiphilic "Janus" nanoparticles serve as both solid surfactants and Pickering emulsion stabilizing agents, thus able to optimize ordering degree of the honeycomb structures and nanoparticle enrichment in the pore walls. Janus nanoparticles were synthesized using literature methods (with improvements that will be presented) : functionalizing only the exposed surface of particles embedded on the surface of wax microspheres (colloidosomes) renders half of the particle hydrophobic. They were then employed in the BFs templating method for the first time, resulting in regular, porous films with uniform, high nanoparticle d. Humble materials (silica and polystyrene) demonstrate the method, and can now be replaced by catalyst nanoparticles (e. g., nickel, molybdenum sulfide, or cobalt-based) embedded in a semiconducting polymer to create membranes for photocatalytic water splitting...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of breathing pattern on lung deposition and bronchodilator response to nebulised salbutamol is uncertain. Three different breathing patterns were assessed in eight {{patients with chronic}} stable asthma. Salbutamol solution (2. 5 mg in 4 ml) mixed with technetium- 99 m labelled human serum albumin was nebulised by an Acorn nebuliser at a flow rate of 6 litres a minute. Particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 4. 8 microns were produced for inhalation by (a) tidal breathing, (b) six tidal breaths followed by three deep breaths, and (c) six tidal breaths followed by three deep breaths with a five second breath hold after each <b>breath.</b> Each breathing <b>pattern</b> was continued for four minutes. There {{was no significant difference}} in the percentage of radioaerosol deposited in the lung or in the distribution of radioaerosol within the lung as assessed by gamma camera imaging. Changes in bronchodilator responses as measured by peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), and forced vital capacity (FVC) 30, 45, and 60 minutes after inhalation were similar for the three studies. The mean (SEM) maximum percentage change in FEV 1 was 44 (7. 1), 47 (9. 2), and 51 (8. 4) for studies 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The percentage of nebulised solution deposited in the body was also similar for the three breathing patterns [...] that is, 11 - 13 %, of which 98 % entered the lung. This study shows that inhaling a nebulised aerosol by tidal breathing, the simplest method, is as effective as tidal breathing with deep breaths with or without a breath hold...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of hierarchically ordered arrays of spherical cavities on polymer films {{is of interest}} due to potential applications {{in the preparation of}} photonic bandgap materials, environmental sen-sors, and patterned light emitting diodes (LED). While many methods are known for the prepara-tion of these porous materials, the breath figure approach has received significant scrutiny because of the simple and robust mechanism of <b>pattern</b> formation. 1 <b>Breath</b> figures are <b>patterned</b> arrays of micrometer-sized defects in a polymer film, formed when water droplets condensed onto a polymer solution surface during film drying. By controlling variables such as relative humidity and solvent, the feature size and uniformity of the resultant pattern can be controlled. The breath figure approach is valuable because it provides the advantages of large area ordering in the nano and micrometer re-gime, is versatile, and inexpensive. The process is driven by the evaporation of an ap-propriate solvent under humid conditions, leading to a decrease in temperature at the air-liquid inter-face, resulting in water condensation. 2 The drop-wise condensation proceeds according to several steps shown in Figure 1. The first stage involves nucleation of the water droplets on the polymer solution surface. During the second stage, the drop-lets become larger and coalesce to minimize interfa-cial energy differences, resulting in pattern forma-tion. With properly controlled conditions, a subsequent ordering of the droplets into a hexago-nal lattice is observed. 3 The temperature difference between the surface and the ambient conditions is minimized once the surface of the film is covered with water droplets. At this stage, the water drop-lets sink into the solution (depending upon solution density). Upon complete evaporation of the sol-vent, the pattern of the droplets generated in the polymer matrix is preserved as a hexagonally or-dered array of pores with a honeycomb structure. 4,...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether the muscle strength decrease that follows {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) reconstruction would lead to different cardiorespiratory adjustments during dynamic exercise. Method: Eighteen active male subjects were submitted to isokinetic evaluation of knee flexor and extensor muscles four months after ACL surgery. Thigh circumference was also measured and an incremental unilateral cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed separately for both involved and uninvolved lower limbs in order to compare heart rate, oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, and ventilatory <b>pattern</b> (<b>breath</b> rate, tidal volume, inspiratory time, expiratory time, tidal volume/inspiratory time) at three different workloads (moderate, anaerobic threshold, and maximal). Results: There {{was a significant difference}} between isokinetic extensor peak torque measured in the involved (116. 5 ± 29. 1 Nm) and uninvolved (220. 8 ± 40. 4 Nm) limbs, p= 0. 000. Isokinetic flexor peak torque was also lower in the involved limb than in the uninvolved limb (107. 8 ± 15. 4 and 132. 5 ± 26. 3 Nm, p= 0. 004, respectively). Lower values were also found in involved thigh circumference as compared with uninvolved limb (46. 9 ± 4. 3 and 48. 5 ± 3. 9 cm, p= 0. 005, respectively). No {{differences were found between the}} lower limbs in any of the variables of the incremental cardiopulmonary tests at all exercise intensities. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, four months after ACL surgery, there is a significant deficit in isokinetic strength in the involved limb, but these differences in muscle strength requirement do not produce differences in the cardiorespiratory adjustments to exercise. Based on the hypotheses from the literature which explain the differences in the physiological responses to exercise for different muscle masses, we can deduce that, after 4 months of a rehabilitation program after an ACL reconstruction, individuals probably do not present differences in muscle oxidative and peripheral perfusion capacities that could elicit higher levels of peripheral cardiorepiratory stimulus during exercise...|$|R
40|$|Pulsed lasers {{proved to}} be {{advantageous}} tools for the stimulation of pattern formation in complex systems. Their capability to support thermodynamic, kinetic and spatial control facilitates the direction of self-organization processes into selective channels. The short lifetime of laser-stimulated processes was identified {{to be the key}} aspect that enables for the synthesis of functional materials starting from complex systems. When self-organization is abruptly stopped after a few nanoseconds, this creates materials present in a non-equilibrium state, which are known to exhibit special properties. A prominent example is the distinctively different behavior of gold nanoparticles compared to bulk gold. Repeated laser stimulation was demonstrated to be a powerful method that enables selective adjustments of material properties emergent in the course of self-organized pattern formation in complex systems. This includes a broad spectrum of optical, electrical, magnetic and catalytic properties, which are not found in the starting materials prior to laser modification. The capability of lasers to trigger self-organization processes with spatial control was identified to be an interesting feature because it bears the potential to create materials with advanced functionality. In particular, the utilization of a phenomenon called laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) {{proved to be}} very efficient. LIPSS transformed the surface of stainless steel into hierarchical structures thus equipping this everyday material with a multifunctional surface. Considering the simplicity of the generation process this demonstrates the viability of nature’s low-effort-high-outcome-principle of order formation in complex systems. In addition to that, the application <b>breath</b> of laser-stimulated <b>pattern</b> formation was successfully expanded to temperature sensitive materials by including photochemistry into the concept. The large variety of reaction types accessible via photochemistry opens an even wider field of potential applications. In conclusion, it can be stated that the concept of nature to trigger selective reorganizations and pattern formation in complex systems can be imitated in its principles. The introduced concept of laser-directed self-organization and reaction control in complex systems prospects a large application potential. Presented insights into laser-stimulated reaction pathways and pattern formations processes provide a valuable basis for future studies in this field. Overall, the major challenge that must be met on the way to beneficial applications is the need for purposeful design of materials, which requires a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles behind self-organization...|$|R
