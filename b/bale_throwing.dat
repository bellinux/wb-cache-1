5|$|The village holds typical English rural festivals {{during the}} year. The spring and harvest festivals are horticultural shows {{that include the}} {{surrounding}} villages. The country fair (or fête) in the summer previously included traditional country games, stalls and attractions such as hay <b>bale</b> <b>throwing,</b> tug of war and a coconut shy, although the village has not held a fête since 2009. Wormshill contains a community village hall and recreation ground, including a small playground. The 9th Sittingbourne (Tunstall and Wormshill) Scout Group {{are associated with the}} village and group meetings are occasionally held at the village hall. Wormshill, together with the united benefice villages of Bredgar, Milstead, Bicknor and Frinsted, also produces a free monthly Parish Magazine including village news, announcements and occasional articles. In common with a number of rural communities in the county, Wormshill also receives a weekly mobile library service run by Kent County Council.|$|E
50|$|Rural Heritage Day — This {{living history}} event is held every two years. It {{includes}} {{a wide range}} of rural domestic and working exhibitions from: blade shearing to dog handling, and jam making to blacksmithing. Competitions such as hay <b>bale</b> <b>throwing</b> (over rugby posts) and rides on traction engines are particularly popular.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, as tractor {{horsepower}} increased, the thrower-baler became possible, which {{eliminated the}} need for someone {{to stand on the}} wagon and pick up the finished bales. The first thrower mechanism used two fast-moving friction belts to grab finished <b>bales</b> and <b>throw</b> them at an angle up in the air onto the bale wagon. The bale wagon was modified from a flatbed into a three-sided skeleton frame open at the front, to act as a catcher's net for the <b>thrown</b> <b>bales.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s most farmers would bale hay in {{the field}} with a small tractor with 20 or less horsepower, and the tied bales would be dropped onto the ground as the baler moved through the field. Another team of workers with horses and a flatbed wagon would come by and use a sharp metal hook to grab the <b>bale</b> and <b>throw</b> it up onto the wagon while an {{assistant}} stacks the bale, for transport to the barn.|$|R
60|$|She {{heard the}} robbers {{knocking}} things {{about in the}} cabin. They <b>threw</b> <b>bales</b> of beaver pelts out of the door. Presently Fresno reappeared carrying a buckskin sack in which Slingerland kept his money and few valuables, and the others followed, quarreling over a cane-covered demijohn in which there had once been liquor.|$|R
5000|$|Square Grouper: The Godfathers of Ganja is a 2011 {{documentary}} by director Billy Corben (Cocaine Cowboys) {{and produced}} by Alfred Spellman and Billy Corben through their Miami-based media studio Rakontur. The term square grouper was a nickname given to <b>bales</b> of marijuana <b>thrown</b> overboard {{or out of}} airplanes in South Florida in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Chester Hilliard, 24, {{the only}} {{passenger}} to survive, had helped crew members <b>throw</b> <b>bales</b> of cotton {{to people in}} the water. He climbed onto the last bale at 8:00 p.m., along with ship’s fireman Benjamin Cox. About eight hours later, Cox, weak from hypothermia, fell off the bale and drowned. At 11:00 a.m., Hilliard was rescued by the sloop Merchant.|$|R
60|$|There {{he saw a}} {{sight that}} would have {{surprised}} any man except a superintendent of police. Mrs Davis was engaged in <b>throwing</b> <b>bales</b> of cloth over the window with the energy of a coal-heaver and the haste of one whose house is on fire! The poor woman was not robust, yet the easy way in which she handled those bales was quite marvellous.|$|R
50|$|Gōeidō won {{his first}} five bouts in the {{following}} Kyūshū tournament, but then was defeated by komusubi Tamawashi on Day 6. On Day 8 against sekiwake Okinoumi {{he was forced to}} the edge of the ring but with his left heel back on the straw <b>bales</b> he <b>threw</b> his opponent down. The referee awarded the bout to Gōeidō but the judges overruled his decision, with the chief judge Tomozuna announcing to the crowd that in his opinion Gōeido's body was already out of the ring (shini-tai) before Okinoumi hit the ground. Gōeidō's promotion hopes were ended by a third defeat to fellow ōzeki Kisenosato on Day 9. Gōeidō went on to win the next three days, but then lost the final three days where he faced all three yokozuna. Gōeidō finished the tournament with a 9-6 record, dashing his hopes of perhaps being under consideration for promotion in January.|$|R
50|$|People {{who keep}} {{small numbers of}} animals may prefer small bales that can be handled by one person without machinery. There is also a risk that hay bales may be moldy, or contain {{decaying}} carcasses of small creatures that were accidentally killed by baling equipment and swept up into the bale, which can produce toxins such as botulism. Both can be deadly to non-ruminant herbivores, such as horses, and when this occurs, the entire contaminated <b>bale</b> generally is <b>thrown</b> out, another reason some people continue to support the market for small bales.|$|R
60|$|William said {{he would}} agree to them all with all his heart, but that the not {{speaking}} English would be the hardest, but he would do his best for that too; so, in a word, we agreed to go from Venice to Naples, where we converted a large sum of money into bales of silk, left a large sum in a merchant's hands at Venice, and another considerable sum at Naples, and took bills of exchange for a great deal too; and yet we came with such a cargo to London as few American merchants had done for some years, for we loaded in two ships seventy-three <b>bales</b> of <b>thrown</b> silk, besides thirteen bales of wrought silks, from the duchy of Milan, shipped at Genoa, with all which I arrived safely; and some time after I married my faithful protectress, William's sister, with whom I am much more happy than I deserve.|$|R
50|$|Vicksburg {{put into}} Hampton Roads {{two days later}} and was {{deployed}} with the blockade off Wilmington, North Carolina, on 18 February. In the spring, while on temporary duty {{off the coast of}} South Carolina, the gunboat seized the blockade-running British schooner Indian east of Charleston on 30 April. Returning to North Carolina, Vicksburg towed the stricken mortar schooner Oliver H. Lee to Beaufort, N.C., on 17 May and 18 May and chased a blockade runner on 31 May, recovering 79 <b>bales</b> of cotton <b>thrown</b> overboard by the vessel's crew. The gunboat put into Hampton Roads for repairs in June.|$|R
60|$|The {{offer was}} too tempting to be rejected, {{and the men}} hurried down and began to prepare a large sailing boat. Leslie and Lieutenant Long had a hasty consultation, and agreed that, seeing the {{difficulty}} there would be in obtaining horses, it was useless to take more than ten men in all. Accordingly, {{as soon as the}} boat was in readiness, the two officers, Mike, and seven soldiers took their places in her. The sails were closely reefed, and she at once put out into the Firth. Every minute the wind rose, until, {{by the time they were}} half across, it was blowing a gale. The boat was a stout one, but the waves broke freely over her, and four of the soldiers were kept at work <b>baling</b> to <b>throw</b> out the water she took over her bows. Once or twice they thought that she would capsize, so furious were the gusts, but the boatmen were quick and skillful. The sheets were let go and the sails lowered until the force of the squall abated, and at last, after a passage which seemed rapid even to those on board, anxious as they were, she entered the little port.|$|R
25|$|On Stage 15 Schleck was race {{leader and}} {{pressing}} the pace over the day's final climb of Port de <b>Bales</b> when he <b>threw</b> his chain. Contador and Denis Menchov immediately {{moved to the}} front and attacked, pressing the advantage over the crest of the climb and all the way back down into Bagneres-de-Luchon. They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders, all looking to gain time. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow jersey and 39 seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium {{at the end of the}} stage.|$|R
50|$|Contador was a {{favorite}} coming into the 2010 Tour de France, along with Team Saxo Bank's Andy Schleck.

Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium {{at the end of the}} stage. It is an unusual occurrence in the Tour for the new race leader to be met with whistles and cat calls as he is given the yellow jersey. The yellow jersey changing shoulders made a large difference in the remainder of the race, for now the onus was on Schleck to attack Contador, and not the other way around.|$|R
