This means that they are no longer represented by physical certificates, but instead by data entered into the Clearstream systems.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} two {{important}} and contemporary phenomena {{at the heart}} of the financial markets and the policymaking process i. e. (i) the policymaker’s role on the critical features of the intermediated holding infrastructure that exacerbate securities shortfall; and (ii) the purposeless effect of policymaking. The main aims of this study are to contribute to the deficient awareness on the former and provide a long-needed framework of analysis for the latter, which represent also the originality and the significance of this study. The intermediated securities holding system is a financial market infrastructure: (i) operated by intermediaries (banks and other financial firms and market infrastructures), and (ii) where the securities are acquired, held and disposed of in <b>book-entry</b> (electronic) <b>form</b> with the intermediation of such a party. This is a fundamental but technical and silent aspect of the financial markets understood by a few people who are experts on the subject. The modern shape of the intermediated holding infrastructure has been determined not only by its private players but also substantially by the policymaker. We have observed several characteristics of the system, reinforced by the policymaker, that deserve continuous scrutiny in terms of investor protection such as the infrastructure complexity, lack of system transparency, asymmetric advantage of intermediaries, risky proliferation of the asset reuse chain and complex investor protection regimes to name a few. We argue that these critical characteristics contribute to a system difficult to be understood and disciplined by the investor and which is vulnerable to securities shortfall. The shortfall is ultimately born by the investor directly or as a taxpayer indirectly, in the case of severe shortfalls in the system that require bailout or bail-in intervention, an outcome that defies the primary purpose of the policymaker’s intervention in the infrastructure i. e. investor protection. The main result stemming from the above observation is that we may be dealing with a typical case of the purposeless effect of policymaking on the infrastructure i. e. consequences that defy the very purpose of the acts that influenced such consequences. To our dissatisfaction, however, the existing literature suffers from the lack of a proper framework for analysing the purposeless consequences of policymaking and the inherent factors that lead to such consequences (the “usual suspects”). In the second part of this study we fill this gap by developing such a framework. For this purpose we have borrowed R. K. Merton’s framework for analysing the problematic consequences of social action (1936) and whose traces can be found unacknowledged though deeply embedded in the more contemporary theories. This framework consists in a typology of the inherent factors that produce unanticipated consequences such as lack of information, error, imperious immediacy of interest, basic values and self-fulfilling and self-defeating prophecy. We have extended this framework to include the intentional aspect of the action and have enriched it with persuasive insights from various disciplines, such as information asymmetry, behavioural biases, capture theory, laissez-fare and paternalistic ideologies of policymaking and performativity to name a few. As a result we offer a comprehensive, balanced, strong, contemporary, multidisciplinary and promising framework for analysing the purposeless consequences of policymaking in general, including on the intermediated holding infrastructure in particular. Ultimately, due to its general applicability, the framework provides a common theoretical and practical ground for the hypothesis, debates and applications on various actors’ behaviour to take place, the suitability and the review of the policymaking process being only one of them...|$|R
50|$|Most {{investors who}} use an online broker {{or even a}} regular full-service broker will have their shares held in <b>book-entry</b> <b>form.</b> This is {{generally}} convenient, as {{one does not have}} to preserve physical stock certificates, and can buy/sell securities without turning certificates in or having new ones issued. Also, replacement costs for certificates are high in case one loses them, while book-entry ownership can never be lost thanks to technological backups.|$|E
5000|$|Issue and cancel {{certificates}} {{to reflect}} changes in ownership. For example, {{when a company}} declares a stock dividend or stock split, the transfer agent issues new shares. Transfer agents keep records of who owns a company's stocks and bonds and how those stocks and bonds are held—whether by the owner in certificate form, by the company in <b>book-entry</b> <b>form,</b> or by the investor's brokerage firm in street name. They also keep records of how many shares or bonds each investor owns.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{working with}} the {{securities}} industry, developed a new form of, [...] "direct holding system" [...] that would allow both the speedy settlement of securities transactions and communication between shareholders and their companies. This new system was a type of book-entry direct registration system (DRS) operated by stock transfer agent. This concept would allow any retail investor who wants his or her securities to be registered directly on the books of the issuer, but does not necessarily want to receive a certificate, to register those securities in <b>book-entry</b> <b>form</b> directly on the books of the issuer. The DRS concept {{has been slow to}} develop for two reasons. First, many investors do not understand that if they give up paper certificates while joining a DRS, this will return them to the status of direct shareholders of the issuer rather than just customers of a broker (who is the registered shareholder {{in the eyes of the}} issuer), and second, once brokers and banks had been inserted as the [...] "indispensable" [...] middlemen between shareholders and issuers, they were not eager to surrender this privileged position of control. As a result, one version of the [...] "direct holding system" [...] is an inefficient relic of the past and a modern DRS form of direct holding remains for most shareholders an unrealized thing of the future.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{to discuss}} and {{recommend}} security systems for protecting investors ’ assets against misuse or fraud by intermediary institutions when Turkish capital market transforms to dematerialized system where rights for capital market instruments will be kept in electronic <b>book-entry</b> <b>form</b> by the Central Registry Agency of Turkey (CRA). It also discusses the possibility of moral hazard and breach of trust by the intermediary institutions following the commencement of the Investors ’ Protection Fund, and the probable functions of CRA to avoid moral hazard and breach of trust risks by the help of mobile communications and internet technologies. In that framework, two very important and innovative recommendations are made {{for the first time}} which would enhance investors’ confidence and change the system of supervision for the capital markets in the world dramatically...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of U. S. Treasury securities from physical to <b>book-entry</b> <b>form</b> {{was a major}} event {{in the history of}} the Treasury market. The conversion, which began in 1966, resulted in an automated system that has greatly reduced market operating costs and risks. This article examines the origins and development of the Federal Reserve book-entry system for Treasury securities. It suggests that the system was the product of three important factors: the interest of the Federal Reserve Banks and the Treasury in lowering their operating costs and risks, the intention of the Reserve Banks and the Treasury to preserve the liquidity of the market, and the desire of the Reserve Banks to reduce member bank operating costs. Two critical incidents-a loss of securities at a Reserve Bank in 1962 and an "insurance crisis" in 1970 - 71 -played major roles in the early development and subsequent expansion of the book-entry system. Treasury bonds; Federal Reserve banks - Automation; Government securities; Federal Reserve banks - Costs...|$|E
