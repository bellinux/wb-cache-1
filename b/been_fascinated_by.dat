5|$|Andrew was the {{favorite}} nephew of Stephen Báthory who officially adopted him. Giovanni Andrea Caligari, the papal nuncio (or ambassador) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, urged the king to persuade Andrew {{to start a}} church career. According to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy, Andrew had already <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> altars, churches and tombs as a child. However, his Protestant mother and relatives wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice. He was especially worried about clerical celibacy, because it prevented him from fathering legitimate children. He also hoped that his uncle would promote his secular career. His Jesuit tutors finally persuaded him to accept his uncle's decision.|$|E
5|$|Chase had <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> {{organized}} {{crime and the}} mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up. He also was raised on classic gangster films, such as The Public Enemy, and the crime series The Untouchables. The series is partly inspired by the Boiardo family, a prominent New Jersey {{organized crime}} family when Chase was growing up, and partly on New Jersey's DeCavalcante family. He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style.|$|E

25|$|Having {{heard of}} Thunberg's {{inquisitive}} mind, his skills in botany and medicine and Linnaeus' high esteem of his Swedish pupil, Johannes Burman and Laurens Theodorus Gronovius, a councillor of Leiden, convinced Thunberg {{to travel to}} either the West or the East Indies to collect plants and animal specimen for the botanic garden at Leiden which was still lacking exotic exhibits. Thunberg who had ever since <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> the secretive and mainly unknown East Indies was eager {{to travel to the}} Cape of Good Hope and apply his knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Before {{starting}} for the East Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had met Alexander Pope, {{and during}} her Embassy travels with her husband, they wrote {{each other a}} series of letters. While Pope may have <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> her wit and elegance, Lady Mary's replies to his letters reveal {{that she was not}} equally smitten. Very few letters passed between them after Lady Mary's return to England, and various reasons have been suggested for the subsequent estrangement. In 1728, Pope attacked Lady Mary in his Dunciad inaugurating a decade in which most of his publications made some sort of allegation against her.|$|E
25|$|Mankind has <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> {{the golden}} eagle {{as early as}} the {{beginning}} of recorded history. Most early-recorded cultures regarded the golden eagle with reverence. It was only after the Industrial Revolution, when sport-hunting became widespread and commercial stock farming became internationally common, that humans started to widely regard golden eagles as a threat to their livelihoods. This period also brought about the firearm and industrialized poisons, which made it easy for humans to kill the evasive and powerful birds. The following are various reportages of the significance of eagles, many likely pertaining to the golden eagles, in early cultures and older religions as well as national and military insignias.|$|E

25|$|Sullivan {{recalled}} {{that he had}} always <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel-hair coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. Broadbent turned down the role, due to the play he was acting in had moved. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of Open All Hours that Jason was considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role, and that he and Lyndhurst {{did not look like}} brothers, he was cast.|$|E

500|$|From {{his boyhood}} Wodehouse had <b>been</b> <b>fascinated</b> <b>by</b> America, which he {{conceived}} of as [...] "a land of romance"; he [...] "yearned" [...] to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: [...] "In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment". This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that [...] "in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded with awe and looked upon as an authority on that terra incognita.... After that trip to New York I {{was a man who}} counted.... My income rose like a rocketing pheasant." ...|$|E
