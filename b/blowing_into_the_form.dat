Once the charge has been melted, the furnace is tilted back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blowing</b> position and oxygen is <b>blown</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bath. Slag <b>formed</b> from <b>the</b> oxidation of lead and zinc is removed periodically by tilting the furnace forward again and pouring it off.|$|R
