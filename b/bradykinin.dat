5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and <b>bradykinin,</b> are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of <b>bradykinin.</b> He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of <b>bradykinin</b> or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} develop angioedema due {{to increased}} <b>bradykinin</b> levels. A genetic predisposition may exist toward this adverse effect in patients who degrade <b>bradykinin</b> more slowly than average.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{adverse effect}} specific for ACE inhibitors, {{but not for}} other RAAS blockers, {{is an increase in}} <b>bradykinin</b> level. Elevated <b>bradykinin</b> level due to ACE inhibition can be a cause of dry cough, angioedema and/or rash, hypotension, and inflammation-related pain.|$|E
25|$|In kidney cells, the <b>bradykinin</b> {{receptor}} B2 {{has been}} shown to interact directly with a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) sequence in the B2 receptor is necessary to mediate this interaction and subsequently the antiproliferative effect of <b>bradykinin.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} dry cough is {{a relatively}} common adverse effect believed {{to be associated with}} the increases in <b>bradykinin</b> levels produced by ACE inhibitors, although the role of <b>bradykinin</b> in producing these symptoms has been disputed. Patients who experience this cough are often switched to angiotensin II receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} mechanism typically involves histamine or <b>bradykinin.</b> The version {{related to}} histamine is to due {{an allergic reaction}} to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to <b>bradykinin</b> may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder.|$|E
25|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{that interfere with}} <b>bradykinin</b> production or degradation can lead to angioedema. ACE inhibitors block ACE, the enzyme that among other actions, degrades <b>bradykinin.</b> In hereditary angioedema, <b>bradykinin</b> formation is caused by continuous activation of the complement system due to a deficiency {{in one of its}} prime inhibitors, C1-esterase (aka: C1-inhibitor or C1INH), and continuous production of kallikrein, another process inhibited by C1INH. This serine protease inhibitor (serpin) normally inhibits the association of C1r and C1s with C1q to prevent the formation of the C1-complex, which - in turn - activates other proteins of the complement system. Additionally, it inhibits various proteins of the coagulation cascade, although effects of its deficiency on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis appear to be limited.|$|E

25|$|Mutations in the C1 {{inhibitor}} gene {{can cause}} hereditary angioedema, a genetic condition resulting from reduced regulation of <b>bradykinin</b> by C1-INH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bradykinin</b> {{is rapidly}} inactivated in the {{circulating}} blood, and it disappears completely {{in a single}} pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of <b>bradykinin</b> and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme. In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors can induce angioedema. ACE inhibitors {{block the}} enzyme ACE {{so it can}} no longer degrade bradykinin; thus, <b>bradykinin</b> accumulates and causes angioedema. This {{complication}} appears more common in African-Americans. In people with ACE inhibitor angioedema, the drug needs to be discontinued and an alternative treatment needs to be found, such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) which has a similar mechanism but does not affect <b>bradykinin.</b> However, this is controversial, as small studies have shown some patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema can develop it with ARBs, as well.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of <b>bradykinin,</b> angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with Thrombospondin 1, Alpha 2-antiplasmin and IGFBP3. Moreover, plasmin induces the generation of <b>bradykinin</b> in mice and humans trough high molecular weight kininogen cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Sérgio Henrique Ferreira (October 4, 1934 – July 17, 2016) was a Brazilian {{physician}} and pharmacologist noted for {{the discovery of}} the <b>bradykinin</b> potentiating factor, which led to new and widely used anti-hypertension drugs — the ACE inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Renin {{increases}} in {{concentration in the}} blood {{as a result of}} negative feedback of conversion of AI to AII. AI increases for the same reason; AII and aldosterone decrease. <b>Bradykinin</b> increases because of less inactivation by ACE.|$|E
25|$|Future {{attacks of}} {{hereditary}} angioedema {{can be prevented}} {{by the use of}} androgens such as danazol, oxandrolone or methyltestosterone. These agents increase the level of aminopeptidase P, an enzyme that inactivates kinins; kinins (especially <b>bradykinin)</b> are responsible for the manifestations of angioedema.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to protect}} the airway may include {{intubation}} or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine. In those with <b>bradykinin</b> related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used. Fresh frozen plasma may be used instead. In the United States the disease affects about 100,000 people a year.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} several {{different}} chemicals {{have been used}} to induce referred pain including <b>bradykinin,</b> substance P, capsaicin, and serotonin. However, before any of these substances became widespread in their use a solution of hypertonic saline was used instead. Through various experiments it was determined that there were multiple factors that correlated with saline administration such as infusion rate, saline concentration, pressure, and amount of saline used. The mechanism by which the saline induces a local and referred pain pair is unknown. Some researchers have commented that it could be due to osmotic differences, however that is not verified.|$|E
25|$|BPFs {{are members}} of a family of {{peptides}} whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of <b>bradykinin</b> by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF teprotide (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect in vivo. Teprotide had limited clinical value {{as a result of its}} peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. David Cushman, Miguel Ondetti and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may {{be superior to}} either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of <b>bradykinin</b> while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT1 receptor. This 'dual blockade' {{may be more effective}} than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways. Preliminary studies suggest this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of essential hypertension, chronic heart failure, and nephropathy. However, the more recent ONTARGET study showed no benefit of combining the agents and more adverse events. While statistically significant results have been obtained for its role in treating hypertension, clinical significance may be lacking. There are warnings about the combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs.|$|E
25|$|The lungs {{activate}} one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I {{is converted}} to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates <b>bradykinin.</b> Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs {{is converted to}} angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified {{on the surface of}} the pulmonary endothelial cells.|$|E
25|$|The species {{within the}} {{hymenopteran}} order commonly sting or bite others {{with which they}} interact. After a man was stung by a European hornet, he experienced tingling {{at the site of}} contact, as well as headaches and shortness of breath. In the hospital, he was found to have a fast, irregular heartbeat with a blood pressure of 111/63. His subsequent ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. V. crabro toxin contains neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenalineneurotoxin apamin, as well as enzymes phospholipase A and hyaluronidase, the compound histamine, and proteins melittin and <b>bradykinin.</b> These compounds have been shown to cause tachycardia episodes in smaller animals. The mechanism of this attack is still undetermined, but this man possibly was just more susceptible to vespine stings than other humans. Currently, the two most effective treatments are electrical cardioversion or propafenone. The man in this case study was given an oral dose of propafenone (150mg) and his atrial fibrillation resolved.|$|E
25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other investigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like metamizole, in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the primary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of the primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of <b>bradykinin</b> and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{constitute}} 90-95% of venom's {{dry weight}} {{and they are}} responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and potentiate <b>bradykinin</b> (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. Hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability to accelerate absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (Dendroaspis), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bradykinin</b> plays a {{critical}} role in all forms of hereditary angioedema. This peptide is a potent vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. This is most obvious in the face, where the skin has relatively little supporting connective tissue, and edema develops easily. <b>Bradykinin</b> is released by various cell types in response to numerous different stimuli; it is also a pain mediator. [...] Dampening or inhibiting <b>bradykinin</b> has been shown to relieve HAE symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Ferreira {{received}} his M.D. from the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto of the University of São Paulo (USP) and soon became staff {{member of the}} same school, {{where he is a}} member of the Department of Pharmacology. His research training in pharmacology initiated in this Department with Prof. Maurício Rocha e Silva, the discoverer of <b>bradykinin.</b> While working on this subject, he discovered a family of peptides present in the venom of a Brazilian snake, Bothrops jararaca, which inhibited kininase activity and strongly potentiated the effects of <b>bradykinin</b> in vivo and in vitro. This factor was named <b>bradykinin</b> potentiating factor, BPF. In 1968, with the collaboration of Dr. Lewis Joel Greene, from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, U.S., he isolated several pharmacologically active peptides responsible for the activity of BPF. Using those peptides, was demonstrated a general parallelism between <b>bradykinin</b> potentiation and inhibition of Angiotensin I conversion. Subsequently, his group elucidated the structure of the smallest peptide, and using the synthetic pentapeptide, demonstrated its ability to potentiate <b>bradykinin</b> and to inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I in vivo [...] in experimental models of hypertension. His work in this area paved the way for the development of a new class of antihypertensive drugs, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors by Squibb scientists. For this work with the Bothrops peptide he received the CIBA Award for Hypertension Research of 1983, together with Drs. E. Ondetti and D. Cushman from Squibb laboratories.|$|E

2500|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} include: hypotension, cough, hyperkalemia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and renal impairment.
