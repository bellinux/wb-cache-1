50|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> (Anthracothorax nigricollis) is a mainly South American hummingbird species.|$|E
50|$|The {{call of the}} <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> is {{a high-pitched}} tsiuck, and the song is a buzzing hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl-hsl.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> has bronze-green upperparts {{and white}} underparts {{with a black}} central stripe. Immature birds show some grey or buff feather tips {{on the head and}} wings, and have brown around the eyes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango's</b> {{breeding}} season lasts almost year-round {{in most of}} its range. It builds a tiny cup nest on a high, thin, and usually bare branch. For this it uses fluff like seed down, cladding the outside with lichen. Nests are maybe 35-40 mm wide and 25-30 mm tall {{on the outside and}} some 25 mm wide and 10-15 mm deep inside. The two all-white eggs measure c.15 by 9.5 mm. They are incubated by the female for 16 or 17 days, and fledging takes another 24.|$|R
50|$|In Neotropical {{gardens and}} parks, their nectar is popular with many hummingbirds, {{such as the}} <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> (Anthracothorax nigricollis), the black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), or the gilded hummingbird (Hylocharis chrysura). The wood of the tree is soft and is used for nesting by many hole-building birds such as barbets.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} easily {{accessible}} to pollinators. Some hummingbirds - e.g. black jacobin (Florisuga fusca) and <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> (Anthracothorax nigricollis) - seem to prefer {{them over the}} flowers of other Handroanthus species, while for others like the stripe-breasted starthroat (Heliomaster squamosus) {{it may even be}} a mainstay food source.|$|E
50|$|At a <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> nest in Cuyabeno Faunistic Reserve, Ecuador, it {{was noted}} that the tree was beset with Pseudomyrmex {{stinging}} ants. This was also noted at a green-breasted mango nest on San Andrés Island (Caribbean). It is likely that the ants would deter predators, but it is not known whether the birds deliberately select such trees for nesting.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the closely related <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango.</b> Although the male green-breasted mango has less {{extensive}} black on the underparts, this and other plumage differences are not always easy to confirm in the field because the birds appear all-black. The females of the two species can be almost inseparable, although green-breasted has more extensively coppery upperpart tones than its relative.|$|E
50|$|Migratory {{bird species}} include swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), plumbeous kite (Ictinia plumbea), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), dark-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus melacoryphus), white-collared swift (Streptoprocne zonaris), Sick's swift (Chaetura meridionalis), black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango</b> (Anthracothorax nigricollis), white-rumped monjita (Xolmis velatus), yellow-browed tyrant (Satrapa icterophrys), rusty-margined flycatcher (Myiozetetes cayanensis), {{streaked}} flycatcher (Myiodynastes maculatus), piratic flycatcher (Legatus leucophaius), fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), white-winged becard (Pachyramphus polychopterus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), lined seedeater (Sporophila lineola) and sooty grassquit (Tiaris fuliginosus).|$|E
50|$|More than 1000 {{bird species}} have been {{estimated}} {{to exist in the}} park. Birds reported for the lowland rainforest in the park include: the great tinamou, Spix's guan, the rufescent tiger-heron, the blue-and-yellow macaw, the silvery grebe, the harpy eagle, the blue throated piping-guan, the long-billed starthroat, the snowy egret, the king vulture, the ladder-tailed nightjar, the scarlet macaw, the sapphire-spangled emerald, the roseate spoonbill, the stilt sandpiper, the blue-crowned trogon, the turquoise tanager, the Amazonian pygmy owl, the <b>black-throated</b> <b>mango,</b> the blue-headed parrot, etc. Birds present in the mountain zones in the park include: the Andean tinamou, the great horned owl, the torrent duck, the yellow-billed pintail, the amethyst-throated sunangel, the Andean guan, the puna ibis, the golden-collared tanager, the Andean condor, the collared inca, the solitary eagle, the Andean cock-of-the-rock, the masked flowerpiercer, the mountain caracara, the mitred parakeet, the sapphire-vented puffleg, the giant hummingbird, etc.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} flower morphology, nectar features, and hummingbird visitation to Palicourea crocea (Rubiaceae), {{a common}} ornithophilous shrub {{found in the}} riparian forest understory in the Upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil. Flowers are distylous and the style-stamen dimorphism is accompanied by other intermorph dimorphisms in corolla length, anther length, and stigma lobe length and form. We did not observe strict reciprocity in the positioning of stigma and anthers between floral morphs. Flowering occurred during the rainy season, October to December. Nectar standing crop per flowerwas relatively constant throughout the day, which apparently resulted in hummingbirds visiting the plant throughout the day. Energetic content of the nectar in each flower (66. 5 J) and that required daily by hummingbird visitors (up to 30 kJ) would oblige visits to hundreds of flowers each day, and thus movements between plants that should result in pollen flow. Three hummingbird species visited the flowers: the Gilded Sapphire (Hylocharis chrysura), the <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Mango</b> (Anthracothorax nigricollis), and the Glittering-bellied Emerald (Chlorostilbon aureoventris). The frequency of hummingbird visitation, nectar features, and the scarcity of other hummingbird-visited flowers in the study area, indicate that P. crocea is an important nectar resource for short-billed hummingbirds in the study site...|$|E

Investigamos a morfologia floral, as características do néctar e a visita de beija-flores a Palicourea crocea (Rubiaceae), uma espécie ornitófila arbustiva comumente encontrada no sub-bosque da vegetação ripária na planície de inundação do Alto Rio Paraná, Brasil. As flores são distílicas, sendo o dimorfismo estilete-estames acompanhado por outras variações morfológicas no comprimento da corola, altura das anteras, comprimento das anteras e comprimento e forma das papilas estigmáticas. Não foi observada reciprocidade estrita na posição dos estigmas e anteras entre flores longistilas e brevistilas. A floração da espécie ocorreu durante a estação chuvosa, de outubro a dezembro. A disponibilidade de néctar foi relativamente constante ao longo do dia, o que aparentemente possibilitou aos beija-flores visitar a planta o dia todo. O conteúdo energético de néctar por flor (66, 5 J) e a demanda diária de energia dos beija-flores visitantes(superior a 30 kJ) os obrigaria a visitar diariamente centenas de flores da espécie, o que pode aumentar o fluxo de pólen. Três espécies de beija-flores foram observadas: beija-flor-dourado (Hylocharis chrysura), beija-flor-de-colete-preto (Anthracothorax nigricollis) e esmeralda-de-bico-vermelho (Chlorostilbon aureoventris). A freqüência de visita dos beija-flores, as características do néctar e a baixa disponibilidade de outras flores visitadas por beija-flores na área de estudo indicam que P. crocea é uma fonte de néctar importante para beija-flores de bico-curto no local...|$|E
