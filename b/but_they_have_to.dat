25|$|Many new young writers appeared, {{but due to}} {{financial}} constraints, only those who have gained a strong reputation could get the financial backing to publish their works. The Writers Association, which should, in principle, support these writers' efforts, hasn't undergone much change since 1989 and there is much controversy surrounding its activity and purpose. The most successful writers, like Mircea Cărtărescu, Horia-Roman Patapievici, Andrei Pleşu, Gabriel Liiceanu and Mircea Dinescu, are respected personalities in Romanian life, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> devote some of their would-be writing time to other activities, mainly journalism. The ties with the Romanian diaspora are now very strong and even foreign-language Romanian writers like Andrei Codrescu (who now writes primarily in English) are very popular.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{discrimination}} in hiring {{has been shown}} to exist in the United States and in Europe. By means of their path breaking field experiment, Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, showed that applications from job candidates with white-sounding names got 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with African-American-sounding names in the United States at the start of this millennium. A 2009 study by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski found that black applicants to low-wage jobs were half as likely as identically qualified white applicants to receive callbacks or job offers. More recently, Stijn Baert, Bart Cockx, Niels Gheyle and Cora Vandamme replicated and extended their field experiment in Belgium, Europe. They found that racial {{discrimination in}} the labour market is heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared to natives, candidates with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a job interview in Belgium if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low.|$|E

[...] "Momma's Gotta Die Tonight" [...] follows the account of a black teenager who murders and dismembers his racist mother after she reacts negatively when he brings a white girl home. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song's lyrics are metaphorical, explaining that [...] "Whoever is still perpetuating racism has got to die, not necessarily physically, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill off that part of their brain.

500|$|Wayne Scholes, {{owner of}} the Telford Tigers (currently in the English Premier League) has stated that his {{organisation}} doesn't have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled {{out the possibility of}} joining the EIHL in the future, saying that “We have had conversations with the Elite League before <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> invite you. You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mets' Ron Darling took {{a no-hitter}} and 4–0 lead into {{the eighth inning}} against the Phillies on June 28 at the Vet before 52,206 fans. Philadelphia's Greg Gross pinch-hit and tripled to lead off the eighth inning, {{breaking}} up the no-hitter. Juan Samuel then singled {{to break up the}} shutout, and the Phillies came back with nine hits against Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell, scoring five runs to win 5–4. It would have been the first no-hitter in Mets history. Compounding the loss for the Mets, the Phillies were in last place at the time, and the loss dropped the Mets [...] games behind the first-place Cardinals who they would play the next day. Of the win and the Mets, Mike Schmidt said, [...] "The Mets don't like to give credit when they lose, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it today." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Yeung showed {{mixed feelings about}} the album. He regarded the album as [...] "alright", however, {{he believed that the}} songs were too straightforward and lacked [...] "differentiation, excitement, or the brightness that would be found on later albums." [...] Whitson said that the album was [...] "this group of youngsters have written a great debut album for their age [...] isn't the best album around, but is far from the worst." [...] Renshaw was critical about the fact that [...] "Paramore are for the kids who think Pink is not cool enough but My Chemical Romance are too scary, they want to rebel <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be in by 9 o' clock. Paramore are not terrible; they are simply a transitional band." [...] Jordan [...] "Anchors" [...] Rogowski from Punknews.org was more critical of the album; he praised William's voice, but criticized the structures of the songs, regarding them [...] "just too flat, too linear [...] the guitar seems a bit uninspired, the drumming a bit lazy, and the bass is barely existent, if existent at all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Phenomenal Woman", a crowd-pleaser that Angelou often {{performed}} for audiences, {{has been called}} her [...] "personal theme-poem". [...] Neubauer and literary critic Harold Bloom both consider {{it one of the}} best poems in the volume. [...] The poem was featured in the motion picture Poetic Justice (1993), directed by John Singleton. Bloom calls it a [...] "hymn-like poem to woman's beauty". [...] Angelou [...] "skillfully engages" [...] in some word-play with the word [...] "". [...] As Angelou often does in her poetry, [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] is paired with the one that follows it, [...] "Men", in which Angelou uses a raw egg metaphor to contrast dominant masculinity with fragile and cautious femininity. [...] She celebrates both [...] "her slightly mysterious power" [...] and the excitement created by men. [...] The poem is characteristic of Angelou's style, with terse and forceful lines and irregular rhymes. The short and often monosyllabic words, as Neubauer states, [...] "create an even, provocative rhythm that resounds with underlying confidence". [...] Angelou said that she wrote the poem for all women, regardless of their race or appearance. She also stated, [...] "Now, I know men are phenomenal, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write their own poem".|$|E
2500|$|The Kuvasz breed is for {{experienced}} handlers only. The {{combination of}} intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating {{the environment and}} taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices {{and those who do}} not have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a handler.|$|E

2500|$|Kassem, Victor, and Jackie all assume fake {{identities and}} end up in Porvenir, a remote village in Latin America. Its {{conditions}} provide {{a stark contrast to}} their previous lives. The village economy is heavily reliant on an American oil company. Kassem befriends a man called 'Marquez' (John), presumably a Nazi war veteran. They all live in extreme poverty and earn meager salaries. All want out, but their savings are inadequate for emigration. After some time, Nilo arrives in the village, raising suspicions. In the meantime, an oil well explodes, {{and the only way to}} extinguish the fire is to use dynamite. Since the only available dynamite has been improperly stored in a remote depot, the nitroglycerin contained inside has become highly unstable; the faintest vibration could cause an explosion. With all other means ruled out, the only way to transport it the [...] is to use trucks. The company seeks four drivers to man two vehicles. Kassem, Victor, Jackie and 'Marquez' are offered the job, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> assemble the trucks using scrap parts. Shortly before their departure, Nilo kills and replaces 'Marquez', which angers Kassem.|$|E

Girls make monsters of themselves, and I'm told the men like it;--going about with unclean, frowsy structures on their heads, {{enough to make a}} dog sick. They used to be clean and sweet and nice,--what one would like to kiss. How a man can like to kiss a face with a dirty horse's tail all whizzing about it, is what I can't at all understand.

Maud and Nelly look the best, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep stiff and still, or the {{wrinkles}} come. Kit has no peace in hers, and poor Cordy {{looks more like a}} meal bag than ever, while I am a perfect spectacle, with my round shoulders and long thin arms.

60|$|MRS WARREN. Why, of course. Everybody dislikes {{having to}} work and make money; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{do it all the}} same. I'm sure I've often pitied a poor girl, tired out and in low spirits, having to try to please some man that she doesn't care two straws for--some half-drunken fool that thinks he's making himself {{agreeable}} when he's teasing and worrying and disgusting a woman so that hardly any money could pay her for putting up with it. But she has to bear with disagreeables and take the rough with the smooth, just like a nurse in a hospital or anyone else. It's not work that any woman would do for pleasure, goodness knows; though to hear the pious people talk you would suppose it was a bed of roses.|$|E
