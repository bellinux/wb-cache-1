50|$|The IJN {{therefore}} planned {{two kinds}} of seaplane tenders which {{were included in the}} Maru 4 Programme. One was a 10,000-ton class flying boat carrier, the other a 2,400-ton class flying boat tender. These plans were not able to pass the assessment by the Ministry of Finance. These two basic plans were revived by the Maru 5 Programme in 1941. However, their construction did not begin. Therefore, the IJN planned a 3,500-ton class tender, which was a scaled-up model of the 2,400-ton class. The ships should be able to maintain, repair and supply seaplanes. The IJN intended to accommodate the flying boat by <b>bow-up</b> trim and slope at first, however this plan was cancelled and the Akitsushima class was equipped with a 35-ton crane. The IJN changed the design frequently, ending up with a displacement increased by 1,000 tons.|$|E
40|$|Background. In duodenoscopy, during {{endoscopic}} retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a backward-oblique angle duodenoscope (BOAD) {{is generally}} used. In Japan, 15 ° BOAD are mainly used, but in Western countries, 5 ° BOAD are mostly used. In bile duct cannulation associated with ERCP, a catheter for contrast imaging is used in Japan, but wire-guided cannulation (WGC) using a papillotome is standard in Western countries. We conducted a randomized controlled multicenter trial to evaluate the contributions of different duodenoscopes using WGC to selective common bile duct cannulation. Methods. Subjects comprised 179 consecutive patients who underwent ERCP. Patients were randomized into the 15 ° BOAD group (15 ° group, n = 90) or the 5 ° BOAD group (5 ° group, n = 89). Results. The duodenal papilla could not be accessed endoscopically in two cases from each group. Success rates for bile duct cannulation by WGC without <b>bow-up</b> for the 15 ° and 5 ° groups were 85. 6 % and 56. 2 %, respectively (P < 0. 01). Success rates for bile duct cannulation by WGC with <b>bow-up</b> for the 15 ° and 5 ° groups were 88. 9 % and 78. 7 %, respectively. Total rates of bile duct cannulation for the 15 ° and 5 ° groups were 94. 4 % and 92. 1 %, respectively. As for accidents, incidences of acute pancreatitis for the 15 ° and 5 ° groups were 5. 6 % and 9. 0 %, respectively, with no significant difference seen. Conclusions. With 15 ° BOAD, bile duct cannulation was favorable without papillotome <b>bow-up.</b> With 5 ° BOAD, the success rate of WGC may be improved by adjusting the angle based on papillotome <b>bow-up...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Network Noisy Leaky Integrate and Fire {{equation}} {{is among the}} simplest model allowing for a self-consistent description of neural networks and gives a rule to determine the probability to find a neuron at the potential $v$. However, its mathematical structure is still poorly understood and, concerning its solutions, very few results are available. In the midst of them, a recent result shows blow-up in finite time for fully excitatory networks. The intuitive explanation is that each firing neuron induces a discharge of the others; thus increases the activity and consequently the discharge rate of the full network. In order {{to better understand the}} details of the phenomena and show that the {{equation is}} more complex and fruitful than expected, we analyze further the model. We extend the finite time <b>bow-up</b> result to the case when neurons, after firing, enter a refractory state for a given period of time. We also show that spontaneous activity may occur when, additionally, randomness is included on the firing potential $V_F$ in regimes where blow-up occurs for a fixed value of $V_F$...|$|E
40|$|The {{compression}} {{plane is}} intended for operation on or {{close to the surface}} of the water, and has a hull with a concave bottom which forms the upper surface of a tunnel into which air is forced under pressure to support part of the load. The results of the tests made in Langley tank no. 1 include values of the horizontal forces, trimming moment, and static pressure in the tunnel for a wide range of loads and speeds and two power conditions, and are presented in the form of curves against speed with load as a parameter. The results are scaled up to 10 times the model size for three conditions at which the model is self-propelled at a steady speed. Lift is obtained from the static pressure of air in the tunnel. In general, the ratio of the gross load to the total resistance increases with increase in load and decrease in speed. This ratio varies between l- 7 and 5. 7 at high speeds and has a maximum value of 7. The total resistance is nearly the same for both power conditions except at low speeds and heavy loads. No abrupt change in forces on the hull or flow around the hull occurs in. the region of zero draft. The centers of pressure are generally far aft. At the most efficient trim (1. 2 '), considerable <b>bow-up</b> moment would be required for practicable operation. There is no abrupt transition from the air-borne to the water- borne condition...|$|E
