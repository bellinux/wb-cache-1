25|$|Alignment {{of primary}} {{transcript}} mRNA sequences derived from eukaryotes to a reference genome requires specialised handling of intron sequences, which are absent from mature mRNA. Short read aligners perform an additional round of alignments {{specifically designed to}} identify splice junctions, informed by canonical splice site sequences and known intron splice site information. Identification of intron splice junctions prevents reads being misaligned across splice junctions or erroneously discarded, allowing more reads to <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> the reference genome and improving the accuracy of gene expression estimates. Since gene regulation may occur at the mRNA isoform level, splice-aware alignments also permit detection of isoform abundance changes {{that would otherwise be}} lost in a bulked analysis.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{transcript}} molecules have been prepared, {{they can be}} sequenced in just one direction (single-end) or both directions (paired-end). A single-end sequence is usually quicker to produce, cheaper than paired-end sequencing and sufficient for quantification of gene expression levels. Paired-end sequencing produces more robust alignments/assemblies, which is beneficial for gene annotation and transcript isoform discovery. Strand-specific RNA-Seq methods preserve the strand information of a sequenced transcript. Without strand information, reads can <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> a gene locus, but do not inform in which direction the gene is transcribed. Stranded-RNA-Seq is useful for deciphering transcription for genes that overlap in different directions, and to make more robust gene predictions in non-model organisms.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{limitations}} in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, {{it has not}} been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, {{solely on the basis of}} the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.|$|E
25|$|Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was a {{development}} of EST methodology {{to increase the}} throughput of the tags generated and allow some quantitation of transcript abundance. cDNA is generated from the RNA but is then digested into 11bp ‘tag’ fragments using restriction enzymes that cut at a specific sequence, and 11base pairs along from that sequence. These cDNA tags are then concatenated head-to-tail into long strands (>500bp) and sequenced using low-throughput, but long read length methods such as Sanger sequencing. Once the sequences are deconvoluted into their original 11 bp tags. If a reference genome is available, these tags can sometimes <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> identify their corresponding gene. If a reference genome is unavailable, the tags can simply be directly used as diagnostic markers if found to be differentially expressed in a disease state.|$|E

25|$|The party traces its {{beginnings}} to an August, 1967 assembly in a sports complex (which {{is now known}} as el Estadio Country Club) in the sector of Country Club, San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 5, 1968, the party was belatedly certified as an official political group by the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico. The party had roots in a prior pro-statehood party led by Miguel Angel García Méndez. The incipient party campaigned unsuccessfully in favor of statehood in the Puerto Rico status referendum of 1967, even though the historical pro-statehood Puerto Rican Republican Party decided to boycott that plebiscite. Main party founder, president, and former statehood Republican Party standard-bearer Luis A. Ferré categorized the New Progressive Party as one which would not <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> any of the two major U.S. national parties. Co-founders of the NPP alongside Luis A. Ferre were Manuel F. Alsina Capo, attorney Nelson Escalona, and Benny Frankie Cerezo.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomics {{methods are}} highly {{parallel}} and require significant computation to produce meaningful data for both microarray and RNA-Seq experiments. Microarray data is recorded as high-resolution images, requiring feature detection and spectral analysis. Microarray raw image files are each about 750 MB in size, while the processed intensities are around 60 MB in size. Multiple short probes matching a single transcript can reveal {{details about the}} intron-exon structure, requiring statistical models to determine {{the authenticity of the}} resulting signal. RNA-Seq studies produce billions of short DNA sequences, which must <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> reference genomes composed of millions to billions of base pairs. De novo assembly of reads within a dataset requires the construction of highly complex sequence graphs. RNA-Seq operations are highly repetitious and benefit from parallelised computation but modern algorithms mean consumer computing hardware is sufficient for simple transcriptomics experiments that do not require de novo assembly of reads. A human transcriptome could be accurately captured using RNA-Seq with 30 million 100 bp sequences per sample. This example would require approximately 1.8 gigabytes of disk space per sample when stored in a compressed fastq format. Processed count data for each gene would be much smaller, equivalent to processed microarray intensities. Sequence data may be stored in public repositories, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). RNA-Seq datasets can be uploaded via the Gene Expression Omnibus.|$|E

2500|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} that load and store 8-bit bytes, 16-bit halfwords, and 32-bit words. Only one addressing mode is supported: base + displacement. Since MIPS I is a 32-bit architecture, loading quantities fewer than 32 bits requires the datum {{to be either}} signed- or zero-extended to 32 bits. The load instructions suffixed by [...] "unsigned" [...] perform zero extension; otherwise sign extension is performed. Load instructions source the base from {{the contents of a}} GPR (rs) and write the result to another GPR (rt). Store instructions source the base from the contents of a GPR (rs) and the store data from another GPR (rt). All load and store instructions compute the memory address by summing the base with the sign-extended 16-bit immediate. MIPS I requires all memory accesses to <b>be</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>to</b> their natural word boundaries, otherwise an exception is signaled. To support efficient unaligned memory accesses, there are load/store word instructions suffixed by [...] "left" [...] or [...] "right". All load instructions are followed by a load delay slot. The instruction in the load delay slot cannot use the data loaded by the load instruction. The load delay slot can be filled with an instruction that is not dependent on the load; a nop is substituted if such an instruction cannot be found.|$|E
