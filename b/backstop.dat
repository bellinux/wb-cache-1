5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation <b>Backstop,</b> because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation <b>Backstop</b> a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|The UNPROFOR {{operations}} {{staff in}} Sector West developed several defensive plans, assigning top {{priority to the}} plan codenamed Operation <b>Backstop.</b> It envisaged an active defence against the HV, assuming that the attack's main axis would be the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. CANBAT 1 (supported by General Zabala) thought the HV would attack Sector West to control the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, and the UN would not object to such a move. Any Croatian attack in the area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for Operation <b>Backstop.</b>|$|E

5|$|To {{reassure the}} Sector West Croatian Serb population, CANBAT 1 {{performed}} an Operation <b>Backstop</b> exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993. Afterwards, Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague {{recommended that the}} plan be redesigned primarily {{as a means of}} deterrence. Hague felt that if Operation <b>Backstop</b> triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
5|$|Although Operation <b>Backstop</b> {{was within}} the UNPROFOR mandate (since the peacekeepers were {{authorised}} {{to use force to}} prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs), Croatian authorities resented the operation. Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the fulfilment of other aspects of the Vance plan, such as the return of refugees to their homes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{increasing}} demand for multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) continuum robot in presence of highly nonlinear dynamic parameters {{in a number}} of industries has motivated a flurry of research in the development of soft computing nonlinear methodology. The robust <b>backstopping</b> controller proposed in this research is used to further demonstrate the appealing features exhibited by the continuum robot. Robust feedback controller is used to position control of continuum robot in presence of uncertainties. Using Lyapunov type stability arguments, a robust <b>backstopping</b> controller is designed to achieve this objective. The controller developed in this research is designed into two steps. Firstly, a robust stabilizing torque is designed for the nominal continuum robot dynamics derived using the constrained Lagrangian formulation based on modified PD <b>backstopping</b> controller. Next, the fuzzy logic methodology applied to it to solution uncertainty problem. The fuzzy model free problem is formulated to estimate the nonlinear formulation of continuum robot. The eventual stability of the controller depends on the torque generating capabilities of the continuum robots.

5|$|Operation <b>Backstop</b> was a United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) {{military}} plan {{designed to}} guard {{a portion of}} the United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) against attack by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) during the Croatian War of Independence. The operation, developed by the UNPROFOR staff in charge of the UNPA Western Slavonia (Sector West) in 1992, was scheduled to be implemented by two mechanised companies of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI) battalion deployed in the area.|$|E
5|$|A part {{of western}} Slavonia, {{encompassing}} an area extending approximately , was {{designated as the}} UNPA of Western Slavonia or Sector West by the peace plan. Unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled {{only a part of}} the area—approximately a third of the UNPA located in the south—centred on the town of Okučani. The RSK-held area included a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. The UNPROFOR deployed to Sector West thought the HV would attack the area to control the motorway. In response, the UNPROFOR developed Operation <b>Backstop</b> aimed at defending against the HV attack, assuming that its main axis would be aligned with the motorway.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the main}} scoreboard, the {{ballpark}} has three more LED displays. A display in the left-center field wall is used for showing player introductions, in-game pitching statistics, upcoming batters, and advertisements. LED ribbon boards are installed on the facings of {{each side of the}} upper deck; these are used to display the inning, score, count, player introductions, and advertisements. The stadium's three pitch clocks—part of professional baseball's pace-of-game initiatives implemented in Triple-A and Double-A baseball games in 2015— are located on the straightaway center field wall and {{on each side of the}} <b>backstop.</b>|$|E

5|$|By September 1993, CANBAT 1 was {{relocated}} from Sector West to Sector South (northern Dalmatia and Lika). The UNPFROFOR mandate in Croatia expired on 31 March 1995, and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 981 {{establishing the}} United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO) instead. Sector West {{was captured by}} the HV in Operation Flash in early May 1995, with no resistance from UN peacekeepers. The main axis of the first day's HV advance was the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, as anticipated by the planners of Operation <b>Backstop.</b>|$|E

5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the <b>backstop</b> netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 1959, Musial was {{the batter}} {{in one of}} the oddest plays in {{baseball}} history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling {{all the way to the}} <b>backstop.</b> Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the <b>backstop</b> to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1981 season, Greer {{underwent}} {{a number of}} renovations including the addition of over 1,200box seats and over 1,000new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000contoured seats. The original <b>backstop</b> which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling {{the size of the}} reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315people watched the Sounds play against the Columbus Astros.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} only issue on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the <b>backstop</b> was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E

He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight {{gold medal at the}} tournament, beating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils. It marked Luongo's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. He had another opportunity to step in for the starting goalie when Brodeur pulled himself out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4–3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland. Brodeur returned for the championship game to <b>backstop</b> Team Canada to a 3–2 win.|$|E

The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the <b>backstop.</b> Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E
