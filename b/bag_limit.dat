5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{recreational}} catch {{often is}} greater than the commercial catch in some areas, with a survey carried out in Blackwood River indicating 120 700 fish were taken in a year by anglers. A similar survey conducted in the South Australian Gulfs found recreational fishermen accounted for 28% of the entire yellowfin whiting taken during the 2000/2001 period, representing over 50 tonnes of fish. Recreational bag limits have been put in place to prevent over-exploitation by anglers in both states, with South Australia imposing a minimum size limit of 24cm and a <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 20 fish on anglers. In Western Australia, there is no minimum size limit, but a <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 40 fish in combination with school whitings (Sillago bassensis and Sillago vittata).|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{reactions}} of professional fishermen, western school whiting are considered to have good to excellent flesh for eating, and fetch similar high prices at market to other whiting species. Due to their offshore nature {{in the south of}} Western Australia, they are rarely taken by recreational fishermen, while {{in the northern part of}} their range where they inhabit shallower waters, they are often overlooked for larger tropical species by anglers. Thus they are not a major recreational fishery either. They respond to the same fishing styles as other whitings, generally using light lines and sinkers with worm or mollusc baits. They are caught off beaches, jetties and from boats. There is no size restriction on the species, but a daily <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 40 per person applies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bag</b> <b>limits</b> are {{provisions}} {{under the}} law that control how many animals of a given species or group of species can be killed, although there are often species for which <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> do not apply. There are also jurisdictions where <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. The phrase <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> comes from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a fishing creel.|$|R
25|$|Recreational <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> vary {{by state}} and province.|$|R

25|$|The {{southern}} school whiting (also {{known as}} the silver whiting or trawl whiting) is a common smelt whiting that inhabits the south and south-west coasts of Australia, and {{is closely related to}} the eastern school whiting. It is commonly caught by recreational fishermen, often while fishing for related species, especially the sought after King George whiting. Southern school whiting are taken on a variety of baits, with their natural prey such as marine worms, molluscs, prawns and sardines often used. Due to their schooling nature, many fish can be caught in a single fishing period, although most authorities ask for excess fish to be returned to the water alive. In Western Australia, southern school whiting and yellowfin whiting have a combined <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 40 per person with no size restrictions, with no regulations applying elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The western school whiting (also {{known as}} the banded whiting, golden whiting and bastard whiting), is {{distributed}} along the Western Australian coast from Maud Landing in the north to Rottnest Island in the south. They are grow to 30cm in length and 275 g in weight, and are considered to have good to excellent flesh for eating. Due to their offshore nature {{in the south of}} Western Australia, they are rarely taken by recreational fishermen, while {{in the northern part of}} their range where they inhabit shallower waters, they are often overlooked for larger tropical species by anglers. Thus they are not a major recreational fishery. They respond to the same fishing styles as other whitings, generally using light lines and sinkers with worm or mollusc baits.

500|$|In New South Wales, sand whiting have {{a minimum}} legal length of 27cm to be taken and a daily {{personal}} <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 20 applies, [...] while in Queensland there is a minimum size of 23cm and a combined <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 30 for all whiting species.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> {{serve to}} keep a healthy {{population}} for the carrying capacity of the species' environment. This is done by utilizing hunters and fishermen, to harvest only a selected number of the mature game species. These <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> are utilized by a multitude of Countries and Fish and Game enforcement agencies. Although like all law and regulation enforcement agencies, poorer {{regions of the world}} have limited ability to enforce these regulations.|$|R

25|$|Many {{regulatory}} measures {{are available for}} controlling overfishing. These measures include fishing quotas, <b>bag</b> <b>limits,</b> licensing, closed seasons, size limits {{and the creation of}} marine reserves and other marine protected areas.|$|R
500|$|As {{with all}} game {{animals in the}} United States, the hunting of {{raccoons}} is regulated by wildlife conservation officials in each state and seasons and bag limits will therefore vary. In Tennessee, for example, coon hunting season begins in mid-September and ends in February, with a <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of one raccoon per hunter per day, [...] while in Kentucky, it begins in October and ends {{on the last day}} of February, with no <b>bag</b> <b>limit.</b> Some states, including Iowa, require a valid trapping or hunting license to train a coonhound to hunt.|$|E
500|$|Conservation {{management}} strategies {{have been put}} in place in some regions, such as minimum legal size limit restrictions in Guam and Vanuatu, and a ban on the capture of egg-bearing females in Guam and the Federated States of Micronesia. In the Northern Mariana Islands, hunting of non-egg-bearing adults above a carapace length of [...] may take place in September, October and November, and only under licence. There is a <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of 5 coconut crabs on any given day, and 15 across the whole season.|$|E
500|$|The {{long time}} public {{perception}} of alligator gar as [...] "trash fish", or a [...] "nuisance species" [...] has changed with increasing national and international attention on the species as a sport fish which some have attributed to features on popular television shows. [...] Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana allow regulated sport fishing of alligator gar. [...] Texas {{has one of the}} best remaining fisheries for alligator gar, and in concert with its efforts to maintain a viable fishery, imposed a one-per-day <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> on them in 2009. [...] The Texas state record, and world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel is , taken by Bill Valverde on January 1, 1951 on the Rio Grande in Texas. Alligator gar are also quite popular among bowfishers because of their large size, trophy potential, and fighting ability. [...] The Texas state bowfishing record was set In 2001 by Marty McClellan with a [...] alligator gar from the Trinity River. [...] The all-tackle record was a [...] alligator gar caught on a trotline in 1953 by T.C. Pierce, Jr. [...] In 1991, fishing guide Kirk Kirkland anecdotally reported catching an alligator gar measuring [...] on rod and line from the Trinity River.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{management}} studies, {{research and}} lobbying by interest groups help designate {{times of the}} year when certain wildlife species can be legally hunted, allowing for surplus animals to be removed. In the United States, hunting season and <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> are determined by guidelines set by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for migratory game such as waterfowl and other migratory gamebirds. The hunting season and <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> for state regulated game species such as deer are usually determined by State game Commissions, which are made up of representatives from various interest groups, wildlife biologists, and researchers.|$|R

40|$|Growing deer {{populations are}} {{controlled}} through changes in hunting regulations including changes in both hunter <b>bag</b> <b>limits</b> and season length. Such action results in direct benefits to hunters and indirect benefits to motorists and {{the agricultural sector}} as a lower deer population leads to fewer incidences of human-deer encounters. Traditional recreation demand models are often employed to examine the welfare implications of changes in daily hunting <b>bag</b> <b>limits.</b> Studies measuring the effects of changes in season length, however, are noticeably absent from the literature. This study uses a nested random utility model to examine hunter choice over site and season selection to derive the welfare implications of changes in season length. random utility models, recreation, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
2500|$|In Russia, government-backed wolf exterminations {{have been}} largely {{discontinued}} {{since the fall of}} the Soviet Union. As a result, their numbers have stabilized and are increasing, though they are still hunted legally. According to Alexander Tikhonov, head of the Department of Hunting Resources [...] "the more wolves you have, the more problems there are". His department currently licenses a national <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> of up to 14,000 wolves annually, with permits given to hunt even within nature reserves. Currently, Russia is the only nation where poison is legally used to kill wolves. The government licensed a fluorine-acetate-barium compound and distributed it through hunting associations.|$|E
2500|$|Diving is {{a popular}} {{activity}} at Rottnest. Its varied limestone reef terrain, and plentiful fish make it an interesting diving destination. In particular, diving for crayfish Western rock lobster, is popular in the summer months. The season opens on 15 November each year, and runs until 30 June. Crayfish may be caught in special traps or [...] "pots", or when diving either by hand or by using a crayfish [...] "loop". The loop is a spring-loaded steel cable attached to a long pole. It is illegal to use any means that might puncture the shell to catch the crayfish. The <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> is 6 per licence per day, with a maximum of 12 per boat per day.|$|E
2500|$|Not many {{conservation}} measures are known {{but it has}} been recorded from one marine reserve in South Africa and it occurs in La Jolla Cove, La Jolla, San Diego, California with the latter having an apparent population increase in 2013. 2009 research also suggested that [...] be made a conservation area given the high number of sharks there. In Washington, United States, recreational fishing of broadnose sevengill shark is closed on all state waters. In Victoria, Australia, the Department of Environment and Primary Industries sets a one <b>bag</b> <b>limit</b> and must be whole or in carcass form. The International Shark Attack File considers this shark to be potentially dangerous because of its proximity to humans, and because of its aggressive behavior when provoked. It has also been noted as being aggressive towards divers in both public aquariums and the wild and spearfishermen. Human remains were also found in one specimen's stomach therefore divers should be wary of this shark. Six attacks on humans by the broadnose sevengill, the latest being in 2013 in New Zealand, have been recorded since the 16th century, with no known fatalities.|$|E
