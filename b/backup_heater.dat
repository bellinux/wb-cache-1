50|$|In new construction, {{the cost}} of the extra {{insulation}} and wall framing may be offset by not requiring a dedicated central heating system. In homes with numerous rooms, more than one floor, air conditioning or large sized, a central furnace is often justified or required to ensure sufficiently uniform temperatures. Small furnaces are not very expensive and some ductwork to every room is almost always required to provide ventilation air in any case. When peak demand and annual energy use is low, sophisticated and expensive central heating systems are not often required. Hence, even electric resistance heaters may be used. Electric heaters are typically only used on the coldest winter nights when overall demand for electricity is low. Other forms of <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> are widely used, such as wood pellets, wood stoves, natural gas boilers or even furnaces. The cost of a superinsulation retrofit should be balanced against the future cost of heating fuel (which can be expected to fluctuate from year to year due to supply problems, natural disasters or geopolitical events), the desire to reduce pollution from heating a building, or the desire to provide exceptional thermal comfort.|$|E

40|$|An {{indirect}} type {{natural convection}} solar dryer with integrated collector-storage solar and biomass <b>backup</b> <b>heaters</b> has been designed, constructed and evaluated. The major {{components of the}} dryer are biomass burner (with a rectangular duct and flue gas chimney), collector-storage thermal mass and drying chamber (with a conventional solar chimney). The thermal mass {{was placed in the}} top part of the biomass burner enclosure. The dryer was fabricated using simple materials, tools and skills, and it was tested in three modes of operation (solar, biomass and solar-biomass) by drying twelve batches of fresh pineapple (Ananas comosus), with each batch weighing about 20 kg. Meteorological conditions were monitored during the dehydration process. Moisture and vitamin C contents were determined in both fresh and dried samples. Results show that the thermal mass was capable of storing part of the absorbed solar energy and heat from the burner. It was possible to dry a batch of pineapples using solar energy only on clear days. Drying proceeded successfully even under unfavorable weather conditions in the solar-biomass mode of operation. In this operational mode, the dryer reduced the moisture content of pineapple slices from about 669 to 11 % (db) and yielded a nutritious dried product. The average values of the final-day moisture-pickup efficiency were 15, 11 and 13 % in the solar, biomass and solar-biomass modes of operation respectively. It appears that the solar dryer is suitable for preservation of pineapples and other fresh foods. Further improvements to the solar chimney design are suggested to avert reverse thermosiphoning at night or during periods of low insolation...|$|R

40|$|Solar {{desiccant}} cooling {{is widely}} considered as an attractive replacement for conventional vapor compression air conditioning systems because of its environmental friendliness and energy efficiency advantages. The system performance of solar desiccant cooling strongly depends on the input parameters associated with the system components, such as the solar collector, storage tank and <b>backup</b> <b>heater,</b> etc. In {{order to understand the}} implications of different design parameters on the system performance, this study has conducted a parametric analysis on the solar collector area, storage tank volume, and <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> capacity of a solid solar desiccant cooling system for an office building in Brisbane, Australia climate. In addition, a parametric analysis on the outdoor air humidity ratio control set-point which triggers the operation of the desiccant wheel has also been investigated. The simulation results have shown that either increasing the storage tank volume or increasing solar collector area would result in both increased solar fraction (SF) and system coefficient of performance (COP), {{while at the same time}} reduce the <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> energy consumption. However, the storage tank volume is more sensitive to the system performance than the collector area. From the economic aspect, a storage capacity of 30 m 3 / 576 m 2 has the lowest life cycle cost (LCC) of $ 405, 954 for the solar subsystem. In addition, 100 kW <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> capacity is preferable for the satisfaction of the design regeneration heating coil hot water inlet temperature set-point with relatively low <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> energy consumption. Moreover, an outdoor air humidity ratio control set-point of 0. 008 kgWater/kgDryAir is more reasonable, as it could both guarantee the indoor design conditions and achieve low <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A natural {{convection}} solar tunnel greenhouse dryer coupled with biomass <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> {{was designed and}} developed for studying the drying characteristics of coconuts in Pollachi region of Tamil Nadu. Three trails of loading 5000 coconuts in the dryer were carried out {{during the month of}} January, 2014. The biomass <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> was used after 5 PM where there would be no sufficient solar radiation and was loaded with the remains of coconut such as coconut fronts, coconut husk and coconut shells which {{could be used as a}} fuel for biomass heater. The drying time and the product quality were the main deciding performance parameters of the dryer which are studied in comparison with the traditional drying method (open sun drying). It was found that the coconuts which has an initial moisture content of 53. 84 % (w. b.) were dried to final moisture content of 7. 003 % (w. b.) in the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer for a time period of 44 hours whereas the open sun drying method took 148 hours for the reduction of moisture content of the coconuts to the same level. Also, the superior quality coconuts can be produced from the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer since the dryer is free from contamination, dust & dirt, damage by birds and infections by bacteria and fungus.

25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} often {{employed}} for extremely deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much {{more efficiently than}} air, {{which means that the}} diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a <b>backup</b> water <b>heater</b> is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes; depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2010. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 72). The use of renewable energy has been spread {{all over the globe}} very rapidly. Renewable energy is the energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat, which are renewable (naturally replenished). Along with the major developments in the alternative sources of energy, a major breakthrough is the solar energy. More energy from sunlight strikes Earth in one hour than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. So it is very convenient to utilize this energy in our daily life. In many other countries solar energy is being used within vast area. Researches are going on to make the solar system more efficient and affordable. So it has been necessary to bring the idea of using solar energy in our country in wide range including domestic purpose. It will be in fact a great achievement if we can minimize electricity consumption by substituting it with solar energy. This thought leads us to work on our project which is on the topic “Alternative Solar Water Heater with Automated Control System”. Using solar energy to supply hot water for both industrial and domestic purpose can be a very good application of utilizing solar power and that is the target that we will be trying to achieve. Our task is to implement a solar water heater along with a <b>backup</b> water <b>heater</b> controlled by a controller to ensure the constant hot water supply in the cheapest possible way. Our thesis work also provides a solution to increase the efficiency of solar water heater by implementing high capacitive multiple hot water storage tanks. Md. Asifur RahmanA. S. M SayemMd.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{purposely}} designed dynamic {{simulation model}} for the performance analysis of solar heating and cooling systems is presented. The investigated system layouts are based on single stage LiBr–H 2 O absorption chillers and on both evacuated tube and concentrating photovoltaic thermal solar collectors. Furthermore, both electric chiller and gas fired <b>heater</b> <b>backup</b> system are considered. Such model is implemented in a computer code written in MATLAB. Here, the optimisation of several system design and operating parameters in terms of energy saving is also carried out. A code to code analysis is performed comparing the obtained simulation results vs. those achieved by a TRNSYS model available in literature. The simulation code for the concentrating photovoltaic thermal solar collectors is validated by experimental data. A good agreement among results is observed in both the cases. A suitable case study referred to a building including both offices and dwellings located in Northern and Southern Italy is presented. High primary energy savings are obtained {{for some of the}} investigated system layouts. By evacuated tube collectors solar field such savings can reach 74 %, while shifting to concentrating photovoltaic thermal solar collectors they often surpass 100 %.

40|$|Abstract — The most {{important}} aspect of drying technology is the mathematical modelling of the drying processes ad equipments. Since moisture ratio and dryer temperature are the deciding parameters for the modelling of a natural convection solar tunnel greenhouse dryer, a mathematical modeling analysis was carried out in the solar tunnel greenhouse drier with biomass <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> under full load conditions during the month of January 2014. About 5000 coconuts were dried in the dryer from 53. 84 % initial moisture content to about 7. 003 % final moisture content for 44 hours and the moisture ratio of the coconuts were calculated for every one hour interval. Ten different modelling were used for determining the theoretical moisture ratio of the coconuts. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} Page method is the best method available for determining the drying characteristics of coconuts since the ᵪ 2 and RMSE values are found to be very minimum.

40|$|Solar {{air-conditioning}} (AC) is {{an attractive}} AC system but it has intermittent output, and therefore, a conventional heater is needed as a backup. This study presents the effect of ratio of heat delivered by solar (Qsolar) to the total heat delivered to an adsorption chiller (Qsolar[*]+[*]Qheater) or solar fraction (SF) on the economic and environmental performance of a solar AC. This solar AC is not a solar-assisted AC, and therefore, it needs to fully cover the cooling load. The cooling demand of an office building in Kuala Lumpur, {{and the performance of}} flat-plate collectors and the adsorption chiller were calculated by equest and watsun software and by a mathematical model, respectively. Economic performance was analyzed by life-cycle cost analysis, whereas the environmental performance was analyzed by using typical emissions rate of energy systems used. It was found that a boiler was a better solution than an electric heater as a <b>backup</b> <b>heater.</b> Furthermore, the net profit (NP) at lower SF was higher because of its lower capital investment, but more emissions were released compared to the conventional AC because of the boiler operation. Thus, when economic and environmental performance were fairly considered, it is appropriate to have solar AC with an SF around 0. 74...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{new concept}} for solar active houses is {{presented}} within this paper. In contrast to existing solar house solutions, the solar collec- tor heat gains are distributed in a temperature-optimized way to three different heat sinks – a significantly smaller storage tank, concrete floor elements directly {{fed by the}} solar circuit and a ground heat exchanger which also serves as the heat source of a heat pump, which is the <b>backup</b> <b>heater.</b> This new layout should reduce the today's usual extra system costs of solar houses by about 25 %. System simulations prove the functionality of the concept and show even higher solar fractions and energy savings as simulated for the existing solar active house concept. One of the main components in the new concept is the controller which has to decide which heat sink will be charged. A control strategy was developed which evaluates the potential outputs of the collector opera- ting to each heat sink. Simulations allow determining the optimal control parameters for this approach. While the thermal activa- tion is able to compensate the decreasing solar input to the smaller storage tank, {{the effects of the}} regeneration of the ground heat exchanger are significantly smaller. However, the regeneration avoids a long-term temperature decrease in the ground and may allow a reduction of the heat exchanger area...|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} highlight describes NREL {{tests to}} capture information about heat pump performance {{across a wide}} range of ambient conditions for five heat pump water heaters (HPWH). These water heaters have the potential to significantly reduce water heater energy use relative to traditional electric resistance water heaters. These tests have provided detailed performance data for these appliances, which have been used to evaluate the cost of saved energy as a function of climate. The performance of HPWHs is dependent on ambient air temperature and humidity and the logic controlling the heat pump and the <b>backup</b> resistance <b>heaters.</b> The laboratory tests were designed to measure each unit's performance across a range of air conditions and determine the specific logic controlling the two heat sources, which has a large effect on the comfort of the users and the energy efficiency of the system. Unlike other types of water heaters, HPWHs are both influenced by and have an effect on their surroundings. Since these effects are complex and different for virtually every house and climate region, creating an accurate HPWH model from the data gathered during the laboratory tests was a main goal of the project. Using the results from NREL's laboratory tests, such as the Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves for different air conditions as shown in Figure 1, an existing HPWH model is being modified to produce more accurate whole-house simulations. This will allow the interactions between the HPWH and the home's heating and cooling system to be evaluated in detail, for any climate region. Once these modeling capabilities are in place, a realistic cost-benefit analysis can be performed for a HPWH installation anywhere in the country. An accurate HPWH model will help to quantify the savings associated with installing a HPWH in the place of a standard electric water heater. In most locations, HPWHs are not yet a cost-effective alternative to natural gas water heaters. The detailed system performance maps that were developed by this testing program will be used to: (1) Target regions of the country that would benefit most from this technology; (2) Identify improvements in current systems to maximize homeowner cost savings; and (3) Explore opportunities for development of advanced hot water heating systems...|$|R
40|$|SHW {{systems are}} {{generally}} {{expected to last}} for at least 20 years {{with little or no}} maintenance. However, in many cases failures occur far sooner due to a variety of problems, many of which are undetected or detected long after the system has failed because the <b>backup</b> <b>heater</b> silently assumes the heating load. Some of the failures may cause the system to run inefficiently or even damage other system components, such as when a system loses fluid in the solar loop and the pump runs dry, eventually destroying itself. In recent years there has been an increasing demand for SHW systems to become economic and reliable. Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) in SHW systems {{is an important part of}} maintaining proper performance, reducing power consumption and unnecessary peak electricity demand. The aim of the current work is to develop anomaly detection system that can reliably detect both anticipated and unforeseen faults and can be implemented in commercial SHW systems without any additional sensors to the ones commonly needed for ordinary system control. Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) -based neural networks are chosen to perform this task, because the ART-based neural networks are fast, efficient learners and retain memory while learning new patterns. In particular, the ART networks can be incorporated into SHW system controller without any extra sensors and have the capability of an early detection of performance degradation faults. Other benefits of ART-based neural networks are on-line fault detection for its high computational efficiency and no involvement of faulty data for the training process. A testbed for SHW system reliability is developed for the purposes of investigating the fault detection system. The input patterns of the fault detection system are generated from two sensors: collector plate temperature and water tank heat exchanger outlet temperature, which are normally installed in residential SHW systems installed by commercial operators. One of the strengths of the system is that only few data points are needed, meaning that it will not be necessary to instrument SHW systems with additional sensors, something which would not be acceptable in an aggressively competitive industry where reducing costs is paramount. The training data for the fault detection system are generated from a verified SHW system TRNSYS (Transient Systems Simulation) model. The simulation and experimental results show that the ART-based anomaly detection has the capability to accurately and efficiently detect degradation and failure. Faults are detected at various levels depending on their severity. The ART-based anomaly detection can be used for SHW real-time reliability monitoring, as well as, eventually, in larger, more complex systems such as commercial building HVAC systems or subsystems.
