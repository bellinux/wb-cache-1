50|$|The tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauge {{is not as}} {{accurate}} as the standard rain gauge because the rainfall may stop before the lever has tipped.

Tipping buckets also tend to underestimate the amount of rainfall, particularly in snowfall and heavy rainfall events. The advantage of the tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauge is that the character of the rain (light, medium, or heavy) may be easily obtained. Rainfall character is decided by the total amount of rain that has fallen in a set period (usually 1 hour) and by counting the number of 'clicks' in a 10-minute period the observer can decide the character of the rain.

40|$|Based on {{rainfall}} intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, {{a robust}} optimization approach is proposed {{to identify the}} best locations to install new rain gauges. The advantage of robust optimization is that the resulting design solutions yield networks which behave acceptably under hydrological variability. Robust optimisation can overcome the problem of selecting representative rainfall events when building the optimization process. This paper reports an original approach based on Montana IDF model parameters. The latter {{are assumed to be}} geostatistical variables and their spatial interdependence is taken into account through the adoption of cross-variograms in the kriging process. The problem of optimally locating a fixed number of new monitoring stations based on an existing rain gauge network is addressed. The objective function is based on the mean spatial kriging variance and rainfall variogram structure using a variance-reduction method. Hydrological variability was taken into account by considering and implementing several return periods to define the robust objective function. Variance minimization is performed using a simulated annealing algorithm. In addition, knowledge of the time horizon is needed for the computation of the robust objective function. A short and a long term horizon were studied, and optimal networks are identified for each. The method developed is applied to north Tunisia (area = 21 000 km 2 ). Data inputs for the variogram analysis were IDF curves provided by the hydrological bureau and available for 14 tipping <b>bucket</b> type <b>rain</b> gauges. The recording period was from 1962 to 2001, depending on the station. The study concerns an imaginary network augmentation based on the network configuration in 1973, which is a very significant year in Tunisia because there was an exceptional regional flood event in March 1973. This network consisted of 13 stations and did not meet World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations for the minimum spatial density. So, it is proposed to virtually augment it by 25, 50, 100 and 160 % which is the rate that would meet WMO requirements. Results suggest that for a given augmentation robust networks remain stable overall for the two time horizons...|$|R

40|$|Rain {{rates as}} derived from {{standard}} tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauges have variable integration times {{corresponding to the}} interval between bucket tips. For example, the integration time for the Weathertronics rain gauge is given by delta(T) = 15. 24 /R (min), where R is the rain rate expressed in mm/h and delta(T) is the time between tips expressed in minutes. It is apparent that a rain rate of 1 mm/h has an integration time in excess of 15 minutes. Rain rates larger than 15. 24 mm/h will have integration times smaller than 1 minute. The integration time is dictated {{by the time it}} takes to fill a small tipping bucket where each tip gives rise to 0. 254 mm of rainfall.

Leuven) for the water company Aquafin, a small, short range, high resolution X-band weather radar called Local Area Weather Radar (LAWR, DHI) has been installed in the densely populated city centre of Leuven (Belgium). The radar beam has a horizontal opening angle of approximately 4 degrees, making quantitative precipitation estimation possible up to a distance of 15 km from the radar site. The radar data {{are being used to}} study the impact of the spatial variability of rainfall on sewer system design and operation. Since weather radar measures the rain rate indirectly (through measurement of reflected energy), the system needs to be calibrated before quantitative precipitation estimation is possible. For this, data of a network existing of several well calibrated tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauges are used. The calibration procedure of the rain gauges is based on the one described by Luyckx and Berlamont (2001), and consists of a dynamic calibration in the field, which takes the loss of water due to the tipping motion of the bucket explicitly into account. In the radar calibration technique, the tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauge errors are taken into account.

This report summaries the results from the 2010 evaluations. Eight controllers were evaluated over a 238 day period, from March 29 - November 22, 2010. Controller performance is analyzed for the entire evaluation period as well as seasonally (spring, summer, fall). Controller performance is evaluated by comparison to the irrigation recommendation of the TexasET Network and Website. This year, we introduce a new evaluate methodology: irrigation adequacy in order to identify controllers which apply excessive and inadequate amounts of water. Programing smart controllers for specific site conditions continues to be a problem. Only two (2) of the eight (8) controllers tested could be programmed directly with all the parameters needed to define each zone. The 2010 results showed an increase in controller performance compared to the Year One and Year Two results. However, we continue to see controllers irrigating excessively; some irrigated in excess of ETc even though 17 inches of rainfall fell during the study. Total Irrigation Amounts * When looking at total irrigation amounts for the entire landscape, one (1) controller was within +/- 20 % the recommendation of the TexasET Network for five (5) stations * Two (2) controllers applied greater than a simple ETc model (ETo x Kc, neglecting rainfall) and one (1) controller was greater than ETo. Adequacy Analysis * No controllers were consistently able (across all 6 stations) to adequately meet the plant water requirements throughout the entire season. * The results showed inconsistency in performance by the 8 controllers, with three (3) controllers irrigating excessive volumes and four (4) controllers irrigating inadequate volumes. * Two (2) controllers had five (5) stations irrigate adequate amounts and two (2) controllers had four (4) stations irrigate adequate amounts. Factors that could have caused over/under irrigation of landscapes are improper ETo calculations and insufficient accounting for rainfall. Only three (3) controllers were equipped with ?tipping <b>bucket?</b> type <b>rain</b> gauges which actually measure rainfall. Two of these were consistency among the top 3 performing controllers. Based on 2010 performance, controllers which used onsite sensors for ET calculations irrigated closer to the recommendations of the TexasET Network than those which operate on an ET subscription. It was observed that controllers that used on site sensors more often produced inadequate irrigation amounts compared to ET subscription controllers that generally produced excessive irrigation amounts...|$|R
40|$|To predict outage due to rain {{attenuation}} at millimeter wavelengths, propagation prediction models require {{rain rate}} averaged over one minute. Recently several tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauges do not measure rain rate; they provide only a rough {{estimate of the}} quantity of water accumulated in one minute by {{counting the number of}} tips. In this paper we propose a new algorithm to extract rain rate from data gathered with modern raingauges, and test its performance against an extensive database collected over a period of eight years...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Measuring hillslope erosion has {{historically}} been a costly, time-consuming practice. An easy to install low-cost technique using silt fences (geotextile fabric) and tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauges to measure onsite hillslope erosion was developed and tested. Equipment requirements, installation procedures, statistical design, and analysis methods for measuring hillslope erosion are discussed. The use of silt fences is versatile; various plot sizes {{can be used to}} measure hillslope erosion in different settings and to determine effectiveness of various treatments or practices. Silt fences are installed by making a sediment trap facing upslope such that runoff cannot go around the ends of the silt fence. The silt fence is folded to form a pocket for the sediment to settle on and reduce the possibility of sediment undermining the silt fence. Cleaning out and weighing the accumulated sediment in the field can be accomplished with a portable hanging or platform scale at various time intervals depending on the necessary degree of detail in the measurement of erosion (that is, after every storm, quarterly, or seasonally). Silt fences combined with a tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> gauge provide an easy, low-cost method to quantify precipitation/hillslope erosion relationships. Trap efficiency of the silt fences are greater that 90 percent efficient, thus making them suitable to estimate hillslope erosion...|$|E
