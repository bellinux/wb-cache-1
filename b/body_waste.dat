40|$|Cachexia is an {{irreversible}} {{process that can}} develop {{in the course of}} chronic disease. It is characterized by the remodeling of the metabolic, inflammatory, and endocrine pathways. Insulin, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) are involved in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism, which regulates body composition. In <b>body</b> <b>wasting</b> and cachexia, their signaling is impaired and causes anabolic/catabolic imbalance. Important mechanisms include inflammatory cytokines and neurohormonal activation. Remodeled post-receptor insulin, GH, and IGF- 1 pathways constitute a potential target for pharmacological treatment in the setting of <b>body</b> <b>wasting</b> and cachexia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, drugs inhibiting angiotensin II action (angiotensin II antagonists and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme), and testosterone, which interfere with post-receptor pathways of insulin, GH, and IGF- 1, were investigated as pharmacological intervention targets and various clinically important implications were reported. There are several other potential targets, but their treatment feasibility and applicability is yet to be established...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac {{cachexia}} (i. e. <b>body</b> <b>wasting)</b> {{has long}} been recognised as a serious complication of chronic heart failure (CHF) which affects many body systems and remains an important and increasing public health problem. The occurrence of wasting in CHF {{has been known for}} many centuries but little investigated. Independently of functional disease severity, age, and measures of exercise capacity and cardiac function, cardiac cachexia is associated with poor prognosis. Cachectic CHF patients are weaker and fatigue earlier because of a general loss of fat tissue, lean tissue and bone tissue as well as impaired muscle quality. There is a shift of understanding of pathophysiology of cardiac cachexia with increasing evidences that metabolic, neurohormonal and immune abnormalities may play a significant role as well the degree of <b>body</b> <b>wasting</b> is dependent on such changes. It has been shown that cardiac cachexia is linked to raised plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and other inflammatory cytokines and increased concentration of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol.

5000|$|The {{extracellular}} fluid is constantly “stirred” by the circulatory system, which {{ensures that the}} watery environment which bathes the body’s cells is virtually identical throughout the body. This means that nutrients can be secreted into the ECF in one place (e.g. the gut, liver, or fat cells) and will, within about a minute, be evenly distributed throughout the body. Hormones are similarly rapidly and evenly spread to every cell in the body, regardless of where they are secreted into the blood. Oxygen {{taken up by the}} lungs from the alveolar air is also evenly distributed at the correct partial pressure to all the cells of the <b>body.</b> <b>Waste</b> products are also uniformly spread to the whole of the ECF, and are removed from this general circulation at specific points (or organs), once again ensuring that there is generally no localized accumulation of unwanted compounds or excesses of otherwise essential substances (e.g. sodium ions, {{or any of the other}} constituents of the ECF). The only significant exception to this general principle is the plasma in the veins, where the concentrations of dissolved substances in individual veins differs, to varying degrees, from those in the rest of the ECF. However this plasma is confined within the waterproof walls of the venous tubes, and therefore does not affect the interstitial fluid that forms the [...] "pond" [...] in which the body's cell live. When the blood from all the veins in body mixes in the heart and lungs, the differing compositions cancel out (e.g. acidic blood from active muscles is neutralized by the alkaline blood homeostatically produced by the kidneys). From the left atrium onward, to every organ in the body, the normal, homeostatically regulated values of all of the ECF’s components are therefore restored.|$|E
