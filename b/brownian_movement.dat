Work with isolated droplets of cytoplasm from algae demonstrates a set of fibers involved in both cytoplasmic streaming and saltatory motion, suggesting that both phenomena {{are related to the}} same force-generating set of fibers. Analysis of a variety of systems in which streaming and/or saltatory movement occurs reveals two types of fiber systems spatially correlated with the movement, microtubules and 50 A micro filaments. The fibers in Nitella (alga) are of the microfilament type. In other systems (melanocyte processes, mitotic apparatus, nerve axons) microtubules occur.

40|$|Background: Theoretical studies {{predict that}} Lévy walks maximizes {{the chance of}} encountering {{randomly}} distributed targets with a low density, but Brownian walks is favorable inside a patch of targets with high density. Recently, experimental data reports that some animals indeed show a Lévy and <b>Brownian</b> walk <b>movement</b> patterns when forage for foods in areas with low and high density. This paper presents a simple, Gaussian-noise utilizing computational model that can realize such behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings: We extend Lévy walks model {{of one of the}} simplest creature, Escherichia coli, based on biological fluctuation framework. We build a simulation of a simple, generic animal to observe whether Lévy or Brownian walks will be performed properly depends on the target density, and investigate the emergent behavior in a commonly faced patchy environment where the density alternates. Conclusions/Significance: Based on the model, animal behavior of choosing Lévy or <b>Brownian</b> walk <b>movement</b> patterns based on the target density is able to be generated, without changing the essence of the stochastic property in Escherichia coli physiological mechanism as explained by related researches. The emergent behavior and its benefits in a patchy environment are also discussed.

40|$|Background: Identifying {{movement}} {{routes and}} stopover sites {{is necessary for}} developing effective management and conservation strategies for migratory animals. In the case of migratory birds, a collection of migration routes, known as a flyway, is often hundreds to thousands of kilometers long and can extend across political boundaries. Flyways encompass the entire geographic range between the breeding and non-breeding areas of a population, species, {{or a group of}} species, and they provide spatial frameworks for management and conservation across international borders. Existing flyway maps are largely qualitative accounts based on band returns and survey data rather than observed movement routes. In this study, we use satellite and GPS telemetry data and dynamic <b>Brownian</b> bridge <b>movement</b> models to build upon existing maps and describe waterfowl space use probabilistically in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. Results: Our approach provided new information on migratory routes that was not easily attainable with existing methods to describe flyways.

40|$|AbstractPlanar {{polarization}} of the forming hair bundle, the mechanosensory antenna of auditory hair cells, {{depends on the}} poorly characterized center-to-edge displacement of a primary cilium, the kinocilium, at their apical surface. Taking advantage of the gradient of hair cell differentiation along the cochlea, we reconstituted {{a map of the}} kinocilia displacements in the mouse embryonic cochlea. We then developed a cochlear organotypic culture and video-microscopy approach to monitor the movements of the kinocilium basal body (mother centriole) and its daughter centriole, which we analyzed using particle tracking and modeling. We found that both hair cell centrioles undergo confined <b>Brownian</b> <b>movements</b> around their equilibrium positions, under the apparent constraint of a radial restoring force of ∼ 0. 1 pN. This magnitude depended little on centriole position, suggesting nonlinear interactions with constraining, presumably cytoskeletal elements. The only dynamic change observed during the period of kinocilium migration was a doubling of the centrioles’ confinement area taking place early in the process. It emerges from these static and dynamic observations that kinocilia migrate gradually in parallel with the organization of hair cells into rows during cochlear neuroepithelium extension. Analysis of the confined motion of hair cell centrioles under normal and pathological conditions should help determine which structures contribute to the restoring force exerting on them...|$|R

40|$|Background: Global {{positioning}} system (GPS) technology for monitoring home range and movements of wildlife {{has resulted in}} prohibitively large sample sizes of locations for traditional estimators of home range. We used areaunder- the-curve to explore the fit of 8 estimators of home range to data collected with both GPS and concurrent very high frequency (VHF) technology on a terrestrial mammal, the Florida panther Puma concolor coryi, to evaluate recently developed and traditional estimators. Results: Area-under-the-curve was the highest for Florida panthers equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology compared to VHF technology. For our study animal, estimators of home range that incorporated a temporal component to estimation performed better than traditional first- and second-generation estimators. Conclusions: Comparisons of fit of home range contours with locations collected would suggest that use of VHF technology is not as accurate as GPS technology to estimate size of home range for large mammals. Estimators of home range collected with GPS technology performed better than those estimated with VHF technology regardless of estimator used. Furthermore, estimators that incorporate a temporal component (third-generation estimators) {{appeared to be the}} most reliable regardless of whether kernel-based or Brownian bridge-based algorithms were used and in comparison to first- and second-generation estimators. We defined third-generation estimators of home range as any estimator that incorporates time, space, animal-specific parameters, and habitat.
