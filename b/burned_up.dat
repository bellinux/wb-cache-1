5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of the reactors to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been <b>burned</b> <b>up</b> to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being <b>burned</b> <b>up</b> as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Since {{several years}} irradiations of HTR-spherical fuel {{elements}} {{have been done}} in a reflector position 6 V at the JUlich research reactor FRJ- 2 (DIDO), in the course of which the target <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> of the nuclear fuel has a fixed value. For the prediction of the shut down moment it is necessary to know the momentary fuel <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> state of the irradiation experiment at any time. On account of the construction of the irradiation rig the fuel <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> determination can only be performed by calculation. Only after that, this means following the irradiation end, the reached fuel <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> of the HTR-spherical fuel element can likewise be measured by gamma spectrometryor by mass spectrometry. The present report describes the neutronic calculations which are needed for the fuel <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> determination. Under the given circumstances especially the self shielding correction for the HTR-spherical fuel element is accentuated which in the case of low enriched fuel is inevitable because of the now important resonance absorption of the neutrons in the nuclear fuel U 238. It appears, that under optimal circumstances our fuel <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> calculation is feasible with an average relative single standard deviation of approximately 7 percent. In the case of the HTR irradiation experiment JK 13 there was found an agreement between the total fuel <b>burn</b> <b>up</b> which was calculated by our treatment on one hand, and those which was measured in the hot cells of the KFA on the other. This statement refers to a statistical significance level of 95 percent...|$|R

5|$|Wigner was {{disappointed}} that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it {{by the head of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem. Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were <b>burned</b> <b>up</b> and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year. During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site. Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|The team finds {{another version}} of themselves, dead, who come from yet another {{parallel}} universe and were trapped aboard while investigating the ship, just as they are. Soon, the ship jumps again, into a reality where Atlantis is under attack from an unfamiliar alien ship. Sheppard intervenes, and the aliens retaliate by launching fighters. One of the fighters crashes into the Daedalus before it jumps again, this time into a universe where Atlantis' sun has already swelled into a red giant. To keep the ship from being <b>burned</b> <b>up,</b> McKay (David Hewlett) increases {{the rate at which}} the alternate reality drive activates, warning that his modifications are irreversible. Meanwhile, the team must contend with aliens from the crashed fighter. McKay figures out that there is no way to guide the alternate reality drive, but that they can return to their original reality by reversing the drive and jumping back through the realities they had visited before. They use the maneuvering thrusters to stabilize the ship's orbit above the red giant, and weather another attack by the aliens, with help from an alternate Atlantis. Once they return to their own reality, they leave the ship in space suits after a remaining alien detonates an explosive, causing a breach in the ship's hull and are picked up by Lorne (Kavan Smith) after the Daedalus disappears. In the end, McKay is shown working on fixing the alternate reality drive, despite Sheppard's admonishments.|$|E

25|$|Most reactor designs rely on liquid {{hydrogen}} {{as both a}} coolant and a method for converting stray neutrons from the reaction into tritium, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is highly flammable, {{and in the case}} of a fire it is possible that the hydrogen stored on-site could be <b>burned</b> <b>up</b> and escape. In this case, the tritium contents of the hydrogen would be released into the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that at about , the total amount of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be so small that they would have diluted to legally acceptable limits by the time they blew as far as the station's perimeter fence.|$|E

He notes three other attempts to use the same gimmick—Franz Niklaus König's Atlas céleste (1826), Friedrich Braun's Himmels-Atlas in transparenten Karten (1850), and Otto Möllinger's Himmelsatlas (1851), but states that they lack Urania's Mirrors artistry.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate {{breakfast and}} began {{preparations}} for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the [...] "porch" [...] of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human {{to walk on the}} Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: [...] "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." [...] Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: [...] "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" [...] The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had <b>burned</b> <b>up</b> with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a [...] crater on the rim of Flag crater, about [...] across. There, at a distance of [...] from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator William R. Muehlberger. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about [...] from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16 mm movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.|$|E
