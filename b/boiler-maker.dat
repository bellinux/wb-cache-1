I caught her and rode her till after sunrise to Masson City, 25,000 inhabitants. Caught a cattle train and rode all night.|$|E

The C. & A. runs through here, and we're {{going to take}} that. <b>Boiler-Maker</b> went off, but didn't return. Guess he caught a freight.|$|E

60|$|Prescott laughed. Remembering how Jernyngham {{had driven}} a truculent rabble out of Sebastian, {{he could imagine}} {{the scene in the}} shed; but it was evident that the <b>boiler-makers</b> bore him no malice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saturday, May 26th. At 2.11 A.M. {{we caught}} the Cannonball as she slowed {{up at the}} crossing. Scotty and Davy were ditched. The four of us were ditched at the Bluffs, forty miles farther on. In the {{afternoon}} Fish and McAvoy caught a freight while <b>Boiler-Maker</b> and I were away getting something to eat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Friday, May 25th. <b>Boiler-Maker</b> and I {{left the}} {{camp on the}} island. We went ashore on the Illinois side in a skiff and walked six miles on the C.B. & Q. to Fell Creek. We had gone six miles out of our way, but we got on a hand-car and rode six miles to Hull's, on the Wabash. While there, we met McAvoy, Fish, Scotty, and Davy, who had also pulled out from the Army.|$|E
60|$|In {{his younger}} days Murray {{had been a}} <b>boiler-maker,</b> and he still {{retained}} most of his great strength. He was a veritable mountain of a man, and now {{in the throes of}} a berserker rage he was a formidable opponent. His face was white and his lips were drawn back tightly, exposing his teeth in a bestial snarl as he charged at Jimmy. His great arms and huge hands beat to the right and left like enormous flails, one blow from which might seemingly have felled an ox.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Docker {{has risen}} to his feet amidst a little hoarse cheering. For {{a quarter of an}} hour or more, he spoke fluently and convincingly. It {{appeared}} from his statements that <b>boiler-makers</b> were the worst paid mechanics in the universe, that it was he who had discovered this, that it was he who had drawn up the ultimatum which had been presented to the masters and refused. His peroration was friendly but appealing.|$|R

[...] "You see, there are a great number of tables. The commodore is entitled to dine alone, so is the captain and the commander, while the other officers have what they call the wardroom mess. Then there are the steerage mess, for midshipmen, ensigns, and clerks; the master-at-arm's mess, for yeomen, machinists, <b>boiler-makers,</b> and so on; and three or four other messes besides, including that to which you will belong. We gunners dine with the boatswain, sail-maker, and carpenter." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{personal}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} exposure levels {{of a group}} of welders and nearby workers were estimated using a photosensitive polymer film, polysulphone. The polysulphone film was attached to the inner and outer surfaces of eye protection, the workers' clothing, and also placed throughout the work area. The estimated average ocular exposures (inside the helmets) for welders and <b>boiler-makers</b> were between four and five times the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit, and the estimated exposures at the spectacles of nonwelders were around 9 times MPE. Body exposures (at the clothing surface) for welders were estimated to be around 3000 times MPE and for nonwelders around 13 times MPE. The ambient ultraviolet radiation levels in the factory were found to exceed the MPE by an average of 5. 5 times, even in nonwelding areas. The results suggest that welders require additional ocular protection to supplement conventional welding helmets, and any exposed skin areas of workers in this environment should also be protected...|$|R
60|$|It was at Hannibal, Missouri, {{that the}} ten invincibles went to pieces. It was not planned. We just {{naturally}} flew apart. The <b>Boiler-Maker</b> and I deserted secretly. On {{the same day}} Scotty and Davy made a swift sneak for the Illinois shore; also McAvoy and Fish achieved their get-away. This accounts for six of the ten; what became of the remaining four I do not know. As a sample of life on The Road, I make the following quotation from my diary of the several days following my desertion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monicas" [...] are the nom-de-rails that hoboes assume {{or accept}} when thrust upon {{them by their}} fellows. Leary Joe, for instance, was timid, and was so named by his fellows. No self-respecting hobo would select Stew Bum for himself. Very few tramps care to {{remember}} their pasts during which they ignobly worked, so monicas based upon trades are very rare, though I remember having met the following: Moulder Blackey, Painter Red, Chi Plumber, <b>Boiler-Maker,</b> Sailor Boy, and Printer Bo. [...] "Chi" [...] (pronounced shy), by the way, is the argot for [...] "Chicago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a bit," [...] {{said the}} <b>boiler-maker.</b> [...] "All {{we were afraid}} of was that a train might come in with the boss on board; but we chanced it. We told Kermode he might go round the tank-plate landings--the laps, you know--with the caulker, {{and give them a}} rough tuck in, ready for us to finish; and then we went off. Well, we didn't shoot any wild hens, though Bill got some pellets in his leg, and when we came back we both felt pretty bad when we saw what Kermode had done. Bill couldn't think of names enough to call him, and he's good at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here, {{as we have}} said, above 3500 men {{and boys}} were at work, {{and all sorts of}} trades were represented. There were draughtsmen to make designs, and, from these, {{detailed}} working drawings. Smiths to forge all the wrought-iron-work, with hammermen as assistants. Pattern-makers to make wooden patterns for castings. Moulders, including loam, dry-sand and green-sand moulders and brass-founders. Dressers to dress the rough edges off the castings when brought from the foundry. Turners in iron and brass. Planers and nibblers, and slotters and drillers. Joiners and sawyers, and coach-builders and painters. Fitters and erecters, to do the rougher and heavier part of fitting the engines together. <b>Boiler-makers,</b> including platers or fitters, caulkers and riveters. Finishers to do the finer part of fitting--details and polishing. In short almost every trade in the kingdom concentrated in one grand whole and working harmoniously, like a vast complex machine, towards one common end--the supply of railway rolling-stock, or [...] "plant" [...] to the line.|$|R
40|$|The central {{economic}} unit within the → socio-organisation of the Kalderaš – of the → <b>boiler-makers</b> or the coppersmiths – {{is represented by}} the kumpania which is the joining together of more extended families (vica/-i) or of the members of different vici in order to form an economic community. A kumpania does not follow a strict order but represents a loose association, which can be extended or reduced permanently, depending on the requirements of the present relations. The professional knowledge is handed down within the families and/or the kumpania. Preconditions for a functioning kumpania are an unlimited co-operation and the fulfilment of group internal rules, whereas the traditional law and court of the Roma – → kris – functions as the control organ. If these factors are met a kumpania represents the possibility to react, in a flexible way, to current economic and social conditions and to discover always new economic niches thanks to its independent and open structure. This kind of flexibility was and still is of great importance because the Roma and Sinti {{do not have access to}} many professional areas. The reasons for this limitation were mainly discriminating regulations, prejudices and stereotypes. In the German-speaking areas, Roma and Sinti groups have continually been hindered from settling within city walls. They were not allowed to become members of craft guilds or to purchase agriculturall...|$|R
60|$|But, you see, {{it come to}} {{her through}} two hands, {{and of course it}} didn't come through the second hand for nothing. Why did it come through the second hand at all? Why, this way. The second hand took the risk of the given-out work, you see. If she had money enough to pay the {{security}} deposit,--call it two pound,--she could get the work from the first hand, and so the second would not have to be deducted for. But, having no money at all, the second hand come in and took its profit, and so the whole worked down to tenpence half-penny. Having explained all this with great intelligence, even with some little pride, and without a whine or murmur, she folded her work again, sat down by her husband's side at the washing-stool, and resumed her dinner of dry bread. Mean as the meal was, on the bare board, with its old gallipots for cups, and what not other sordid makeshifts; shabby as the woman was in dress, and toning done towards the Bosjesman colour, with want of nutriment and washing,--there was positively a dignity in her, as the family anchor just holding the poor ship-wrecked boilermaker's bark. When I left the room, the <b>boiler-maker's</b> eyes were slowly turned towards her, as if his last hope of ever again seeing that vanished boiler lay in her direction.|$|R
6000|$|I trust, my dear Eugenius, {{that you}} have {{recognised}} yourself in a certain Uncommercial, and also some small reference to a name rather dear to you? As an instance of how strangely something comic springs up {{in the midst of}} the direst misery, look to a succeeding Uncommercial, called [...] "A Small Star in the East," [...] published to-day, by-the-bye. I have described, with exactness, the poor places into which I went, and how the people behaved, and what they said. I was wretched, looking on; and yet the <b>boiler-maker</b> and the poor man with the legs filled me with a sense of drollery not to be kept down by any pressure.|$|E
60|$|A {{telegram}} with a procès-verbal {{was at once}} {{sent off}} to the Prince; Sa'íd Bey and Ra'íf Bey hastened to our aid, and Mr. Williams, superintending engineer of the Khedivíyyah line, with the whole of his staff, stripped and set {{to work at the}} peccant tubes and air-pump. They commenced with extinguishing a serious fire which burst from the waste-room--by no means pleasant when close to kegs of blasting-powder carefully sewn up in canvas. They laboured with a will, and before sunset Mr. Williams informed us that he would guarantee the engines for eight days, when we were starting on a dangerous cruise for four months. He also supplied us with an Egyptian <b>boiler-maker</b> and with eleven instead of sixty new tubes: we lost forty-two of the old ones between Suez and El-Muwaylah. Before sunset we made a trial trip, the wretched old kettle acting tant bien que mal; we returned to re-embark the soldiers and the mules, and we set out for the second time at 5.30 p.m.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was not {{surprised}} to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with his legs dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despised--on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose. This was the foreman--a <b>boiler-maker</b> by trade--a good worker. He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality, for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with six young children (he had left them {{in charge of a}} sister of his to come out there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose. It had loops to go over his ears. In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{patterns}} of mortality for specific {{causes of death}} with increases in the Texaco mortality study {{to determine if the}} patterns are related to employment in the petroleum industry. METHODS: Mortality patterns by duration of employment in various job groups were examined for mesothelioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, cell type specific leukaemia, and brain tumours. RESULTS: Mortality from mesothelioma was examined for the total cohort and for two maintenance groups with the greatest potential for exposure to asbestos. The insulator group had a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 3029, and a larger group consisting of insulators, carpenters, labourers, electricians, pipefitters, <b>boiler-makers,</b> and welders had an SMR of 411. The mortalities from mesothelioma increased with increasing duration of employment. Mortality was lower for those first employed after 1950. An analysis of all brain tumours for the total cohort and some job and unit subgroups resulted in an SMR of 178 for those employed on the units related to motor oil and 166 for those employed as laboratory workers. Mortality from brain tumours in both of these job groups was higher for those employed > or = 5 years in the group. An analysis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed no consistent patterns among the various employment groups. Mortality from multiple myeloma was non-significantly increased among people employed on the crude (SMR = 155) and fluid catalytic cracking units (SMR = 198). Leukaemia mortality was not increased for the total cohort, and a cell type analysis of leukaemia mortality for the total cohort showed no significant increases for the major cell types. However, there were significant increases for acute unspecified leukaemia (SMR = 276) and leukaemia of unknown cell type (SMR = 231). CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of specific causes of death by duration of employment in various job and process units did not show any patterns which suggest that, other than for mesothelioma, any of these increases in mortalities were likely to have resulted from workplace exposures or from employment at one of the places included in the Texaco mortality study...|$|R

Then in a low voice, 'You [...] . eh?' I don't know why we behaved like lunatics. I put my finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously. 'Good for you!' he cried, snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one foot. I tried a jig. We capered on the iron deck. A frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels. A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager's hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished too. We stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land. The great wall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence. And it moved not. A deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river. 'After all,' said the <b>boiler-maker</b> in a reasonable tone, 'why shouldn't we get the rivets?' Why not, indeed! I did not know of any reason why we shouldn't.
