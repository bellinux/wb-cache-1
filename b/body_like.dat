5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its <b>body</b> <b>like</b> a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round <b>body</b> <b>like</b> a cylinder illuminated and seen from above {{appears to have}} dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E
5|$|The left {{ventricle}} is much thicker {{as compared with}} the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire <b>body.</b> <b>Like</b> the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The {{left ventricle}} pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E

50|$|For sharp-cornered bluff <b>bodies,</b> <b>like</b> square {{cylinders}} {{and plates}} held transverse to the flow direction, this equation is applicable with the drag coefficient as a constant value when the Reynolds number {{is greater than}} 1000.

5|$|Some {{relatives}} of Compsognathus, namely Sinosauropteryx and Sinocalliopteryx, have been preserved with {{the remains of}} simple feathers covering the <b>body</b> <b>like</b> fur, promoting some scientists to suggest that Compsognathus might have been feathered in a similar way. Consequently, many depictions of Compsognathus show them with coverings of downy proto-feathers. However, no feathers or feather-like covering have been preserved with Compsognathus fossils, in contrast to Archaeopteryx, which {{are found in the}} same sediments. Karin Peyer, in 2006, reported skin impressions preserved {{on the side of the}} tail starting at the 13th tail vertebra. The impressions showed small bumpy tubercles, similar to the scales found on the tail and hind legs of Juravenator. Additional scales had in 1901 been reported by Von Huene, in the abdominal region of the German Compsognathus, but Ostrom subsequently disproved this interpretation; in 2012 they were by Achim Reisdorf seen as plaques of adipocere, corpse wax.|$|E

25|$|Copepods are a {{group of}} small {{crustaceans}} found in ocean and freshwater habitats.
