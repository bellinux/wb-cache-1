Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in all three sessions, capitalized on his teammate's problem and took pole position by over half a second. It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park. The {{rest of the field}} was more than a second behind Hamilton's time, with Felipe Massa in the Williams <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> in third position.

5|$|Secretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My Gallant {{were the}} first four horses to be entered into the Belmont Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, was the odds on {{favorite}} to win the event. The added distance of the Belmont {{when compared to the}} Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of the New York Times wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race went too fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My Gallant was considered the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> especially as he was the progeny of Gallant Man, who set the Belmont Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.|$|E

25|$|In the 2002 Formula One season, Montoya was the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> as Ferrari's {{dominance}} left available {{no better}} place than third. Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello won 15 of 17 races. Although he did not win a race, unlike Coulthard and his teammate Ralf Schumacher, Montoya {{was one of the}} few drivers to compete with Schumacher on the track. As in 2001, he stood out for his forceful overtaking moves on the World Champion, although several times he lost places through clashing with the German. For qualifying, the BMW WilliamsF1 FW24 could be set up to use its tires more effectively than its rivals and generate more grip. With this weapon, Montoya was able to achieve seven pole positions, usually setting his pole time in the very last seconds of the session. He set the fastest-ever average speed over a lap during the qualifying session of the 2002 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Overall, he finished the season in 3rd position in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
500|$|Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg {{were the}} first out in Q3. Hamilton's early sector times put him on course to a new fastest lap of the weekend, but a brake lockup at turn ten ruined his lap and tyres, handing {{provisional}} pole position to Rosberg. As the two Ferrari drivers struggled to find pace, Max Verstappen claimed second place for the time being, before the drivers went out for their second laps. Lewis Hamilton's second flying lap bested Rosberg's time by almost three-tenths of a second, and saw him take the fifty-second pole of his career. The two Red Bull cars of Ricciardo and Verstappen followed, with Räikkönen and Vettel for Ferrari in fifth and sixth respectively, both more than a second behind Hamilton.

50|$|Much like Mozart, many legends {{exist on}} how Li Bai {{effortlessly}} composed his poetry, even (or some say, especially) when drunk; his favorite form is the jueju (five- or seven-character quatrain), {{of which he}} composed some 160 pieces.

500|$|The {{major works}} for voices and {{orchestra}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twenty-one years <b>of</b> Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: <b>The</b> Dream <b>of</b> Gerontius (1900), and the oratorios The Apostles (1903) and The Kingdom (1906); and two shorter odes, the Coronation Ode (1902) and The Music Makers (1912). <b>The</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> odes, as a pièce d'occasion, {{has rarely been}} revived after its initial success, with the culminating [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in Ein Heldenleben. The choral works were all successful, although the first, Gerontius, was and remains the best-loved and most performed. On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting John Ruskin, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> me; for <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory." [...] All three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together.

50|$|Through {{the halfway}} mark, Kipkemboi Kimeli was pushing the pace {{close to the}} world record, marked by Brahim Boutayeb. Only Moses Tanui and {{trailing}} off the back Salvatore Antibo managed to stay in contact. More than 60 metres back, Arturo Barrios led the chase pack. As Tanui came up behind Boutayeb to tighten <b>the</b> lead group <b>of</b> three, Boutayeb went around Kimeli. The two Kenyans ran together in chase for part of a lap then Tanui was unable {{to keep up with}} the accelerated pace. Kimeli managed to keep close to Boutayeb but ever so slightly was losing ground. As Tanui faded, Antibo accelerated to move himself into a stronger medal position. By 5 laps to go, Antibo closed down on Kimeli. The two were jockeying for the position, Antibo first sprinting past Kimeli, then Kimeli accelerating away from Antibo. Boutayeb entered the last lap with a 20-metre lead and ran the last lap checking behind him. Coming down the home stretch, realizing the world record was out of reach, he slowed the last 30 metres and celebrated, blowing kisses to the crowd. Behind him, Antibo made one more move, sprinting around Kimeli, sprinting for home for the silver. Kimeli was unable to respond and cruised home for bronze still more than eleven seconds up on Jean-Louis Prianon and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sprinting efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pack.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> {{good book}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour, then,--I {{do not speak}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bad ones,-- is simply the useful or {{pleasant}} talk of some person whom you cannot otherwise converse with, printed for you. Very useful often, telling you {{what you need to}} know; very pleasant often, as a sensible friend's present talk would be. These bright accounts of travels; good-humoured and witty discussions of question; lively or pathetic story-telling in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> novel; firm fact-telling, by the real agents concerned in <b>the</b> events <b>of</b> passing history;--all these books <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour, multiplying among us as education becomes more general, are a peculiar possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present age: we ought to be entirely thankful for them, and entirely ashamed of ourselves if we make no good use of them. But we make the worst possible use if we allow them to usurp <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> true books: for, strictly speaking, they are not books at all, but merely letters or newspapers in good print. Our friend's letter may be delightful, or necessary, to-day: whether worth keeping or not, is to be considered. The newspaper may be entirely proper at breakfast time, but assuredly it is not reading for all day. So, though bound up in a volume, the long letter which gives you so pleasant an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inns, and roads, and weather, last year at such a place, or which tells you that amusing story, or gives you <b>the</b> real circumstances <b>of</b> such and such events, however valuable for occasional reference, may not be, in <b>the</b> real sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word, a [...] "book" [...] at all, nor, in the real sense, to be [...] "read." [...] A book is essentially not a talking thing, but a written thing; and written, not with a view of mere communication, but <b>of</b> permanence. <b>The</b> book <b>of</b> talk is printed only because its author cannot speak to thousands of people at once; if he could, he would--the volume is mere MULTIPLICATION of his voice. You cannot talk to your friend in India; if you could, you would; you write instead: that is mere CONVEYANCE of voice. But a book is written, not to multiply the voice merely, not to carry it merely, but to perpetuate it. The author has something to say which he perceives to be true and useful, or helpfully beautiful. So far as he knows, no one has yet said it; so far as he knows, no one else can say it. He is bound to say it, clearly and melodiously if he may; clearly at all events. In <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> his life he finds this to be the thing, or group of things, manifest to him;--this, <b>the</b> piece <b>of</b> true knowledge, or sight, which his share of sunshine and earth has permitted him to seize. He would fain set it down for ever; engrave it on rock, if he could; saying, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> me; for <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> I ate, and drank, and slept, loved, and hated, like another; my life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw and knew: this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory."
