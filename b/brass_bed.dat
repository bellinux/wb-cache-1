5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|When the BX was completed, she {{had three}} decks, with stateroom {{accommodation}} for 70 passengers and could also carry another 60 deck passengers. The staterooms featured steam heat, hot and cold running water, fine quality bedding and attractive wall and floor coverings. Her dining room could seat 50 and was lavishly furnished, {{right down to the}} plates, which were specially ordered from England and monogrammed in the BX Company's colors: red, yellow and white. Off the ladies cabin above the covered paddlewheel a bridal chamber was built, which contained, among other luxuries, a double <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> and a silk eiderdown worth $150. Many dignitaries, including Premier Richard McBride would travel in the comfort of this sumptuous suite.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} was an unusually narrow structure, only [...] wide but [...] deep stretching the entire distance from Fifth to Winston Streets. [...] The main floor was an arcade connecting Fifth and Winston Streets with stalls for ten horses, repressed vitrified brick, walls of white enamel tiling, and pressed steel ceilings [...] above the floor. [...] More than anything else, {{it was the}} extravagant third floor living quarters, described as [...] "the chief's boudoir" [...] and a [...] "palace for chiefs," [...] that drew the most attention. [...] Access {{to the third floor}} was by a private elevator that [...] "moves noiselessly and stealthily to the upper haven." [...] The third floor was covered in Peruvian mahogany with French bevel glass mirrors, a mantel of Vermont marble, polished inlaid oak floors, a private slide pole, a massive <b>brass</b> <b>bed,</b> private roof garden, and [...] "a tub big enough for two chiefs." [...] The Times reported: [...] "Notice the Peruvian mahogany carefully, and you will see that the heart of the log has been chosen and that its grain has been placed so that it gives the appearance of real flames. [...] Certainly the esthetic for the reception room of the engine-house de luxe." [...] The chief's apartment alone was reported to have cost $25,000. [...] The Times noted that the quarters rivaled the finest suites in the country, referred to it as a [...] "Sybaritic effort," [...] and offered its sarcastic speculation that the house captain would be expected to [...] "wear evening dress after 6 o'clock, at least." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brass</b> <b>beds</b> are beds {{in which}} the {{headboard}} and footboard are made of brass; the frame rails are usually made of steel. <b>Brass</b> <b>beds</b> can be made of 100 per cent brass or of metals that have been brass-plated.

2500|$|The BC Express Company, (which {{had been}} {{formerly}} known as Barnard's Express) had been freighting in the area since the 1860s during the Cariboo Gold Rush. They were also aware of the great changes that the railway would bring to this sparsely populated area. Thousands of construction workers would soon be working in-between Tête Jaune Cache and Fort George and {{millions of acres of}} land would be opened for settlement. The owner of the BC Express Company was now Charles Vance Millar who had purchased the company from Stephen Tingley in 1897. Millar decided to build two large and very luxurious steamers to accommodate the growing demand. Both were built at Soda Creek by Alexander Watson Junior, the son of the man who had built the Charlotte. The first company sternwheeler was launched in May 1910. It was named the BX and was piloted by Captain Owen Forrester Browne. She had stateroom accommodation for seventy and was also licensed to carry sixty deck passengers. Her paddlewheel was covered, so there was no backsplash, and a fine view could be enjoyed from the stern, which was where the ladies cabin was located. The BX boasted hot and cold running water and steam heat. She soon became the preferred steamer for passenger service and also won the government mail contract. Premier Richard McBride traveled on the BX in her sumptuous bridal suite, which featured, among other luxuries, a double <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> with a silk eiderdown. She was the only steamer that could advertise a bi-weekly service from Soda Creek to Fort George. On Sunday and Wednesday mornings, she would leave Soda Creek at the break of dawn, usually 3am, and would reach Quesnel around noon. After unloading the mail and supplies for that town she would continue upriver until dark, tying up at a woodpile where her crew would have an opportunity to load more fuel aboard. This was called wooding up and it was a common activity. Most sternwheelers burnt upwards of four cords of wood an hour when they were travelling upstream and they could only carry three. She would arrive in Fort George the next day, usually around 11am. Her return trips downriver were far swifter, she would leave Fort George at 7am on Tuesdays and Saturdays, arriving in Soda Creek by 4;30pm of the same day. [...] For the 1911 season of navigation, the BC Express Company built a second sternwheeler, the BC Express which was nearly identical to the BX, only slightly smaller and lacking the covered paddlewheel. Her pilot was Captain Joseph P Bucey. The BC Express worked the route from Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache until 1913 and then joined her sister ship, the BX, on the Soda Creek to Fort George route, where they both worked on the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. In 1915, only the BX worked on the Fraser, and in '16 and '17 there were none at all. The BX returned to the river in 1918, still under Captain Browne, and was joined, when the need arose, by the BC Express.Then, in August 1919, the BX struck a reef named [...] "Woodpecker" [...] and sank in the Fort George Canyon while carrying 100 tons of concrete. Her sister ship towed her back to Quesnel for salvage but she never sailed again.|$|E

6000|$|Naturally, I had {{resolved}} {{that the}} bath-room {{and the big}} <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> should be mine. When I asked the agents to arrange with the captain they seemed non-committal and uncomfortable. [...] "I don't know in the least what it is worth," [...] I said. [...] "And I don't care.

50|$|The {{destruction}} of the hotel was imminent until a group of concerned citizens came together and forced a reconsideration for the property. This led to Klamath County buying the property {{and all of its}} contents, including the original <b>brass</b> <b>beds,</b> dressers, claw foot tubs and other items from the long history of the building and its inhabitants. The conversion was considerably helped by former County Commissioner, Nell Kuonen to whom the Museum owes its gratitude.|$|R

60|$|Youth {{will have}} its way. So will a ship in a sea. And so will a hundred and seventy pounds of a man. The {{beautiful}} hardwood door-panel splintered, the latch fetched away, and I broke the nails of the four fingers of my right hand in a futile grab at the flying door, marring the polished surface with four parallel scratches. I kept right on, erupting into Captain West's spacious room with the big <b>brass</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{after such}} a rebuff, I knew that no {{circumstance}} could ever persuade me to occupy Captain West's <b>brass</b> <b>bed.</b> And it was this Captain Nathaniel West, whom I had not yet met, who had now kept me freezing on pier-ends through four miserable hours.

50|$|The hotel's lobby {{featured}} round seats, {{which remain}} a Cedar Point tradition. The ceiling was elaborate pressed tin and included chandeliers crafted by Tiffany artists. The hotel's original amenities included imported wicker furniture, large <b>brass</b> <b>beds,</b> a manicurist, a physician, a tailor, a stenographer, a barbershop, news stand, {{ice cream parlor}} and souvenir counter. Adjacent to the lobby was a four-story rotunda featuring four tiers of balconies, which remains in the hotel.

Forty <b>brass</b> <b>beds</b> were imported from the city, not, of course, for the guests to sleep in, but to keep them out. A bar-tender with a starched coat and wicker sleeves was put behind the bar.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brass</b> double <b>bed</b> {{is now in}} the {{northwest}} bedroom and also belonged to the Warkentins. Much of the furniture in the bedrooms is not original to the house. The trunk {{at the foot of the}} bed was used by the Warkentins in their travels.|$|R
6000|$|But Jethro Bass {{has been}} dead these twenty years, and his lieutenants shorn of power. An empire has arisen out of {{the ashes of the}} ancient kingdoms.

[...] But there are no guerrillas now, no condottieri who can be hired: the empire has a paid and standing army, as an empire should. The North Country chiefs, so powerful in the clan warfare of bygone days, are generals now,--chiefs of staff. The captain-general, with a minute piece of Honey Dew under his tongue, sits in Number Seven. A new Number Seven,--with electric lights and a bathroom and a <b>brass</b> <b>bed.</b> Tempora mutantur.

60|$|Sir Richmond Hardy was not {{the only}} man who was {{thinking}} intently about Miss Grammont at that particular moment. Two gentlemen were coming towards her across the Atlantic whose minds, it chanced, were very busily occupied by her affairs. One of these was her father, who was lying in his <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> in his commodious cabin on the Hollandia, regretting his diminishing ability to sleep in the early morning now, even {{when he was in the}} strong and soothing air of mid-Atlantic, and thinking of V.V. because she had a way of coming into his mind when it was undefended; and the other was Mr. Gunter Lake on the Megantic, one day out from Sandy Hook, who found himself equally sleepless and preoccupied. And although Mr. Lake was a man of vast activities and complicated engagements he was coming now to Europe for the express purpose of seeing V.V. and having things out with her fully and completely because, in spite of all that had happened, she made such an endless series of delays in coming to America.|$|E
60|$|And it did, at {{one in the}} afternoon, after I {{had been}} {{compelled}} to wait and freeze for four mortal hours. During this time I fully {{made up my mind}} that I was not going to like this Captain West. Although I had never met him, his treatment of me from the outset had been, to say the least, cavalier. When the Elsinore lay in Erie Basin, just arrived from California with a cargo of barley, I had crossed over from New York to inspect what was to be my home for many months. I had been delighted with the ship and the cabin accommodation. Even the stateroom selected for me was satisfactory and far more spacious than I had expected. But when I peeped into the captain's room I was amazed at its comfort. When I say that it opened directly into a bath-room, and that, among other things, it was furnished with a big <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> such as one would never suspect to find at sea, I have said enough.|$|E

(several of his things have appeared in the annuals, and in manuscript in the nobility's albums)--he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem, it was said--Sibwright, however, was absent and his bed given up to Miss Bell. It was the prettiest little <b>brass</b> <b>bed</b> in the world, with chintz curtains lined with pink--he had a mignonette-box in his bedroom window, and the mere sight of his little exhibition of shiny boots, arranged in trim rows over his wardrobe, was a gratification to the beholder. He had a museum of scent, pomatum, and bear's-grease pots, quite curious to examine, too; and a choice selection of portraits of females, almost always in sadness and generally in disguise or deshabille, glittered round the neat walls of his elegant little bower of repose. Medora with dishevelled hair was consoling herself over her banjo for the absence of her Conrad--the Princesse Fleur de Marie (of Rudolstein and the Mysteres de Paris) was sadly ogling out of the bars of her convent cage, in which, poor prisoned bird, she was moulting away,--Dorothea of Don Quixote was washing her eternal feet:--in fine, it was such an elegant gallery as became a gallant lover of the sex. And in Sibwright's sitting-room, while there was quite an infantine law library clad in skins of fresh new-born calf, there was a tolerably large collection of classical books which he could not read, and of English and French works of poetry and fiction which he read a great deal too much. His invitation cards of the past season still decorated his looking-glass: and scarce anything told of the lawyer but the wig-box beside the Venus upon the middle shelf of the bookcase, on which the name of P.
