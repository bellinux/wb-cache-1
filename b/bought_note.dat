The words Chester Perkins had spoken that morning came back to Wetherell as {{he stood in the}} door. And how was he to meet Jethro Bass again with no money to pay even the interest on the note? Then suddenly he missed Cynthia, hurried out, and spied her under the trees on the common so deep in conversation with a boy that she did not perceive him until he spoke to her. The boy looked up, smiling frankly at something Cynthia had said to him. He had honest, humorous eyes, and a browned, freckled face, and was, perhaps, two years older than Cynthia.|$|R

40|$|This project {{assessed}} {{the impact that}} the 2012 drought had on northwest Iowa cow-calf operations. A survey was mailed to 293 beef producers in seventeen northwest Iowa counties. Producers indicated that feed resources were scarce, and those who <b>bought</b> feed <b>noted</b> high prices made feed an undesirable purchase. Future plans included extensive pasture management and feed supplementation. The average pregnancy rate of the females, 93 %, was not significantly affected by the drought, but heat stress on the female was perceived to affect pregnancy rate. Despite drought, 11 % of the producers planned to retain open females. The majority, 75 %, of the operations indicated that drought had little impact on their financial position, but 25 % responded that their financial position would be poorer. To cope, some producers would sell part of the cows, sell the 2012 calves, and/or sell the 2012 replacement heifers. Other producers indicated that total or partial dispersal of the herd may be required. Rain, availability of feeds, and price of feedstuffs would dictate whether they kept or sold calves and cows...|$|R
50|$|A bank lends {{money to}} a company, XYZ, {{and at the time}} of loan issues credit-linked <b>notes</b> <b>bought</b> by investors. The {{interest}} rate on the notes is determined by the credit risk of the company XYZ. The funds the bank raises by issuing notes to investors are invested in bonds with low probability of default. If company XYZ is solvent, the bank is obligated to pay the notes in full. If company XYZ goes bankrupt, the note-holders/investors become the creditor of the company XYZ and receive the company XYZ loan. The bank in turn gets compensated by the returns on less-risky bond investments funded by issuing credit linked notes.|$|R

They bought a large parcel of undeveloped land in the French portion of Saint Martin around 1964, Philippe's dream had been to build a luxury resort called La Belle Creole which would be like a tiny portion of France in the Caribbean. Philippe's intended guests were the people he had been acquainted with through his hotel work. His plans were also for a casino, a nightclub and various luxury shops as part of the resort. The French government was interested enough in the project to assist Philippe by providing a desalination plant and a paved road leading to the potential resort. Philippe hired architects and designers who estimated that it would cost about $5.5 million to make the dream a reality. It was decided to break ground after an investment of $2.5 million, which was enough to construct buildings and begin the resort plans. However, Philippe's funds ran out by 1969 and work on La Belle Creole was suspended.|$|R
5000|$|While popular {{accounts}} of Shays' Rebellion emphasize impoverished, debt-ridden farmers {{desperately trying to}} stave off foreclosures, the issues that animated the discussions and informed the petitions crafted within the tavern were much more sophisticated. Many issues led to Shays' Rebellion, but two stand out as tavern fare. With the Revolutionary War won, states began {{the process of writing}} and ratifying their own constitutions. The wealthy eastern interests in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts maneuvered adroitly to concentrate political power in their own hands while spreading the burden of taxation as regressively as they could among the common folk. The subsistence farmers of western counties comprehended, organized, and petitioned to champion concepts like “no taxation without representation” to throw off [...] "destructive and tyrannical government". States had paid for Revolutionary War soldiers with paper notes, which veterans soon learned were worth maybe a tenth of their face value. Speculators <b>bought</b> the <b>notes</b> for pennies from de-mobilized soldiers who had to buy nails and seed in the tough economic times following the war. The speculators then convinced their friends in new state governments, controlled by like-minded merchants and bankers, to redeem the full face value of the notes. How? By taking out government debt to be repaid, of course, by higher poll and property taxes on the same average farmers and artisans of the hill towns who sold the worthless paper to the speculators in the first place. [...] "Not only was the tax bite going to be heavy, then, it was biased against farm families with grown sons, and the chief beneficiaries were to be Boston speculators." [...] The speculators ultimately succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, but not without the patrons of Conkey’s Tavern understanding exactly {{what was going on and}} organizing to protest these get-rich-at-our-expense schemes. Had the patrons not proclaimed themselves “regulators” in pursuit of a more representative and equitable government and taken up arms to force the issue, the Constitutional Convention and George Washington in particular would not have been swayed by the speculators' public relations scare tactics. The draft constitution would not have been quickly re-written to bring in strong central government and a standing army. A loosely federated United States, half slave owning and half not, would have had a very different history.|$|R
