5|$|Hammond console organs {{come with}} a wooden pedalboard played with the feet, for bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the <b>bottom</b> <b>note</b> a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards {{going up to the}} G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E

2500|$|Often, a bass note {{other than}} the root is {{indicated}} after a forward slash, following or slightly under {{the rest of the}} chord notation--for example, [...] "GM7/B" [...] would indicate a G major seventh chord, with B, not G, as the bass or <b>bottom</b> <b>note.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Homophonic chordal {{sections}} {{are written}} using interval notation. [...] For instance, the notation [...] "quarter-note-C, 3rd, 5th" [...] would indicate playing a C {{along with the}} notes a 3rd and 5th higher than C, making a chord C-E-G a quarter note in length. Reading the interval notation is somewhat {{complicated by the fact}} that some staves use bottom-up notation (the <b>bottom</b> <b>note</b> of each chord is specified and intervals are read upwards from the given note) and some use top-down notation (the top note of each chord is specified and intervals are read downwards from the given note). The modern convention is to specify the main note (either the bass line or melody line) and let the intervals go up or down from there as appropriate. [...] For instance, in most piano music the left hand specifies the <b>bottom</b> <b>note</b> and intervals go bottom-up while the right hand specifies the top note and intervals go top-down. Many older scores have all staves reading bottom-up or all reading top-down. Most scores have a note indicating the direction of the interval notation. [...] However, in some older scores the direction must be established from the context. By convention, in-accords are given in the same direction as the interval notation. Thus, examining the in-accords is one way to establish whether the interval notation on a particular staff is bottom-up or top-down.|$|E
6000|$|London Edition, June 1887 If {{you will}} only take the {{following}} pages, {{as you do}} some long and gossippy letter written for you by a relative or friend travelling through distant scenes and incidents and jotting them down lazily and informally, but ever veraciously (with occasional diversion of critical thought about sombody or something,) it might remove all formal or literary impediments at once, and bring you and me closer together in the spirt in which the jottings were collated to be read. You have had, and have, plenty of public events and facts and general statistics of America;--in the following book is a common individual New World private life, its birth and growth, its struggles for a living, its goings and comings and observations (or representative portions of them) amid the United States of America the last thirty or forty years, with their varied war and peace, their local coloring, the unavoidable egotism, and the lights and shades and sights and joys and pains and sympathies common to humanity. Further introductory light {{may be found in}} the paragraph, [...] "A Happy Hour's Command," [...] and the <b>bottom</b> <b>note</b> belonging to it {{at the beginning of the}} book. I have said in the text that if I were required to give good reason-for-being of [...] "Specimen Days," [...] I should be unable to do so. Let me fondly hope that it has at least the reason and excuse of such off-hand gossippy letter as just alluded to, portraying American life-sights and incidents as they actually occurred--their presentation, making additions as far as it goes, to the simple experience and association of your soul, from a comrade soul;--and that also, in the volume, as below any page of mine, anywhere, ever remains, for seen or unseen basis-phrase, GOOD-WILL BETWEEN THE COMMON PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS.|$|E

However, such losses do not occur in 1 D for flat and non-flat bottoms, and so it is possible to construct a solution via a standard Picard scheme as in [13] for flat bottoms and [8] for non-flat bottoms.|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} the chanter, with its {{cylindrical}} bore and single reed, is extremely unaffected by crossfingering, and that the drone is tuned to the same note and octave as the <b>bottom</b> <b>note</b> of the chanter, {{makes it possible to}} play in a closed or semi-closed manner, enabling the player to quickly play the <b>bottom</b> <b>note</b> in between other notes—since this will blend with the sound of the drone, it gives the illusion of silence, and the possibility to play staccato.|$|E

Finally, recorders with a downward extension of a semitone are becoming available; such instruments can play a full three octaves in tune.|$|R

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the <b>bottom</b> <b>notes</b> are actually performed on a double bass.

50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} contemporary use of musical ciphering {{can be found}} in the popular online puzzle Cicada 3301. In the puzzle, the creators use dyads (two notes) to represent letters and numbers with word spacing based on prime numbers of beats. There are two notes, both in Ionian mode. The range of the top note is limited to a major 9th and there are 4 <b>bottom</b> <b>notes,</b> thus yielding 36 combinations, enough for 26 letters and 10 numbers. This makes for a naturally musical and melodic result while still permitting entire sentences to be encrypted.|$|R
