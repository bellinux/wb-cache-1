40|$|The {{parasitic}} protists in {{the genus}} Tritrichomonas cause significant disease in domestic cattle and cats. To assess the genetic diversity of feline and bovine isolates of Tritrichomonas foetus (Riedmüller, 1928) Wenrich and Emmerson, 1933, we used 10 different genetic regions, namely the protein coding genes of cysteine proteases 1, 2 and 4 - 9 (CP 1, 2, 4 - 9) {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of the disease caused by the parasite. The cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH 1) and internal transcribed spacer region 2 of the rDNA unit (ITS 2) were included as additional markers. The gene sequences were {{compared with those of}} Tritrichomonas suis (Davaine, 1875) Morgan and Hawkins, 1948 and Tritrichomonas mobilensis Culberson et al., 1986. The study revealed 100 % identity for all 10 genes among all feline isolates (=T. foetus cat genotype), 100 % identity among all bovine isolates (=T. foetus cattle genotype) and a genetic distinctness of 1 % between the cat and cattle genotypes of T. foetus. The cattle genotype of T. foetus was 100 % identical to T. suis at nine loci (CP 1, 2, 4 - 8, ITS 2, MDH 1). At CP 9, three out of four T. suis isolates were identical to the T. foetus cattle genotype, while the T. suis isolate SUI-H 3 B sequence contained a single unique nucleotide substitution. Tritrichomonas mobilensis was 0. 4 % and 0. 7 % distinct from the cat and cattle genotypes of T. foetus, respectively. The genetic differences resulted in amino acid changes in the CP genes, most pronouncedly in CP 2, potentially providing a platform for elucidation of genotype-specific host-pathogen interactions of T. foetus. On the basis of this data we judge T. suis and T. foetus to be subjective synonyms. For the first time, on objective nomenclatural grounds, the authority of T. suis is given to Davaine, 1875, rather than the commonly cited Gruby and Delafond, 1843. To maintain prevailing usage of T. foetus, we are suppressing the senior synomym T. suis Davaine, 1875 according to Article 23. 9, because it has never been used as a valid name after 1899 and T. foetus is widely discussed as the cause of <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis.</b> Thus bovine, feline and porcine isolates should all be given the name T. foetus. This promotes the stability of T. foetus for the veterinary and economically significant venereal parasite causing <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecently, Tritrichomonas foetus, {{the known}} {{etiologic}} agent of <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis</b> was identified in domestic cats {{in many countries}} around the world. In felids, this parasite would be a significant cause of large-bowel diarrhoea. Therefore {{the aim of the}} present study was to determine for the first time the prevalence of T. foetus infection in French catteries. In this epidemiological survey, rectal swabs from 140 cats participating in three international shows were tested for the presence of motile parasites by microscopy after culturing. The prevalence of T. foetus infection was 14. 3 % among cats (20 / 140) and 15. 9 % among catteries (18 / 117). These values were similar to those previously obtained in other European countries. Except for the age, no significant associations were found between the presence of T. foetus and various risk factors of infection such as the size of the cattery, the type of food, or the vicinity of a dog. Internal transcribed region of the ribosomal DNA unit was sequenced from the 20 T. foetus isolates identified in this study. They exhibited 100 % identity and are homologous with other sequences of strains isolated from domestic cats in other countries...|$|E
40|$|Recent reports {{identified}} Tritrichomonas fetus, the causative {{agent of}} <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis,</b> in cats with large-bowel diarrhea in the US. Between July 2007 and August 2008, {{a total of}} 105 Swiss cats were tested for T. fetus with the InPouchTM culture system and/or PCR, whereof 27 (26 %) yielded positive results. All positive cats were pedigree cats, whereof 22 (81 %) were less than 1 year of age (median 5 months). 25 (93 %) of these cats lived in multi-cat households, and all but one were kept indoor. The clinical picture was dominated by large bowel diarrhea with increased frequency of defecation and fresh blood and mucus. Furthermore, inflamed anus and fecal incontinence was common. 52 % of the T. fetus-positive cats were tested positive for Giardia before, but the treatment with fenbendazole or metronidazole only temporarily alleviated the clinical signs. The treatment with 30 mg/kg of ronidazole q 12 h p. o. was successful in all but 1 cat with only minor transient adverse effects in 3 cats. In conclusion, T. fetus has to be considered an important causative agent of large bowel diarrhea in cats in Switzerland, especially in young indoor pedigree cats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTritrichomonas mobilensis is an {{intestinal}} parasite of squirrel monkeys. There are few reports concerning the morphological {{aspects of this}} parasite. In addition, the taxonomic relationship between T. mobilensis and Tritrichomonas foetus, a serious pathogen that causes <b>bovine</b> and feline <b>trichomonosis,</b> has been questioned. For this reason, in the present study, we examined and compared both tritrichomonads {{with regard to their}} morphology, ultrastructure, endocytic activity and cytotoxicity when in the presence of host cells. Electron microscopy demonstrated consistent morphological differences between the hydrogenosomes of both parasites. Moreover, T. mobilensis and T. foetus had striking differences in their endocytic behavior. Thus, this work provides additional data that support the hypothesis that T. mobilensis is a distinct species from T. foetus...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis</b> {{caused by}} Tritrichomonas foetus is a {{significant}} reproductive disease of cattle. Preputial samples were collected using sheath washing technique in bulls in Namibia. Thirty-six trichomonad cultures were characterized using the TaqMan-probe commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic assay (VetMAX™-Gold Trich Detection Kit) and CYBR real-time PCR assay based on TFR 3 / 4 primers. Diagnostic real-time PCRs and DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed region confirmed presence of T. foetus in 35 out of 36 samples. Multilocus genotyping using cysteine proteases (CP 1, CP 2, CP 4, CP 5, CP 6, CP 7, CP 8, CP 9) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH 1) gene sequences demonstrate that the T. foetus in Namibia are genetically distinct from those characterized elsewhere. We report {{the discovery of a}} novel genotype of T. foetus in Namibian cattle, distinct from other T. foetus genotypes in Europe, South and North America and Australia. We suggest recognition of a 'Southern African' genotype of T. foetus. Identification of the new genotype of T. foetus demonstrates the need for wider global sampling to fully understand the diversity and origin of T. foetus causing disease in cattle or cats...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractTritrichomonas foetus {{is a very}} {{intriguing}} trichomonad protozoan {{with respect}} to its varied choice of residence in the different host species. It is an obligate parasite of the reproductive and the gastrointestinal tract of bovine and feline host respectively, leading to trichomonosis. <b>Bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis</b> is a sexually transmitted disease whereas feline trichomonosis is a disease with a purported fecal-oral route of spread. Further, the trichomonad is a commensal in the nasal passages, stomach, cecum and colon of swine host. Advances have been exponential in understanding the trichomonad biology and specifically feline trichomonosis since late 1990 s and early 2000 s when T. foetus was soundly determined to be a causative agent of chronic diarrhea in the domestic cat. It is a challenging task, even for a skilled investigator {{not to mention the}} busy clinical veterinarian, {{to keep up with the}} vast volume of information. Here we comprehensively reviewed the trichomonad biology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, host immunity, world map of distribution, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment. Risk factors associated with T. foetus-positive status in the domestic cat include young age, purebred, history of diarrhea, co-infections with other enteral pathogens. In addition, molecular similarity of bovine and feline isolates of T. foetus in DNA sequence was concisely discussed. The data presented serve as an information source for veterinarians, and investigators who are interested in biology of T. foetus and feline trichomonosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Tritrichomonas foetus is {{well known}} as an important causative agent of infertility and abortion in cattle (<b>bovine</b> <b>trichomonosis).</b> This World Organisation for Animal Health (O. I. E.) notifiable disease {{is thought to be}} under control in many countries including Switzerland. In recent studies, however, T. foetus has also been identified as an intestinal parasite that causes chronic large-bowel diarrhoea in cats. Since the feline isolates were considered indistinguishable from bovine isolates, the possibility and risk of parasite transmission from cats to cattle and vice versa has been intensively discussed in current literature. Therefore, we investigated if cat and cattle isolates are genetically distinct from each other or in fact represent identical genotypes. For this purpose, two independent genetic loci were selected {{that turned out to be}} well-suited for a PCR sequencing-based genotyping of trichomonad isolates: (i) previously published internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS- 2) and (ii) a semi-conserved sequence stretch of the elongation factor- 1 alpha (EF- 1 alpha) gene used for the first time in the present study. Respective comparative analyses revealed that both loci were sufficiently variable to allow unambiguous genetic discrimination between different trichomonad species. Comparison of both genetic loci confirmed that T. suis and T. mobilensis are phylogenetically very close to T. foetus. Moreover, these two genetic markers were suited to define host-specific genotypes of T. foetus. Both loci showed single base differences between cat and cattle isolates but showed full sequence identity within strains from either cat or cattle isolates. Furthermore, an additional PCR with a forward primer designed to specifically amplify the bovine sequence of EF- 1 alpha was able to discriminate bovine isolates of T. foetus from feline isolates and also from other trichomonads. The implications these minor genetic differences may have on the biological properties of the distinct isolates remain to be investigated...|$|E
