25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the <b>basic</b> <b>system</b> of vowel marking common to Brahmi and Kharosthī, in which every {{consonant}} is understood {{to be followed by}} a vowel, was well suited to Prakrit, but as Brahmi was adapted to other languages, a special notation called the virāma was introduced to indicate the omission of the final vowel. Kharoṣṭhī also differs in that the initial vowel representation has a single generic vowel symbol that is differentiated by diacritics, and long vowels are not distinguished.|$|E

25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>system.</b> Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a thyratron and a pentode, which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single thyratron, but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 cycles per second.|$|E
25|$|Ayutthaya's {{military}} was {{the origin of}} the Royal Thai Army. The army was organised into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger conscript-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the Phrai system (including phrai luang and phrai som), which required local chiefs to supply their predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population in times of war. This <b>basic</b> <b>system</b> of military organisation was largely unchanged down to the early Rattanakosin period.|$|E

During the normal exchange between two instances of FIDONET, any files attached to the messages in the packets were delivered after the packet itself had been up or downloaded. It is not clear when this was added, but it was already a feature of the <b>basic</b> <b>system</b> when the 8 February 1985 version of the FidoNet standards document was released, so this was added very early in Fido's history.|$|E

Fourth chapter is focused on the reliability of <b>basic</b> <b>systems</b> as, e. g., serial, prallel, circle and star, using Boolean algebra and Markov chains.

There are also numerous other differences such as the elimination of character classes and attacks of opportunity, a modified Skill list, a very different Feat selection, and the fact that any equipment possessed is considered a part of the character and purchased {{in a manner similar to}} powers.|$|E
25|$|The Mk. VIII {{spawned a}} number of variants, notably the AI Mk. IX which {{included}} a lock-on feature to ease interceptions. A series of events, including a deadly friendly fire incident, so greatly delayed the Mk. IX that it never entered service. During the late-war period, many UK aircraft adopted the US SCR-720 under the name AI Mk. X. This worked along the same general principles as the Mk. VIII, but used a different display system that offered several advantages. Development of the <b>basic</b> <b>system</b> continued, and the Mk. IX would eventually briefly re-appear in greatly advanced form as the AI.17 during the 1950s.|$|E

In order to protect the infant town against thieves and petty criminals after dark, Governor Arthur Phillip authorised the formation of a nightwatch in August 1789, consisting of eight of the best-behaved convicts. After his appointment as the new governor of New South Wales, Governor Lachlan Macquarie restructured the police force in January 1811, setting up a <b>basic</b> <b>system</b> of ranks and control and recruiting free men into the force instead of convicts.
