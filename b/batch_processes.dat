2500|$|The {{industrial}} production of soap involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition {{of fat and}} removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional <b>batch</b> <b>processes.</b> The three variations are the cold process, wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled process, wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|E

The use of gray models {{is a novel}} concept in <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> modeling and monitoring A gray model is a hybrid model, intermediate between hard (white) process models and soft (black) models, combining the advantages of both approaches.

For this purpose an industrial <b>batch</b> <b>process</b> is available that is spectroscopically monitored, and an explanation is provided {{as to how the}} spectroscopic measurements are combined with prior process knowledge.
