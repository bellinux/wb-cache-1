5|$|May 2006 {{was very}} <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> Konnan. In AAA, {{he made his}} first {{appearance}} with La Legión Extranjera (with Chessman & Ron Killings) on May 1, 2006, losing to El Zorro, Octagon & Vampiro Canadiense at AAA Sin Limite. He soon became the leader of the stable, which was active through 2009. That same month, Konnan became the TNA Impact! Spanish color commentator. Additionally, he and the LAX began a storyline that saw them refuse to wrestle (as well as himself and Moody Jack refuse to commentate), claiming that Latinos were discriminated against within TNA.|$|E
5|$|The NBC {{site also}} {{featured}} {{more than two}} minutes-worth of clips involving the subplot between Kevin and Lynne, including Andy discussing his new method of being mean to women while courting dates, {{in response to his}} recent failed engagement with Angela. Among the deleted scenes are Kevin telling Lynn he will be too <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> three weeks to talk to her and giving a backhanded compliment to her shirt, both at Andy's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|The {{powerful}} Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan {{was severely}} {{defeated by the}} Christian kings at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340. Marinid Morocco subsequently went into internal convulsions, too <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> active intervention in Spain, {{clearing the way for}} a renewed attempt by the Castilians on Algeciras and Gibraltar. Algeciras was taken with relative ease by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1344. Gibraltar, however, would not fall as easily. The Castilans subjected it to a fifth siege between 1349–50. It ended when Alfonso XI died from bubonic plague during the Black Death.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport was}} the <b>busiest</b> <b>for</b> {{passenger}} traffic in Asia in 2010, and the world's <b>busiest</b> airport <b>for</b> cargo traffic in 2010. In terms of international traffic, {{the airport is}} the third <b>busiest</b> <b>for</b> passenger traffic and the <b>busiest</b> <b>for</b> cargo since its operation in 1998. There are over 95 international airlines providing about 900 scheduled passenger and all-cargo flights each day between Hong Kong and some 160 destinations worldwide. About 76 percent of these flights are operated with wide-body jets. There is also an average of approximately 31 non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights each week.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials to the events of World War I, mainly as {{a result of}} the devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E
5|$|Business {{and family}} {{commitments}} kept Rush <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> {{the next few}} years. He moved his home up-river from Maclean to Grafton, the effective 'capital' of the Clarence River district. Rush purchased a hotel and an adjacent store, and a riverside villa which he named 'Clarence House'. Rush took {{an active part in}} a great many community and sporting organisations. He was a founder of the Grafton Rowing Club and was several times an office-holder of the Clarence River Jockey Club. He continued to promote and take part in local regattas. One of these was the Clarence River Aquatic Carnival, held on 10 March 1883. The Carnival attracted thousands of spectators. The main event was Rush vs Laycock for a stake of £1000 and the Championship of Australia, which Laycock won convincingly. At a banquet later that week, Rush announced his retirement from professional sculling, but in December of that year, he rowed Trickett on the Parramatta River for a stake of £400, and lost convincingly. The newspapers praised Rush for his valour, but hinted that it was high time he retired.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy and {{his wife}} moved north of Auckland {{to what is now}} known as Warkworth in early 1854, {{following}} his appointment as district surveyor for the Mahurangi Peninsula, which was being opened for settlement. For two years, Heaphy surveyed the plots of land that were to be sold to people moving to the area. In 1856 he became Auckland's provincial surveyor following the retirement of his predecessor. He moved back to Auckland and took up residence in Parnell. Surveying kept him <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> the next few years but in early 1859, he accompanied Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who had been invited by the government to make a report on a coalfield discovered south of Auckland. The two became friendly and Hochstetter was impressed with Heaphy's bush skills, although privately did not accord him much respect for his scientific knowledge. When Hochstetter left for Europe later in the year, he took with him many examples of Heaphy's artwork. The two later fell out, when Heaphy had an article published in a geological journal. Hochstetter felt usurped by someone he considered an inferior scholar and publicly questioned Heaphy's credentials. He also made allegations that Heaphy had plagiarised portions of his work on the coalfields. Heaphy mounted a spirited defence and generally had the sympathy of the public. The dispute did not stop Hochstetter from using Heaphy's artwork in a book he published on New Zealand's geology.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Malpensa Airport handled 19,320,546 {{passengers}} {{and was the}} 29th busiest airport in Europe in terms of passengers. Until 2008, Malpensa Airport was a major hub for flag carrier Alitalia. Malpensa Airport remains the second <b>busiest</b> Italian airport <b>for</b> international passenger traffic (after Rome Fiumicino Airport), and first <b>busiest</b> <b>for</b> freight and cargo. It handles over 500,000 tons of international freight annually.|$|R

25|$|Noten {{started the}} project with interviews, asking the taxi drivers {{how they felt}} about art, what they knew about MIMA and what they would like him, as an artist, to create for their cars. He {{received}} answers like 'I used to wear a ring for good luck', 'would like a girl on the hood', and 'I'm too <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> art'. These, sometimes puzzling, quotes were used on posters announcing the exhibition throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|When {{he arrived}} before Quebec on 26 June, Wolfe {{observed}} that the northern shore of the St. Lawrence River around Beauport (the Beauport shore), the most favourable site for the landing of troops, was strongly defended by the French, who had built entrenchments on high ground, redoubts and floating batteries. Wolfe consequently had to devise a plan involving a landing on some other location of the shore. The search for the best site kept him <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> weeks.|$|E
25|$|Many early RISC designs {{also shared}} the {{characteristic}} {{of having a}} branch delay slot. A branch delay slot is an instruction space immediately following a jump or branch. The instruction in this space is executed, {{whether or not the}} branch is taken (in other words the effect of the branch is delayed). This instruction keeps the ALU of the CPU <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> the extra time normally needed to perform a branch. Nowadays the branch delay slot is considered an unfortunate side effect of a particular strategy for implementing some RISC designs, and modern RISC designs generally do away with it (such as PowerPC and more recent versions of SPARC and MIPS).|$|E

25|$|Priscilla {{was always}} keen {{to go to}} Hollywood with Elvis, but he kept telling {{her that he was}} too <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> that and she was made to stay in Memphis. During the filming of Viva Las Vegas, Elvis began an affair with his co-star Ann-Margret. When Priscilla read of these reports in the press, she confronted Elvis. He told her that they were simply rumors to promote the film and that she should not believe {{everything}} that she read in the press. For the next few years, Elvis would have intimate relationships with many of his leading ladies and co-stars, all the while denying their existence to Priscilla. Eventually she was allowed to visit him in Hollywood, but her visits were kept short.|$|E
25|$|Another {{slow start}} would doom the Ducks. Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Jason Blake and Vesa Toskala after signing Hiller to a {{contract}} extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, {{as well as the}} acquisitions of defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes and goalie Curtis McElhinney from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries and picked up play {{in the second half of}} the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks failed to make the playoffs with a 39–32–11 record. The 2010 off-season was also <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks resigned Saku Koivu for two years and signed free agent defenseman Toni Lydman to a three-year contract. In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman Cam Fowler via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman Andy Sutton signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent Bobby Ryan was signed to a five-year deal.|$|E
25|$|With news on draft {{day that}} Scott Niedermayer signed a one-year {{contract}} extension and that Teemu Selanne intended to fulfill {{the last year of}} his contract, the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the Philadelphia Flyers, receiving Joffery Lupul back and defenseman Luca Sbisa, along with the Flyers' first-round pick that year and their first-round pick next year. On July 8, the Ducks signed former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu to {{a one-year contract}}. Another slow start doomed the Ducks.

500|$|In 1851, the New Zealand Company {{was still}} {{struggling}} financially and eventually transferred its {{land to the}} New Zealand Government. Brunner's employment with the company ceased and he, after writing a letter soliciting for surveying work, was appointed the Government Surveyor with an annual salary of ₤100 (2014 approximation ₤8,000). This was still a low salary for a professional and Brunner was allowed to continue with his architectural commissions, working from an office he had purchased in Nelson. He was kept <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> the next several years; in addition to carrying out and supervising survey work in the area, he took on responsibility for some public works. He drew up plans for roading, bridges and botanical gardens.|$|E
500|$|The next day, 28 November, was <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> 609 Squadron. Several scrambles and alerts {{came through}} against Bf 109s. The last came at {{approximately}} 15:30 Greenwich Mean Time. Dundas {{was once again}} piloting X4586. Two squadrons, 152 Squadron and 609 made contact with Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 2 ("fighter wing 2"), led by the most successful German ace of the war thus far — Helmut Wick. Minutes after contact had been made and the battle joined, Flight Lieutenant Fieldsend heard the familiar voice of Dundas shout [...] "I've finished a 109—Whoopee!". Squadron Leader Robinson congratulated Dundas but nothing was heard from Dundas, or his wingman Pilot Officer Paul A. Baillon, flying R6631.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of these expeditions the {{geographical}} and magnetic poles were both reached. [...] The achievement of being first to the geographical South Pole was a primary object in some expeditions, and was the sole rationale for Roald Amundsen's venture. However, {{this was not the}} only aspect of polar exploration during this time; other expeditions worked with defined objectives in different areas of the continent. As a result of all this activity, much of the continent's coastline was discovered and mapped, and significant areas of its interior were explored. The expeditions also generated large quantities of scientific data and specimens across a wide range of scientific disciplines, the examination and analysis of which would keep the world's scientific communities <b>busy</b> <b>for</b> decades.|$|E
