2500|$|Following this complaint, the FCC {{issued an}} order censuring Comcast from interfering with subscribers' use of {{peer-to-peer}} software—the FCC's second attempt {{to enforce its}} network neutrality policy with the first being the Madison River investigation. [...] The order began with the FCC stating it had jurisdiction over Comcast's network management practices under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 154). [...] Specifically, the Communications Act of 1934 granted the FCC the power to [...] "perform any and all acts, make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders, not inconsistent with , as may be necessary in the execution of its functions." [...] Next, the FCC ruled that Comcast impeded consumers' ability to access content and use applications of their choice. [...] Additionally, because other options were available for Comcast to manage their network policy without discriminating against peer-to-peer programs, the FCC found that Comcast's method of <b>bandwidth</b> <b>management</b> breached federal policy.|$|E

Researchers have developed and designed so many protocols for these networks, but due to the dynamic change in topology, decentralization, power <b>management,</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and many other factors like these no specific routing protocol is exclusively recommended, up to today, which comply and fulfill all the needs and requirements of users for ad hoc networks in all situations of network variation statuses and traffic overhead. This paper contributes an effort towards anthology of one of the major segment of routing protocols i. e. unicast, their categories and the main type of unicast routing protocols such as DSDV from proactive plus DSR from reactive. The protocols and their performances are evaluated on the basis of some metrics commonly used in support of simulation environment for getting simulation results acquired by simulation of certain model with some parameters with the help of NS- 2, OPNET and GloMoSim like simulators. The performance evaluations are declared on the basis of those simulations results, but all the results peter out when magnitudes of those attributes or load of network changes (increased or decreased) with respect to <b>bandwidth,</b> power <b>management,</b> end to end delay, data errors, packet dropping ratio or even with distance.

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} Deficit Round Robin Fair Queuing applied in router congestion control. Two parameters affect {{the performance of a}} DRR router: the number of flows and the buffer size. We study the influence of the two parameters on fairness. The results show that the optimal region can be achieved by means of one-dimensional optimization. Then, we investigate the impact of the packet size, <b>bandwidth,</b> and queuing <b>management</b> on a flow in a simple network by means of 2 k factorial design. Three factors are considered to analyze the performance of the delay and the packet arrival ratio for a flow: the packet size, bandwidth, and queue type. In the performance study on the packet arrival ratio, we find that the effects of the bandwidth and packet size are predominant. However, in the performance study on the delay, we find that the effect of the queue type is as great as that of the <b>bandwidth.</b> Active queuing <b>management,</b> such as DRR, which allocates bandwidth fairly, can also improve the delay performance of a flow...|$|R

40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{increasing}} demand of mobile and personal communications, two-tier cellular systems {{are likely to be}} deployed in major city center. Reservation schemes are consequently to be adapted to such a context : forced call terminations due to handoff call blocking are generally more objectionable than new call blocking. In order to maintain an acceptable call dropping probability rate, we propose, below, a new adaptive guard channel scheme : Hierarchical Predictive Reservation Policy (HPRP). In this scheme, the number of reserved channels depends on the actual number of calls in progress in the neighboring cells. In micro/macrocells systems, users are assigned to a given level of the hierarchy according to their speed. In this paper, three schemes are proposed and compared by discrete event simulations. The efficiency of the proposed methods is emphasized on a complex configuration.

40|$|Network Congestion {{occurs when}} the {{aggregate}} demand for bandwidth exceeds the available capacity of a link and when the arrival rate to the router is greater than its departure. To solve this problem, {{it is necessary that}} the router must implement effective queuing algorithm that governs how packets are buffered while waiting to be transmitted. According to the dynamic of input packets and available link <b>bandwidth,</b> queue <b>management</b> becomes very complex. For this reason it is better to use an intelligent algorithm. In this paper, a Fuzzy Inference System implementation for Drop Tail, Adaptive Drop Tail-Fuzzy Logic (ADT-FL) is proposed which regulates the queue size of the router buffers based on prevailing traffic conditions and available link bandwidth preventing the router buffers from becoming full when congestion occurs. Simulation results are provided to show that ADT-FL has better performance and lower loss rate than the conventional queuing algorithms used in current internet buffers.
