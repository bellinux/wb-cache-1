25|$|In {{the first}} {{extraction}} of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, {{which is similar}} to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into <b>barium</b> <b>carbonate</b> carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by fractional crystallisation while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.|$|E

2500|$|Urea {{was first}} noticed by Hermann Boerhaave {{in the early}} 18th century from evaporates of urine. In 1773, Hilaire Rouelle {{obtained}} crystals containing urea from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive filtrations. This method was aided by Carl Wilhelm Scheele's discovery that urine treated by concentrated nitric acid precipitated crystals. Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin discovered in 1799 that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented the term [...] "urea." [...] Berzelius made further improvements to its purification and finally William Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and determining the chemical composition of the pure substance. In the evolved procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved in warm water, and <b>barium</b> <b>carbonate</b> added. The water is then evaporated and anhydrous alcohol added to extract the urea. This solution is drained off and evaporated, leaving pure urea.|$|E

The maximum magnetic field B is about 0.35 tesla and the magnetic field strength H is about 30 to 160 kiloampere turns per meter (400 to 2000 oersteds).

50|$|The {{chemical}} radium bromide is {{not found}} in nature; it is created. To extract radium from uranium or pitchblende ores, the most common practice is called the Curie method which it involves two major stages. The first stage is a chemical treatment to concentrate the radium as a combination of radium and barium. This is done by treating the ore with a barium salt and sulfuric acid which help the uranium, iron, copper, and other components become soluble. A residue containing gangue, barium, radium, and lead sulfates will be left over. The mixture will then be treated with sodium chloride to remove lead and convert radium and <b>barium</b> into <b>carbonates</b> that are insoluble in hydrochloric acid. The second step requires fractional crystallization to separate the barium from the radium. Because {{of the differences in}} solubility between radium and barium in bromide or chlorine, those two chemicals are chosen for the fractional crystallization. Once the radium is separated, radium bromide can be formed by dehydrating the dihydrate with a dry air stream at 200°C. Another method is to heat radium chloride to red heat with a dry hydrogen bromine gas stream.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to categorize all geological and geochemical parameters applicable to the Loch Loyal syenites and to relate these both to processes operating there and to the broader problems of alkaline rock genesis. Whole rock and trace element contents have been determined for the Loyal syenites and compared with other alkaline intrusions in Scotland and both pegmatite chemistry and mineralogy have been detailed. Loch Loyal syenites consist of three separate bodies, Ben Loyal, Beinn Stumanadh, and Cnoc nan Cuilean each intrusive into grey flaggy psammitic Moinian granulites. They are best described as quartz-nordmarkites. Emplacement of the magma resulted in the formation of a feldspar flow lamination in the outer parts of the Loyal mass and to deformation of the surrounding country rocks. Core rocks crystallized as a one-feldspar type and outer laminated syenites as a two-feldspar assemblage. A pegmatitic phase was succeeded by low-temperature hydrothermal mineralisation and considerable deuteric activity in which strontium and <b>barium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> hematite and rare-earth elements were deposited either in veins or druses and, at a temperature close to 25000, a type of lead metasomatism formed green amazonitic feldspar. The intermediate nature of the Loyal nordmarkite has been established, it straddles the sodaclase-granite/nordmarkite division of Johannsen, is close to sphene-orthite type granitoids but contains a mineral with monazite structure, and the tantalo-niobate mineral polycrase occurs within the pegmatites contrary to a suggestion byPavlenko et. ale that such minoralo arc absent from sphene-orthite typo granitoids. Tho other alkaline intrusions in Sutherland, Loch Ailsh and Loch Borralan, were found to differ in trace-element chemistry from each other and from the Loch Loyal syenites. Even so a general alkaline petrographic province is postulated for the N. W. Highlands which persisted from early Caledonian times and included the metamorphosed syenite of Glen Dessarry, part of the Glenelg-Ratagain complex and scattered areas of soda-metasomatism. Compared with other rocks of the Scottish "Newer Igneous" suite Loyal syenites are markedly enriched in Pb,Ba,Nb, and the rare-earth elements and very greatly dbficient in calcium. Anomalous radioactivity associated with the Loyal intrusions is due chiefly to the thorium content of allanite. Within the pegmatites of Sgor Chaonasaid at the northern extremity of the Loyal range a zonation between galena and silicate minerals exists in which silver and copper form complex sulphides such as stromoyerite. The origin of the Loyal syenites is not thought to be connected with tho hypothesis of limestone assimilation for alkaline rock genesis as envisaged by Daly and Shand nor to tho specialised stable tectonic conditions considered important by Harker, but to anatexis at depth and subsequent extreme differentiation, connected with faulting, which resulted in an increased sodium content and a 'reworking' of surrounding sediments and/or granitic rocks, with consequent enhancement of U,Th,Nb,RE's,Ba and Sr over that usual for granitic rocks...|$|R
