5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of cations to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E
5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with <b>blunt</b> <b>ends,</b> and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E

There is no data {{about the effectiveness of}} <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> with side hole irrigation needle to eliminate root canal bacteria in vivo, therefore the research about effectivity of this needle compare to conventional irrigation needle was permormed. In this study 12 samples were used and divided into two groups.

The bacteriological sampling and colony counting was conducted. The paired t-test analysis before and after irrigation showed significant difference on the first and second group.

40|$|Abstract: While the avian egg {{is formed}} in the oviduct, it acquires its shell {{membranes}} and shape in the isthmus and the calcified shell in the shell gland/uterus. However, in domestic species not all eggs are laid pointed end first, {{which led to the}} suggestion that egg rotation can occur in the oviduct prior to laying producing the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> first. However, not all studies were in agreement as to which end the pointed or the blunt-comes out first. Here, opportunistic observation of laying behaviour in domestic geese and ducks was carried out. 89. 47 % of the single yolked (SY) goose eggs were laid pointed end first. Goose age and dimensions did not influence the orientation of the egg, though the 12 <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> first eggs were heavier and wider. 85. 52 % of the SY duck eggs were laid pointed end first. However, in double yolked (DY) duck eggs evidence was presented showing that the yolks closer to the airspace (<b>blunt</b> <b>end)</b> tend to be heavier (Salamon and Kent, 2013 a) and had higher levels of fertilization (Salamon and Kent, in press) consistent with the yolk at the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of the egg being ovulated first and suggests that the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of these large eggs was caudal in the oviduct during egg formation.

5000|$|A sticky or {{cohesive}} end has protruding single-stranded strands with unpaired nucleotides called overhangs, each overhang can anneal with another complementary one to form base pairs.

DNA ligase can join two adjacent strands of DNA by forming a covalent bond between the sugar-phosphate moieties of adjacent nucleotides to join the two together via a phosphodiester bond in a process called ligation. The <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> however do not have such protruding strands, and therefore cannot anneal together, and consequently ligation between <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> is less efficient.|$|E
