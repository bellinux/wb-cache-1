25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com, {{the song}} contains familiar qualities of Songz's breakout hit [...] "Can't Help But Wait", also produced by Stargate.

500|$|... "1+1" [...] {{begins with}} a low {{fidelity}} indie rock arrangement which is brought about by distorted guitar arpeggios and a discreet pipe organ. Beyoncé sings a meandering melody as she alternately references the pleasures of love and sex. Using simple arithmetic to describe her undying love for her partner, she begins the first verse as she affirms to her romantic interest {{that the only thing}} she is sure about is her feelings for him, [...] "I don't know much about algebra, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one plus one equals two ... If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn / 'Cause I got it with you". In the pre-chorus lines, Beyoncé expresses her reliance on her man without whom she believes to be incomplete as she sings, [...] "And it's me and you, that's all we'll have when the world is through / Because baby we ain't got nothing without love / Darling, you got enough love for the both of us".|$|E

2500|$|On March 16, 2007, Valerie Wilson {{told the}} House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: [...] "But I {{do know the}} Agency did a damage assessment.

2500|$|Heading {{into the}} 2010 season, Jones was not {{mentioned}} {{among the top}} contenders on the Roughriders to replace departing defensive linemen John Chick and Stevie Baggs, which suited him fine, [...] "I’m always the undersized guy at my position. There are things that I {{have to do to}} remain a Roughrider <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I’m in a fight. Then again, I’m always fighting." [...] Jones also sees significant playing time on special teams, where he is considered by some to be among the CFL's best.|$|E
2500|$|After {{pleading}} {{not guilty}} to state charges of first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree armed robbery, felonious larceny, and felonious possession of stolen goods, Lovette remained in custody awaiting his trial, which began on December 6, 2011. Lovette declined to testify during the trial. On December 20, 2011, a jury found Lovette guilty on all charges. After the verdict, Judge Allen Baddour, the same judge who sentenced Atwater in 2010, stated, [...] "The life that Ms. Carson led was too short, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she {{continues to be an}} inspiration, not only for her family, but for thousands in this community and across this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with music website Hollywood Unlocked, {{when asked about the}} initial direction for her music, Cardi B said, [...] "When I first started rapping [...] I liked certain songs from Khia and Trina, and they [...] fighting songs. I haven't heard fighting songs for a very long time," [...] crediting the two female rappers for her aggressive rap style. She continued saying [...] "a lot of girls they can not afford red bottoms, a lot of girls they can not afford foreign cars [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> every girl has beef with a girl [...] I know that every bitch don't like some bitch, and it's like 'that's what I wanna rap about.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Descendents' 1981 Fat EP had {{established}} the band's {{presence in the}} southern California hardcore punk movement with its short, fast, aggressive songs. While still short and fast, the songs the band wrote for their first full-length album were also melodic, described by singer Milo Aukerman as melodic hardcore. [...] "I think with those songs we were expanding beyond the kind of fast-fast-fast-fast thing", he later recalled. [...] "There {{are some of the}} similar coffee-driven songs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> melodically there was actually an attempt at singing and making more pop-flavored music. Obviously we all really loved that, growing up with The Beatles and stuff." [...] Drummer Bill Stevenson reflected that [...] "By the time we recorded Milo Goes to College the pendulum swung somewhere maybe in the middle. There's a lot of melodic and pop elements to it, but it also has that [...] bitter resentment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jennifer Hudson {{performed}} {{the song in}} front of Houston in 2010. On February 12, 2012, Hudson {{performed the}} song as a tribute during the 54th Grammy Awards, the day after Houston's death, alongside images of musicians {{who had died in}} 2011 and 2012, including Amy Winehouse and Etta James. The song was played at Houston's funeral as her casket was brought out of the church. Parton complimented Hudson on her performance, saying,I was brought to tears again last night, as I'm sure many were, when Jennifer Hudson sang [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] on the Grammys in memory of Whitney. Like everybody else, I am still in shock. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Whitney will live forever in all the great music that she left behind. I will always have a very special piece of her in the song we shared together and {{had the good fortune to}} share with the world. Rest in peace, Whitney. Again, we will always love you.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sims spoke {{little of}} his disappointments. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he {{thought much about}} them. They set him wondering. There were changes here that to the {{thoughtful}} mind called for investigation.|$|R

2500|$|Then in August 2010, Moroccan {{producer}} RedOne {{confirmed his}} involvement in the project during an interview with BBC Music, where he confirmed that the it was the third time that new material had been recorded for the album. When asked why he thought the album didn't previously come out RedOne said [...] "Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonald's, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent." [...] He confirmed that he had produced the majority of the new album. Scherzinger followed up his comments in an interview with X magazine in September 2010. She said [...] "It was actually my decision not to put Her Name Is Nicole out, not the label's". Scherzinger then said how much of an honor it was to work with RedOne. [...] "He's an unbelievable producer and musician. He had made some amazing songs with Lady Gaga. Now, there is someone with the 'x factor'. I can't touch GaGa or RedOne in that space, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we've created something unique of our own." [...] RedOne revealed that Jimmy Iovine (chairman of Scherzinger's record label) personally called him to work on Scherzinger's album.|$|E
