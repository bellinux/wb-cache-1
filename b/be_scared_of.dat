500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even sure what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E

He was recorded saying: [...] "Don't <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> them, do not <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> the police or the cameras. You are here only to please Allah.

2500|$|Iofan's {{original}} {{draft was}} crowned {{with a relatively}} small statue of [...] "The Free Proletarian". In August 1932, as is clear from Stalin's memo, this statue disappeared from his draft, and Stalin personally intervened to correct the omission. A taller tower and Lenin's statue appeared after the fourth contest, in response to Stalin's public speech: [...] "The Palace of the Soviets is a monument to Lenin. Don't <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> height; go for it." [...] In the process, the total height increased from [...] to [...] The Main Hall with a capacity of 21,000 seats was [...] high and [...] in diameter (the Little Hall in the Eastern Wing was 6,000 seats). This project was {{released to the public}} in March 1934. The Lithuanian-American artist William Zorach [...] "let out a cry of protest, charging that the Soviets had stolen an idea submitted by him for a Lenin memorial in Leningrad" [...] in vain. The statue structure was designed later; a [...] 1936 version weighed in excess of [...] In 1937, Frank Lloyd Wright, addressing the Congress of Soviet Architects, remarked [...] "This structure— only proposed I hope— is good if we take it for a modern version of Saint George destroying the dragon." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Lewis was famously arrested outside Elvis Presley's Graceland {{home for}} {{allegedly}} intending to shoot him. [...] Lewis had already nearly killed his bass player, Butch Owens, on September 29 (Lewis's 41st birthday) when a [...]357 accidentally {{went off in}} his hand. In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Lewis explains that the reclusive Presley {{had been trying to}} reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to [...] "come out to the house." [...] Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in Tunica, for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. [...] "Charles Feron, he owned Vapors, he give it to me," [...] Lewis explained to Bragg. [...] "A [...]38 derringer. Me, pretty well drunk, with that derringer – it ain't somethin' 'strange'." [...] Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because [...] "the nose of that Lincoln was a mile long." [...] Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through the car window, not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but [...] "Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening 'the', away in handcuffs." [...] Lewis said, [...] "The cops asked Elvis, 'What {{do you want us to}} do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." [...] Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. [...] Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mug shot was wired around the world. Presley died of a heart attack at Graceland eight months later.|$|E

You're whiter 'n a sheet. You can't <b>be</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> the rustler. I don't believe you've got a scare in you. Wal, now, jest let me talk. You know I like to talk, an' if I'm slow I allus git there sometime. As I said, Lassiter was talkie' chummy with Oldrin'. There wasn't no hard feelin's. An' the gang wasn't payin' no pertic'lar attention. But {{like a cat}} watchin' a mouse I hed my eyes on them two fellers. It was strange to me, thet confab. I'm gittin' to think a lot, fer a feller who doesn't know much. There's been some queer deals lately an' this seemed to me the queerest. These men stood to the bar alone, an' so close their big gun-hilts butted together. I seen Oldrin' was some {{surprised}} at first, an' Lassiter was cool as ice. They talked, an' presently at somethin' Lassiter said the rustler bawled out a curse, an' then he jest fell up against the bar, an' sagged there. The gang in the saloon looked around an' laughed, an' thet's about all. Finally Oldrin' turned, and {{it was easy to}} see somethin' hed shook him. Yes, sir, thet big rustler--you know he's as broad as he is long, an' the powerfulest build of a man--yes, sir, the nerve had been taken out of him. Then, after a little, he began to talk an' said a lot to Lassiter, an' by an' by it didn't take much of an eye to see thet Lassiter was gittin' hit hard. I never seen him anyway but cooler 'n ice--till then. He seemed to be hit harder 'n Oldrin', only he didn't roar out thet way. He jest kind of sunk in, an' looked an' looked, an' he didn't see a livin' soul in thet saloon. Then he sort of come to, an' shakin' hands--mind you, shakin' hands with Oldrin'--he went out. I couldn't help thinkin' how easy even a boy could hev dropped the great gun-man then!... Wal, the rustler stood at the bar fer a long time, en' he was seein' things far off, too; then he come to an' roared fer whisky, an' gulped a drink thet was big enough to drown me." ...|$|E
