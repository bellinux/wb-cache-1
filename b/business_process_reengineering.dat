40|$|Abstract—There is an {{abundance}} of <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modeling techniques that capture and address different aspects of a <b>business</b> <b>process.</b> A limited number of these process models allow further quantitative analysis, {{and only a few}} enable structured process im-provement. This paper reviews and classifies the main techniques for <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modeling with regard to their analysis and op-timization capabilities. Three primary groups are identified, and a selection of representative <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modeling techniques is classified based on these. Similar classification is also presented for the analysis and optimization approaches for <b>business</b> <b>processes</b> that were identified in relevant literature. The main contribution of the paper is that it identifies which types of <b>business</b> <b>process</b> mod-els are suitable for analysis and optimization, and also highlights the lack of such approaches. This paper offers a state-of-the-art review in the areas of <b>business</b> <b>process</b> modeling, analysis, and optimization—underlining that the latter two have not received enough coverage and support in the literature.

In each industrialized country, {{the public}} {{administration}} (PA) has significantly shifted its interests {{to reach the}} innovative Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), undergoing important <b>Business</b> <b>Processes</b> <b>Reengineering</b> (BPR) {{as a result of}} e-Government projects. The new challenge for public administrations is based on the exploitation of their knowledge resources in order to improve their processes and to offer more effective and efficient services to the users. Knowledge has to be managed as a valuable asset and a key resource. For this reason an organizational transformation is indispensable, and it cannot be just based on the management of data and information, which is what public administrations actually do. The aim of this contribution is to investigate the spreading of cooperating strategies in public administrations in order to better understand why and how these organizational behaviors could assure advantages for PA and citizens. ...|$|R

40|$|A major {{component}} of any business reengineering effort is the identification of <b>business</b> <b>processes,</b> {{and the development of}} software to support these processes. The development of the software is itself a process, commonly called the software process. One reason for reengineering a business is to decentralize its mode of operation, or to make a decentralized mode more effective. We contend that a properly defined general software process model is essential for the development of support software for a reengineered decentralized enterprise. We have developed a sixteen-step plan for business reengineering, and an enterprise model composed of eight submodels. In this paper we bring together the enterprise model, relevant steps of the business reengineering plan, and the Capability Maturity Model of the Software Engineering Institute to define a software <b>process</b> model for <b>business</b> <b>reengineering.</b> Keywords <b>Business</b> <b>process,</b> <b>business</b> <b>reengineering,</b> capability maturity model, enterprise model [...] ...|$|R
