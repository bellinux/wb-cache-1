5000|$|In most {{situations}} {{the operation}} involves both breasts and thus represents a <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedure.</b> When cancer has affected already one breast, the other breast, still healthy, may be removed in a unilateral preventive mastectomy. Typically either a simple, a subcuteaneous or a nipple-sparing mastectomy is performed. With the former the areola and nipple are removed, {{while the other}} two approaches preserve the nipple area for cosmetic reasons. To increase {{the viability of the}} nipple area for preservation during mastectomy, a so-called [...] "nipple delay" [...] procedure can be done several weeks before the mastectomy. Reconstructive breast surgery can be performed in the same surgical setting, added after the mastectomy.

40|$|Abstract: Bilateral total knee {{arthroplasty}} can {{be performed}} either as a staged or simultaneous procedure. We conducted a retrospective comparative study to compare the need for transfusion, the length of procedure, the length of stay, and complications of bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasty with those of unilateral knee arthroplasty. Sixty-nine patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasty procedures were compared with a matched control group of 69 patients who underwent unilateral knee arthroplasty. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve {{was used to determine}} optimum cut-off values. Both groups of patients had a similar age and gender distribution, preoperative haemoglobin and ASA scores. Cumulative transfusion episodes were lower in the bilateral group than twice that of the unilateral group. In multivariate analysis the preoperative haemoglobin level and <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> were independent factors predicting the need for transfusion. The average length of procedure and length of hospital stay in the bilateral group was less than twice than that of the unilateral group. Advanced age and <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> were independent predictors of prolonged length of stay. A haemoglobin level of 12. 5 g/dL and age of 70 were most suitable cut-off points to predict need for transfusion and occurrence of medical complications respectively. We conclude that bilateral simultaneous knee arthroplasties are safe and cost effective in appropriately selected patients. We recommend avoiding <b>bilateral</b> simultaneous <b>procedures</b> in patients over the age of 70 years and with significant comorbidities...|$|R

Thirty-six hips were fixed on a fracture table and 113 on a radiolucent table. Eighty-nine percent (134) of hips had slips that were classified as stable, whereas 10 % (15) were unstable.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sacral {{insufficiency}} fractures are an infrequent {{but often}} disabling cause of severe low back pain. We report our {{results of a}} sacroplasty technique, using CT for needle placement and fluoroscopy to monitor the polymethylmethacrylate injection in a group of patients with sacral insufficiency fractures. METHODS: All patients had a history of chronic back pain and had an osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fracture documented by imaging before the procedure. With the patient under conscious sedation, a bone biopsy needle was placed under CT guidance; the patient was then transferred to the fluoroscopy suite, where a polymethylmethacrylate mixture was injected into the sacrum under real-time fluoros-copy. Clinical outcome was assessed by telephone. RESULTS: The procedure was performed on 13 female patients with an average age of 76 years (range, 60 – 88 years). A <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed in 11 patients and a unilateral procedure was performed in 2 patients. An average of 4. 1 mL of cement was injected for each treatment.

30|$|A {{total of}} 9 {{patients}} who fulfilled the inclusion criteria {{were enrolled in}} the study, and a total 10 ridge augmentations were performed using the subperiosteal tunneling technique with an alloplastic in situ hardening bone graft substitute. One patient underwent a <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedure.</b> There were 5 males and 4 females, in an age range between 49 and 78  years (median age 55  years). Wound healing was assessed qualitatively in terms of postoperative pain, swelling, hematoma formation, incidence of wound dehiscence, and graft loss. The surgical sites healed uneventfully, without any intra-operative or postoperative complications in any of the patients. All patients who received bone augmentation eventually had dental implants placed in the grafted areas.|$|E
30|$|The {{issue of}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> is {{controversial}} since {{the presence of}} two procedures in one patient violates the assumption of independent observations on which many statistical tests rely [60]. However, other authors have discussed this and found that inclusion of <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> did not alter the results [61, 62]. In a recent study from the Finnish Arthroplasty Register, 27 % of the cases analyzed were bilateral cases, and inclusion of bilateral cases in the analysis was considered appropriate, even though the statistical technique (Cox regression) formally requires independent observations. In out study, 21 % of the cases were bilateral. We did find statistically significant differences in preoperative BMI, {{which raises the question}} of whether other unknown confounders might influence the results. However, the issue of bilaterality was not addressed in the study protocol. The presence of an arthroplasty in the contralateral hip was not an exclusion criterion for the study, nor was there any criterion excluding patients with poor function of the contralateral hip. For these reasons, we find it justified to include the patients who had two arthroplasties during the study and treat them as independent cases.|$|R

MethodsData were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing EVLA for varicose veins in our unit including clinical outcomes (CEAP classification) and post-operative duplex. Results 624 EVLA procedures were performed from April 2004 to February 2009. There were 527 LSV EVLA cases, 449 of which were for the above-knee segment only. There were 94 SSV EVLA cases and 3 patients needed LSV EVLA on the same leg at the same time. 84 % were done under general anesthetic including 126 patients who underwent <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedures</b> at the same session.

30|$|Unless contraindicated, a {{trial of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medication or oral contraceptives would be a reasonable initial treatment of this condition [9]. Otherwise hysteroscopic drainage of the cornual haematometra should ensue. This is a difficult procedure because intrauterine adhesions {{make it difficult to}} approach the cornual area without the danger of perforation [9]. If this fails or if the condition recurs, release of the haematosalpinx can be achieved by laparoscopic diathermy to the tubal stump, as in our case. Unilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy has also been recommended as a treatment alternative since the cyclical pain in these cases is likely to be due to tubal distention. However, a <b>bilateral</b> <b>procedure</b> may be more appropriate, since recurrence in the remaining tube has also been described [10]. A definitive treatment would be a hysterectomy. Histological confirmation of post-ablation-tubal sterilisation syndrome requires assessment of the cornual tissue and proximal tube [13].|$|E
