5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try to manipulate the system {{in order to stop}} <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> from happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E

Hui was chosen for the part {{because he is the}} ideal actor to play a character who persuades others to do <b>bad</b> <b>things.</b> The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E
5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all <b>bad</b> <b>things.</b> And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E

Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} by the superstitious that <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> happen on that score, {{although}} {{an investigation by}} the magazine The Cricketer in the 1990s found that wickets are no more likely to fall on Nelson and indeed, the score at which most wickets fall is 0 (a duck). It may be considered unlucky because the number resembles a wicket without bails (a batsman is out if the bails are knocked off their wicket).|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} during a therapy session Lars von Trier attended during treatments for his depression. A therapist had told von Trier that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> to happen. Von Trier then developed the story not primarily as a disaster film, and without any ambition to portray astrophysics realistically, but {{as a way to}} examine the human psyche during a disaster.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why do <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> happen to good people?. Christianity teach {{that all people}} are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E

5000|$|David and Marjorie Haight took a {{very similar}} tack with Anselm's proof attempt as did Gaunilo. However, whereas Gaunilo changed the target noun of Anselm's proof, [...] "God", to an {{alternate}} noun that he felt was more obviously absurd, a [...] "Lost Island", the Haights inverted the adjective in Anselm's reasoning. Where Anselm used the word [...] "greater" [...] to define god into existence, the Haights {{point out that the}} logic can be inverted by replacing [...] "greater" [...] with [...] "worse". The statement then follows to a conclusion that the very most <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> has to be an existent <b>bad</b> <b>thing,</b> because it would be worse for this <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> to exist than to not exist, therefore it must exist in its absolute badness. Therefore, the Devil must also exist, so long as Anselm's proof is held as consequential.|$|R
