For this reason, the brominated hydrocarbons {{can be used to}} monitor the polarity of the medium in which they are buried. By determining the coordination of the bromine atom, information on the interactions between the probe molecule and several systems such as micelles, macromolecules, membranes, solvent molecules, and host molecules in inclusion compounds can be obtained. Brominated hydrocarbons in aqueous micellar solutions of sodium and rubidium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate have been investigated by means of the XAS technique. Experimental and calculated EXAFS spectra and Fourier transform functions are presented. The results are supported by the XANES experimental spectra. As already found for 2 -bromopropane, the polarity of the solubilization loci of <b>bromoethane</b> in sodium and rubidium deoxycholate micellar solutions decreases by increasing the solute concentration. On the contrary, in micellar solutions of sodium dodecyl sulfate, these molecules are embedded in a more apolar environment. The polarity of the spectra of 2 -bromopropane changes with the probe concentration, while <b>bromoethane</b> presents a marked apolar coordination which seems to be independent from the probehost ratio. The bromine intermolecular coordination in 1 -bromobutane {{has been found to be}} apolar in both classes of surfactants. Functionalized surfactants with -ene, -yne, or bromo as the terminal group of the alkyl chain were used by different researchers to investigate micellar structures. In fact, for a micellar aggregate with a hydrocarbon core and an outer region containing the polar heads, the chain terminal group may be buried in the micelle core or placed in the head group region of the micelle, in contact with water. In the latter case, the alkyl chain flexibility may give rise to a chain folded conformation which increases the probability of finding the terminal group at the micelle-water interface. EXAFS data analysis of aqueous micellar solutions of sodium and rubidium 12 -bromo dodecyl sulfate and sodium 1 I-bromoundecanoate at the Br K-edge has been accomplished.

An accurate {{analysis of}} the intramolecular contribution to the absorption spectra allows the possibility of identifying the intermolecular contacts related to the systems in which these molecules are solubilized to be evaluated. We present a very accurate X-ray absorption spectroscopy investigation of several brominated hydrocarbons (<b>bromoethane,</b> 2 -bromopropane, 2 -bromo- 2 -methylpropane, and bromobenzene), taking into account the three-body multiple-scattering contributions which are found to give a detectable signal to the X-ray absorption cross-section.

40|$|The {{response}} of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction to trimethylamine, choline, and glycine betaine was examined in surface sediments from the intertidal region of Lowes Cove, Maine. Addition of these substrates markedly stimulated methanogenesis {{in the presence}} of active sulfate reduction, whereas addition of other substrates, including glucose, acetate, and glycine, had no effect on methane production. Sulfate reduction was stimulated simultaneously with methanogenesis by the various quaternary amines and all other substrates examined. Incubation of exogenous trimethylamine, choline, or glycine betaine with either <b>bromoethane</b> sulfonic acid or sodium molybdate was used to establish pathways of degradation of the substrates. Methanogenesis dominated the metabolism of trimethylamine, although limited nonmethanogenic activity, perhaps by sulfate-reducing bacteria, was observed. Acetate was oxidized primarily by sulfate reducers. Both choline and glycine betaine were fermented stoichiometrically to acetate and trimethylamine; apparently, neither substrate could be utilized directly by methanogens or sulfate reducers, and the activities of fermenters, methanogens, and sulfate reducers were all required to effect complete mineralization. These observations support the hypothesis that the presence of quaternary amines can mediate the coexistence of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marine surface sediments; they also implicate methanogens in the nitrogen cycle of marine sediments containing quaternary amines...|$|E

In contrast, ethanethiol and propanethiol were not degraded by the samples investigated under {{any of the}} conditions tested. Methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, and dimethyldisulfide were mainly degraded by methanogenic archaea. In the presence of sulfate and the methanogenic inhibitor <b>bromoethane</b> sulfonate, degradation of these compounds coupled to sulfate reduction occurred as well, but at much lower rates. Besides their biodegradability, also the toxicity of methanethiol, ethanethiol, and propanethiol to methanogenesis with methanol, acetate, and H 2 /CO 2 as the substrates was assessed. The 50 % inhibition concentration of methanethiol on the methane production from these substrates ranged between 7 and 10 mM. The 50 % inhibition concentration values of ethanethiol and propanethiol for the degradation of methanol and acetate were between 6 and 8 mM, whereas hydrogen consumers were less affected by ethanethiol and propanethiol, as indicated by their higher 50 % inhibition concentration (14 mM).
