40|$|Extensive {{research}} suggests that political factors bias the domestic allocation of the European Structural and Investment Funds (SIF) in ways {{that may not be}} in line with EU goals. This article offers the first systematic and comparative analysis of the role of electoral institutions in shaping county-level allocations of SIF. Drawing on theories of distributive politics and federalism, this article argues that electoral institutions provide politicians in the executive branch of national government with incentives to use at least a part of the SIF to buy votes in NUTS 3 -level counties, whereby vote-buying is more common under majority voting than under proportional representation. The results of a statistical analysis of SIF allocations across 202 Italian and French NUTS 3 -level counties during 2007 – 13 confirm this argument. The article concludes by discussing the findings and their implications for future research on EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>implementation</b> and cohesion policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{contention}} {{of this paper}} is to highlight the difficulties in implementation of priority-based-budgeting in a mono-cultural economies of the third world countries. To device a means by which the budgetary system could be applied meaningfully and advantageously, linking the conventional/traditional methodology to the neo-supra system. To highlight outstanding advantages of priority-based-budgeting, when cautiously applied and strictly adhered by its norms. It is a neolithic advent of budgeting implementation.

Data procurement has been a stumbling block due to unfamiliarity of the system to the public sector as well as private segment of the economy. A structured questionnaire was adopted to harness the concept of priority-based-budgeting as a focus to the respondents. Online discussions were carried out on a lesser scale particularly with the closely affiliated individuals in some subsections of the government and organizations as a whole. Many key-stakeholders in private institutions were highly fascinated with the concept and were wiling to furnish their available information regarding the progress of the investigation...|$|R
