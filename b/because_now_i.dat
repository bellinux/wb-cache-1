500|$|Five {{months after}} the Olympic session, with the Beatles having now broken up, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison {{recorded}} for his All Things Must Pass triple album. It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at the same time I thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll forgive me <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E
2500|$|Doc {{relates the}} news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the {{countryside}} to have children with Maria. Feeling {{there is no longer}} anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of [...] "Somewhere") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that [...] "all of [...] " [...] killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, [...] "Now I can kill too, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have hate!" [...] she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. The Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay! but I {{will hear}} you, good master," [...] she murmured with {{infinite}} gentleness, [...] "for {{the sake of}} that friendship, and <b>because</b> <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> have seen you again I no longer believe any evil of you." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{dropped me}} one of her curtseys which were {{extraordinary}} taking. [...] "If you will be cross," [...] said she, [...] "I must be making pretty manners at you, Davie. I will be very obedient, as I should be when every stitch upon all there is of me belongs to you. But {{you will not be}} very cross either, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have not anyone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did {{you treat}} me like you did?" [...] she said. [...] "It's such a pity, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can't feel {{anything}} at all." [...] And turning, she suddenly passed {{the back of her}} hand across her eyes. Really moved by that, Fiorsen went towards her, but she had turned round again, and putting out her hand to keep him off, stood shaking her head, with half a tear glistening on her eyelashes.|$|E

Not that it hurts, but that my boss would have a fit! I'm glad you've stopped heaping praise upon our friend Ben. <b>Because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can get over my jealousy and be half decent.

6000|$|Barrington {{shook hands}} with Graham, and then sighed a little when he went out. [...] "I believe the man is honest, {{and he is a}} guest of mine, or I should have dressed him down," [...] he said. [...] "I don't like the way things are going, Dane, and the fact is we must find {{accommodation}} somewhere, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have to pay out so much on my ward's account to that confounded Courthorne it is necessary to raise more dollars than the banks will give me.

I saw my gold was in my trunk at home! In Christ my Lord and Saviour. Now Christ was all; all my wisdom, all my righteousness, all my sanctification, and all my redemption.|$|E
50|$|I {{got hold}} of your book at a very opportune time, <b>because</b> right <b>now</b> <b>I</b> am busy {{collecting}} and compiling {{a book on the}} lives of the Muslims from various perspectives.

Yet another Spirit came, that of one Mameena whom once you knew. She came angrily, like a storm, and I shrank before her. She said, 'Vile witch, you have plotted to murder Macumazahn, and for that you shall answer to me before another sun has set over this earth of yours. Now you seek a way of escape from your own wickedness. Well, it can be had, but at a price.' ...|$|E

Do not, think that I am praising myself, for I am pretty nearly beside myself, you may suppose.' ...|$|E
60|$|After I {{had been}} a year at home again, I went over the bay to see my son, and to receive another year's income of my plantation; and I was {{surprised}} to hear, just at my landing there, that my old husband was dead, and had not been buried above a fortnight. This, I confess, was not disagreeable news, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> could appear as I was, in a married condition; so I told my son before I came from him, that I believed I should marry a gentleman who had a plantation near mine; and though I was legally free to marry, as to any obligation that was on me before, yet that I was shy of it, lest the blot should some time or other be revived, and it might make a husband uneasy. My son, the same kind, dutiful, and obliging creature as ever, treated me now at his own house, paid me my hundred pounds, and sent me home again loaded with presents.|$|E

60|$|At last, {{after an}} agony of supplication and protestation, I got Dora {{to look at}} me, with a horrified {{expression}} of face, which I gradually soothed until it was only loving, and her soft, pretty cheek was lying against mine. Then I told her, with my arms clasped round her, how I loved her, so dearly, and so dearly; how I felt it right to offer to release her from her engagement, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> was poor; how I never could bear it, or recover it, if I lost her; how I had no fears of poverty, if she had none, my arm being nerved and my heart inspired by her; how I was already working with a courage such as none but lovers knew; how I had begun to be practical, and look into the future; how a crust well earned was sweeter far than a feast inherited; and much more to the same purpose, which I delivered {{in a burst of}} passionate eloquence quite surprising to myself, though I had been thinking about it, day and night, ever since my aunt had astonished me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are sea-cattle!' said Little Klaus. 'I {{will tell}} you the whole story, and I thank you for having drowned me, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> am on dry land and really rich! How frightened I was when I was in the sack! How the wind whistled in my ears as you threw me from the bridge into the cold water!

I fell on this, and immediately the sack opened; the loveliest maiden in snow-white garments, with a green garland round her wet hair, took me by the hand, and said! ''Are you Little Klaus? Here are some cattle for you to begin with, and a mile farther down the road there is another herd, which I will give you as a present!'' Now I saw that the river was a great high-road for the sea-people. Along it they travel underneath from the sea to the land till the river ends. It was so beautiful, full of flowers and fresh grass; the fishes which were swimming in the water shot past my ears as the birds do here in the air. What lovely people there were, and what fine cattle were grazing in the ditches and dykes!' ...|$|E
