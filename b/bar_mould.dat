40|$|Peat soils {{occur in}} many {{countries}} and formed naturally through the decomposition {{of plant and animal}} matter. These soils are known as a very problematic soft soil due to its low bearing capacity and high compressibility. These two main factors may be based on the characteristics of the soil itself. This study is focused on its physical properties and shrinkage measurement. It is also to investigate the shrinkage measurement that was obtained from the diameter of the samples at four dimensional points and bar linear shrinkage method for both location peat samples. There are various method {{that can be used in}} order to obtain a full description of the shrinkage behaviour of peat. The sample was taken from two different locations which are Parit Nipah and Pontian. The linear shrinkage method is used to determine the soil shrinkage from linear measurements on a <b>bar</b> <b>mould</b> with disturbed soil that passing 0. 425 mm sieve. However, this method was modified by using undisturbed samples to compare the result with bar linear shrinkage method and the measurement was obtained by the reduction of its diameter at four points of the sample. Linear shrinkage values obtained from Parit Nipah and Pontian by following British Standard method are 34. 77 % and 33. 09 % respectively while modified linear method gives the value of 35. 25 % for Parit Nipah and 32. 85 % for Pontian. Modified method shows that peat soil from both locations shrinks in irregular shape due to Point C of Parit Nipah and Pontian peat sample has the smallest diameter compared to other points within 24 hours oven-dried. It also shows that Parit Nipah peat soil has a higher percentage of linear shrinkage for both methods instead of Pontian peat soil. The linear shrinkage values that obtained from bar linear shrinkage and modified linear shrinkage gives smaller different values which are nearly same for both method...|$|E
40|$|Powder Injection Moulding (PIM) is a {{promising}} approach to producing a near netshape product of intricate geometry with cost-effective production. PIM by using ceramic powders {{has been studied}} recently due to interest as ceramic biomaterials. Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) powders are renowned materials with their, biocompatibility, superior dimensional stability and excellent mechanical properties resulting from mechanisms of transformation toughening. The focus {{of this study is}} to fabricate root pins for dental implantation structure through Ceramic Injection Moulding (CIM). 3 mol% YSZ powders were used to mix with binder components that consist of palm stearin (PS) as a primary binder and polyethylene (PE) as a backbone binder in 60 : 40 ratios. Four different powder loadings were prepared in this study; 57, 58, 59 and 60 vol. % based on critical powder volume percentage (CPVP) experiment. The homogeneity of the feedstocks was evaluated via torque rheometry data and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. The flow ability of the feedstock were determined through rheological characteristic which are the relationship of viscosity and shear rate formed pseudoplastic behaviour, the flow behaviour index value (n) is below than 1 and lower activation energy (E). Then, all feedstocks were injected in a screw thread shape and rectangular <b>bar</b> <b>mould</b> for further experiment. All moulded specimens were embedded into alumina powder (wicking agent) before undergoing thermal debinding process at 550 °C to remove the binders and pre-sintering at 1100 °C was carried out simultaneously after debinding process in the same furnace. The parts were subsequently sintered in the furnace up to 1450 °C for 3 hours without wicking agent with 3 °C/min heating rate. The characterization of sintered parts, physical properties, and mechanical properties was performed. It is expected that, low powder loading specimens (57 vol. %) had lower viscosity, strength, density and hardness but higher in porosity compared to higher powder loading specimens (58 vol. %, 59 vol. % and 60 vol. %). The elastic modulus of compressive strength and hardness for 60 vol. % specimens was 4. 79 ± 1. 24 GPa and 398. 5 ± 10. 4 HV respectively. Overall, root pins for dental implantation structure was successfully fabricated via CIM technique using PS as the binder system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective of this research project was {{to carry out the}} investigation of the relationship between processing conditions, micromorphology and mechanical properties of isotactic polypropylene homopolymer using conventional and shear controlled orientation injection moulding (SCORIM) techniques by systematically changing carefully controlled processing conditions, mould geometry and compound additives. Both SCORIM and conventional techniques were employed for iPP injection moulding using three moulds of different shapes by varying the processing conditions, including nozzle temperature, mould temperature, injection speed, hold pressure and oscillating patterns of pistons. The results obtained were compared so as to indicate the differences in microstructure and physical properties resulting from the two moulding techniques. A range of analytical methods were employed. Optical transmitted light microscopy was used to reveal the skin-core morphology and preferentially oriented fibrous textures. Transmitted Electron Microscopy represented the enlargement of the fibrous alignment. Micro hardness analysed the hardness and isotropy characteristics by measuring the diagonal lengths of the indentations. Mechanical testing determined Young's modulus, the strength and toughness of the mouldings. X-ray diffraction exhibited the distribution of the cc, 6 and 7 crystalline phases of the iPP mouldings. The WAXS Debye patterns confirmed the existence of the preferred orientation through the thickness of the moulding. Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysed the thermal behaviour from the endothermal and exothermal curves. In the initial stage of the study, the polypropylene was moulded {{in the form of a}} standard tensile bar on a conventional Sandretto injection machine in order to obtain the basic characteristics of the polypropylene study material, which could then be used to compare with those properties to be gained using the SCORIM technique. A ring mould was then used in a Negri Bossi twin injection machine to investigate improvements in uniformity of micromorphology and dimensional reproducibility of mouldings made possible by four live-feed injection moulding. Later, a study was carried out on injection moulding of polypropylene by varying processing conditions, including three hold pressures, two mould temperatures and two nozzle temperatures for both conventional and SCORIM injection processes by using a rectangular <b>bar</b> <b>mould</b> in a Demag injection moulding machine. In the finial stage, the study explores the influences of composition, in essence a limited range of nucleating agents, and processing methods, and aspects of the micromorphology, dimensional control and the mechanical properties of polypropylene. Polypropylene, as a sernicrystalline polymer, represents a class of materials in which mechanical properties are strongly influenced by processing conditions and micromorphology.

5000|$|Aero {{bars are}} {{manufactured}} in nut-free facilities in England and Canada. However, in Australia {{where they are}} manufactured, they do have traces of nuts. They are made {{in a number of}} discrete stages beginning with deposition of unaerated shell chocolate into the <b>bar</b> <b>moulds.</b> A frozen cone shaped to fit into the bar is then pushed down to spread the liquid chocolate into the entire mould and set it. The aerated chocolate is then deposited into the centre and the moulds are shaken to distribute the chocolate evenly in the cavity. This is then chilled to set the bubbly chocolate in place before a final backing off deposit is created to give the back. The moulds are then shaken again to get a flat even back. The moulds are specially shaped to ensure that no meniscus is formed on the bottom, which can give the chocolate a scuffed appearance and also cause issues with the machines when they break off and build up. The bars are then chilled again for a longer period. This helps to make the chocolate contract for easier demoulding. The moulds are then tipped over and hammered to demould the bars, which then go to the packaging section.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} pinholes in castings formed by reaction between a green foundry mould and lamellargraphite cast iron. Great numbers of works have been aimed at clarifying the causes of pinholes formation in iron castings. In spite of thisthere exists no united opinion on the pinholes formation (genesis) and {{the authors of this}} contribution having studied this phenomenon incompacted graphite and spheroidal graphite iron castings were also aimed at lamellar graphite cast iron and they applied for it theirknowledge gained in study of reoxidation processes during casting of ferrous alloys. Methodology: Experiments were done on castings of stepped <b>bars</b> <b>moulded</b> in green bentonite mixtures with s graduated moisture and withuse of two types of carbonaceous matters. Metal was melted in a 100 kg induction furnace from the same charge. Inoculation was done ina ladle after pouring out from the furnace. Aluminium was dosed in the ladle in some cases and the inoculator kind was changed too. Results: Pinholes were present on castings as small flat pits; on horizontal surfaces sooner singly, on casting edges in clusters. Theformation of pinholes wasn’t caused by high moisture of moulds but the defect was sensitive to aluminium content in metal. In castingswith high aluminium content > 0. 01 % the pinholes were present in great numbers, and namely both under low, and also high moi stures ofmoulding mixtures. In melts with low content of Al < 0. 01 % the pinholes occurred less extensively only. Practical implications: Conclusions from literature about influence of Al on pinholes occurrence were confirmed in such a way.

40|$|Abstract. During hot {{embossing}} {{process of}} polymer MEMS devices, the parameters such as temperature, pressure and time {{are important for}} the duplication precision of patterns. In this work, a novel method of hot embossing lithography for replication of multiple nano <b>bar</b> structure <b>mould</b> was conducted. The effects of hot embossing temperature and pressure on fabrication precision were studied. Linewidth of the pattern on the mould is from 71 nm to 980 nm. The replicas of nano bar structure were fabricated on the PMMA (polymer methyl methacrylate) layer with silicon substrate. The effects of hot embossing and demoulding temperature on replicating quality were also discussed. Experimental results indicate that higher demoulding temperature help to lessen PMMA leftover and improve the duplication quality. The hot embossing and dmoulding temperature of 110 °C～ 120 °C and 60 °C～ 70 °C were obtained to produce high quality duplication of multiple nano bar structures. Micro-grating replicas were also fabricated and demonstrated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is aimed to improve stability of milk chocolate bars by tempering process. The making of chocolate bars {{consisted of two}} formulations, namely a higher fat bar (40 %) and low fat bar (21. 5 %). The study includes the chocolate bar preparation with and without tempering results. The melting point of milk chocolate bars that use cocoa butter tempering (L 1) {{is higher than the}} milk chocolate bars that use fat without tempering (L 2) for all treatments. Solid fat content (SFC) of F 1 has higher solid phase at room temperature (55 - 60 %) in all treatments compared with milk chocolate bar F 2 (40 - 43 %) and chocolate produced by UKM (Malaysia) 40 - 48 % and soccolatte 35 - 38 % at the same temperature (350 C).

40|$|The impact {{toughness}} of {{high-density polyethylene}} modified with calcium carbonate particles was investigated for different processing conditions. The increase in toughness differed not only between compression and injection moulded samples, but also between samples with different position in an injection <b>moulded</b> <b>bar,</b> and injected with different temperature during the injection moulding process. Therefore, {{the influence of}} crystal orientation was investigated, as influenced by the processing conditions used. It {{was found that the}} effectiveness of hard filler particles on improved impact toughness of HDPE is dominantly controlled by flow induced crystal orientation, rather than by heterogeneous nucleation on the particle surface. The resulting crystal orientation obtained by injection moulding is complex and the anisotropic nature of the crystallized matrix becomes more pronounced once the material is tested perpendicular to the flow direction. The large increase in impact properties is almost completely lost here...|$|R

The pentanediol seems in part to be present as adjacent re-entry groups.

Popular retail outlets currently call these a claw bar {{if it has a}} claw on each end, or a <b>moulding</b> <b>bar</b> if it has a claw on one end and a flat pry bar on the other. It essentially works as a small crowbar. To use the tool the user holds the tool's shank with one hand and drives the claw around a nailhead with a hammer. When the V is firmly seated around the nail's shank, the users pull the bar back to raise the head, then finishes pulling the nail with the hammer's claw. The cat's paw is well designed for demolition work, but because it tears up the wood around the nailhead, it should not be used for finish work.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} pinholes in castings by reaction between cast iron with compacted graphite and green sand mould. Methodology: Experiments were done on <b>bar</b> castings <b>moulded</b> in green bentonite mixtures without carbonaceous matters. Moulding sand moisture and aluminium content in the melt were purposely changed. Metal was melted in a 100 kg furnace by remelting the uniform charge of return material. Metal was inoculated all at once in a ladle and modified in a reaction chamber in a mould or as sandwich method in a pouring ladle. Findings: The formation of pinholes was not caused by high moisture of the mould but this defect was sensible to aluminium content in metal. In castings with high aluminium content > 0. 2 % the pinholes occurred in high numbers, and namely under low and also high moistures (> 4 %). In previous melts with aluminium contents < 0. 02 % defects occurred in small range. Practical implications: Thus the conclusions known from literature {{about the influence of}} Al on pinholes occurrence in cast irons were confirmed. Oxygen activity in metal during its flowing and cooling in the mould was also measured but this quantity was not changed too in dependence on pinholes content. Morphological analyses near the defect have indicated that it is a physical type of pinholes caused by hydrogen. Originality: A number of works were aimed at explanation of causes of pinholes formation in lamellar graphite iron castings and spheroidal graphite ones. But this defect is formed in castings from compacted graphite cast iron too and the research was aimed just to this material. The contribution is in such a way an exceptional one...|$|R

The crystallisation rate, the modulus above the glass transition temperature and the glass transition temperature hardly changed. The APEA of 1, 4 -butyleneisophthalamide ester and ethanediol was amorphous. The lowering of the melting temperature of the copolymers was probably caused by a decrease in lamellar size.

40|$|Titanium {{aluminide}} alloys {{are prone}} to extensive shrinkage porosity, particularly interdendritic layer porosity. This research aims to develop {{a better understanding of}} shrinkage porosity in Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb alloy and how to minimize it. Practical measurements in conjunction with computer simulations were carried out in order to study the effects of cooling rate and temperature gradient on shrinkage porosity in Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb investment castings, through investigating the influence of casting geometry, specifically mould taper on cylindrical <b>bars,</b> and preheating <b>mould</b> temperature on the macrostructure and the formation of shrinkage porosity. The interface heat-transfer coefficient of the ceramic shell/surroundings was determined using measured cooling curves obtained in 200 mbar of Argon and in vacuum. Furthermore, the alloy/mould interfacial heat transfer coefficient was estimated and was verified by comparing measured and predicted cooling curves of Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb. The Niyama criterion function was validated to predict shrinkage-related porosity in Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb castings, through either thermal or tilt-filling ProCastTM simulation models. Positions in a casting with Niyama values above 4 (°C. min) 0. 5 cm- 1; (3 (K. s) 0. 5 mm- 1); could be considered completely sound.

This project involves background work on butt-welding of injection <b>moulded</b> polypropylene ASTM <b>bars</b> followed by a programme on the welding of extruded polypropylene strapping tape. In the butt-welding study, the effects of processing conditions of the bars, welding variables, and annealing treatments, on the morphology and strength of the welds, were investigated. Light and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used for}} the analysis of morphological structure and fracture surface texture. Tensile tests have been used to assess the weld strength either at room temperature and at sub-zero temperature. In the strapping tape programme the influence of the tape orientation and the welding temperature on weld efficiency was analysed. The orientation of the tapes, obtained by means of five different draw ratios in the manufacturing plant, was assessed by doing shrinkage and optical measurements. Shear and peeling tests have been used to study the weld efficiency. From the butt-welding study was concluded that the microstructure of the injection <b>moulded</b> <b>bars</b> affected the weld zone morphology. The annealing at l 52 degrees C before and after welding caused a reduction in weld strength. However the oriented zones were apparently unaffected by these thermal treatments. In that the strapping tape welding is concerned, an optimum welding tool temperature could be identified. The draw ratio of the tapes seems not to affect the optimum weld temperature, but it influences the efficiency of the welds...|$|R
40|$|For the {{automotive}} sector, plastics play {{the most important}} role when designing interior and exterior parts for cars. Currently, most parts are made from petroleum-based plastics but alternatives are needed to replace environmentally harmful materials while providing the appropriate mechanical performance and preferably reduce the cost for the final product. The objective of this work was to explore the use of soy flakes as natural filler in a composite with polypropylene and to investigate the mechanical properties, water absorption and thermal behaviour. For {{a better understanding of}} the filler, the soy flakes were characterized extensively with analytical and microscopic methods. Two types of soy fillers were investigated, soy flakes, provided by Bunge Inc., with a 48 wt-% protein content and an industrial soy based filler with 44 wt-% protein content and provided by Ford. The size of the soy flakes after milling was mainly between 50 and 200 µm and below 50 µm for the industrial filler. The aspect ratio for all filler was below 5. The soy flakes were used after milling and subjected to two pre-treatment methods: (1) one hour in a 50 °C pH 9 water solution in a 1 : 9 solid-liquid ratio; (2) one hour in a 50 °C pH 9 1 M NaCl solution in a 1 : 9 solid-liquid ratio. A control filler, without pre-treatment was considered. The soy flakes were also compared to an industrial soy based filler provided by Ford (soy flour (Ford)). The thermogravimetric analysis showed an onset of degradation at 170 °C for the treated filler (ISH 2 O and ISNaCl) and 160 °C for the untreated filler. The biocomposites formulation consisted of 30 wt-% filler, and polypropylene with/without 0. 35 wt-% anti-oxidant Irganox 1010 and with/without the addition of MA-PP as coupling agent. All biocomposites were compounded in a mini-extruder, pressed into <b>bars</b> by injection <b>moulding</b> and tested subsequently. The mechanical properties of the biocomposites are promising. An increase of the E-modulus was observed when compared to pure polypropylene. The addition of MA-PP as coupling agent increased the yield strength of the biocomposites. When pure polypropylene and the biocomposites were compared no difference could be seen for their yield strength. The thermal behaviour deduced from differential scanning calorimetry, revealed a similar behaviour for the biocomposites and the pure polypropylene. Only the samples treated in the presence of NaCl and without a coupling agent, appear to have a slightly higher degree of crystallinity. The melt flow index was slightly increased for the biocomposites containing soy flakes pre-treated with NaCl and decreased for biocomposites containing the soy flour. The water absorption behaviour of the biocomposites was quite similar at the beginning with a slightly lower absorption for the materials with coupling agent. After three months, all samples except the ones treated with water showed a weight loss that can be due to the leaching of the water soluble components in the untreated filler and the NaCl treated filler. In conclusion, soy flakes represent an attractive filler when used in a polypropylene matrix if an aqueous alkaline pre-treatment is performed. The aqueous alkaline extraction also leads to the recovery of the proteins that can be used in food products while the remaining insoluble material is used for the biocomposites, avoiding the competition with the use of soy for food products [...] ...|$|R
