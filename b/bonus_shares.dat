25|$|On 20 April 2015, The Express Tribune {{claimed that}} Sharif {{administration}} misled the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the actual tax charged on {{the issuance of}} <b>bonus</b> <b>shares,</b> as collection from supposedly the biggest source of income tax in the year stands at a mere Rs. 1billion. As against the actual income tax rate of 5% {{on the value of}} <b>bonus</b> <b>shares,</b> the government has told the IMF that it levied a 10% tax, which will generate revenue equal to 0.1% of gross domestic product or Rs. 29billion. On 27 March 2016, around 2,000 far-right protesters led by Sunni Tehreek staged a sit-in at D-Chowk in front of the parliament in Islamabad, causing a partial halt to the capital city. The protestors demanded the implementation of Sharia in the country and declaring Mumtaz Qadri a martyr. The protestors also burned down cars and city main public transit station and injured journalists and bystanders. The government on the 28th called in the army to control the law and order.

On 7 April 2016, The Express Tribune in an editorial claimed that Sharif's multibillion-rupee health insurance plan seems to be failing already because of poor planning, claiming that the basic health infrastructure doesn't allow for such a plan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing <b>bonus</b> <b>shares,</b> partly paid shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a rolling basis for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|E
