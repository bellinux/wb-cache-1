5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> {{parts of}} the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters {{were excluded from the}} succession.|$|E

5|$|With the {{infantry}} {{part of the}} <b>battle</b> <b>over,</b> Union artillery continued to boom across the hill. They stopped firing at 8:30pm, leaving a wreath of smoke upon the crest's edge, and ending the action on Malvern Hill.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} Stevan K. Pavlowitch, {{the bombing of}} Belgrade lasted three days. Other sources state the air <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April. The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the National Library of Serbia, which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of volumes, rare books, maps, and medieval manuscripts were destroyed. Also struck was the Belgrade Zoo, sending frightened animals running through the streets.|$|E

5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} no signs of enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the group. By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. A furious <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> the islands ensued.|$|E
5|$|After {{a costly}} legal <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> {{a real estate}} deal with William S. King and the {{financial}} downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become hesitant to testify against him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's post-playing {{career was}} mired by a legal <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> child support. He {{was accused of}} reneging on child support {{payments}} to a woman whom he had fathered a child with out of wedlock. The case has since been settled. It was reported that the bad publicity from this case had kept Anderson out of the Hockey Hall of Fame for a long time.|$|E

5|$|Copeland was {{considered}} a prodigy who rose to stardom despite not starting ballet {{until the age of}} 13. By age 15, her mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was already an award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E
5|$|In 2506, {{during the}} End War, the Daelaam {{under the command}} of Hierarch Artanis came to Cybros to reactivate the purifiers. Clolarion acted as their {{spokesman}} and leader during the mission, and ordered the Purifiers to engage the zerg on the station, and then purified the surface of Endion, the forest moon Cybros orbited. With the <b>battle</b> <b>over,</b> Artanis asked the purifiers to join the Daelaam in the war against Amon. Clolarion questioned his sincerity and only accepted an alliance on the condition of Talandar being their ambassador.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Takechi {{entered the}} film {{industry}} by producing controversial soft-core theatrical pornography. His 1964 film Daydream was the first big-budget, mainstream pink film released in Japan. After the release of his 1965 film Black Snow, the government arrested him on indecency charges. The trial became a public <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> censorship between Japan's intellectuals and the government. Takechi won the lawsuit, enabling the wave of softcore pink films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema during the 1960s and 1970s. In the later 1960s, Takechi produced three more pink films.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Governor J. C. W. Beckham {{ascended to}} the office of governor, and he and Taylor waged a {{protracted}} court <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> the governorship. Beckham won the case on appeal, and Taylor fled to Indiana to escape prosecution as an accomplice in Goebel's murder. A total of sixteen people were charged in connection with the assassination. Five went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Each of the remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors. The identity of Goebel's assassin remains a mystery.|$|E

The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E
