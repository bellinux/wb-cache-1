5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} <b>back.</b> <b>From</b> <b>this</b> difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
5|$|The initial Russian position, which {{stretched}} {{south of}} the new Smolensk Highway (Napoleon's expected route of advance), was anchored on its left by a pentagonal earthwork redoubt erected on a mound {{near the village of}} Shevardino. The Russian generals soon realized that their left wing was too exposed and vulnerable. So the Russian line was moved <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> position, but the Redoubt remained manned, Kutuzov stating that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces. Historian Dmitry Buturlin reports that it was used as an observation point to determine the course of the French advance. Historians Witner and Ratch, and many others, reported it was used as a fortification to threaten the French right flank, despite being beyond effective reach of guns of the period.|$|E

Unfortunately, the electronic brainstorming still is in infantile state and lacks some modern techniques which may make the whole approach more effective.

25|$|Mason was now Architect to the Auckland Provincial Council. In April 1856 {{he became}} President {{of the newly}} formed Board of Works.

The first fortifications date <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> period. In 1351, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania conquered the area, only to give it three years later to the Vlachs, who formed their own independent principality in 1359, Moldavia.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall in 1961, military service in the GDR was voluntary, though the Free German Youth and public schools mounted intensive recruitment drives and service in the NVA was often a prerequisite for career advancement. Compulsory service had been introduced earlier in West Germany (1956) – one year after the Federal Armed Forces were established – but the GDR held <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> step until 1962.

25|$|He {{was able}} to bounce <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> loss by {{recording}} back-to-back wins, a third-round TKO of Sadio Cissoko on March 17, 2007 and a unanimous decision over Arslan Magomedov on April 14, 2007 at K-1 Italy Oktagon 2007, both fights taking place in Milan, Italy. From there, he was offered the biggest fight of his career at that point when he replaced John Wayne Parr, who withdrew after injuring his ribs training with Nathan Corbett, to challenge Buakaw Por. Pramuk for his WMC World Junior Middleweight (-69.8kg/154lb) Championship at K-1 Fighting Network Scandinavian Qualification 2007 in Stockholm, Sweden on May 19, 2007. After five rounds, the fight was ruled a split draw and, consequently, Buakaw retained his title.|$|E
25|$|Jung did {{not plan}} to study {{psychiatry}} since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, {{exactly what he was}} searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Wolfgang Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.|$|E

25|$|Schutz' next venture, however, was a {{financial}} disaster. In January 1577 Schutz assisted Giovanni Battista Agnello, a Venetian then living in London, in the assaying {{of a black}} stone which had been picked up lying loose {{on the surface of}} Hall's Island by Robert Garrard during Sir Martin Frobisher's first voyage to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. Agnello's claim that the stone was gold-bearing (apparently confirmed or at least accepted by Schutz) caused government officials to authorise a second voyage by Frobisher to Baffin Island. Schutz accompanied Frobisher's ships to Meta Incognita, where he is said to have found a 'great ruby stone' which Frobisher promised to present to the Queen in Schutz's name, but which was apparently not heard of again after it came into Frobisher's hands. In August 1577 Schutz, Robert Denham and Gregory Bona, in a brick-lined furnace built for the purpose, assayed black ore mine at the Countess of Warwick's Island, (now Kodlunarn Island) in Frobisher Bay. Back in England, between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 Schutz performed three 'great proofes' of the black ore brought <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> second voyage. Agnello and Kranich were also brought in to assay the ore, and Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. It was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton.|$|E
500|$|He bounced <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> defeat {{by winning}} the Montreal Masters Rogers Cup, {{defeating}} Tsonga and Nishikori in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively. He then prevailed in the final against Djokovic in three sets. This broke his eight-match, two-year losing streak against Djokovic (his last win against him being in the final of Wimbledon in 2013). In winning the title he also surpassed Federer in terms of ranking, becoming the world No. 2 {{for the first time}} in over two years. In doubles, he partnered Leander Paes and they won their first match against Chardy and Anderson, but were then defeated by Murray's brother Jamie and John Peers in two sets – the first time the Murray brothers had competed against each other in a Tour-level match, a situation which Andy described as [...] "awkward" [...] and Jamie as [...] "a bit weird".|$|E
2500|$|On 31 May, Sever sighted the Kermadec Islands [...] — {{he named}} Macauley Island after McCaulay and Curtis Island after William Curtis. The poor {{condition}} {{of the ship and}} sickness among her crew compelled Lady Penrhyn to turn <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> voyage when she had gone only as far as Matavai Bay, Tahiti, where the crew recovered and the ship was repaired. She then visited and named Penrhyn Island—the atoll of Tongareva in the Cook Islands—on 8 August, arriving at Macao on 19 October 1788, then proceeding upriver to Canton (now Guangzhou) to take on a cargo of tea.|$|E

2500|$|But {{apparently}} Legrand drew <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> {{brink of}} cynicism, for when Pierrot, incarnated by younger mimes, crossed the barriers that had forestalled him from violations {{of his own}} naïveté, Legrand demurred. [...] After enjoying some success with his Pierrot, Murderer of his Wife (1881), a pantomime in which a disillusioned Pierrot tickles Columbine to death, the young Paul Margueritte interviewed Legrand, now an aging artist whose triumphs at the Folies lay far behind him. [...] Margueritte's reception was not warm. [...] "The macabre, the terrible," [...] {{he wrote in his}} memoir Le Printemps tourmenté (1925), [...] "Paul Legrand only tolerated it as accidental, quickly borne away by fantasy and dream." [...] And it was Legrand's old Pierrot, unstained by crime and disillusionment, that would survive into the twenty-first century.|$|E

Commons managed to come <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> and made his league debut the following season on 10 August 2002 in a scoreless draw against Sheffield Wednesday. [...] Commons won praise from his manager Steve Cotterill who stated [...] "Kris is a great prospect with a fantastic left foot", adding [...] "If he keeps working hard {{he has a great}} future." [...] His first goal came in a 1–1 draw against Norwich City on 26 August 2002.

2500|$|With her sixth Japanese album, The Face (2008), BoA {{took more}} {{creative}} control over her music. At this time, BoA {{was influenced by}} electropop.
