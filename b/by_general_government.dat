30|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} {{between public and private}} wages, as measured <b>by</b> <b>general</b> <b>government</b> and manufacturing nominal compensations, respectively, on a sample of 17 European Union (EU) countries from 1980 to 2013 applying dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) to panel data for the long-run and an error correction model (ECM) for the short run. We focus specifically on the spill over of government to manufacturing compensations so as to address the question of the possible effects of certain fiscal policy measures on cost competitiveness via the supply side. Moreover, attention is devoted to the manufacturing sector because much of the literature on wage leadership is indeed concerned with the signalling that comes from wage bargainers in the manufacturing sector. Our estimation strategy aims at determining the strength of the relation between sectoral compensations across government sectors of different size, at assessing whether the way in which government compensations are set has any impact {{on the nature of the}} interaction with the private traded sector, and finally at establishing whether such relation is symmetric holding both when government compensations are increased and when cut and whether periods of large cuts (or fiscal consolidations) make a difference. Whilst our focus is on the relation going from general government to manufacturing compensations, we nonetheless also assess interactions in the opposite direction as a way of validating our results.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis started. in 2008 {{with the collapse}} of Iceland's banking system. Subsequently, several European countries faced the implosion of financial institutions, high government debt and rapidly rising bond yield spreads in government securities. In this context, Greece {{is an example of a}} country whose government debt is a matter of grave concern since it has received the second bailout but still threatens to default. This is ironic since a developed economy like Greece is considered to aide developing economies. The main aim of this dissertation is to conduct an econometric analysis of the determinants of the Greek {{sovereign debt}} crisis while the secondary aim is an extensive literature review of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Regarding the former aim, the variables selected include the government deficit, current account balance, inflation, gross savings and general government debt of Greece. This annual data (from 1976 to 2010) was collected from the World Development Indicators, European Commission data base and the International Monetary Fund. The Vector Error Correction Model framework was used to estimate our model. Also, the Granger causality analysis helped to identify the direction of causation. Furthermore, the Variance Decomposition and the Generalized Impulse Response Function were employed to analyze the shocks of all our variables on each other. Finally, for the latter aim, we critically review the evolution, causes, consequences and cures of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and then formulate some suggestions on how to mitigate the effects of this crisis. The results of the econometric analysis show that there is a significant negative relationship between general government debt with government deficit and inflation. However, a significant positive relationship between general government debt and current account balance was found. There is an insignificant negative relationship between gross savings and general government debt. The past value of the general government debt and government deficit has the ability to determine the present value of inflation; and in turn, pass value of inflation, can predict the present value of current account balance and gross savings. Variation in most of our variables is highly explained by our variables itself, with the exception of current account balance where variation is explained mostly <b>by</b> <b>general</b> <b>government</b> debt. The response of general government debt to itself is positive. Gross government debt to government deficit and general government debt to current account balance is negative. General government debt to inflation is positive. A shock of gross government debt has an increasing negative effect on gross savings over the study period. Among the causes of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis is the rapid growth of government debt levels, trade imbalances, monetary policy inflexibility, and loss of confidence. Consequences of this crisis involve disrupted bond markets and the banking sector, depreciation of the Euro, reduced economic growth, loss of confidence, reduced remittances and tight fiscal measures. Some measures were taken and many are proposed as a cure for this crisis. This dissertation recommends that policies aimed at decreasing the level of general government debt should increase expenditure hence deficit in an income generating investment, increase inflation while decreasing current account balance.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the latest estimates of Hong Kong domestic health spending for fiscal years 1989 / 90 to 2006 / 07, cross-stratified and categorised by financing source, provider, and function. Total expenditure on health (TEH) was HK$ 75 048 million {{in fiscal year}} 2006 / 07, which represents an increase of HK$ 4405 million or 6. 2 % over the preceding year. Represented {{as a percentage of}} gross domestic product (GDP), TEH increased from 3. 6 % in 1989 / 90 to 5. 6 % in 2003 / 04 and then decreased to 5. 0 % by 2006 / 07. Taking population growth into account, total health spending per capita (at constant 2007 prices) grew at an average annual rate of 5. 1 %, which was faster than the average annual growth rate of per capita GDP by 2. 1 percentage points. In 2006 / 07, government financing of health expenditure was HK$ 37 417 million (49. 9 % of TEH), which was the first time it was surpassed by private spending (HK$ 37 631 million) in the last decade {{as a result of the}} continued growth of private spending (averaging 9. 5 % per annum in real terms since 2002 / 03). The second important source of health financing was out-of-pocket payments by households (35. 2 %), followed by employer-provided medical benefits (7. 4 %) and private insurance (5. 6 %). Private insurance has taken on an increasingly important role for financing private spending, whereas household and employer expenditure together has shown a corresponding decrease during the same period. Of the HK$ 75 048 million total health expenditure in 2006 / 07, current expenditure comprised HK$ 71 888 million (95. 8 %), whereas HK$ 3161 million (4. 2 %) was for capital expenses (ie investment in medical facilities). Analysed by health care function, services for curative care accounted for the largest share of total health spending (66. 2 %) which was made up of ambulatory services (35. 2 %), in-patient curative care (27. 1 %), day patient hospital services (3. 4 %), and home care (0. 5 %). In response to the escalating demand for private health care, private hospitals had increased capital expenditure leading to an observed increase in investment in medical facilities from 2. 2 % to 4. 2 % of total spending over the period 2002 / 03 to 2006 / 07. Analysed by health care provider, hospitals accounted for the largest share (42. 7 %) and providers of ambulatory health care the second largest share (30. 9 %) of total health expenditure in 2006 / 07. The downward trend in hospital share after 2002 / 03 was primarily driven by the reduced public spending on hospitals, albeit with continued growth in corresponding private spending since 1997 / 98. Meanwhile, expenditure at providers of ambulatory services accounted for an increasing share of health spending after 2003 / 04, mainly due to increases in the volume and expenditure for private services. Not taking into account capital expenses (ie investment in medical facilities), public current expenditure on health amounted to HK$ 35 437 million (49. 3 % of total current expenditure) in 2006 / 07 with the remaining HK$ 36 451 million made up of private sources of funds. Expenditure on hospital care (HK$ 32 069 million) was predominately funded <b>by</b> <b>general</b> <b>government</b> revenue (83. 8 %), whereas that on providers of ambulatory health care (HK$ 23 201 million) was by private household out-of-pocket payments (67. 3 %). This reflects the mixed health care economy of Hong Kong, where public hospitals generally account for about 90 % of total bed-days and private doctors (including western and Chinese medicine practitioners) provide about 70 % of the out-patient care. Although both public and private spending were mostly expended on personal health care services and goods (92. 2 % of total spending), the distributional patterns among functional categories differed. Public expenditure was targeted at in-patient care (53. 3 %) and substantially less at out-patient care (24. 4 %), especially first-contact care. In comparison, private spending was mostly concentrated on out-patient care (48. 7 %), whereas medical goods outside the patient care setting (22. 4 %) and in-patient care (18. 9 %) comprised the majority of the remaining share. Compared to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, Hong Kong has devoted a relatively low percentage of GDP to health care in the last decade. As a share of total spending, public funding (either general government revenue or social security funds) was also lower than in most comparably developed economies, although commensurate with its public revenue collection base. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{publication}} in the ECB monthly bulletin of new Eurosystem projections for the euro area, this article presents {{the results for the}} Belgian economy for 2008 and 2009. Since the previous forecasts were published in December 2007, the deterioration in the external factors has become more acute, owing to the deepening financial tensions, the sharp downturn in the property cycle and, more generally, the marked slowdown in activity in the United States, as well as soaring commodity prices. In the euro area, the appreciation of the euro has partly cushioned this prices increase, but is detrimental to export opportunities. The Eurosystem projections take account of weakening trade in 2008, reflecting the slower global growth. On the basis of the forward markets, oil prices are expected to persist at a very high level, averaging 113. 3 dollars per barrel in 2008 and 117. 7 dollars in 2009. Interest rates are also assumed to move in line with market expectations. As an annual average, three-month interbank deposit rates in euro are projected to reach 4. 9 p. c. in 2008 and 4. 3 p. c. in 2009. Longer term rates are forecast at 4. 5 p. c. in 2008 and 4. 7 p. c. in 2009. Exchange rates are kept constant at their mid May level, namely 1. 54 dollars to the euro. In that context, having reached 2. 7 p. c. in 2007, GDP growth in the euro area should be between 1. 5 and 2. 1 p. c. in 2008 and between 1. 0 and 2. 0 p. c. in 2009. Under the impetus of the rising prices of energy and food, inflation looks set to increase to between 3. 2 and 3. 6 p. c. in 2008. Inflation is expected to subside to between 1. 8 and 3. 0 p. c. in 2009. As in the euro area, activity remained buoyant in Belgium in 2007. The slowdown {{during the second half of}} the year was limited, in the light of the various shocks originating from the external environment. However, the slowdown is likely to be more marked towards mid 2008. Overall, real GDP growth is projected to fall from 2. 8 p. c. in 2007 to 1. 6 p. c. in 2008 and 1. 5 p. c. in 2009. Most expenditure categories are expected to contribute to the slackening pace of growth in 2008. Following a gradual recovery in the two preceding years, a downturn in exports of goods and services is expected, in line with flagging foreign demand. The recovery forecast to begin in 2009 is likely to be curbed by the delayed effects of the recent appreciation of the euro. On the domestic spending front, the growth of business investment – which had been highly dynamic up to 2007 – is likely to falter owing to the less favourable demand outlook and the tightening of external financing conditions. However, that tightening will probably be manifested mainly in a widening of the spreads. Housing investment is likely to maintain the decelerating trend which began in 2007, in a context of cooling property prices. Private consumption is also expected to weaken significantly, mainly as a result of the meagre increase in household purchasing power. However, that weakening – due mainly to higher inflation in 2008 and diminished job creation – is expected to be partly offset by a reduction in the savings ratio. Following a year-on-year rise of 1. 7 p. c. in 2007, sustained partly by the success of the service vouchers, the rate of expansion in employment is expected to drop to 1. 3 p. c. in 2008 and 0. 7 p. c. in 2009. This decline reflects the slowdown in activity after a time lag of several months. Nevertheless, job creation is likely to outpace the growth of the labour force, so that the unemployment rate should fall from 7. 5 p. c. in 2007 to 6. 9 p. c. in 2008 and 6. 8 p. c. in 2009. Having remained almost constantly below 2 p. c. in the preceding twelve months, inflation measured by the HICP accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter of 2007. According to the projections, the unusually large contribution made by food and energy price increases is set to continue during 2008. It should unwind at the beginning of 2009, in line with the assumption of persistently high commodity prices. Overall inflation is therefore predicted to rise from 1. 8 p. c. in 2007 to 4. 1 p. c. in 2008, before subsiding to 2. 3 p. c. in 2009. However, higher inflation is expected in the case of industrial goods and in services, mainly on account of the indirect effect of the commodity price shocks and the progressive incorporation of the increase in labour costs. Reflecting a muted rise in labour productivity following the strong expansion of employment in 2007 and the cyclical downturn in activity in 2008, the rise in unit labour costs in the private sector is expected to gain momentum, accelerating from an average of 0. 6 p. c. per annum between 2002 and 2006 to 2. 9 p. c. in 2007 and 3. 4 p. c. in 2008, before easing to 2. 4 p. c. in 2009. The accelerating rise in labour costs in 2007 and 2008 takes place against the background of the pressure exerted on some segments of the labour market in the wake of the economic boom. In addition, temporary factors reinforced the increase in 2007, and indexation has a considerable impact in 2008. Thus, hourly wage costs are expected to increase by 7. 3 p. c. over the two years taken together, so that the disadvantage vis-à-vis the three main trading partners is likely to be further widened. For 2009, the 3. 2 p. c. rise in hourly labour costs assumed for this exercise essentially comprises the expected effect of indexation, as this takes time to respond to the acceleration in inflation measured by the health index. That assumption is based on moderate wage settlements, the factor determining the projected easing of inflation and the expected continuing job creation. The figures for public finances take account of the recent movement in tax revenues, the endogenous effect of the macroeconomic environment, a movement in expenditure based on historical patterns and the measures which have already been decided. In accordance with the ESCB directives, new government measures which might be passed in the coming months have not been anticipated in the projection exercise. In that context, the public deficit is expected to increase from 0. 2 p. c. of GDP in 2007 to 0. 3 p. c. in 2008 and 0. 8 p. c. in 2009. This larger deficit would be due mainly to the adverse impact of the economic situation, a structural decline in revenues and a slightly expansionary policy on expenditure. Conversely, there should be a slight fall in the interest charges incurred <b>by</b> <b>general</b> <b>government.</b> Despite the budget deficits projected for 2008 and 2009, the debt ratio is expected to continue falling, to reach 81. 4 p. c. of GDP in 2008 and 79. 5 p. c. in 2009.
