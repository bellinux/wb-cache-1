50|$|Barff is {{most widely}} remembered for his {{invention}} of {{a method of}} rust proofing cast iron, named after him. The method used superheated steam to form a layer of tri-iron tetroxide(Fe3O4), which proved much cheaper than traditional galvanisation. The method was subsequently improved by George Bower, after which the process {{became known as the}} <b>Bower-Barff</b> <b>process.</b> The Bower-Barff Rustless Iron Co. had works in Southwark and New York, the latter supplying cast-iron for many of the city's landmark buildings.|$|E
