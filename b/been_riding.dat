5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} {{the front door of the}} jail and a few minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez rebounded to turn {{in another}} strong ride on Alpe d'Huez in stage 19. He, along with Contador and Pierre Rolland formed the leading group {{on the way up}} the climb. Contador, who had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> out front much of the stage after an early attack, faded first and {{finished}} the day in third place. Rolland eventually rode away from Sánchez for the stage win, but Sánchez' second place on the day moved him up to seventh overall, and back into the mountains classification lead. Sánchez, as well as Contador, moved up a place in the stage 20 individual time trial. Damiano Cunego, who had been in fifth place and is considered a poor time trialist, had a bad race against the clock even by his standards, losing two minutes to most of the race's top overall riders and more than three to the stage winner. This moved him up to sixth place overall, the position in which he concluded the race the next day, while also finishing as mountains classification winner.|$|E

25|$|The {{assassination}} evoked stunned reactions worldwide. The {{first hour}} after the shooting {{was a time of}} great confusion before the President's death was announced. The incident took place during the Cold War, and it was at first unclear whether the shooting might be part of a larger attack upon the United States. There was also concern whether Vice President Johnson, who had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> two cars behind in the motorcade, was safe.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack was}} the product of careful planning. Quantrill had been able to gain the {{confidence}} of many of the leaders of independent Bushwhacker groups, and chose the day and time of the attack well in advance. The different groups of Missouri riders approached Lawrence from the east in several independent columns, and converged with well-timed precision in the final miles before Lawrence during the pre-dawn hours of the chosen day. Many of the men had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> for over 24 hours to make the rendezvous and had lashed themselves to their saddles to keep riding if they fell asleep. Almost all were armed with multiple six-shot revolvers.|$|E
50|$|Dual-sports, by definition, are compromises - {{giving up}} some dirt {{performance}} to <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> {{on the street}} and some street performance to <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> in the dirt. The merits of a particular model can only be judged relative to the owner’s intended mix of dirt and street riding. Although aficionados may argue the merits of different models, versatile dual-sports can be desirable alternatives to more specialized motorcycles that can only <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> in one environment.|$|R

25|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Agnes Salm-Salm. Many {{scholars}} believe that she worked in a circus, then as an actress in Cuba. In 1861 {{she returned to the}} United States but soon left her home in Vermont to visit her sister in Washington, D.C. who was getting married. Agnes stayed around Washington when she met Prince Felix Salm-Salm, a soldier of fortune, and a distant relation to the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. She had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> her horse one morning through the city when Felix first saw her and he made sure she was invited to a party that he would be attending. Soon Felix proposed to her and they were married in August 30, 1862, despite opposition from her family (he was Catholic and she was Protestant).|$|E
25|$|Craddock {{planned a}} career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new Triumph motorcycle. In July 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was {{shattered}} in a motorcycle crash. He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg {{for the rest of his}} life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him, but some claim Craddock had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> drunk. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea. He spent time in the Portsmouth Naval Hospital and was medically discharged from the Navy shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Neil Lake needed three metal plates {{inserted}} {{in his face}} after being attacked by a Hells Angel at a petrol station in Cardiff in October 2007. Lake took down the registration of his attacker's Harley-Davidson motorcycle which led police to Sean Timmins, the vice-president of the Wolverhampton chapter. Timmins denied inflicting grievous bodily harm on Lake and claimed that a fellow club member had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> around with the same number plates as him; he told a judge he knew {{the identity of the}} actual attacker but explained that it would be against club rules for him to name him. Timmins was cleared of the charge in September 2008 after providing an alibi who said that he was working in his hometown {{on the day of the}} attack. He would later be one of the three Hells Angels jailed for six years after the brawl with the Outlaws at Birmingham Airport.|$|E

25|$|The {{description}} {{of the young man}} with whom Beineman had last been seen alive was heard by a patrolman named Larry Mathewson, who believed the person described by Mrs. Goshe and others may be one John Norman Collins: a former fraternity member of his who had previously been interviewed but eliminated from police inquiries, and who he had himself seen riding his motorcycle around the Eastern Michigan University campus on the afternoon of July 23. When Mathewson questioned Collins on July 25 as to his movements two days earlier, he admitted that on the date in question he had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> his Triumph Bonneville in the vicinity, and that he had stopped to converse with a former girlfriend of his while doing so (the point at which Mathewson had observed him). This former girlfriend was able to provide Mathewson with two recent photographs of Collins. When Mathewson showed these photographs to both Mrs. Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding, both women were adamant the man in the photographs was the same individual with whom Beineman had last been seen alive.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, neighbors began to {{discover}} items along the route Desha and Baker had taken from Doggate's Tavern to Maysville. These included a bloody glove, a pair of saddlebags with the bottoms cut out, and Desha's missing horse bridle. On November 8, three men discovered a man's body [...] its upper half covered by a log [...] about [...] off the road on the Fleming County side. The men did not move the body, but reported it to local authorities, who returned to recover it. The victim had four or five bludgeon wounds to the head, stab wounds {{in the chest and}} shoulder, and his throat had been slit, severing his windpipe. The man wore a shirt, waistcoat, socks, and a single glove; a search of the area yielded pantaloons and a coat. Authorities brought the body to town, where Captain John Bickley (whom Baker had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> to visit) identified it as Francis Baker.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 April, the 27th Infantry Division Savska was {{deployed}} around Koprivnica.

The 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, which had <b>been</b> <b>riding</b> from its mobilisation centre in Virovitica to Zagreb, was allocated to the 27th Infantry Division Savska to assist with establishing its forward defences, and was deployed with two artillery batteries between the outskirts of Koprivnica and Bregi.

The 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment had not yet arrived in Koprivnica, and the divisional cavalry squadron had reached as far as Ivanec. The majority of the 81st Cavalry Regiment, which were army-level troops, were on the road from Zagreb to Koprivnica, although its 1st Squadron, which had been transported to Koprivnica in cars on 7 April, was deployed as part of an outpost line forward of Koprivnica supporting the 1st Battalion of the 53rd Infantry Regiment.
