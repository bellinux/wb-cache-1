50|$|Collie has a {{significant}} role in the provision of electricity for Western Australia. There are two coal mines in the town and three power stations. The government of Western Australia will soon commission a new <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> for which a number of Collie base proposals have been made.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{a concerted effort}} has been in process to re-establish a new, larger, {{independent}} <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> near the original site of the old Colenso power station. With a substantial coal resource discovered near the town and with the gradual liberalising of the South African electric power generation industry, a modern coal technology power generation unit is planned.|$|E
5000|$|The {{award of}} the Malta LNG FSU project in April 2015 marks {{the entry of}} Bumi Armada in the {{floating}} LNG segment. The project consists in the conversion of a first generation MOSS carrier of 125,000m3 storage capacity into a Floating Storage Unit to be permanently moored by a jetty near the Delimara power station. The unit will deliver LNG on a continuous basis, without dry-docking interruption and during the entire project life of 18 years, to an onshore regasification plant feeding natural gas to the 400 MW <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
25|$|British Energy {{bought the}} 2,000 MWe Eggborough coal fired <b>station</b> from National <b>Power</b> in 2000 {{to provide a}} more {{flexible}} power production facility and reduce penalty charge risks from the New Electricity Trading Arrangements introduced in March 2001. Despite this, the new arrangements led to a significantly lower electricity price for inflexible <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> such as British Energy had. The purchase of Eggborough occurred {{at the peak of the}} market for <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> and in 2002 the value of the station was written down by half.|$|R
50|$|White Bluff Power Plant is a 1,480-megawatt <b>base</b> <b>load</b> {{coal-fired}} <b>power</b> <b>station</b> at Redfield, Arkansas, USA. It {{has one of}} {{the tallest}} chimneys in the world (305 meters), which was built in 1980.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, {{the current}} design of the {{electrical}} generating system {{may result in a}} surplus of electricity from <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> during off-peak periods, and storage heaters may then be able to make use of this surplus to increase the net efficiency of the system as a whole. However, future changes in supply and demand - for example as a result of energy conservation measures or a more responsive generating system - may then reverse this situation, with storage heaters preventing a reduction in the national <b>base</b> <b>load.</b> Other technologies may incorporate demand response electronics to sense when there is a change in supply and demand. Thereby, they ensure that these loads only use off-peak electricity. Further advances in supply technology could provide for a more bespoke 'supply and demand' tariff system to make smart grid sensing technologies like dynamic demand a more viable financial prospect.|$|R
50|$|These diesels can in {{some cases}} {{be up and running}} in {{parallel}} as quickly as two minutes, with no impact on the site (the office or factory need not shut down). This is far quicker than a <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> which can take 12 hours from cold, and faster than a gas turbine, which can take several minutes. Whilst diesels are very expensive in fuel terms, they are only used a few hundred hours per year in this duty, and their availability can prevent the need for base load station running inefficiently at part load continuously. The diesel fuel used is fuel that would have been used in testing anyway.|$|E
5000|$|The Neurath Power Station serves {{mainly as}} a <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> It {{consists}} of seven units (3 x 300 MW, 2 x 600 MW, and 2 x 1,100 MW nominally). Five older units were built between 1972 and 1976, {{and have a}} gross generation capacity of 2,200 MW. On 15 August 2012 two new 1,100 MW lignite-fired units - F and G, also known as BoA 2 and 3 - were added. BoA stands for Braunkohlekraftwerk mit optimierter Anlagentechnik (Lignite power station with optimized systems technology). The new units have an efficiency of 43% and the capability to adjust quickly to changes in energy demand. [...] Its engineering {{was carried out by}} Alstom, which was also the supplier of the steam turbines. The consortium that supplied steam generators was led by Babcock-Hitachi Europe GmbH. GEA Group built the cooling towers. Construction costs were â‚¬2.6 billion.|$|E

II n Reliability analysis of auxiliary electrical systems and generating units Boshu Liao and P. Massee A reliability analysis {{is applied to}} the auxiliary electrical system for a generating unit in a <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> Several designs for the auxiliary electrical system are possible and the only meaningful way to select the optimum design is by means of reliability indices. In this report the first step in this direction has been taken. In the analysis failures of all kinds of elements such as relays, motors, bus bars etc. are taken into account besides ageing of elements and preventive maintenance. Because of the fact that large motors are present in the system, this is sensitive to voltage dips and therefore the computerprogram REANIPOS has been used for the reliability analysis...|$|E

40|$|A study {{attempted}} to {{gain insight into}} the attitudes, perceptions and values of Perth inhabitants directed toward the environment. This document attempts to summarise the major findings drawn out {{in a series of}} more detailed reports generated at the conclusion of an initial study. Over 1300 responses were obtained to core questions investigating the significance of environmental management to these Western Australians. Ten specific areas received the attention of a proportionately smaller number of the public, and the literature, activities and policies of the relevant authorities were critically reviewed. These areas were the natural environment, air pollution, land degradation, toxic waste, water, urban waste, transport, energy, urban expansion, and economic incentives for guiding industry. The environment was perceived to be worsening in Perth, in Australia, and world-wide, and to exceed unemployment and economic issues as a problem in the near future. Land degradation is considered the most important environmental issue by Western Australians, although closely followed by pollution in an unspecified form while the more specific terms, air pollution and water pollution, are also considered important. Other environmental issues include our forests, ozone, urban waste, and the natural environment. A service gap model is advanced as an appropriate conceptual structure to examine the stewardship role that the government and its authorities have with respect to various areas of the environment. Education and information issues appear to be the major limitations in closing the service gap. One clear exception to this is the political motivation of the proposed coal-fired <b>base</b> <b>load</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> where the public sentiment away from the coal option is well founded in public understanding of the issue and well known to the government. This study confirmed this sentiment. The community acceptance of and involvement in major government programs associated with the issue of land degradation appears to be a case of effective focussing of community attention, with closure of a service gap. Although there is no clear understanding of more technical or 'invisible' concepts such as groundwater, {{there appears to be a}} strong intuitive feel for returning land to a forested state as a repairing process. The community often has only limited understanding of environmental issues. As a result, close but distinct issues, for example air pollution and toxic waste, can map together in respondents perceptions. In this situation, the individual tends to respond with a common level of concern be it high or low on both...|$|E
