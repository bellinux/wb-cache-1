60|$|The Wind blew very fresh, <b>but</b> <b>tacking</b> about {{too much}} to the North East, it drove us upon Shore with that {{violence}} that we were oblig'd to put in twice to Land, once at Scarborough, and again at Yarmouth.|$|E
5000|$|The Welshman Rhodri Mawr in AD 880 and his {{grandson}} Howell the Good in 945 are both {{known to have}} visited Rome {{towards the end of}} their lives, but it is not known whether they went by land or by the dangerous and pirate-infested sea route via Gibraltar. Reports of journeys before Sigeric can only be apocryphal. We may be quite certain that the Benedictine William of St-Thierry, used the roads towards Rome on several occasions {{at the end of the}} 11th century. The return journey by sea was likely to be easier, thanks to the prevailing south-westerly winds, <b>but</b> <b>tacking</b> down to the Mediterranean would have made a very long journey indeed. A statement that a historical figure [...] "died in Rome" [...] may have been a historical falsity, but a metaphorical truth.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have your}} wish, then; much, {{very much of}} my early life was passed on this dreaded coast. What to you is all {{darkness}} and gloom, to me is as light as if a noon-day sun shone upon it. <b>But</b> <b>tack</b> your ship, sir, tack your ship; I would see how she works before we reach {{the point where she}} must behave well, or we perish." ...|$|R
60|$|At four o'clock, having {{finished}} my report and dined with my client, I {{set out for}} Clarksville, for Mr. Crede had told me, among other things, that the General was there. Louisville was deserted, the tavern porch vacant; <b>but</b> <b>tacked</b> on the logs beside the door was a printed bill which drew my curiosity. I stopped, caught by a familiar name in large type {{at the head of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "He did, <b>but</b> he <b>tacked</b> {{a kind of}} {{condition}} on to it, and--well, that's {{about all}} I can tell you, Charley." ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as captain Truck {{arrived at}} the mouth of this passage, he felt so much {{encouraged}} by the appearance of things that he gave the concerted signal for the ship to veer round and to stand to the southward. This was losing ground in the way of offing, <b>but</b> <b>tack</b> the Montauk could not with so little wind, and the captain saw by the drift she had made since he left her, that promptitude was necessary. The ship might anchor off the inlet, as well as anywhere else, if reduced to anchoring outside at all, and then there was always the chance of entering.|$|R
60|$|Among sea-captains, {{there are}} some who seem to regard the genius of the Cape as a wilful, capricious jade, that must be courted and coaxed into complaisance. First, they come along under easy sails; do not steer boldly for the headland, <b>but</b> <b>tack</b> this way and that--sidling up to it, Now they woo the Jezebel with a t'-gallant-studding-sail; anon, they deprecate her wrath with double-reefed-topsails. When, at length, her unappeasable fury is fairly aroused, and all round the {{dismantled}} ship the storm howls and howls for days together, they still persevere in their efforts. First, they try unconditional submission; furling every rag and heaving to: laying like a log, for the tempest to toss wheresoever it pleases.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> {{finally she}} <b>tacked</b> to my right, and I raised my {{voice to the}} top of its power.|$|R
60|$|We {{gave the}} South a wider berth, for there the tide-race roared; <b>But</b> every <b>tack</b> we made we brought the North Head close aboard: So's {{we saw the}} cliffs and houses, and the {{breakers}} running high, And the coastguard in his garden, with his glass against his eye.|$|R
2500|$|... "The early steam battleships, {{such as the}} [...] Agamemnon, {{combined}} {{a measure}} of speed under sail or steam with similar manoeuvring powers to the sailing ships. [...] This persuaded Walker to try even longer hulls, the Renown being drawn out to [...] and the Bulwark [...] to [...] [...] While the post-war ships, from their greater length and finer lines, reached higher speeds they did so {{at the expense of}} the facility and precision of their response to the helm. [...] New ships such as the Donegal, 101 and Renown, 91 were considered slow in their stays. [...] This lack of handiness was emphasised by their operating in company with older ships such the St Jean d'Acre, 101 and James Watt, 91 which lacked speed, <b>but</b> <b>tacked</b> and wore far more easily. [...] Lord Aukland had anticipated this problem in 1847." ...|$|R
50|$|As a result, these {{additional}} matters {{were not included}} in the European Community; <b>but</b> were <b>tacked</b> on externally to the European Community in the form of two additional 'pillars'. The first additional pillar (Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP) dealt with foreign policy, security and defence issues, while the second additional pillar (JHA, Justice and Home Affairs), dealt with the remainder.|$|R
60|$|At times {{only one}} of the old birds would go a-fishing, while the other watched the nest. But when luck was poor both birds would seek the lake. At such times the mother bird, larger and {{stronger}} than the male, would fish along the shore, within sight and hearing of her little ones. The male, meanwhile, would go sweeping down the lake to the trout pools at the outlet, where the big chub lived, in search of better fishing grounds. If the wind were strong, you would see a curious bit of sea lore as he came back with his fish. He would never fly straight against the wind, <b>but</b> <b>tack</b> back and forth, as if he had learned the trick from watching the sailor fishermen of the coast beating back into harbor. And, watching him through your glass, you would see that he always carried his fish endwise and head first, so as to present the least possible resistance to the breeze.|$|R
50|$|Fluxes can be also {{prepared}} from synthetic resins, {{often based}} on esters of polyols and fatty acids. Such resins have improved fume odor and lower residue <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> their fluxing activity and solubility tend to be lower than of natural resins.|$|R
50|$|Drafting tape {{is similar}} to masking tape, <b>but</b> with lower <b>tack</b> {{adhesive}} so {{that it may be}} removed without damaging or leaving residue on paper or other delicate surfaces, and also has pH maintained at 7 so as not to damage the substrate.|$|R
5000|$|Like all pacific proas, {{they are}} always sailed with the {{outrigger}} to windward, they do not <b>tack</b> <b>but</b> [...] "shunt" [...] (reverse direction), so {{both ends of the}} boat are identical. The distinction between bow and stern depends only on the actual direction of the boat.|$|R
5000|$|A gennaker is a sail {{that was}} {{developed}} around 1990. Used when sailing downwind, it is {{a cross between a}} genoa and a spinnaker. It is not symmetric like a true spinnaker but is asymmetric like a genoa, but the gennaker is not attached to the forestay like a jib or genoa. The gennaker is rigged like a spinnaker <b>but</b> the <b>tack</b> is fastened to the hull or to a bowsprit. It has greater camber than a genoa (but significantly less camber than a spinnaker). This is optimal for generating lift at larger angles of attack. An early form of gennaker was the [...] "gollywhomper", used briefly in the 1870s.|$|R
6000|$|... “I knows {{but little}} of your small drink, Master Oliver,” {{returned}} the steward, his voice issuing {{out of the}} cave into the open air, “and the Jamaikey held out no longer than to take a parting kiss with Billy Kirby, when he anchored me alongside the highway last night, where you run me down in the chase. But here’s summat of a red color that may suit a weak stomach, mayhap. That Master Kirby is no first-rate in a boat; <b>but</b> he’ll <b>tack</b> a cart among the stumps, all the same as a Lon’on pilot will back and fill, through the colliers in the Pool.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Davy {{had been}} at last taught to say [...] "please," [...] <b>but</b> he {{generally}} <b>tacked</b> it on as an afterthought. He looked with approval at the generous slice Anne presently brought to him. [...] "You always put such a nice lot of butter on it, Anne. Marilla spreads it pretty thin. It slips down a lot easier when there's plenty of butter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{this means}} I got {{clear of the}} current {{and was able to}} steer within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the beach, which indeed I might have {{approached}} still nearer by making another <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> being an excellent swimmer, I deemed it best to leave the vessel, which was almost waterlogged, and to make the best of my way to the shore.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{the bark}} came so near {{that we could}} see the people on board, but still she went past us. This was the hardest to bear of all, for she seemed so near. <b>But</b> when she <b>tacked</b> and came back, she sailed right down to us. We could see her all the time now, whether we were up or down.|$|R
50|$|On September 30, while {{pitching}} for the Seattle Mariners {{against the}} Royals, Rick Honeycutt taped a thumbtack to {{his finger to}} cut the ball. Royals baserunner Willie Wilson spotted the tack from second base. The umpires investigated and not only found the <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> also a gash in Honeycutt's forehead. Honeycutt was ejected from the game, suspended for 10 games, and fined.|$|R
50|$|Jerry {{slides down}} to the ground and Tom chases him behind some pillars. Both cat and mouse start to poke their heads out from {{different}} pillars until Tom sees Jerry's back and tries to poke his behind with a <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> only hurts himself. Tom hits the top of the beam and falls to the ground. Jerry waves and whistles at the cat.|$|R
5000|$|September 30, 1980: While {{pitching}} for the Mariners {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Rick Honeycutt taped a thumbtack to {{his finger to}} cut the ball. Royals baserunner Willie Wilson spotted the tack from second base. The umpires investigated and not only found the <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> also a gash in Honeycutt's forehead. Honeycutt was ejected from the game, suspended for 10 games, and fined.|$|R
5000|$|With the Armistice {{declared}} in November 1918, the WRC was not demobilised <b>but</b> rather changed <b>tack</b> and began training women {{to work as}} commercial wireless operators - they believed wireless telegraphy was [...] "one {{of the most important}} of the many new careers open to women" [...] - as the US wireless stations nationalised during the war returned to private ownership.|$|R
6000|$|... '3. New Zealand {{is much to}} {{the east}} of Norfolk Island, and to go from the Loyalty, New Hebrides, Banks, and Santa Cruz groups to New Zealand, it is {{necessary}} to make a long stretch out to the N.E. (the trades blowing from about S.E. by E.), standing down to S. on the other <b>tack.</b> <b>But</b> Norfolk Island is almost due S. of other those groups.|$|R
60|$|Hilda {{smiled to}} herself--a quiet smile, half of disappointment, half of complacent {{feminine}} superiority. What a stupid fellow {{he was in}} some ways, after all! Even that silly Lord Connemara would have guessed what she was driving at, with only a quarter as much encouragement. But Ernest must be too much afraid of the social barrier clearly; so she began again, this time upon a slightly different <b>but</b> equally obvious <b>tack.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{were now}} working <b>tack</b> and <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> the Osprey was still {{improving}} her position, {{and as they}} neared St. Catherine's Head {{she was a good}} quarter of a mile to the good. Still Carthew maintained his good temper, but Bertha could see that it was with an effort. He seemed to pay but little attention to the sailing of the Phantom, but kept his eyes intently fixed upon the Osprey.|$|R
5000|$|The Prime Minister of Spain, Felipe González, {{cut short}} {{a visit to}} Brazil to return to Spain. He told reporters in Salvador, Brazil: [...] "This attack is of a {{different}} style {{than what we have}} seen to date. It is an attempt to force the Government to change <b>tack.</b> <b>But</b> we will not give in to indiscriminate violence. We shall continue fighting terrorism with all the means we have." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Proa: single mast with crab claw sail. The sail {{need not}} have a curved leech and may be {{identical}} to the sail above, with identical spars, sheet and halliard. But the sail is not <b>tacked</b> <b>but</b> shunted; the bow becomes the stern, and the mast rake is also reversed. The vessel therefore always has the ama (and sidestay, if there is one) to windward, and has no bad tack.|$|R
5000|$|Harzand {{returned}} on 10 September for the Irish Champion Stakes {{in which}} he was dropped in distance to ten furlongs and was matched against older horses. He started 2/1 favourite <b>but</b> after <b>tacking</b> the leaders he began to struggle three furlongs out and finished eighth behind the French colt Almanzor. A veterinary examination revealed that he had been [...] "struck into" [...] during the races, sustaining a minor injury to one of his hind legs. The colt recovered sufficiently to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Chantilly Racecourse on 2 October and started third favourite behind Postponed and Makahiki. Ridden as usual by Smullen he never looked likely to win and finished ninth of the sixteen runners behind Found.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amiss, quotha? Here am I {{with but}} half my mariners, and {{a hole in}} the ship where that twenty-devil stone struck us big enough to fit the fat widow of Northam through. It is well enough on this <b>tack,</b> <b>but</b> I would have you tell me what I am to do on the other. We are like to have salt water upon us until we be found pickled like the {{herrings}} in an Easterling's barrels." ...|$|R
60|$|The vessels, as they passed, {{exchanged}} broadsides. Then both <b>tacked,</b> <b>but</b> the Englishman was the quicker, and he raked the French frigate as {{she came}} round. Then they went at it hammer and tongs. The Frenchman suffered very heavily in spars and rigging, but at last the foremast of the English ship fell over her side. The Frenchman at once closed with her, and after pouring in a broadside, tried to board her.|$|R
60|$|They {{waited to}} see what this vessel was going to do. Perhaps she was only <b>tacking.</b> <b>But</b> what fool of a skipper would run {{so close to the}} shore for the sake of tacking! They watched her eagerly, but not one of the white men would have been wholly {{disappointed}} if the schooner, which they could now easily make out, had changed her course and gone off on a long tack to the southwest.|$|R
50|$|The {{cunningham}} {{differs from}} a typical downhaul {{in the way}} that it attaches to the sail. The system usually consists of a line which is secured at one end to the mast or boom below the foot of the mainsail. It is then passed through a cringle in the luff of the sail near the foot, <b>but</b> above the <b>tack,</b> and then led down on the other side to a fitting on the mast or boom or on deck.|$|R
5000|$|Given {{that the}} boat was {{designed}} for cruising comfort, rather than racing, the Beachcomber 6.5 sails very well and, in the 1980s were often well placed in club racing. When properly sailed they were surprisingly close winded for a bilge-keeler, particularly when fitted with the later keel design. In 1980, the late Tony Bouzaid designed a very tall, flat, long-luffed <b>but</b> short-footed self <b>tacking</b> Genoa, known as a [...] "Number 3 Jib", for the boat and this proved a highly successful windward sail.|$|R
50|$|Blacktop {{was educated}} at St Peter's College, Auckland {{where he was}} dux and head prefect in 1954. From there he went to medical school at Otago University <b>but</b> soon changed <b>tack,</b> {{returning}} to Auckland and in 1959 starting work as a law clerk at The Public Trust Office. Blacktop studied law part-time at the University of Auckland. He graduated in law in 1963 and was admitted {{in the same year}} to the Bar in the Supreme Court of New Zealand (now known as the High Court of New Zealand).|$|R
