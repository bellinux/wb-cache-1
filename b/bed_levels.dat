40|$|Bed level {{changes during}} a flood can have large {{influence}} on the safety against flooding and the navigational function of a river. In 1997 measurements were {{carried out in the}} Waal during a flood. These measurements present an average decrease of the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> in the order of 10 cm over a 10 km reach which is much larger than expected from the current morphological models. Two reasons for this <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> decrease are suggested: the unsteady sediment load and the influence of a measuring error. The goal of this thesis is to find the main processes which affect the average <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> during floods in rivers like the Waal. The maximum influence of the unsteady sediment load is estimated using multiple empirical relations for the bed load transport, the bed particle velocity and the suspended load transport. The analysis shows that the maximum change of the sediment load can cause a <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> change in the order of 0. 7 mm during the 1997 flood in the Waal. Therefore it is concluded that the influence of unsteady sediment load is too small to significantly affect the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> and to explain a 10 cm decrease of the <b>bed</b> <b>level.</b> The <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> measurements in the Waal during the 1997 flood were carried out with a single-beam echosounder. This means that the water depth is measured and that the water level is used to estimate the <b>bed</b> <b>level.</b> During the 1997 flood the water level was based on a linear interpolation between station Dodewaard, which is in the upstream part of the measuring reach, and measuring station TielWaal, which is downstream of the reach. In addition, the water level at station Dodewaard was not measured but estimated based on a regression relation. Both the linear interpolation and the regression relation are a source of inaccuracies. Therefore these water levels are compared to WAQUA-results for the 1997 flood and water level measurements during the 2011 flood. From this comparison is concluded that a combination of both sources of inaccuracies can be responsible for an average <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> decrease of 10 cm. The incorrect estimation of the water level is therefore assumed to be the main contributor to the large-scale <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> decrease during the 1997 flood in the Waal. The WAQUA-result of the 1997 flood is used to correct the <b>bed</b> <b>level.</b> The corrected measurements are compared with results from a Delft 3 D model. The model shows similar trends to the measured <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> but the quantitative differences are large. These large differences could be caused by the inaccuracies in the measurements or by the assumptions made in the Delft 3 D model. The model and the measurements show that the spatial variation of the river geometry has the largest {{influence on the}} <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> changes during floods. As a reference case the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> changes at the Pannerdensche Kop during the 1997 and the 1998 flood are studied. During neither of the floods the measured <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> shows a large-scale <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> change. However, local <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> variations are large and are caused by spatial variations of the river width. Therefore the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> measurements at the Pannerdensche Kop confirm that the spatial variation of the river geometry has a large influence on the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> changes during a flood. The main process which affects the average <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> in the Waal is the river geometry. The <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> measurements and the model result show that a spatial variation of the river width has a large effect on the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> during a flood. A new <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> measuring campaign has to be carried out to be able to validate the morphological models during floods.

This study applied a methodology {{to develop a}} quantitative gully pot sedimentation and blockage model. To this end, sediment bed level time series from 300 gully pots, spanning 15 months, were collected. A generalised linear mixed modelling (GLMM) approach was applied to model and quantify the accumulation of solids in gully pots and to identify relevant physical and catchment properties that influence the complex trapping processes. Results show that the retaining efficiency decreases as sediment <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> increase. Two typical silting evolutions were identified. Approximately 5 % of all gully pots experienced progressive silting, eventually resulting in a blockage. The other gully pots show stabilising sediment <b>bed</b> <b>levels.</b> The depth of the sand trap, elapsed time since cleaning and the road type were identified {{to be the main}} properties discriminating progressive accumulation from stabilising sediment <b>bed</b> <b>levels.</b> Furthermore, sediment <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> exhibit no residual spatial correlation, indicating that the vulnerability to a blockage is reduced as adjacent gully pots provide a form of redundancy.

The Froude Number of the approaching flow would be lower for the unequal bed weir than for an equal bed weir at the same submergence. 	Using one of the existing submerged flow formula would lead to an erroneous calculated value. A series of measurements was done on two model weirs of different sizes subject to successive levels of submergence.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{concerns}} the morphological (<b>bed</b> <b>level)</b> behaviour of the intertidal mudflat at Portishead on the Severn Estuary and discusses how the prevailing hydraulic and cohesive sediment processes contribute to bserved {{changes in the}} <b>bed</b> <b>level.</b> The characteristics of the mudflat behaviour d ing a fortnightly cycle is presented, based upon a continuous high resolution time series of the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> measured at one location during 31 tidal immersions. During spring tides the sediment supply to the mudflat is increased and the tidal-mean bed elevation is at least 10 mm higher following the peak of spring tides than on the previous or following neaps. On a tide by tide basis the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> varies by 10 - 20 mm and the preservation of fresh mud deposits on the intertidal area {{is controlled by the}} hydraulic onditions prevailing during the shallow water phase of the tide (less than 0. 5 m depth) and the processes operating during the dry part of the tide. Hence, the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> is controlled by the phasing of the tidal range (ambient sediment supply) with local water depth and wave activity. In comparison, on the annual timescale the <b>bed</b> <b>level</b> variation on the middle and upper mudflat is of the order of 100 mm and seasonal changes in storminess, ubaerial environment and biostabilization appear to play a significant role.

40|$|In shallow marine environments {{various types}} of bed forms emerge under waves and currents, {{producing}} {{various types of}} stratification. Harms et al. (1975) distinguished a nearly horizontally-bedded type of stratification associated to high-energy conditions, and named it hummocky cross-stratification (HCS). HCS is believed to form under highly energetic conditions by large bed forms: hummocks. Few studies have investigated their formation, and many aspects are still unclear. The objectives of this research are: to obtain {{the conditions under which}} they form, to study their similarities and differences with large wave ripples (LWR), and to predict their length. Methodology in this research consisted of two parts: 1) existing data was used and 2) new experiments in a large-scale wave flume were performed. Contrary to previous studies, this study provided both detailed data of bed level evolution and hydrodynamic conditions in a real-scale environment with known history. <b>Bed</b> <b>levels</b> were used to study the bed development and to determine the bed form length. The new observations were compared with existing data. A lacquer peel was taken from a large bed form and correlated with the measured <b>bed</b> <b>levels.</b> Based on phase diagrams no clear distinction between LWR and hummocks can be made. Both are observed around the inception of sheet flow, in different types of sediment and possibly superpositioned by a small current. Their dimensions also lie in the same region, and scale with the orbital diameter. LWR and hummocks are therefore the same phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|The major aims of {{this thesis}} are to {{determine}} the historical qualitative and quantitative reduction in water and <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> of the lower Waikato River, to identify probable factors influencing the reduction, and {{to predict the future}} water and <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> at Huntly in relation to the Huntly Power Station management Sediments in the Waikato River are composed of gravelly pumiceous sands. In terms of the mean and median grain sizes, generally sands dominate the lower river b~ from the river mouth to the cross section at about 100 km upstream of the mouth, while gravels dominate the bed upstream onward. A hiatus in the longitudinal mean and median grain size distributions from sand to gravel is apparent around Horotiu. In the Waipa River, the texture of bed materials was found to be similar but probably finer to those in the lower parts of the Waikato River. On the basis that ∂n / ∂Q= ∂W/ ∂Q =∂S / ∂Q= 0, where n, W, S and Q are, respectively, Manning's coefficient, width, energy slope and discharge, water level of each gauging can be adjusted to one for an index flow of 350 m³/s (WLQ₌₃₅₀). Further assuming that ∂n / ∂T = ∂W / ∂T = ∂S / ∂T= 0 where T is time, variations in the time series of WLQ₌₃₅₀ represent the mean bed level changes over time. These assumptions seem to be acceptable for those gauging data within a certain range of discharges in the lower Waikato River. A quantitative analysis of the available river survey data, water level profile measurements, and gauging records has indicated that, in general, there was a continuous trend of reduction in water and <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> on the lower Waikato River since the 1960 s. The reasons for these reductions likely include sand mining operation along the river, consequent disturbance of the river bed surface, long term sand extraction around Mercer and further downstream, upstream effects of the significant bed level lowering at Mercer, and downstream effects of the 1947 Karapiro Dam closure. Analysis of river bulk volume changes suggested that the amount of bedload transported into the river downstream of Ngaruawahia was about 160 000 ± 24 000 m 3 /yr between 1964 - 1989. Nearly two-thirds of this was contributed by the bed materials stored in the upstream Waikato River course by an analysis of data from 1974 - 1989, and the remainder by the Waipa River and the catchment yield from the Hamilton basin. Two disparate time scales for water and bedload movements in practice result in singularperturbation characteristics of the system. With a quasi-steady flow approach, linearization of the water and bedload movement system produces a hyperbolic equation or even a parabolic equation (uniform flow). The parabolic equation is a good approximation of the hyperbolic equation under the condition of large values of time or a large distance from the original disturbance. Variations along the Waikato River of an average mean bed level within a certain length of channel are expected to be small. Therefore the linear models can be applied. In the domain between 48. 25 - 94. 45 km upstream of the Waikato River mouth, the parabolic model has been used numerically to predict the future <b>bed</b> <b>levels</b> at Huntly in December 2040 for different scenarios. Potential effects on operation of the present cooling water system have been assessed for given discharges at that time. The ratio of river width to water depth for the formation of alternate bars at the Huntly Railway Bridge {{has been found to be}} exceeding 100 by an analysis of the gauging data at this site and at the Ngaruawahia Cableway. This critical width-depth ratio, 100, is much bigger than those suggested in the literature.
