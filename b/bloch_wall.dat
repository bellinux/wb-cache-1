40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{this article}} is to analyze the time {{asymptotic}} stabil-ity of one dimensional <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> in ferromagnetic materials. The equation involved in modelling such materials is the Landau-Lifchitz system which is non-linear and parabolic. We demonstrate that the equilibrium states called <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> are asymptotically stable modulo a rotation and a translation trans-verse to the wall. The linear part of the perturbed equation admits zero as an eigenvalue forbidding a direct proof. 1...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{between a}} <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> in a ferrite-garnet film and a vortex in a {{superconductor}} is analyzed in the London approximation. Equilibrium distribution of vortices formed around the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> is calculated. The results agree quantitatively with magneto-optical experiment where an in-plane magnetized ferrite-garnet film placed {{on top of}} NbSe 2 superconductor allows observation of individual vortices. In particular, our model can reproduce a counter-intuitive attraction observed between vortices and a <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> having the opposite polarity.

40|$|We {{consider}} the one-dimensional anisotropic XY {{model in the}} continuum limit. Stability analysis of its <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> solution is hindered by the nondiagonality of the associated linearised operator and the hessian of energy. We circumvent this difficulty by showing that the energy admits a Bogomolnyi bound in elliptic coordinates and that the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> saturates it [...] that is, the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> renders the energy minimum. Our analysis provides a simple but nontrivial application of the BPS (Bogomolnyi - Prasad - Sommerfield) construction in one dimension, where its use is often believed {{to be limited to}} reproducing results obtainable by other means.

40|$|We study {{interactions}} between the dark solitons of the parametrically driven nonlinear Schrödinger equation, Eq. (). When the driving strength, h, is below √(γ^ 2 + 1 / 9), two well-separated Néel walls may repel or attract. They repel if their initial separation 2 z(0) {{is larger than the}} distance 2 z_u between the constituents in the unstable stationary complex of two walls. They attract and annihilate if 2 z(0) is smaller than 2 z_u. Two Néel walls with h lying between √(γ^ 2 + 1 / 9) and a threshold driving strength h_sn attract for 2 z(0) 2 z_u. Finally, the Néel walls with h greater than h_sn attract and annihilate [...] irrespective of their initial separation. Two <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> of opposite chiralities attract, while <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> of like chiralities repel [...] except near the critical driving strength, where the difference between the like-handed and oppositely-handed walls becomes negligible. In this limit, similarly-handed walls at large separations repel while those placed at shorter distances may start moving in the same direction or transmute into an oppositely-handed pair and attract. The collision of two <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> or two nondissipative Néel walls typically produces a quiescent or moving breather. Comment: 46 pages, 23 figures. To appear in Phys Rev E.

40|$|In superconductor/ferromagnet hybrids, {{the stray}} field and inhomogeneous {{exchange}} field coming from magnetic domain walls have opposite {{influence on the}} superconductivity if the ferromagnet displays in-plane anisotropy. In this paper, we investigate modulation of superconductivity by the stray field of <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> in Nb/Y 3 Fe 5 O 12 hybrids where the proximity effect is excluded. By applying in-plane magnetic field, we show that the resistance {{as a function of}} magnetic field displays two dips precisely at the saturation field H-s of Y 3 Fe 5 O 12. The superconducting transition temperature T-c at H-s is higher than that at lower fields, suggesting the suppression of superconductivity by the stray fields of <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls.</b> By effective controlling of the domain walls, the superconductivity can be switched either on or off.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{analytical}} model for describing {{the motion of}} magnetic domain walls is the 1 -D model formulated based on {{the profile of a}} <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall.</b> This model qualitatively describes the motion of magnetic domain wall in nanowires, while it may fail to match experimental and numerical results quantitatively. In recent years, the 1 -D model has been further generalized by the introduction of terms such as spin transfer torques and spin orbit torques. It has also been used to describe the motion of different domain walls, including vortex walls. It seems that in many such attempts, formalisms are not followed accurately and the main assumptions of the model (such as the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> profile used in developing the model) are underestimated. In this paper, we first derive an {{analytical model}} to describe the motion of a tilting <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> in perpendicularly magnetized materials using four collective coordinates. We then compare the energy landscape predicted by this model to that of micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the possibility of using such comparisons to develop corrections for the 1 -D model...|$|E

These domain walls arise spontaneously and exhibit defects where <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> of different chirality join together. Two dynamic regimes are found: In the first one the vector field approaches a final homogeneous state, and in the other the walls are continually generated and annihilated.

40|$|The {{submicron}} magnetic {{structure of}} domain walls in a single‐crystal ironfilm {{has been studied}} using a magnetic force microscope(MFM). The MFM tip was sensitized to the component of the field perpendicular to the film plane. The sample examined was a 500 ‐nm‐thick single‐crystal film of iron,grown by molecular‐beam epitaxy(MBE). Before it was imaged, the film was magnetized along its (in‐plane) easy axis in a 2000 ‐Oe field. Studies of the domain structure at numerous locations on the filmsurface revealed a rich variety of micromagnetic phenomena. Parallel domain walls, determined to be <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls</b> with a width of 70 – 100 nm, were seen along the easy axis, spaced roughly 30 μm apart. These appeared to be <b>Bloch</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>Bloch</b> lines were also observed in the walls with an average periodicity of 1. 5 μm. This is a value smaller than that predicted for Bloch wall‐line structures. In addition, a pronounced zig–zag structure was observed, as expected from previous Fe whisker observations.

40|$|Current-induced {{magnetic}} domain wall motion, induced by transfer of spin transfer effect due to exchange interaction, {{is expected to}} be useful for next generation high-density storages. We here show that efficient domain wall manipulation can be achieved by introduction of Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which induces spin precession of conduction electron and acts as an effective magnetic field. Its effect on domain wall motion depends on the wall configuration. We found that the effect is significant for <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> with the hard axis along the current, since the effective field works as β or field-like term and removes the threshold current if in extrinsic pinning is absent. For Néel wall and <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> with easy axis perpendicular to Rashba plane, the effective field induces a step motion of wall corresponding to a rotation of wall plane by the angle of approximately π at current lower than intrinsic threshold. Rashba interaction would therefore be useful to assist efficient motion of domain walls at low current...|$|E
40|$|The {{model of}} the {{potential}} function V(x), for the hysteresis cycles in a weak field of a ferromagnetic sample, demagnetized by an alternating field, leads to Rayleigh's laws. In {{the case of a}} thermal demagnetization, the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall</b> may be present in every well of V(x), and the domain structure is initially metastable. Considering all configurations where we can find the <b>Bloch</b> <b>wall,</b> in Néel's formulation, we study the effect of a magnetic field on such a domain structure. We show that Rayleigh's laws should no longer hold and that, for instance, the first remanence should vary with the amplitude of the cycle as the sum of a linear and a quadratic term. The structure is stabilized when the first cycle is over, but the limit cycle is shifted to the side where the field is applied initially.
