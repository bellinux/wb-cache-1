40|$|Abstract A {{selective}} lumbosacral nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> {{is generally}} is performed under X-ray fluoroscopy, {{which has the}} disadvantage of radiation exposure {{and the need for}} fluoroscopy equipment. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of ultrasound and nerve stimulation-guided S 1 nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> on 37 patients with S 1 radicular syn-drome. With the patient in a prone position, an ultrasound scan was performed by placing the probe parallel to the body axis. The needle was pointed slightly medial from the lateral side of the probe and advanced toward a hyper-echoic area in the sacral foramina with ultrasound guid-ance. Contrast medium was then injected and its dispersion confirmed by fluoroscopy. The acquired contrast images were classified into intraneural, perineural, and paraneural patterns. The significance of differences in the effect of the block among the contrast image patterns was analyzed. After nerve block, decreased sensation at the S 1 innervated region and pain relief was achieved in all patients. No significant difference was noted in the effect of the block between perineural and paraneural patterns. In conclusion, this technique provided reliable S 1 nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> in patients with S 1 radicular syndrome and minimized radi-ation exposure...|$|R

Several investigators have independently documented the reliability and safety of local anesthesia in eliminating the pain associated with circumcision. Investigations have not, however, been conducted to determine which technique is most effective in reducing {{the pain of the}} procedure. This study compares the techniques of local anesthesia for circumcision to determine which technique most safely and reliably reduces pain.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although {{diagnostic}} lumbar selective nerve <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> {{are often}} used to confirm the pain-generating nerve root level, the reported accuracy of these blocks has been variable and their usefulness is controversial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic lumbar selective nerve <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> to analyze potential causes of false results in a prospec-tive, controlled, single-blinded manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 105 block anesthetics were performed under fluoroscopic guidance in 47 consecutive patients with pure radiculopathy from a single confirmed level: 47 blocks were performed at the symptomatic level, and 58 were performed at the adjacent asymptomatic “control ” level. Contrast and local anesthetics were injected, and spot radiographs were taken in all cases. We calculated the diagnostic value of the block anesthetics using concordance with the injected level. We analyzed the potential causes of false results using spot radiographs.

40|$|Since {{many years}} we {{routinely}} use diagnostic selective nerve <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> (SNRB) at our department when evaluating patients with cervical radiculopathy. Frequently patients who also presented with headache {{reported that the}} headache disappeared when the nerve root responsible for the radicular pain was blocked with local anaesthetics. Headache {{has been described as}} a companioning symptom related to cervical radiculopathy but has never before been evaluated with SNRB performed in the lower cervical spine. For this reason we added to our routine an evaluation of the response from the SNRB on headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The aim was to describe the frequency of headache in patients with cervical radiculopathy and its response to a selective nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> of the nerve root/roots responsible for the radiculopathy. Can nerve root compression in the lower cervical spine produce headache? In this consecutive series of 275 patients with cervical radiculopathy, 161 patients reported that they also suffered from daily or recurrent headache located most often unilaterally on the same side as the radiculopathy. All patients underwent a careful clinical examination by a neurosurgeon and a MRI of the cervical spine. The significantly compressed root/roots, according to the MRI, underwent SNRB with a local anaesthetic. The effect of the nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> on the radiculopathy and the headache was carefully noted and evaluated by a physiotherapist using visual analogue scales (VAS) before and after the SNRB. All patients with headache had tender points in the neck/shoulder region on the affected side. Patients with headache graded significantly more limitations in daily activities and higher pain intensity in the neck/shoulder/arm than patients without headache. After selective nerve <b>root</b> <b>block,</b> 59 % of the patients with headache reported 50 % or more reduction of headache and of these 69 % reported total relief.

40|$|Summary: CT {{fluoroscopy}} {{may be used}} as a {{rapid and}} effective means of guiding needle placement when perform-ing selective lumbar nerve <b>root</b> <b>blocks.</b> In this set of pa-tients, the average external radiation dose was 0. 73 mrem per procedure, with an average of 2 seconds of CT-fluoros-copy time and four images per procedure. Average physi-cian room time was 7 minutes. Use of intermittent CT fluoroscopy during lumbar selective nerve <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> can result in minimal radiation dose levels and procedure times that are comparable to fluoroscopic guidance. Selective lumbar nerve <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> (SNRB) have long been a staple of anesthesiologists and orthopedic surgeons, but have been increasingly performed by neuroradiologists and interventional radiologists (1). Initially performed by using deep and surface ana-tomic landmarks and a large amount of local anes-thetic, the procedures were not very specific. Fluoro-scopic guidance increased the accuracy of needle placement, and thus the specificity of the examina-tion, and is still used by many practitioners. Numer-ous articles have described and advocated CT guid-ance for SNRB, citing the excellent visualization of the nerve root, ganglion, and surrounding structures, thus allowing precise placement of the needle tip without the use of iodinated contrast medium (2 – 4). One disadvantage often cited by opponents of CT guidance is the increased physician time involved in the procedure, as opposed to fluoroscopic guidance. Low-dose CT fluoroscopy is a relatively new tech-nique that allows rapid imaging during needle place-ment while the operator is standing at the bedside, dramatically reducing the procedure time while re-taining the benefits of CT guidance. This study eval-uates operator time, fluoroscopic time, and radiation dose of CT fluoroscopic-guided lumbar SNRB...|$|R

Peri-radicular infiltration of corticosteroids has previously been shown to offer no additional benefit in patients with sciatica compared to local anaesthetic alone. It is not known if the response to peri-radicular infiltration is less marked in certain subgroups of patients such as those with radicular pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis. Previous studies have suggested that peri-radicular infiltration of corticosteroids may obviate the need for subsequent interventions and we therefore further investigated this in the current study. We randomised 150 patients to receive a single injection with either bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine and methylprednisolone. Patients were assessed at 6  weeks and 3  months after the injection using standard outcome measures including Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analogue score for leg pain and patient’s subjective assessment of outcome. At 1 -year follow-up, we looked at the outcome in terms of the need for subsequent interventions such as additional <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> or surgery. At 3 -month follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the standard outcome measures between the two injection groups. At a minimum 1 -year post injection, there was no difference in the need for subsequent interventions in either group. Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis had a less marked reduction in the ODI at 3  months with a mean change of 3. 3 points when compared with 15 points for patients with lumbar disc herniation. In conclusion, peri-radicular infiltration of corticosteroids for sciatica does not provide any additional benefit when compared to local anaesthetic injection alone.

The most serious complications {{that have been}} reported include cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, transient quadriplegia and death. Case presentation A 40 -year-old Japanese woman {{with a history of}} severe right-sided cervical radicular pain was scheduled to undergo a right-sided C 6 selective cervical nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> using a transforaminal approach under fluoroscopic guidance. An anterior oblique view of the C 5 -C 6 intervertebral foramen was obtained, and a 23 -gauge spinal needle, connected to the normal extension tube with a syringe filled with contrast medium, was introduced into the posterior-caudal aspect of the C 5 -C 6 intervertebral foramen on the right side. In the anteroposterior view, the placement of the needle was considered satisfactory when it was placed no more medial than halfway across the width of the articular pillar. Although the spread of the contrast medium along the C 6 nerve root was observed with right-sided C 6 radiculography, the subdural flow of the contrast medium was not observed with real-time fluoroscopy. The extension tube used for the radiculography was removed from the spinal needle and a normal extension tube with a syringe filled with lidocaine connected in its place. We performed a negative aspiration test and then injected 1. 5 [*]mL of 1. 0 % lidocaine slowly around the C 6 nerve root. Immediately after the injection of the local anesthetic, our patient developed acute flaccid paralysis, complained of breathing difficulties and became unresponsive; her respiratory pattern was uncoordinated. After 20 minutes, she regained consciousness and became alert, and her muscle strength in all four limbs returned to normal without any sensory deficits after receiving emergent cardiorespiratory support. Conclusions We believe that confirming maintenance of the appropriate needle position in the anteroposterior view by injecting local anesthetic is important for preventing central needle movement. Because the potential risk of serious complications cannot be completely eliminated during the use of any established selective cervical nerve <b>root</b> <b>block</b> procedure, preparation for an emergency airway, ventilation and cardiovascular support is indispensable in cases of high spinal cord anesthesia. </p...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Adhesion to {{root canal}} dentin {{is one of}} the {{necessary}} characteristics of endodontic sealers. MTA Fillapex (Angelus, Londria, PR, Brazil) {{is one of the}} recently introduced MTA-based sealer. Only a limited number of studies have evaluated the bonding of this sealer to the dentin, with conflicting results. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the bond strength of MTA Fillapex sealer) to root canal dentin compared to an epoxy resinbased sealer (AH 26 sealer). Materials and Methods: Twenty <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> (6 mm length) were acquired from the middle part of the extracted single-rooted central or lateral maxillary incisor roots and their lumens were enlarged to achieve a diameter of 1. 3 mm. MTA Fillapex and AH 26 were placed in the lumens of <b>root</b> <b>blocks</b> (n = 10). The specimens were kept in an incubator for 7 days, the roots were sectioned perpendicular to their long axis to achieve slices with thickness of 1 mm and the push-out test was carried out by a universal testing machine. Results: The mean value of bond strength was 1. 84 ± 0. 7 Mpa for AH 26 and 0. 19 ± 0. 1 Mpa for MTA Fillapex. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: With in the limitation of this study, AH 26 showed significantly higher bond strength in comparison to MTA Fillapex...|$|R
