The focus is to investigate amplifiers with regard to two contextual factors known to affect the use of amplifiers: amplifier type (both maximizers and <b>boosters)</b> and <b>amplifiers</b> used to intensify adjectives as it has been shown by several studies that most amplifiers are used with adjectival heads. The sociolinguistic variable tested in this study is the difference between registers in amplifier use. To answer the present study's questions, several steps were followed. First, a pilot study was run for the whole corpus and for each register to search for {{the most frequently used}} amplifiers. Second, a list of the frequencies of the ten most frequently used amplifiers in each register was created for comparison. Third, a final list of the most frequently used amplifiers in all registers in COCA was set for further analysis. The results gained from the present study suggest that the more formality of the register increases, less intensification is used. It is also found that the more frequency increases in a register, less versatility in the use of different amplifiers is found. Furthermore, this study shows that there is a fixed pattern of boosters being most frequently used in all registers in COCA, and that very so and really are still the most prevailing boosters in American English.

To avoid damage and nonlinear-effect issues, passive divided pulse amplification is studied {{for the first}} time for bulk-amplifier. Great efforts have been deployed in the development of laser systems delivering femtosecond pulses for industrial and scientific applications. Among all available technologies, fiber lasers came out {{as one of the best}} choice due to their capability to deliver short pulse duration (typically 300 to 500 fs) together with high average power within very reliable and robust systems. Nevertheless, one of the main drawbacks remains the limited output energy available for such laser due to the strong confinement of the light. Standard femtosecond fiber lasers can deliver typically up to 10 s µJ energy pulses; and lasers based on rod type technology allow to reach up to the mJ level for laboratory systems [1 - 2] and 200 µJ for industrial systems. We propose here to enhance the energy from fiber sources by implementing a very simple, but optimized, Yb doped YAG booster stage. This booster consists in using a cm-long crystal to have a simple high gain booster together with a rather-modest length to prevent from deleterious nonlinear effects like self-phase modulation and critical self-focusing. Secondly, the use of a simple and passive divided pulse amplification (DPA) setup [3] is also investigated, in order to exceed the energy limitation. We investigate how the DPA permits to overcome the laser threshold limits from 2. 9 mJ to 4. 1 mJ.

In this work, we report on the use of SCF amplifier for the amplification of femtosecond pulses in master oscillator power amplifier configuration to achieve high energy / high average power pulses in view of high speed material processing (surface structuring, drilling) with radial or azimuthal polarization. In preliminary studies, we demonstrate a two stages diode-pumped Yb:YAG single crystal fiber amplifier to achieve femtosecond pulses at an average power of 70 W at 20 MHz. Abstract (250 mots) Diode-pumped Yb-doped solid-state lasers implemented in Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) configuration clearly dominate the field of high-average power pulsed laser. Thanks to a very efficient thermal management and a high overlap between pump and signal beams brought by the pump guiding, the single-crystal-fiber (SCF) technology has recently shown strong potentialities for the amplification of ultrashort pulses. In this work, we present the use of Yb:YAG SCF (1 % Yb doped 1 mm diameter, 40 mm long) for high average power amplification. As a seed, we used a passively-modelocked Yb-based laser delivering ultra-short pulses at 20 MHz with an average power of 1, 5 W and a duration of 360 fs at 1031 nm. The SCF amplifier consists in two double-pass stages based on SCF (Taranis modules). The first amplification stage is pumped by a high brightness fiber-coupled laser diode producing 120 W at 940 nm. After a double-pass, the output power is multiplied by 10, reaching 15 W of average power. The second amplification stage consists in a double-pass <b>booster</b> <b>amplifier</b> pumped by a high power fiber-coupled laser diode producing 200 W at 969 nm to lower the thermal load.

Optimized length and doping rate of each SCF and different experimental configurations are under study to increase the performances. Furthermore, using a polarization converter, the amplification of radially and azimuthally polarized beam will be investigated in order to achieve high-energy cylindrically polarized femtosecond pulses needed for high-speed material processing applications (surface structuring, drilling) ...|$|E

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{fatigue testing}} machine {{was developed to}} obtain the very high cycle fatigue life at elevated temperature for 	safety and reliability of structural components in the faster breeder reactor (FBR). This testing machine consists of an 	<b>amplifier,</b> <b>booster,</b> horn and equipments such as a system controller and data acquisition. The test specimen is attached at 	the end of the horn. The electric power generated in the amplifier is transformed into the mechanical vibration in the 	converter and is magnified in the booster and horn. The developed ultrasonic fatigue testing machine enables to carry out 	the fatigue test at 20 kHz {{so that it can}} perform the very high cycle fatigue test within a very shorter time as compared with the 	regular fatigue testing machines such as a hydraulic fatigue testing machine. This study carried out very high cycle fatigue 	tests using type STBA 24, the steel for tube in boiler and heat exchanger, at room and elevated (673 K) temperatures by the 	developed testing and conventional hydraulic testing machines, and obtained the fatigue lives. This paper also described the 	cracks observed on specimen surface of fatigued specimen and discussed the very high cycle fatigue strength properties. It 	was confirmed that the fatigue data obtained by the ultrasonic fatigue testing machine are continuous and compatible with the 	results obtained by the hydraulic tension-compression testing machine. Fatigue lives more than 106 cycles at room and high 	temperatures can be predicted conservatively by the best fit design curve employed in the nuclear power plant design...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the research {{work that has}} been carried out on O-band transmission windows as support to the saturated optical fiber transmission windows. O-band is selected based on advantages it offer including operational cost effectiveness, low absorption coefficient, low dispersion wavelength range and operated with existence system. The aim of this research work is to investigate the components {{that could be used in}} developing O-band as transmission windows. The components studied in this research work are the optical amplifiers and multiwavelength fiber laser as the transmitter. The optical amplifiers are Bismuth doped fiber amplifier (BiDFA), O-band Raman fiber <b>amplifier</b> (RFA) and <b>Booster</b> optical <b>amplifier</b> (BOA). The BiDFA produce low amplification (2 dB) but high nonlinearity coefficient measured to be 13. 98 W- 1 km- 1 utilizing the four wave mixing (FWM) effect. The RFA was tested with 4 different types of fiber, where dispersion compensated fiber (DCF) shows the highest amplification performance with gain of 12 dB for single pass configuration and 14 dB for double pass at 1330 nm signal wavelength. The BOA is an improved version of semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) capable to amplify up to 28 dB and 31 dB at 1350 nm for single pass and double pass configuration respectively. The optical amplifier is not only use as the amplifier but also to support the process of generating multiwavelength fiber laser (MWFL). Three techniques demonstrated in this thesis include; multiwavelength Brillouin fiber laser (MWBFL), Sagnac loop mirror (SLM) and Fabry Perot Interferometer. The MWFL was demonstrated by various configurations to investigate the performance including its peak power flatness and tune ability. The MWBFL generated from nonlinear effect of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). The Brillouin threshold power required to generate SBS in O-band is less than threshold of C-band. The MWBFL demonstrated in 2 different cavites namely linear cavity and ring cavity. Both cavities produce 4 Stokes with the linear cavity giving a iii closed spacing of 12. 5 GHz while ring cavity 25 GHz. Inserting BOA in the multi pass linear configuration induce nonlinearity and hence produces 3 anti-Stokes signals. The flatness of MWBFL achieved via 2 techniques namely by in cooperate the BiDF in the cavity to provide FWM effects and by relocating the BOA. The spacing tunability for MWBFL is limited to two spacing 12. 5 GHz and 25 GHz. Sagnac loop mirror were also demonstrated in linear and ring cavity, where the linear cavity provide stable and more number of channels (16). The uniformity of MWFL via SLM was provided by the nonlinearity of BIDF. The tunability of the SLM is controlled by the length of polarization maintaining fiber (PMF). The FPI was only demonstrated in linear configuration. The spacing generated was double of SLM with the same length of PMF. The uniformity of peak power was also improved by the incorporation of BiDF. The tunability is achieved by controlling the polarization state. The spacing varied from 5. 0 nm to 1. 25 nm with 4 m PMF...|$|R
