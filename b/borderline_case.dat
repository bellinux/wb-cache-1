Four names were changed: Nonneseteren from Jernbanen, Florida from Strømmen, Brann stadion from Nymark and Hop from Troldhaugen. Brann stadion and Troldhaugen were afterwards considered by the municipal administration, because they could be in violation of the Place Name Act. The general rule is to use the place name where the station is located, and naming after institutions or facilities nearby is not permitted unless they are in the immediate vicinity.

2500|$|Although it is {{frequently}} considered {{as an example}} of communist genocide, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan represents a <b>borderline</b> <b>case,</b> according to Frank Wayman and Atsushi Tago. Prior to the Soviet invasion, the PDPA executed between 10,000 and 27,000 people, mostly at Pul-e-Charkhi prison. [...] After the invasion in 1979, the Soviets installed the puppet government of Babrak Karmal, but it was never clearly stabilized as a communist regime and was {{in a constant state of}} war. By 1987, about 80% of the country's territory was permanently controlled by neither the pro-Communist government (and supporting Soviet troops) nor by the armed opposition. To tip the balance, the Soviet Union used a tactic that was a combination of [...] "scorched earth" [...] policy and [...] "migratory genocide": by systematically burning the crops and destroying villages in rebel provinces, as well as by reprisal bombing of entire villages suspected of harbouring or supporting the resistance, the Soviets tried to force the local population to move to the Soviet controlled territory, thereby depriving the armed opposition of their support. [...] By the time the Soviets withdrew in 1988, 1 to 1.5 million people had been killed, mostly Afghan civilians, and one-third of Afghanistan's population had been displaced. M. Hassan Kakar argued that [...] "the Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower." [...] Mass graves of executed prisoners have been exhumed dating back to the Soviet era.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new theory}} of higher-order vagueness. This theory is an improvement on current theories of vagueness in that it (i) describes the kind of <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> relevant to the Sorites paradox, (ii) retains the ‘robustness’ of vague predicates, (iii) introduces a notion of higher-order vagueness that is compositional, but (iv) avoids the paradoxes of higher-order vagueness. The theory’s central building-blocks: Borderlinehood is defined as radical unclarity. Unclarity is defined by means of competent, rational, informed speakers (‘CRISPs’) whose competence, etc., is indexed to {{the scope of the}} unclarity operator. The unclarity is radical since it eliminates clear cases of unclarity and, that is, clear <b>borderline</b> <b>cases.</b> This radical unclarity leads to a (bivalence-compatible, non-intuitionist) absolute agnosticism about the semantic status of all <b>borderline</b> <b>cases.</b> The corresponding modal system would be a non-normal variation on S 4 M...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To compare {{soft tissue}} changes in Class I <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> treated with {{extraction}} and nonextraction modalities. Methods: A parent sample of 150 patients with Class I dental and skeletal malocclusion (89 patients treated with premolar extraction and 61 patients without extraction) was randomly selected {{and subjected to}} discriminant analysis which identified the borderline sample of 44 patients (22 extraction and 22 nonextraction patients). Pretreatment and post-treatment cephalograms of the borderline subsample were analyzed using 22 soft tissue parameters. Results: Upper and lower lips were more retracted and thickness of the upper lip increased more in the <b>borderline</b> extraction <b>cases</b> (p < 0. 01). The nasolabial angle became more obtuse and the interlabial gap was reduced in the <b>borderline</b> extraction <b>cases</b> (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Vagueness can be {{narrowly}} conceived or broadly conceived. Paradigmatic {{features of}} narrow vagueness include its susceptibility to sorites paradoxes, {{as well as}} the presence of <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> (cases where we’d like to say that it’s vague whether Patchy is red, for example). Borderline or vague predica-tions are usually thought of as examples of a more general phenomenon, vagueness in the broad sense or indeterminacy. Indeterminacy has all sorts of instances that aren’t obviously associated with sorites series. This article highlights two puzzles arising from these commonplaces. The first puzzle concerns the hypothesis that there is a unified phenomenon of indeterminacy. How are we to reconcile this with the apparent diversity of reactions that indeterminacy prompts? The second puzzle focuses narrowly on <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> of vague predicates.

40|$|Spatially {{discrete}} difference approximations for hyperbolic initial-boundary-value problems (IBVPs) require numerical {{boundary conditions}} {{in addition to}} the analytical boundary conditions specified for the differential equations. Improper treatment of a numerical boundary condition can cause instability of the discrete IBVP even though the approximation is stable for the pure initial-value or Cauchy problem. In the discrete IBVP stability literature there exists a small class of discrete approximations called <b>borderline</b> <b>cases.</b> For nondissipative approximations, <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> are unstable according to the theory of the Gustafsson, Kreiss, and Sundstrom (GKS) but they may be Lax-Richtmyer stable or unstable in the L sub 2 norm on a finite domain. It is shown that borderline approximation can be characterized by the presence of a stationary mode for the finite-domain problem. A stationary mode has the property that it does not decay with time and a nontrivial stationary mode leads to algebraic growth of the solution norm with mesh refinement. An analytical condition is given which makes it easy to detect a stationary mode; several examples of numerical boundary conditions are investigated corresponding to <b>borderline</b> <b>cases...</b>|$|R

The issue is based on a socio-psychological perspective, in a combination with economics and it takes shape in the use of qualitative methods. The study uses interviews, such as semi-structured interview as well as interview of a focus group. To illuminate this issue, some of Michel Foucaults concepts will be used, as well as a review of Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunsteins definition of the phenomenon Nudge.
