5|$|A {{report was}} {{approved}} by Brampton City Council during a council meeting on August 16, 1993. The report suggested that in British Columbia, such sculptures are frequently displayed outdoors. As Chinguacousy Park bears an Aboriginal name, it was deemed appropriate for the sculpture to be used {{at the entrance of}} the nearby area. It was to be <b>bolted</b> to a 1.5-metre high (five-foot high) tree stump.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly <b>bolted.</b> As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted on}} a variety of <b>bolt</b> types to examine the load transfer capacities of different profiled <b>bolts</b> in short encapsulation push testing. A 70 mm section of 150 mm long <b>bolt</b> specimen was anchored in a 70 mm long stainless steel tube using full resin encapsulation. Six types of different profiled <b>bolts</b> and two non - profiled <b>bolts</b> were tested. <b>Bolts</b> with higher profile were in general found to have greater shearing resistance and higher stiffness than low profile <b>bolts.</b> Widely spaced profiles allow greater displacement at peak shear strength, and <b>bolts</b> with no profiles produced very little load transfer capability. Rough surfaced plain <b>bolts</b> showed a significant load transfer capability in comparison to a factory supplied smooth surface <b>bolt</b> which supports the belief that rusted <b>bolts</b> have higher load transfer capability that un-rusted <b>bolt</b> surfaces...|$|R
25|$|At this point, the <b>bolt</b> {{is locked}} into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the <b>bolt</b> carrier backward a short distance. As the <b>bolt</b> carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the <b>bolt</b> cam pin, riding in a slot on the <b>bolt</b> carrier, forces the <b>bolt</b> to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the <b>bolt</b> is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the <b>bolt</b> carrier. The <b>bolt's</b> rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the <b>bolt's</b> spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
5|$|Artificial {{climbing}} {{walls are}} used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then <b>bolted</b> onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} well {{respected}} in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained <b>bolted</b> until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece <b>bolt</b> assembly {{consists of a}} breech (<b>bolt</b> head) and <b>bolt</b> carrier. The <b>bolt</b> is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the <b>bolt</b> head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and <b>bolt</b> carrier which begin to withdraw while the <b>bolt</b> head slowly moves rearward {{in relation to the}} <b>bolt</b> carrier. As the <b>bolt</b> carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the <b>bolt</b> head is caught by the <b>bolt</b> carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. The <b>bolt</b> also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the <b>bolt</b> from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the <b>bolt</b> while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling <b>bolt).</b>|$|R

The main frames were <b>bolted</b> onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave {{a speech}} nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not {{receptive}} to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters <b>bolted</b> the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the Progressive Party. This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E
5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was <b>bolted</b> together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>bolt</b> head type {{includes}} a different means of cartridge ejection. The push-feed <b>bolt</b> heads utilize a plunger-type ejector {{mounted in the}} <b>bolt</b> face.The controlled-round-feed <b>bolt</b> heads have a relief cut for a receiver-mounted, spring-loaded folding ejector to pass through as the <b>bolt</b> is retracted.|$|R
50|$|CMMG {{introduced}} the Mk 45 Guard rifle incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses {{the rotation of}} the <b>bolt</b> head to accelerate the <b>bolt</b> carrier of an AR-15 pattern rifle. The <b>bolt</b> locking lugs are adapted to incorporate angles that rotate the <b>bolt</b> as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the <b>bolt</b> rotates, it must accelerate the <b>bolt</b> carrier to the rear through an adapted cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the <b>bolt</b> carrier, slowing the speed of the <b>bolt</b> head. This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier <b>bolt</b> carrier assembly. The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the <b>bolt</b> carrier moving at a faster rate than the <b>bolt</b> head to delay the action from opening.|$|R
50|$|While {{it would}} be simpler and easier to shorten the <b>bolt</b> to fit {{completely}} behind the breech, the <b>bolt</b> must have {{a certain amount of}} mass in order to operate reliably with a given caliber. The telescoping <b>bolt</b> moves some of that mass forward of the <b>bolt</b> face, resulting in a <b>bolt</b> which is longer overall, but is shorter behind the <b>bolt</b> face.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked in the structure, which he <b>bolted</b> shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E

5000|$|On used bolt-action firearms, especially, the {{headspace}} {{should be}} checked with headspace gauges prior to shooting to ensure it is correct, {{and to prevent}} over-stressing chambers and cartridge brass. Some bolt-action rifles, such as the Lee-Enfield, {{have a series of}} different length <b>bolts</b> available to extend the service life of the rifle, for taking up any wear of the <b>bolt</b> and chamber occurring from long years of service. In the case of the No. 4 Lee-Enfield <b>bolt,</b> the <b>bolt</b> heads themselves are replaceable separate from the <b>bolt</b> and are marked 0, 1, 2, or 3, with each <b>bolt</b> head in sequence being nominally 0.003" [...] longer than the <b>bolt</b> head numbered one less, for easily taking up any action stretching that may have occurred. It is possible to replace such a <b>bolt</b> head without tools by disassembling the <b>bolt</b> from the action, unscrewing the <b>bolt</b> head, and replacing the <b>bolt</b> head with the next higher number <b>bolt</b> head, for restoring a safe headspace.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to perform a {{statistical}} analysis on how rockbolts are placed using different machines. There are three different methods that are used today when mounting a rock <b>bolt.</b> These three methods are: 1. From a <b>bolt</b> rig using a <b>bolt</b> angle identification tool 2. From a <b>bolt</b> rig without using <b>bolt</b> angle identification tool 3. Manual <b>bolting,</b> i. e. drilling holes of the <b>bolt</b> using a regular drilling rig. Then placing the <b>bolts</b> by handfrom a platform. Data is collected by measuring the angle and distance between different <b>bolts.</b> Angle and distance is measured on the drill steel used to drill the holes. Almost all data have been collected by taking measurements using a total station, except for the data underlaying the analysis of manual <b>bolting.</b> The underlying data from manual <b>bolting</b> are recorded drill holes from the drilling rigs used. The data is then processed mainly in the programs: AutoCAD and Microsoft Office Excel. From here, angles, distances and directions could be calculated. The results indicate that <b>bolting</b> performed from <b>bolting</b> rigs with a angle identification tool are of best quality. On average the deviation for the <b>bolt</b> angle was 5, 4 degrees. The deviation from a specified pattern (distance) was only 0, 033 meters in both directions (inside rows, and between two different rows). All distance measurement are made using the CC-distance. The above should be compared with <b>bolting</b> that are made without a angle identification tool, here is the deviation of <b>bolt</b> direction on average 9, 26 degrees. The deviation from a specified <b>bolt</b> pattern is 0. 072 meters.

5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost {{completely}} different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks <b>bolted</b> onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and <b>bolted</b> the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop.

5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a two-party system, but had only contempt for those who <b>bolted</b> the Republican Party to join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.|$|E
