5|$|Diamonds {{have been}} treasured as gemstones since their use as {{religious}} icons in ancient India. Their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history. The popularity of diamonds has risen since the 19th century <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> supply, improved cutting and polishing techniques, {{growth in the}} world economy, and innovative and successful advertising campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh enjoyed {{looking after}} the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but {{struggled}} to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord. He became an enthusiastic member of the Lancashire Agricultural Society and {{was concerned about the}} fate of local farm workers who were losing their jobs <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> mechanisation. Hesketh was gradually becoming more interested in the lives and conditions of the working classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} on Mir {{was similar}} to Earth's. Normal air pressure on the station was 101.3kPa (14.7psi); the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much safer than the alternative, a pure oxygen atmosphere, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> fire risk such as occurred with Apollo 1.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting {{in an increase in}} the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge.|$|E
5|$|The linen {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|After briefly {{moving over}} land, Keith turned north under the {{influence}} of a trailing frontal trough. The storm became disorganized while recurving northeast <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> vertical wind shear and the presence of cool dry air from its north. On November23, Keith made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, with winds of 65mph (100km/h), while most of its convection was well {{to the north of the}} center. Its landfall was the second latest on record for the Continental United States, only behind a hurricane in the 1925 season. The storm quickly weakened as it crossed Florida, and within hours the winds dropped to 40mph (65km/h). Reaching the Atlantic Ocean eight hours after moving ashore, Keith began to gradually re-intensify, and {{under the influence}} of a very large upper-level low pressure area over Newfoundland, the storm accelerated northeast. On November24, the storm again reached its peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), shortly before becoming an extratropical cyclone near Bermuda. Keith restrengthened and deepened into a powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining hurricane-force winds and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (27.92inHg). The extratropical storm turned westward and was last observed on November26 northeast of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> running time, {{budget and}} facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more {{intricate}} action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, who handled the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> shop rates.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 2014, {{the ports}} of Seattle and Tacoma {{formally}} announced {{their intention to}} move management of their marine cargo businesses to a joint alliance in March, ending decades of competition, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> threats from British Columbia and other ports. A full merger, including the two port commissions, was opposed by Tacoma, who feared that the more populous King County would have more votes on the combined commission than Pierce County, who were more dependent on the cargo port. In March 2015, the plan was pushed back to August while working on specifics of the alliance, including a decision on which legal entity it would fall under. The Washington State Legislature and Governor Jay Inslee approved {{the creation of a}} port development authority, similar to Washington's existing public development authority designation, in late April.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} years of the Banzer {{presidency}} the economy improved rapidly. Exports tripled between 1970 and 1974 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> production of petroleum, natural gas, and tin, which was then refined] in Bolivian smelters. The production of cotton in the Santa Cruz area in eastern Bolivia also tripled between 1970 and 1975.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of significant reduction in agricultural yields <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with photosynthesis and stunts overall growth of some plant species. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage, {{in addition to the}} primary regulation designed for the protection of human health.|$|E
25|$|Ribavirin {{should not}} be given with {{zidovudine}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>increased</b> risk <b>of</b> anemia; concurrent use with didanosine should likewise be avoided <b>because</b> <b>of</b> an <b>increased</b> risk <b>of</b> mitochondrial toxicity.|$|R

25|$|Although {{early in}} the 21st century, after Macau was ceded to China and Brazilian {{immigration}} to Japan slowed down, the use of Portuguese was in decline in Asia, it is once again becoming a language of opportunity there, mostly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> diplomatic and financial ties with economically powerful Portuguese-speaking countries (Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, etc.) in the world.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial {{ischemia}} {{comes about}} when the myocardium (the heart muscle) receives insufficient blood and oxygen to function normally either <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> oxygen demand by the myocardium or because of decreased supply to the myocardium. This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|The Overlander {{replaced}} {{a previous}} service operated by RM class Silver Fern railcars on Monday 2 December 1991. Following {{the withdrawal of}} the overnight Northerner, it was the only regular passenger train on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Palmerston North. After being threatened with cessation itself in 2006, it gained significantly in popularity, partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> tourism promotion for the service.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> weights <b>of</b> trains, {{the bridge}} was {{strengthened}} in 1901 with additional stringers and heavier floor beams. Even heavier locomotives required further strengthening of the trusses in 1910.|$|R
50|$|Background {{levels of}} {{ground-level}} ozone have risen since pre-industrial times <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> emissions <b>of</b> methane, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. This trend {{is expected to}} continue into the mid-21st century.|$|R

25|$|In some mountainous areas, higher {{elevations}} above the condensation line or on equator-facing and leeward slopes {{can result in}} low rainfall and increased exposure to solar radiation. This dries out the soil, resulting in a localized arid environment unsuitable for trees. Many south-facing ridges of the mountains of the Western U.S. have a lower treeline than the northern faces <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> sun exposure and aridity.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{significantly}} higher odds of preterm birth (odds ratio 1.3) and congenital anomalies (odds ratio 1.3) among births having reached the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> female embryo mortality due to epigenetic modifications induced by extended culture, blastocyst transfer leads to more male births (56.1% male) versus 2 or 3 day transfer (a normal sex ratio of 51.5% male).|$|E
25|$|Upon {{auscultation}} of {{an individual}} with mitral stenosis, the first heart sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increased</b> force in closing the mitral valve. The first heart sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid heart valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 14th century Genoese lost their {{influence}} in the Black Sea. They did not have the opportunity to pass the Aegean Sea, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>of</b> Turkish military pressure. According to majority of historians, Lithuania came to replace Genoa. In the 14th century the Principality of Moldavia won the control over the Lithuanians.|$|R
50|$|Using panel data {{estimates}} of export and import equations for 17 countries, Jakob B. Madsen (2002) estimated the effects <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> tariff and non-tariff trade barriers on worldwide trade {{during the period}} 1929-1932. He concluded that real international trade contracted somewhere around 33% overall. His {{estimates of}} the impact of various factors included about 14% <b>because</b> <b>of</b> declining GNP in each country, 8% <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>increases</b> in tariff rates, 5% <b>because</b> <b>of</b> deflation-induced tariff <b>increases,</b> and 6% <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the imposition of non-tariff barriers.|$|R
