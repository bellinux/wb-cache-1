40|$|Impact tests using a soft gelatin {{projectile}} {{were performed}} to identify failure modes that occur at high strain energy density during impact loading. Failure modes were identified for aluminum plates and for composites plates and half-rings made from triaxial carbon fiber braid having a 0 /+/- 60 deg architecture. For aluminum plates, a large hole formed {{as a result of}} crack propagation from the initiation site {{at the center of the}} plate. For composite plates, fiber tensile failure occurred in the <b>back</b> <b>ply</b> at the center of the plate. Cracks then propagated from this site along the +/- 60 deg fiber directions until triangular flaps opened to form a hole. For composite half-rings fabricated with 0 deg fibers aligned circumferentially, fiber tensile failure also occurred in the <b>back</b> <b>ply.</b> Cracks first propagated from this site perpendicular the 0 deg fibers. The cracks then turned to follow the +/- 60 deg fibers and 0 deg fibers until rectangular flaps opened to form a hole. Damage in the composites was localized near the impact site, while cracks in the aluminum extended to the boundaries...|$|E

The data provide specific {{information on the}} effects of impactor velocity, impactor mass, material, thickness of <b>back</b> <b>ply</b> group, difference in fiber orientation between adjacent ply groups, plate thickness, and impactor nose radius.

The photographs are taken with X-ray and C-scan imaging {{in conjunction with a}} dye penetrant to show matrix cracks and delaminations. Impact and static-loading tests are performed on plates of graphite-epoxy, graphite-toughened epoxy, and graphite-PEEK materials. The images are presented to yield specific visual data regarding such parameters as impactor velocity, thickness of the <b>back</b> <b>ply</b> group, impactor nose radius, and the effects of multiple delaminations. The images are grouped in eight subsets that correspond to parameters including plate length, material, and the difference in fiber orientation between adjacent ply groups.

40|$|Impact tests using a soft gelatin {{projectile}} {{were performed}} to identify failure modes that occur at high strain energy density during impact loading. Use of a soft projectile allows {{a large amount of}} kinetic energy to be transferred into strain energy in the target before penetration occurs. Failure modes were identified for flat aluminum plates and for flat composite plates made from a triaxial braid having a quasi-isotropic fiber architecture with fibers in the 0 and +/- 60 deg. directions. For the aluminum plates, a large hole formed as a result of crack propagation from the initiation site {{at the center of the}} plate to the fixed boundaries. For the composite plates, fiber tensile failure occurred in the <b>back</b> <b>ply</b> at the center of the plate. Cracks then propagated from this site along the +/- 60 deg. fiber directions until triangular flaps opened to allow the projectile to pass through the plate. The damage size was only slightly larger than the initial impact area. It was difficult to avoid slipping of the fixed edges of the plates during impact, and slipping was shown to have a large effect on the penetration threshold. Failure modes were also identified for composite half-rings fabricated with the 0 deg. fibers aligned circumferentially. Slipping of the edges was not a problem in the half-ring tests. For the composite half-rings, fiber tensile failure also occurred in the <b>back</b> <b>ply.</b> However, cracks initially propagated from this site in a direction transverse to the 0 deg. fibers. The cracks then turned to follow the +/- 60 deg. fibers for a short distance before turning again to follow 0 deg. fibers until two approximately rectangular flaps opened to allow the projectile to pass through the plate. The damage size in the composite half-rings was also only slightly larger than the initial impact area. Cracks did not propagate to the boundaries, and no delamination was observed. The damage tolerance demonstrated by the quasi-isotropic triaxial braid composites indicate that composites of this type can reasonably be considered as a lightweight alternative to metals for fan cases in commercial jet engines...|$|E

50|$|Ply steer {{describes}} the lateral force a tire generates due to asymmetries in its carcass as is rolls forward with zero slip angle {{and may be}} called pseudo side slip. It is the characteristic that is usually described as the tire’s tendency to “crab walk”, or move sideways while maintaining a straight-line orientation. This tendency affects the steering performance of the vehicle. In order to determine ply steer, the lateral force generated is measured as the tire rolls both forward and <b>back,</b> and <b>ply</b> steer is then calculated as one-half {{the sum of the}} values, keeping in mind that values have opposite signs. Ply steer is not measured in production testing.|$|R

40|$|To date, {{most high}} {{performance}} composite materials have been fabricated {{in the form of}} relatively thin panels of uniform thickness, parallel front and <b>back</b> surfaces and <b>plies</b> parallel to these surfaces. For such panels, with only moderate curvature, analyses assuming plane wave propagation can treat the plies as being piecewise flat with curvature effects neglected. However, as composites become thicker with nonparallel surfaces and nonparallel plies, these simplified analyses must be abandoned. Depending on the extent of the nonuniformity in ply orientation, ply curvature may introduce a considerable amount of ray bending in the propagation of acoustic waves through composites with complex geometries and ply orientations. Accordingly, a mathematical framework is needed to treat this problem so that efficient, cost-effective inspection procedures may be designed and optimized...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{changing}} {{raw material}} supply and smaller, generally lower quality peeler logs, are causing surface characteristics in veneer that can adversely affect glue-bond performance. When lower quality logs are peeled, rougher veneer is usually produced. The typical response by plywood manufacturers {{is to increase}} adhesive spread when using rough veneer. The effectiveness of increasing adhesive spread rates has not been quantified. To do so, a method to quantify roughness is needed {{so that it can}} be correlated with percent wood failure, the standard for defining glue-bond quality. The objectives of this research were to define the relationships between seven traditional 2 - dimensional measures of surface roughness and glue-bond performance in order to determine if a measure or combination of measures could be used to develop a glue-bond performance prediction model. Rotary peeled, 1 / 8 inch thick Douglas-fir veneer was visually categorized as being smooth, intermediate, or rough. Samples on each sheet were selected at random and their locations tracked throughout the study. The surface roughness of each sample was measured on the tight and loose sides using a modified laser scatter/optical imaging system. The scanning data were used to calculate seven roughness measures. Three-ply plywood panels were manufactured using the measured samples as core material and smooth veneer as face and <b>back</b> <b>plys.</b> Each panel was cut into standard shear specimens according to U. S. Product Standard 1 - 95. The test area for each shear specimen was the measured sample selected prior to panel assembly. The shear specimens were tested and evaluated for load at failure and percent wood failure. Each of the roughness measures and visual categories were compared to load at failure and percent wood failure data. Each shear specimen was also examined to determine the nature of the failure and with the failure being categorized into one of seven types. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression tests indicated no statistically significant relationship between any of the seven roughness measures or combination of measures and load at failure or percent wood failure. There was also no significant difference in roughness between the tight and loose side of the veneer, except for the skewness, kurtosis, and 3 rd highest peak measures. Analysis of the visual categories showed there was strong evidence that an increase in surface roughness was associated with a decrease in load at failure and percent wood failure. This indicates that a 3 - dimensional measure of surface roughness may be more effective for modeling glue-bond performance. Analysis of the nature of failure data indicated that the samples tended to fail on the loose side of the veneer. This trend was noted across all roughness categories. It is believed that this may be associated with lathe check depth and that an interaction between lathe check depth and veneer roughness may determine glue-bond performance...|$|R
