New less- or non-invasive treatments are increasingly used for NMSC patients, making the development of non-invasive diagnostic technologies highly relevant. The scope of this work is to present data on the current state-of-art in diagnostic methods for NMSC and actinic keratosis. Different key words were searched through scientific search-engines. Results {{of the two of}} our studies are presented. Encouraging results from the reviewed diagnostic trials have suggested a high diagnostic accuracy for many of the new technologies. New imaging technologies have the capability of providing new or additional data or enough information in vivo to understand of NMSC development and to help the clinical diagnostics.

He was a humane, kind-hearted man, and really wished to befriend the unfortunate Saxons; but, on the other hand, he was afraid to affront their Norman oppressors, whom he had allowed to build castles, and strengthen themselves in the very way which it had been Henry Beauclerc's policy to prevent. Almost every spot where green mounds and blocks of massive masonry remain within an ancient moat, is said by tradition to have been [...] "a castle in Stephen's time," [...] and we wonder, considering that he reigned but nine years, how such immense works could have been effected.

5000|$|At the {{screening}} of Lakshya (2004), Chopra informed Farhan Akhtar about the script of Wazir, and wanted his feedback on that. The {{next time they}} met him in 2014, after which Akhtar heard the script and agreed to do the film. He went through intense training and put on eight kilograms of weight {{to play the role}} of an Anti Terrorist Squad officer. He also changed his diet and met some of his friends who were ATS officers for the preparation. Akhtar agreeing for the role puzzled Chopra, who recalls: [...] "At that time, Javed Akhtar (Farhan’s father) and I were engaged in a public verbal duel. When I asked Farhan what made him agree to take up the role, he said, ‘The script is so good that I will bear with you". The film’s scale kept growing by time when it was being written, and Chopra recalls: [...] "We realised the protagonist can’t be American. We had to <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own sensibilities. Our cinema is more flamboyant. So the protagonist needed to be flamboyant too. We thought of making the chess master an Indian and approached Amitabh Bachchan for it". Bachchan had also read the original script 12 years ago, but remembered it when Chopra mentioned. Aditi Rao Hydari was cast after Nambiar saw her pictures when she had walked the ramp for a designer and Chopra saw her dancing. Post this, she went through three set of auditions: dance, acting and a look test. John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh make extended cameo appearances in the film.|$|E

40|$|Seventeenth century moral attitudes often {{reflected}} the medieval view that social well-being required each class to perform its functions and enjoy proportionate rights.

An early seventeenth century sermon affirmed this position:"The universall authoritie of the Church of Christ, hath alwayes approved the Trades of Buying and Selling " [Bourne, 1620, p. 27]. The very existence of trade was attributed to Divine design: "God hath distributed his commodities severally, one country hath not all commodities, " thus there is "a necessity of marchantdizing for the distraction of commodities from one nation to another, for furnishing the necessities of each country " [Loe, 1620, p. 24].

40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} the results of a {{research}} project called Open Window on innovative material technologies for a sustainable Flemish production landscape 9 ̆ 2 (in short: 9 ̆ 1 Open Window 9 ̆ 2). In this project, enterprises located in Flanders (Belgium) give testimony of their innovative products and processes. The aim of gathering evidence on material innovation is to inspire others, promote material innovation and help enterprises to trace and implement opportunities for material innovation, amongst others by means of a 3 P scan. The paper starts off with a quote stating that sustainable development via material innovation is still at its infancy stage, with relatively few real adopters and questionable impact. Based on concrete cases in Flemish production industry, we <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> conclusion that some persistent prejudices are gradually eroding: (1) While material innovation in the past was mainly driven by large groups and multinationals, it can be noticed today that small and medium-size enterprises are defining their own strategies for material innovation; (2) Material innovations are no longer only developed within sectors that are traditionally targeted by environmental regulations. Material innovations are generalized in many, if not all, other industrial sectors. In our paper, well-chosen testimonies on sustainable material innovation in Flanders illustrate that good financial performance is not always incompatible with good ecological and social performances, even though not all cases show win-win situations. Further, our paper contains critical reflections on the definition of so-called 9 ̆ 1 success stories 9 ̆ 2 on material innovation. The definition of success proves all but univocal...|$|E
