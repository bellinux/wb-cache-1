50|$|By 1916 Linn had {{developed}} an even smaller, more stable gasoline-powered half-track with an improved flexible traction system, independent of each other, {{with a central}} triangle-shaped rocker using two tear-dropped runner blocks suspended by axles, then surrounded by an independent roller chain to disperse the load through these rollers, patented in 1918. The feature being with constant ground following traction, and steering accomplished by front wheels (or sled in winter); full power was supplied to both tracks {{all the time and}} transmitted to the ground so there was no loss of tractive effort when turning. Lombard and most other crawlers used a rigid bed inside the tracks which would be lifted off the ground at times, and track-steer crawlers reduce power through clutch or <b>brake</b> <b>action</b> to their tracks to turn, losing additional tractive effort. With its payload carrying ability, the Linn did not require trailers or wagons to move a load, something which off-road terrain does not always permit, and no dead weight or ballast was needed for traction, as simply more payload could be added.|$|E
5000|$|All Lowlanders {{featured}} a ‘Power-Plus’ {{version of the}} Leyland O.600 diesel engine rated at 140 bhp at the same 2,000 rpm limit as the Titan’s 125 bhp; the Lowlander also {{featured a}}s standard a dual-circuit air brake system, which latter did not appear on the Titan until 1968. However, {{from the front of}} the [...] "St. Helen’s-style" [...] glass-reinforced plastic bonnet assembly, to the aft spring-hanger for the front axle, the bus was closely derived from the Titan PD3A, with the driving position only marginally lower. The frame design allowed a step-less front entrance and a central sunken gangway on the lower deck: all lower saloon seats were on a higher level than the gangway to allow the transmission, fuel tanks and other ancillaries such as brake chambers and batteries to be sited. The cross-members, like the side-frames, were of complex shapes, a mixture of tubular, box-section and I-beam members being employed. Like the Lodekka FLF, bodywork was to be cantilevered from the frame aft of the rear axle. An unusual facet of the design, adapted to take steel-framed bodies from any open-market UK coachbuilder, was twin fuel tanks, offside mounted between third and fourth and fourth and fifth cross-members, and linked by a balance-pipe, with the fuel-filler attached to the forward tank.

5000|$|Due to misting and exhaust obstructing the driver's {{view through}} the window, the driver drove leaning {{out of the}} cab for much of the time. A side effect of this was that it made hearing the AWS sounder harder, as well as {{observation}} of a flashing light fitted in the cab to remind a driver of an AWS warning. Approaching signal SN43, there was a temporary speed restriction of 85 mph, which was warned of by a temporary AWS magnet in advance of the restriction, and indicated by a sign {{at the start of the}} temporary speed restriction. The train approached signal SN43 at 59 mph and passed over the temporary AWS magnet. The driver failed to react to the warning given within the time allowed and the brakes were applied. Because the AWS isolating cock was out of reach of the driver, he instructed the fireman to open it for him. The train's speed had reduced by about 8 mph when the brakes were released. The rules require that the train is brought to a stand and the signaller contacted in the event of an AWS brake application. Additionally the driver must inform the signaller whenever the AWS is isolated;"Driver: If it becomes necessary to isolate the AWS, you must:* stop your train immediately* tell the signaller* not move the train until instructed to do so* carry out the instructions given."

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to study}} and compare the {{temperature}} distributions caused by mutual sliding of {{two members of the}} disc brake system basing on two- and three-dimensional FE modeling techniques and complexity of the phenomenon. First step of the analysis based on the previously developed model where the intensity of heat flux was assumed to be uniformly distributed on the friction surface of disc during braking process, and the heat is transferred exclusively in axial direction, whereas during the second, the three-dimensional rotor is subjected to the non-axisymmetric thermal load to simulate realistic thermal behaviour of the <b>brake</b> <b>action.</b> Operation conditions, thermo-physical properties of materials and dimensions of the brake system were adopted from the real representation of the braking process of the passenger vehicle. Arbitrarily selected four values of the velocities at the moment of brake engagement were applied to the models so as to investigate theirs influence on the obtained solutions of the temperature evolutions on the contact surface of the disc volume referring to two separated finite element analysis. The large amount of heat generated at the pad/disc interface during emergency braking indisputably evokes non-uniform temperature distributions in the domain of the rotor, whereas the pad element is constantly heated during mutual sliding. The obtained results of the original code of three-dimensional modeling technique implemented to the conventional FE software revel high agreement with the solution of simplified process of friction heating...|$|E
40|$|When {{a vehicle}} is parked on a slope with hot brakes, {{what appears to}} be a {{sufficient}} parking <b>brake</b> <b>action</b> can sometimes become insufficient. When the brakes cool down, the braking force reduces due to relaxation of the entire parking brake system, and the vehicle may start to move, leading to obvious catastrophic consequences. This phenomenon is known as vehicle rollaway. This thesis describes the problem in detail and postulates a mechanism that accounts for the occurrence of the rollaway event on vehicles using integrated rear callipers. Different testing methods are presented that are used to investigate the propensity of a vehicle's parking brake system to rollaway. These include on-vehicle evaluations and laboratory based measurements. A description is given of a novel dynamometer facility that was developed for this research that is capable of testing vehicle parking brake systems for rollaway. Two mathematical modelling techniques are presented that demonstrate how the parking brake system parameters influence the likelihood of rollaway occurring. A finite element model was used to simulate the change in contact pressure at the frictional interface during a rollaway event. A numerical model was also used to predict the change in torque developed by a parking brake system cooling from an initial elevated temperature. The change in clamp load at the frictional interface was modelled using an essentially I-D quasi-static system that showed how the stiffness and the thermal properties of the system qualitatively affect the phenomenon. The research found that rollaway does not always start with a uniform motion, but with a stick/slip motion. The likelihood of rollaway occurring was found to be directly linked to the temperature of the brake when the vehicle is parked. Rollaway can be reduced by lowering the initial temperature of the brake prior to parking. Rollaway can also be reduced by increasing the input load to the system when applying the parking brake. The research identifies the key design parameters of the brake system components whose values require close control within the real system if rollaway is to be avoided.

40|$|In Chinese {{mainline}} railway, freight trains {{need to stop}} within passenger stations {{at times}} because of the delayed passenger trains. Without any decision-support system, {{it is very difficult}} for drivers to stop trains within stations with consistency in one <b>braking</b> <b>action.</b> The reasons are that braking performance of train changes with the conditions of braking equipment and the drivers’ subjective evaluations of track profiles and braking distance are vague and imprecise. This paper presents a fuzzy neural network (FNN), which is based on the historical datasets of train stops, to model the latest condition of train braking equipment and to attain the braking distance under a predefined braking rate, track profiles, and initial braking speed. The braking distance is used to find the initial braking position to advise the drivers on commencing <b>braking</b> <b>action.</b> Case studies confirm that it is feasible to stop trains within stations in one <b>braking</b> <b>action</b> by applying the proposed approach. Furthermore, the runtime and energy consumption of train movement are both reduced in comparison to the practical two-step action train stopping (TATS); that is, drivers stop trains before entering stations and remotor at a low speed before slowly stopping within stations...|$|R

Analyses of 1261 friction-limited landings of commercial airplanes were used to compare predicted and measured <b>braking</b> <b>actions.</b> The IRIS runway model was found to be more conservative than the assessments of Norwegian runway inspectors, and even more conservative than friction measurements. In 86 % of the landings, the IRIS runway model predicted the conditions within ± 1 category of what the airplanes experienced, compared to 77 % achieved by the runway inspectors. The predictions by the friction measurement devices were the least conservative and predicted the conditions within ± 1 category in 61 % of the landings. The model is now implemented in 15 airports in Norway...|$|R
