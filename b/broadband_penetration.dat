These digital networks provide copyright holders with new sales and promotional channels for their content, while also providing consumers with new opportuni-ties to obtain high quality free copies of this content. Broadband access is {{a necessary condition for}} movie piracy and the {{movie industry}} has argued that the dominant impact of increased <b>broadband</b> Internet <b>penetration</b> will be increased piracy, and reduced media sales. We analyze this hypothesis by applying fixed effects and first difference models to a new dataset quantifying changes in <b>broadband</b> Internet <b>penetration</b> and DVD sales at a local level from 2000 to 2003. Contrary to industry concerns, we find that increased <b>broadband</b> Internet <b>penetration</b> leads to a significant increase in DVD sales. Our results are robust across a variety of specifica-tions. Using the most conservative results, we find that 9. 3 % of the $ 14. 1 billion increase in DVD sales during our study period can be directly attributed to increased <b>broadband</b> Internet <b>penetration.</b> This corresponds to a $ 1. 3 billion increase in DVD revenue and a $ 630 million in-crease in profits to movie studios...|$|R

In 2013 the average speed in central Manchester was 60Mbit/s, while in nearby Warrington the average speed was only 6.2Mbit/s. Hull, which is unique in the UK in that its telephone network was never nationalised, has simultaneously some of the fastest and slowest internet speeds in the country: many households have [...] "ultrafast" [...] fibre optic broadband as standard, but {{it is also one of}} only two places in the UK where over 30% of businesses receive less than 10 Mbit/s. Speeds are especially poor in the rural parts of the North, with many small towns and villages completely without high speed access. Some areas have therefore formed their own community enterprises, such as Broadband 4 Rural North in Lancashire and Cybermoor in Cumbria, to install high-speed internet connections. Mobile broadband coverage is similarly patchy, with 3G and 4G almost universal in cities but unavailable in large parts of Yorkshire, the North East and Cumbria.|$|E

Therefore, the aims {{of this study were}} to investigate (a) which individual and country characteristics explain sexting and (b) whether individual predictors vary across countries.

Gender differences in sexting varied across countries. Although country characteristics (GDP, <b>broadband</b> internet <b>penetration,</b> traditional values) had no direct effect on adolescent sexting, traditionalism significantly predicted gender differences in sexting. In more traditional countries, gender differences were more pronounced than in less traditional countries, with more boys than girls engaging in sexting.

40|$|EXCUTIVE SUMMARY Korea has {{experienced}} phenomenal economic {{growth over the}} past five decades. In the aftermath of the Korean-War in 1950 s, the country rebuilt its economy through government-driven economic policies with a heavy emphasis on self-sufficiency and protection of infant industries. The continued growth in GDP per capita seemed to prove the effectiveness of such top-down interventionist programs until the Asian financial crisis in 1997. With aggressive reforms, the country quickly reimbursed its IMF loans and began to show signs of growth again. Nonetheless, the source of growth this time was different as the Korean economy began a shift away from labor- or capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-based and technology-driven higher valued-added activities. The emergence of Korea’s online game cluster is the result of this transformation of Korea’s economy. Korea’s strong IT infrastructure {{played a critical role in}} creating derived demand for online games. Korea has achieved the highest level <b>broadband</b> internet <b>penetration</b> compared any other country in the world, resulting in the availability of cheap and fast internet connections in most households. Supportive cultural factors which stress the importance of education indirectl...|$|R
