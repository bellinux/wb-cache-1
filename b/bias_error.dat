50|$|A biased {{rendering}} {{method is}} not necessarily wrong, and it can still converge to the correct answer if the estimator is consistent. It does, however, introduce a certain <b>bias</b> <b>error,</b> usually {{in the form of}} a blur, in efforts to reduce the variance (high-frequency noise). It is important to note that an unbiased technique may not consider all possible paths. Path tracing can not consistently handle caustics generated from a point light source, as it is highly unlikely to randomly generate the path that directly reflects into the point. Progressive photon mapping (PPM), a biased rendering technique, can handle caustics quite well. Although biased, PPM is provably consistent, meaning that as the number of samples goes to infinity, the <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> goes to zero, and the probability that the estimate is correct reaches one.|$|E
40|$|An error {{analysis}} is presented for cloud-top pressure and cloud-amount retrieval using infrared sounder data. Rms and <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> are determined for instrument noise (typical of the HIRS- 2 instrument on Tiros-N) and for uncertainties in the temperature profiles and water vapor profiles {{used to estimate}} clear-sky radiances. Errors are determined {{for a range of}} test cloud amounts (0. 1 - 1. 0) and cloud-top pressures (920 - 100 mb). Rms errors vary by an order of magnitude depending on the cloud height and cloud amount within the satellite's field of view. Large <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> are found for low-altitude clouds. These <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> are shown to result from physical constraints placed on retrieved cloud properties, i. e., cloud amounts between 0. 0 and 1. 0 and cloud-top pressures between the ground and tropopause levels. Middle-level and high-level clouds (above 3 - 4 km) are retrieved with low <b>bias</b> and rms <b>errors...</b>|$|R

However, it has some non-linear <b>bias</b> <b>errors,</b> the measurement data represents the Gaussian distribution, and the variance of measurement error in-creases in proportion to distance.

A practical scheme for monitoring appraisal <b>biases</b> and <b>errors</b> that cause departure from assessment uniformity has however, been lacking. This paper proposes a stochastic model of <b>biases</b> and <b>errors</b> in assessment administration and transforms {{it into a}} regression scheme for estimating <b>bias</b> and <b>errors</b> arising from growth, market and appraising processes. The model is then approximately validated for use in detecting <b>biases</b> and <b>errors</b> by any municipality interested in maintaining assessment uniformity. ...|$|R
50|$|Generally Bessel's {{correction}} is {{an approach}} to reduce the <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> due to finite sample count. Such finite-sample bias correction is also needed for other estimates like skew and kurtosis, but in these the inaccuracies are often significantly larger. To fully remove such bias errors {{it is necessary to}} do a more complex multi-parameter estimation. For instance a correct correction for the standard deviation depends on the kurtosis (normalized central 4th moment), but this again has a finite sample bias and it depends on the standard deviation, i.e. both estimations have to be merged.|$|E

According to an experiment in 1994, the metering errors may exist even when the velocity flow profile is fully developed with perfect pipe flow conditions. Conversely, it was found zero metering error at times when the velocity profile was not fully developed. Hence this behavior was referred to the turbulence intensity of the gas flow that can cause metering <b>bias</b> <b>error.</b> This behavior accounts in part for the less than adequate performance of the conventional tube bundle.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact of random forecast <b>error</b> and <b>bias</b> forecast <b>error</b> in Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) strategy on the cost of inventory management for both the manufacturer and retailer. Discrete-event simulation is used to develop a CPFR collaboration model where forecast, sales and inventory level information is shared between a retailer and a manufacturer. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the higher random forecast <b>error</b> and negative <b>bias</b> forecast <b>error</b> increases the cost of inventory management for both the manufacturer and the retailer. When demand variability is high, a <b>bias</b> forecast <b>error</b> has a bigger impact on inventory management cost compared to a random forecast error for both the manufacturer and retailer.

The uncompensated mismatched steady state Kalman-Bucy filter exhibits <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> whenever the nominal plant parameters used in the filter design are different from the actual plant parameters. The approach used relies on the utilization of the residual (innovations) process of the mismatched filter to estimate, via a Kalman-Bucy filter, the state estimation errors and subsequent improvements of the state estimate. The compensated Kalman filter augments the mismatched steady state Kalman-Bucy filrby the introduction of additional dynamics and feedforward integral compensation channels...|$|R

40|$|An error {{analysis}} which applies to both conventional and remote reference magnetotelluric impedance and tipper estimates is developed {{based on the}} assumption that noise in the field measurements is governed by a complex normal distribution. Under the assumed model of noise it is shown that the theoretical expressions for the variances and covariances derived recently by Gamble et al (1979 b) specifically for remote reference estimates apply to conventional estimates as well. However, calculations are biased if the impedance or tipper functions are biased. The impedance and tipper functions are calculated as ratios of two random functions of noisy field measurements. The expressions for the variances and covariances account for noise in both the numerator and denominator of the estimates. They are useful provided the probability that the magnitude of the random error in the denominator exceeds the magnitude of its expected value is small. Expressions for the <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> of the impedance and tipper functions are obtained in order to assess the relative contributions of random and <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> to the man squared error of the estimates. The relative magnitude of both random and <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> depends on the noise level and on the values of the sample coherencies between various pairs of the field measurements used to compute a particular estimate...|$|R

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{satellite}} data, {{other sources of}} errors such as measurement errors, substantial seepage losses from the waterholes and errors due to substantial water abstraction by livestock and humans {{could also result in}} additional errors. In spite of these sources of errors, the multi-source satellite data approach presented in this study can be used to monitor relative patterns and variations in water levels as opposed to absolute depths. This approach provides indicative information on relative water availability in near-real time, which otherwise is limited in the remote pastoral regions. Particularly, the use of scaled depths minimizes the negative impact of <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> from input data and model parameterization. Due to the consistent nature of remote sensing data, the <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> are largely eliminated from influencing the year-to-year variability of scaled depth, making it useful for drought monitoring and early warning applications.|$|R

The effect of relaxation parameter is studied. It is demonstrated that when bias errors dominate, the <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> bounds characterize the actual error field better than the standard error. The <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> bound estimates also help to identify regions in the design space where the accuracy of the response surface approximations is inadequate.

40|$|A {{reduction}} in error is obtained for estimates of range computed in a multipath environment. A good estimation technique for this problem typically involves exploiting the multipath interference, that is, analyzing each received signal reflection {{to improve the}} estimate. Under certain conditions, however, the errors in multipath estimates can be quite large. We compute the Cram'er-Rao bounds for an example satisfying these conditions to demonstrate this phenomenon. We propose a modification to the original signal model which better represents the received signals. While the modified model does introduce a <b>bias</b> <b>error,</b> we provide a suitable estimate of the <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> so that a complete error anaylsis of the modified model is possible. The total error (noise error plus <b>bias</b> <b>error)</b> for the modified model is computed for an example and compares favorably with the error obtained via the original signal model. 1.

40|$|Nonlinear systems {{might be}} estimated, using local linear models. If the {{estimation}} data {{is corrupted by}} strongly colored noise the local model will have a <b>bias</b> <b>error.</b> In linear system identification the <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> can be reduced by using instrumentalvariable methods. In this thesis, the problem with <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> in local models have been addressed, by adapting linear methods to local models. Two different two-step estimation methods are presented. Both use {{the fact that the}} simulated output of a high-order ARX-model, is an approximation of the noise-free output from the system. The first method is a local version of a twostep ARX technique, where the second step uses an ARX-model with a shorter regressor than in the first step. The second method uses the simulated output from the first step as an instrumental-variable in the second step. The impact of the two methods on the <b>bias</b> <b>error</b> is discussed. Expressions for the variance error for both the local two-step ARX-estimate and the local IV-method have been derived. Estimation examples using both simulated data, demonstrating the noise influence and the variance expressions, and laboratory data are included. The thesis also addresses model validation by showing how residual analysis for nonlinear systems can be simplified by using a parametric model of the covariance.

30|$|A least-squares {{approach}} to linear uncertainty analysis {{has been described}} and illustrated. This approach can provide improved results over ordinary uncertainty propagation using a first order Taylor series approximation by minimizing the truncation errors in the linear approximation of the equation being analyzed. A drawback {{of this approach is}} that there is no explicit formula to find the sensitivity coefficients. However, in many instances the sensitivity coefficients are obtained through numerical derivatives. In such cases, there is little or no additional computational effort in obtaining the least-squares solution. This paper also shows a simple way to obtain the covariance matrix used in the uncertainty analysis. In many engineering applications, it is cumbersome to determine the correlation coefficients of the <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> (ρ), i.e., reasonable engineering judgment is required. Therefore, the authors recommend using covariance matrix expressed in terms of uncorrelated <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> as shown in the third example. The results in the examples illustrate the advantages of using the least-squares approach.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a linear {{programming}} {{approach to the}} problem of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error mitigation in sensor networks. The locations of sensor nodes can be estimated using range or distance estimates from locationaware “anchor ” nodes. In the absence of line-of-sight (LOS) between the sensor and anchor nodes, e. g., in indoor networks, the NLOS range estimates can be severely biased. If these biased range estimates are directly incorporated into practical location estimators such as the Least-Squares (LS) estimator without the mitigation of these <b>bias</b> <b>errors,</b> this can potentially lead to degradation in the accuracy of sensor location estimates. On the other hand, discarding the biased range estimates may not be a viable option, since the number of range estimates available may be limited. We present a novel NLOS bias mitigation scheme, based on linear programming, that (i) allows us to incorporate NLOS range information into sensor location-estimation, but (ii) does not allow NLOS <b>bias</b> <b>errors</b> to degrade sensor localization accuracy...|$|R
