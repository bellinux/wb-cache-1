5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland.

In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional light rail system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or underground light rail line through Roosevelt with a station in the neighborhood. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, only funding light rail from the University District to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could <b>be</b> <b>secured.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{show that}} major cryptosystems such as FDH, OAEP, and RSA-KEM <b>are</b> <b>secure</b> under a hash {{function}} MD h with Merkle-Damg˚ard (MD) construction that uses a random oracle compression function h. First, we propose two new ideal primitives called Traceable Random Oracle (T RO) and Extension Attack Simulatable Random Oracle (ERO) which are weaker than a random oracle (RO). Second, {{we show that}} MD h is indifferentiable from LRO, T RO and ERO, where LRO is Leaky Random Oracle proposed by Yoneyama et al. This result means that if a cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in these models, then the cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> under MD h following the indifferentiability theory proposed by Maurer et al. Finally, we prove that OAEP <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the T RO model and RSA-KEM <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the ERO model. Since it is also known that FDH <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the LRO model, as a result, major cryptosystems, FDH, OAEP and RSA-KEM, <b>are</b> <b>secure</b> under MD h, though MD h is not indifferentiable from RO...|$|R

5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could <b>be</b> <b>secured.</b> Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E

5|$|Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils {{were found}} at all; but, since the seventies, {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France.

That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E

In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.|$|E
