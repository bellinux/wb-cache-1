50|$|Sulfation {{occurs in}} {{lead-acid}} batteries {{when they are}} subjected to insufficient charging during normal operation. It impedes recharging; sulfate deposits ultimately expand, cracking the plates and destroying the battery. Eventually {{so much of the}} <b>battery</b> <b>plate</b> area is unable to supply current that the battery capacity is greatly reduced. In addition, the sulfate portion (of the lead sulfate) is not returned to the electrolyte as sulfuric acid. It is believed that large crystals physically block the electrolyte from entering the pores of the plates. Sulfation can be avoided if the battery is fully recharged immediately after a discharge cycle. A white coating on the plates may be visible (in batteries with clear cases, or after dismantling the battery). Batteries that are sulfated show a high internal resistance and can deliver {{only a small fraction of}} normal discharge current. Sulfation also affects the charging cycle, resulting in longer charging times, less efficient and incomplete charging, and higher battery temperatures.|$|E

50|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} {{lose the}} ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation, the crystallization of lead sulfate. They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction. Lead and lead dioxide, the active materials on the <b>battery's</b> <b>plates,</b> react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate. The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, amorphous state, and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges. As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging. Thus, not all the lead is returned to the <b>battery</b> <b>plates,</b> {{and the amount of}} usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time.|$|R

Examination of the liver both in life and after death showed a gross excess of cadmium. This was also found in the kidneys after death. Previously unreported changes were present in the bones, especially the lumbar vertebrae which were probably more the result of gross bone deformity than cadmium deposition.

This article summarizes the experimental results and analysis of solar panel under vibration {{with the aid of}} LDV. Through binary channel fast Fourier Transform (FFT), combined with modal analysis theories and software analysis system, a modal model of solar panel is built. Such an modal model provides a basis for the determination of the physical and structural parameters in the solar panel design of a satellite and provides an analysis method for the reliability validation of the design and the operating reliability of the satellite.

In common designs, it reaches a critical density when discharged to about 75% depth of discharge, or below.
