40|$|The article {{gives the}} results of multivariate {{analysis}} of structure and contribution per shares made by potential risk factors at malignant neoplasms in trachea, <b>bronchial</b> <b>tubes</b> and lung. The authors used specialized databases comprising personified records on oncologic diseases in Taganrog, Rostov region, over 1986 - 2015 (30, 684 registered cases of malignant neoplasms, including 3, 480 cases of trachea cancer, <b>bronchial</b> <b>tubes</b> cancer, and lung cancer). When carrying out analytical research we applied both multivariate statistical techniques (factor analysis and hierarchical cluster correlation analysis) and conventional techniques of epidemiologic analysis including etiologic fraction calculation (EF), {{as well as an}} original technique of assessing actual (epidemiologic) risk. Average long-term morbidity with trachea, <b>bronchial</b> <b>tubes</b> and lung cancer over 2011 - 2015 amounts to 46. 64 o / oooo. Over the last 15 years a stable decreasing trend has formed, annual average growth being – 1. 22 %. This localization holds the 3 rd rank place in oncologic morbidity structure, its specific weight being 10. 02 %. We determined etiological fraction (EF) for smoking as a priority risk factor causing trachea, <b>bronchial</b> <b>tubes</b> and lung cancer; this fraction amounts to 76. 19 % for people aged 40 and older, and to 81. 99 % for those aged 60 and older. Application of multivariate statistical techniques (factor analysis and cluster correlation analysis) in this research enabled us to make factor structure more simple; namely, to highlight, interpret, give a quantitative estimate of self-descriptiveness and rank four group (latent) potential risk factors causing lung cancer...|$|R

40|$|Influenza virus A/Tokyo/ 1 / 72 (10 ^ 7. 5 EID_ 50) was inoculated into CAC of the {{hatching}} egg for examinating {{of the virus}} multiplication, and intranasally into murine lung for study of pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia. These studies were investigated by immunofluorescent, histological and electron microscopical appearances. In the {{hatching egg}}, difference of susceptibility to influenza virus was observed between entoderm and ectoderm. On immunofluorescent study, IF was detected not only in CAM {{but also in the}} other membranes and rarely in embryo, especially in respiratory epithelium. In the murine lung, influenza virus invaded to tracheal and bronchial epithelium and finally to type II pneumocyte of alveolar lining cells. These facts suggested that influenza virus had intense respiratory epitheliotrop ism. In the murine lung, cytoplasmic IF was observed at 9 hours after inoculation in epithelium of trachea and bronchiole at first, and at 12 hours after inoculation, scattered IF in some alveolar wall, and at 1 day after inoculation in nuclei of desquamated epithelial cells in the lumen of the trachea and <b>bronchial</b> <b>tube.</b> IF was most brilliant between 1 to 3 days after inoculation. But in the light microscopic study, most violent histological changes were detected at 2 and 10 days after inoculation. Therefore, there was a difference in time between IF intensity and histolgical changes. About the pathogenesis of viral pneumonia in this study, many inflammatory cells infiltrated around the trachea, <b>bronchial</b> <b>tube</b> and to alveolar wall, however IF could not be noticed among them. Consequently, it was speculated that interstitial pneumonia might be a reaction caused by some toxic substance resulted from influenza virus in infected cells.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There {{has been}} a {{progressive}} evolution in double-lumen tubes to separate {{the right and left}} lungs. The appreciation of the anatomical advantage of the longer left main bronchus has directed anesthetists to prefer a left tube if possible for lung separation. Understanding the dimensions of the tube as well as the variations in the left main bronchus has improved the process of selection and insertion of the double-lumen tubes for lung isolation. RECENT FINDINGS: Early work focused on the anatomy of the longer left main bronchus. More recent work looked at the tube. This showed that tubes of the same nominal French size were substantially different {{in the size of the}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and length. The proposed International Standards Organization standard will more accurately identify tube dimensions. These factors must be considered when selecting a tube for lung separation. SUMMARY: Measurement of patient's airway dimensions combined with knowledge of the dimensions of the double-lumen (tracheobronchial) tube plays an important role in lung separation. W.

40|$|An airflow in {{the first}} four generations of the tracheobronchial tree was {{simulated}} by the 1 D model of incompressible fluid flow through the network of the elastic tubes coupled with 0 D models of lumped alveolar components, which aggregates parts of the alveolar volume and smaller airways, extended with convective transport model throughout the lung and alveolar components which were combined with the model of oxygen and carbon dioxide transport between the alveolar volume and the averaged blood compartment during pathological respiratory conditions. The novel features of this work are 1 D reconstruction of the tracheobronchial tree structure on the basis of 3 D segmentation of the computed tomography (CT) data; 1 D− 0 D coupling of the models of 1 D <b>bronchial</b> <b>tube</b> and 0 D alveolar components; and the alveolar gas exchange model. The results of our simulations include mechanical ventilation, breathing patterns of severely ill patients with the cluster (Biot) and periodic (Cheyne-Stokes) respirations and bronchial asthma attack. The suitability of the proposed mathematical model was validated. Carbon dioxide elimination efficiency was analyzed in all these cases. In the future, these results might be integrated into research and practical studies aimed to design cyberbiological systems for remote real-time monitoring, classification, prediction of breathing patterns and alveolar gas exchange for patients with breathing problems...|$|E
