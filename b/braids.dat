40|$|Abstract: Considering {{that there}} were very a few {{varieties}} of 3 D <b>braided</b> materials at present, some novel 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures were derived based on symmetry group theory. Group theory {{was used for the}} first time to describe the 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures was discussed. The whole analyzing procedure from the existing <b>braided</b> geometry structure to the <b>braided</b> symmetry group was described in detail. It is found that because the reflection operation does not exist in some point groups and space groups of <b>braided</b> structure and some odd lattices appeared, the <b>braided</b> symmetry group is not always the same as symmetry groups of crystallographic. The representative volume element of 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structure was deduced from <b>braided</b> space point group, and 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structure was obtained from <b>braided</b> space group. 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures can not only be classified based on <b>braided</b> group theory, but some of novel 3 D <b>braided</b> structures can be deduced through the group's symmetry operators. It is proved that some novel 3 D <b>braided</b> processes are feasible. <b>Braided</b> symmetry theory is an effective mathematical method for developing more and rational 3 D <b>braided</b> materials.

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long <b>braids,</b> but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's <b>braids</b> to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed <b>braids</b> and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was perched atop a railing. From each of her <b>braids,</b> a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
5|$|Blow {{created the}} Thekla, Inc. {{team for the}} {{development}} and publication of The Witness. Since December 2009, Blow was working remotely with two additional full-time roles, one a 3D artist, and another as a technical programmer. By 2015, Blow stated there were about eight full-time members on his team, though had had ten to eleven people involved around 2011, {{and as many as}} fifteen at its peak. The Witness incorporates other artists and programmer's contributions in smaller roles, such as David Hellman, who had previously worked with Blow on <b>Braids</b> art design and worked on conceptualizing the design of The Witness. Other contributors include Eric Urquhart, who has provided 3-D concept artwork for the game, and Ignacio Castaño, who has developed a rendering system for the game's illumination and visual effects. Blow gives much credit to Orsolya Spanyol, a freshly-graduated graphic artist he hired around 2011, for transforming the original sparse imagery of the island to the more vivid scenery that was included in the final game. By diversifying work on the game, Blow has been able to focus more of his time on the core game design, allowing his team to implement his vision, in contrast to the development of Braid where he also had to program much of the game himself.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates <b>braids</b> and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E

5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long <b>braids.</b> This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E
25|$|Dressage {{horses are}} {{turned out to}} a high standard. It is usual for horses to have their manes braided (also known as plaited). In eventing, the mane is {{preferred}} to be braided on the right; in competitive dressage, however, it is occasionally braided on the left, should it naturally fall there. <b>Braids</b> vary in size, but Europeans tend to put in fewer, larger <b>braids,</b> while Americans {{tend to have more}} smaller <b>braids</b> per horse. <b>Braids</b> are occasionally accented in white tape, which also helps them stay in throughout the day. The forelock may be left unbraided; this style is most common with stallions. <b>Braids</b> are held in place by either yarn or rubber bands. It is a common misconception that a dressage horse must be braided, however this is not the case, and some riders may choose for various reasons not to braid.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe use {{physical}} {{experiments to}} investigate the response of submarine <b>braided</b> channels driven by saline density currents to increasing inflow discharge and bed slope. We find that, similarly to <b>braided</b> rivers, {{only a fraction of}} submarine <b>braided</b> networks have active sediment transport. We then find similar response to imposed change between submarine and fluvial <b>braided</b> systems: (1) both the active and total <b>braiding</b> intensities increase with increasing discharge and slope; (2) the ratio of active <b>braiding</b> intensity to total <b>braiding</b> intensity is 0. 5 in submarine <b>braided</b> systems regardless of discharge and slope; and (3) the active <b>braiding</b> intensity scales linearly with dimensionless stream power. Thus, <b>braided</b> submarine channels and <b>braided</b> rivers are similar in some important aspects of their behavior and responses to changes in stream power and bed slope. In light of the scale independence of <b>braided</b> channel planform organization, these results are likely to apply beyond experimental scales...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Braided</b> bialgebras {{were defined}} by {{mimicking}} {{the definition of}} bialgebras in a <b>braided</b> category; see [Ta]. In this paper {{we are interested in}} those <b>braided</b> bialgebras that are connected as a coalgebra, and such that, up to multiplication by a certain scalar, their <b>braiding</b> restricted to the primitive part is a Hecke operator. To every <b>braided</b> bialgebra as above we associate a <b>braided</b> Lie algebra. Conversely, for each <b>braided</b> Lie algebra we construct a <b>braided</b> bialgebra, namely its enveloping algebra. <b>Braided</b> symmetric and exterior algebras are examples of enveloping algebras (they correspond to a trivial Lie bracket). We show many of the properties of ordinary enveloping algebras still hold in the <b>braided</b> case: the graded associated (with respect to the standard filtration) is a <b>braided</b> symmetric algebra; the coalgebra counterpart is isomorphic to the coalgebra structure of a <b>braided</b> symmetric algebra; the coradical filtration and the standard filtration are identical. As in the classical case, <b>braided</b> symmetric and exterior algebras are Koszul algebras. The proof of this fact is based on a new characterization of Koszul algebras. These properties are used to prove a Milnor-Moore type theorem for infinitesimally cocommutative connected <b>braided</b> bialgebras (see Theorem 5. 5). We apply our result to three different classes of <b>braided</b> bialgebras: connected bialgebras in the category of comodules over a coquasitriangular cosemisimple Hopf algebra (e. g. superbialgebras and enveloping algebras o...|$|R
