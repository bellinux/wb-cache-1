She also hated that her character had become a villain, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the direct cause of her leaving the company. Greenwald, however, stated that all of the aforementioned reasons are incorrect, but she would like to keep the real reason she left WWE private.

5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty {{to pick and choose}} her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E

25|$|The label {{psychopath}} {{has been}} described as nonspecific but probably persisting because it indicates that the source of behavior lies in the psyche rather than in the situation.

25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a defect in it, because {{it is supposed to}} infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author‚Äôs fundamental assumptions‚Äîwhich are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E
