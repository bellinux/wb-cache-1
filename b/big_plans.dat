25|$|Columbushaus was {{completed}} and opened in January 1933, {{the same month}} that the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) came to power. Hitler had <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> for Berlin, to transform it into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by his architect friend Albert Speer (1905–81). Under these plans the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz would have got off fairly lightly, although the Potsdamer Bahnhof (and the Anhalter Bahnhof a short distance away) would have lost their function. The new North-South Axis, the linchpin of the scheme, would have severed their approach tracks, leaving both termini stranded {{on the wrong side}} of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and Südbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and Südkreuz. In Speer's plan the former Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool; the intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented.|$|E

25|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{building}} of the arena in the Meadowlands was to potentially lure a National Hockey League team to New Jersey. Governor Byrne was a member of an ownership group that was looking to do so, and in 1978 businessman Arthur Imperatore purchased the Colorado Rockies of the NHL and announced that he would be moving the team out of McNichols Sports Arena in Denver and relocating them to New Jersey. The NHL initially rejected the move as the arena was yet to be completed and, unlike the situation when the Nets moved, there was no arena in New Jersey at that time that would fit NHL standards as even a temporary home. Imperatore sold the team to Houston Astros owner Dr. John McMullen in 1982. When the arena was completed McMullen, who was a native New Jerseyan like Imperatore, announced that he had <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> for the team, including the long-planned move, and in the off-season the Rockies moved operations to New Jersey, where they became known as the Devils. The first NHL game played at Byrne Arena pitted the Devils against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 5, 1982, and the game ended in a 3–3 tie. The next season, the NHL All-Star Game was hosted by the Devils at the arena.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tenacious}} {{opposition of}} the Republicans and the business interests kept most of Johnson's <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> tied up in legal battles. By 1909, Clevelanders were becoming increasingly weary of reform and endless political fights, and Johnson was defeated for re-election by a relatively obscure Republican, Herman C. Baehr. Having ruined his health and dissipated his considerable fortune {{in the cause of}} reform, Johnson lived just long enough to dictate his autobiography, [...] My Story. He died in 1911, and was buried next to Henry George in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|Hayes {{originally}} had <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> for the form factor, referring {{to it as}} the Hayes Stack and intending to release a range of products that could be stacked beside the computer. In the end, only two non-modem devices were added to the line. The Hayes Stack Chronograph, an external real-time clock and the Transet 1000, a printer buffer and primitive email box. [...] Both of these items' sales were apparently dismal. [...] Early advertising referred to the Smartmodem as the [...] "Hayes Stack Smartmodem", but this naming convention was dropped a short time later.|$|E

5000|$|Unfortunately, it’s not {{a benign}} mistake by the {{intelligence}} officials or the home ministry, but {{the reflection of}} a tendency of authoritarianism.

Many of them responded favorably.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{recognized}} the area's historic character and importance, {{the city had}} <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> for the area. The Democratic political machine of Daniel P. O'Connell mostly eschewed the federal Title I funds for the massive urban renewal programs of the era, since they wanted to retain control of patronage. With what money they did have, they chose a plan that would, they hoped, [...] "revitalize" [...] the neighborhood and preserve what had been recognized as special about it. They moved residents out, temporarily they hoped, while selected decrepit buildings were demolished and new ones built in sympathetic styles. Nearly {{half of all the}} buildings in the district were demolished, the rest [...] "mothballed" [...] without heating.|$|E

[...] The dream of Silver Ventures is that once completed, the former brewery will be a village within eyesight of the skyscrapers of Downtown San Antonio. [...] In a local article, [...] Bill Shown, the development's managing director, described an area that would house an event hall, schools, and retail, office, and residential space. [...] The idea is to create an area where people can live, shop, and work, yet a community close-knit enough where residents know the shop owners.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Microsoft {{reportedly}} {{played down}} {{the threat from}} Chrome and predicted {{that most people would}} embrace Internet Explorer 8. Opera Software said that [...] "Chrome will strengthen the Web as the biggest application platform in the world". But by February 25, 2010, BusinessWeek had reported that [...] "For the first time in years, energy and resources are being poured into browsers, the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the Web. Credit for this trend a boon to consumers goes to two parties. The first is Google, whose <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> for the Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer. Microsoft all but ceased efforts to enhance IE after it triumphed in the last browser war, sending Netscape to its doom. Now it's back in gear." [...] Mozilla said that Chrome's introduction into the web browser market comes as [...] "no real surprise", that [...] "Chrome is not aimed at competing with Firefox", and furthermore that it would not affect Google's revenue relationship with Mozilla.|$|E

His arrest in his Hollywood office was broadcast on live TV, shamed as a former Mr. Universe turned crook. [...] His lawyer managed to reduce his sentence to just a year in prison for pandering. In prison he met a preacher who told him that God had <b>big</b> <b>plans</b> for him and that it was his destiny to become an international evangelist.
