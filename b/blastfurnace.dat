5000|$|Portland clinker is {{the main}} {{constituent}} of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of natural gypsum, anhydrite, or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add {{a certain amount of}} water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers. [...] "Blended cements" [...] and Masonry cements may include large additions (up to 40%) of natural pozzolans, fly ash, limestone, silica fume or metakaolin. <b>Blastfurnace</b> slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} effects of {{alternative}} fuels and raw materials on the cement clinker quality. The clinker quality was expressed by the content of two principal minerals alite C 3 S and belite C 2 S. The additions of alternative fuels ashes and raw materials, in principle, always increased the belite content and conversely reduced the amount of alite. The alternative fuels with high ash content were used such as the meat-bone meal, sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants and paper sludge and the used alternative raw materials were metallurgical slags - granulated <b>blastfurnace</b> slag, air cooled <b>blastfurnace</b> slag and demetallized steel slag, fluidized bed combustion fly ash and waste glass. Meat-bone meal, sewage sludge from sewage treatment plants and paper sludge were evaluated as moderately suitable alternative fuels which can be added in the amounts of 2. 8 wt. % addition of meat-bone meals ash, 3. 64 wt. % addition of sewage sludge ash and 3. 8 wt. % addition of paper sludge ash to the cement raw mixture.

40|$|Slag {{has been}} used in {{concrete}} as a cementitious extender for about 50 years in South Africa. Traditionally, <b>blastfurnace</b> slag {{has been used}} in concrete but recently a new product called Ground Granulated Corex Slag (GGCS) has become available on the market in the Western Cape Province. The objective of this research is to characterise the properties of this new product in concrete. In this study, the properties of corex slag concrete were compared to normal <b>blastfurnace</b> slag and plain CEM I concretes. A series of mixes was undertaken, with water:binder ratios varying between 0. 4 and 0. 3, and slag replacement levels between 30 and 70 %. The physical characterisation of corex slag revealed that the material is finer than <b>blastfurnace</b> slag, having more ultra-fine particles. The oxide analysis showed that the higher proportions of the calcium and magnesium oxides present in corex slag increase the potential for hydraulic activity of the binder compared with <b>blastfurnace</b> slag. The investigation of the fresh concrete properties revealed that the consistence of concrete increases with the use of slag, especially at higher water:binder ratios. <b>Blastfurnace</b> slag performed marginally better than corex slag. The use of slag generally increased the setting time of the paste, with pastes containing corex slag having a shorter final setting time than those containing <b>blastfurnace</b> slag. The setting time was also found to increase with increasing stag replacement level. The increase in setting time caused the bleed time of slag concrete to increase but the total bleed volume was significantly reduced. The bleed properties of concrete were improved when corex slag was used. It was found that the compressive strength of the new cementitious material lagged behind that of CEM I controls during early ages but after seven days, corex slag concrete showed higher strength. The strength was observed to decrease with increasing water:binder ratio. From the compressive strength results, it was deduced that the optimum corex slag substitution rate varied with water:binder ratio, ranging from 45 to 60 % The elastic modulus of corex slag concrete was found to be equal to or higher than CEM I concrete, especially at low water:binder ratios (wtb = 0. 4). Deformation experiments showed that corex slag concrete had the lowest creep and shrinkage strains of all the concretes at low water:binder ratios. At higher water:binder ratios, however, the shrinkage strains were in the same range as the other two materials. Prediction models were also assessed and it was found that no model was able to accurately predict both creep and shrinkage. Generally, the shrinkage predictions were more accurate. Durability index tests showed that corex slag concrete has good to excellent potential durability, based on historical data. Marine exposure testing indicated that corex slag binds a substantial amount of chlorides, hence reducing the risk of corrosion in marine environments. Furthermore, the risk of carbonation-induced corrosion is also decreased. Expansion associated with alkali-silica reaction is minimised with the use of corex slag and the efficiency of the material increases with replacement level. It is concluded that corex slag is an excellent extender for use in concrete. Finally, recommendations are made on the need to further characterise the properties of the material...|$|E
40|$|Supplementary {{cementitious}} materials (SCMs), such as fly ash, pozzolan or <b>blastfurnace</b> slag, {{are widely}} used to produce blended portland cements, since they lead to {{a significant reduction in}} CO 2 emission in the production phase compared to portland cement. A practical and generally accepted approach to evaluate the contribution of SCMs to the strength of the hardened concrete is through the concept of the SCMs efficiency factor (i. e. k-value concept), which expresses the fraction of portland cement that can be replaced by a SCM at unchanged strength. In the literature some studies have also been focused {{on the use of the}} k-value approach also for the resistance against carbonation and chloride penetration of blended portland systems. However, limitations of applicability of SCMs efficiency factor to durability properties are not clear. In this paper the k-value of different SCMs, such as ground limestone, fly ash, natural pozzolan and ground granulated <b>blastfurnace</b> slag, was investigated to detect firstly if it can be applied to carbonation- and chloride-related properties and, secondly, if strength can be considered as a proxy-criterion for durability properties. Results showed k-values lower than 1 for all the SCMs with respect to compressive strength and that these values were valid also for resistance to penetration of carbonation. As far as the resistance to chloride penetration is concerned, k-values derived from strength tests were not applicable and specific k-values should be evaluated; values higher than 1 were calculated for fly ash and ground granulated <b>blastfurnace</b> slag, whilst values lower than 1 were obtained for ground limestone and natural pozzolan...|$|E

Portland cement (CEM I) in concrete is normally partially replaced by supplementary cementitious materials such as ground granulated <b>blastfurnace</b> slag or pulverised fuel ash.

This study has investigated use of waste London clay as a supplementary cementitious material. The optimum calcined clay was produced at 900 °C and concrete made with 30 wt% of CEM I replaced by calcined clay had 28 -day strengths greater than control samples. Compressive strengths of concrete containing calcined London clay were similar to concrete containing ground granulated <b>blastfurnace</b> slag and pulverised fuel ash. The production of calcined London clay emits ∼ 70 kg CO 2 /tonne and this is 91 % lower than CEM I. 30 wt% replacement of CEM I by calcined London clay therefore produces concrete with ∼ 27 % lower embodied carbon.

A mixture of the fungi Aspergillus niger, Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium funiculosum, Paecilomyces variotii and Gliocladium virens was used for testing. The scale for evaluating mould proofness properties according to CSN 72 4310 : 1977 is from 0 to 5 in degree of fungi growth, where a value of 0 means that no growth of fungi occurs and the building products and materials possess fungistatic properties.
