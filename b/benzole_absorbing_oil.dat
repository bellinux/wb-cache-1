The rate of migration and final yield were temperature dependent. The major fatty acids in each type of oil at the equilibrium were used to calculate this amount of <b>absorbed</b> <b>oil.</b> In general overall migration (global migration) from plastics was found to be lower in PET and PVC compared to PS and PP. When comparing the absorption of different oils into plastics, the ranking was PS>PP>PVC>PET. The type of oil was found not only influence the global migration but also the amount of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>oil.</b> Global migration was found to be slightly higher into oil contained high amount of short-chain and unsaturated fatty acids. The results are also discussed the effect of temperature and storage time on the migration level and oil absorption...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{caused by}} the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico can be greatly reduced by using natural products, such as cotton, in lieu of synthetics to <b>absorb</b> and recover <b>oil</b> from the ocean. Cotton and many cotton byproducts are much more efficient than synthetics in <b>absorbing</b> <b>oil.</b> Agricultural engineers reported in 1994 that cotton fiber can absorb about 40 times its weight in oil, as compared to synthetics that currently absorb 10 to 20 times their weight. The <b>oil</b> <b>absorbed</b> by cotton along with the cotton itself will degrade naturally in the environment, {{which is not the}} case for synthetics. Additionally, cotton fiber and its fibrous byproducts can be reused to <b>absorb</b> additional <b>oil.</b> Research by agricultural engineer and ASABE Fellow Wm. Stanley Anthony at the U. S. Department of Agriculture (Anthony, 1994) demonstrated that cotton lint absorbs up to 80 times its weight in oil, and cleaned lint cleaner waste can absorb up to 67 times its weight in oil. Gin waste products containing more lint fiber by weight were more effective than those whose composition was dominated by non-lint materials such as hulls and seed cotton cleaner waste. With chemical modifications such as the addition of acetic anhydride, the absorptive capacity can be increased. Furthermore, cotton can be reused through several cycles after removal of <b>absorbed</b> <b>oil</b> although the oil absorption decreases (Deschamps et al., 2003). Based on these reports, lint-containing cotton fiber and fibrous gin waste products appear to be superior to many of the synthetic materials currently being used in the oil cleanup...|$|R

50|$|Earlier, a {{magnetic}} boron-doped MWNT nanosponge that could <b>absorb</b> <b>oil</b> from water. The sponge was grown as a forest on a substrate via chemical vapor disposition. Boron puts kinks and elbows into the tubes {{as they grow}} and promotes the formation of covalent bonds. The nanosponges retain their elastic property after 10,000 compressions in the lab. The sponges are both superhydrophobic, forcing them to remain at the water's surface and oleophilic, drawing oil to them.|$|R
5000|$|For the Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{that began in}} April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, HeiQ, TWE Group and Beyond Surface Technologies jointly {{developed}} an oil-absorbing, water-repelling, nonwoven fabric, in the name Oilguard [...] for oil relief efforts. The product was intended for beach protection against oil spills and {{was applied to the}} shoreline. This allows for the fabric to <b>absorb</b> crude <b>oil</b> while repelling the seawater. This innovation was rewarded the Swiss Technology Award (2010) and the Swiss Award (2013). The water-repelling property of Oilguard is achieved with a textile finishing that creates the Lotus Effect {{on the surface of the}} non-woven fabric. The non-fluorinated finishing makes the fabric only water repellent but not oil repellent, therefore the fabric <b>absorbs</b> <b>oil</b> crudes but not the seawater.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in off-shore oil exploration and drilling technology, accidental oil spills do occur. Depending on their magnitude and location, irreparable damage may be inflicted on marine and coastal ecosystems. Emulsification of a water/surfactant/oil system {{results in the}} production of oil droplets and this depends on the formulation and composition variables, mixing characteristics and system preparation. Thus, research is ongoing on improving methods of cleaning up oil spills. Cactus mucilage was used to disperse and <b>absorb</b> <b>oil</b> from a simulated oil slick in different salt concentrations. Results show correlations between emulsion properties and interfacial characteristics of mucilage as function of aqueous phase salinity. Mucilage powder added to the oil floating on the water dispersed the <b>oil</b> film and <b>absorbed</b> the <b>oil</b> while remaining afloat, facilitates removal of the oil-mucilage aggregate. This invention is a competitive treatment for oil spill remediation with the added advantage of being more environmentally friendly...|$|R
40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf <b>absorbs</b> the <b>oil</b> thus making it soaked and the <b>absorbed</b> <b>oil</b> can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the <b>absorbed</b> <b>oil</b> from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), worm shaft (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. The worm shaft was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil extractor machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core. The operation of the machine does not require any technical-know-how and the machine can be easily maintained as it has the tendency of self-lubricating the extraction chamber due to presence of oil in the input materials...|$|R

40|$|To {{efficiently}} {{remove and}} recycle oil spills, we construct aligned ZnO nanorod arrays {{on the surface}} of the porous stainless steel wire mesh to fabricate a porous unmanned ship (PUS) with properties of sup erhydrophobicity, superoleophilicity, and low drag by imitating the structure of nonwetting leg of water strider. The super-hydrophobicity of the PUS is stable, which can support 16. 5 cm water column with pore size of 100 mu m. Water droplet can rebound without adhesion. In the process of oil/water separation, when the PUS contacts with oil, the oil is quickly pulled toward and penetrates into the PUS automatically. The superhydrophobicity and low water adhesion force of the PUS surface endow the PUS with high oil recovery capacity (above 94 %) and drag-reducing property (31 % at flowing velocity of 0. 38 m/s). In addition, the PUS has good corrosion resistance and reusability. We further investigate the wetting behavior of water and oil, oil recovery capacity, drag-reducing property, and corrosion resistance of the PUS after <b>oil</b> <b>absorbed.</b> The PUS surface changes significantly from superhydrophobic to hydrophobic after <b>absorbing</b> <b>oil.</b> However, the <b>oil</b> <b>absorbed</b> PUS possesses better drag-reducing property and corrosion resistance due to the changes of the motion state of the water droplets...|$|R

The effects of crude oil on the properties of concrete are not well known and little data {{is available in the}} published literature.

All the specimens were oven dried to increase the permeability of concrete to oil and to increase the degree of oil saturation. The results were compared with those of similar specimens soaked in water or sealed in polythene bags as control specimens. The mechanical properties. of HCPs, mortar, and concrete studied here were adversely affected by oil saturation. The compressive strength and elastic modulus were reduced by amounts depending on the amount of <b>oil</b> <b>absorbed.</b> The tensile strength was also reduced due to soaking in oil but the reduction was less than that of the companion specimens sealed as a reference.
