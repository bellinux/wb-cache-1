5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they felt, they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the <b>battery</b> <b>unit</b> site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E

The crew also installed new thermal blanket insulating panels to provide improved thermal protection, and a soft-capture mechanism that would aid in the safe de-orbiting of the telescope by an unmanned spacecraft {{at the end of}} its operational lifespan. The mission also carried an IMAX camera with which the crew documented the progress of the mission for the Hubble IMAX movie.|$|E

The {{advantage}} of some solar powered units {{is that they}} have much more power over their lifetime than <b>battery</b> powered <b>units.</b> This gives them the advantage to report their position and status much more often than <b>battery</b> <b>units</b> which need to conserve their energy to extend their life. Some wireless solar powered units, such as the RailRider can report more than 20,000 times per year and work indefinitely on solar power eliminating the need to change batteries.|$|R
50|$|The infirm or {{unreliable}} {{secondary power}} from the renewable energy such as solar and wind power plants {{can be used to}} follow the load or stabilize the grid frequency with the help of <b>battery</b> storage <b>units</b> at a cost of $450,000 per MWh. When the grid frequency is below the desired or rated value, the power being generated (if any) and the stored battery power is fed to the grid to raise the grid frequency. When the grid frequency is above the desired or rated value, the power being generated is fed or surplus grid power is drawn (in case cheaply available) to the <b>battery</b> <b>units</b> for energy storage. The grid frequency keeps on fluctuating 50 to 100 times in a day above and below the rated value {{depending on the type of}} load encountered and the type of generating plants in the electrical grid. Recently, the cost of <b>battery</b> <b>units,</b> solar power plants, etc. have come down drastically to utilise secondary power for power grid stabilization as an on line spinning reserve.|$|R

50|$|A local backup <b>battery</b> <b>unit</b> is {{necessary}} in some telephony and combined telephony/data applications built with use of digital passive optical networks. In such networks there are active units on telephone exchange side and on the user side, but nodes between them are all passive in the meaning of electrical power usage. So, if a building (such as an apartment house) loses power, the network continues to function. The user side must have standby power since operating power isn't transferred over data optical line.|$|E
