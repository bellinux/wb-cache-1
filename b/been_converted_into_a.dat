These actions included the United States occupation of Veracruz, during which the ship's commander was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Stone is quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales.

5|$|The pier was an {{immediate}} success and quickly {{became one of the}} most popular landmarks in Brighton.

Both Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin performed at the pier to hone their comic skills early in their career, before migrating to the US and finding major commercial success in Hollywood.

5|$|The station's opening {{effectively}} {{filled a}} gap in provision, as lines in the area had already been constructed; the Whiteinch and Stobcross Railways both opened in 1874, but no station was constructed on these lines at Jordanhill. A new link allowed services to Whiteinch Victoria Park to begin in 1897, but they ceased in 1951 and the link was closed to freight in 1967. The route of the link has <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nature walk from Victoria Park to Jordanhill station, running alongside the existing line for approximately half its length.|$|E
5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have {{been taken over by}} London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E
