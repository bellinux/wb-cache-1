5|$|The {{cattle egret}} {{is a popular}} bird with cattle ranchers for its {{perceived}} role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, M.A.C. {{expanded}} its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it {{changed its name}} to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> John A. Hannah, became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, {{with the help of the}} 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.|$|E

25|$|In the town's {{early years}} {{manufactured}} goods were brought overland by wagons or along the White River by keelboats and flatboats, {{but much of}} the local produce was not exported to markets outside Indianapolis until railroads began passing through in the city in the 1850s. Most of Indianapolis's early merchants set up businesses along Washington Street, the town's main street, but its first market house was built north of the courthouse in 1833. Subsequent structures on the site became known as the Indianapolis City Market. Agricultural production remained an important part of Indianapolis's early history. The Marion County Agricultural Society was organized in 1825, and the Marion County <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and the Indiana State <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> were established in 1835.

25|$|Walton {{looked to}} his {{predecessor}} Robertson for many ideas of his administration. Just as education {{had been a}} large part of Robertson’s programs, so it became with Walton.

In true progressive manner, Walton instituted harsher penalties for breaking state laws and regulations, increased spending on welfare programs, and instituted a farm stabilization program {{under the supervision of the}} State <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture.</b>|$|E

25|$|After resigning {{from the}} College, Williams was elected Michigan's {{lieutenant}} governor and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. That new law mandated that the College have a four-year curriculum {{and the power}} to grant degrees comparable to those of the University of Michigan– that is, master's degrees (and, much later, doctoral degrees). Under the act, a newly created body known as the State <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution. At that time, the legislature adopted the more pronounceable name of State Agricultural College.|$|E

The Alaska Creamery Board, which oversaw the dairy and made the request, met in May and discussed privatizing or possibly closing the dairy. It subsequently voted to close the dairy and, on June 13, rejected Palin's public request that it keep the dairy open, saying it stood by its decision to close the dairy plant as July 7.|$|E
50|$|The {{readership}} for Amos's books {{during his}} lifetime was probably only a few hundred, though his articles in Young's Annals <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture's</b> Communications would certainly have reached a greater number, and reviews and cyclopedia entries would have extended knowledge of his ideas still further. Unlike many of the best-known pioneers of the Agricultural Revolution, men such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, Jethro Tull and Sir John Sinclair), Amos had neither the wealth nor the social standing to promote his ideas, but his publications establish him as an important contributor {{to the development of}} improved and evidence-based agricultural practice in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.|$|R

5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture's</b> Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|R
