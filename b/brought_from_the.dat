5|$|This is the Ottoman {{development}} of the composite bow, presumably <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> steppes. Turkish bows evolved, after the decline of military archery, into probably the best traditional flight bows. Their decoration often included delicate and beautiful multicoloured designs with gold.|$|E

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
5|$|In 1829 a Mastiff like dog was <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Great St Bernard Hospice and was {{exhibited}} in London and Liverpool {{to thousands of}} people. This publicised {{the existence of an}} Alpine Mastiff, but drawings of the dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition, and the descriptions of the Spaniel were ridiculed by later publications.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It {{is estimated that}} for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.|$|E

5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|On {{the rooftop}} and roof ridges are iconic statues of golden deer {{flanking}} a Dharma wheel, victory flags and monstrous fish. The temple interior {{is a dark}} labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E

DB Cargo UK haul coal from the nearby ports of Hull and Immingham, and from Hunterston Terminal {{on the west coast}} of Scotland. Freightliner Group move coal imported through Redcar.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wharfs and {{fired at the}} church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E

5|$|In 1854, John Rae, while {{surveying}} the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), discovered {{further evidence of}} the expedition's fate. Rae met an Inuk near Pelly Bay (now Kugaaruk, Nunavut) on 21 April 1854, who told him of a party of 35 to 40white men who had died of starvation near the mouth of the Back River. Other Inuit confirmed this story, which included reports of cannibalism among the dying sailors. The Inuit showed Rae many objects that were identified as having belonged to Franklin and his men. In particular, Rae <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Inuit several silver forks and spoons later identified as belonging to Franklin, Fitzjames, Crozier, and Robert Osmer Sargent, a shipmate aboard Erebus. Rae's report was sent to the Admiralty, which in October 1854 urged the HBC to send an expedition down the Back River to search for other signs of Franklin and his men.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It {{is estimated that}} for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive. In at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for their participation in the conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{the king}} decides {{to take a}} drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their {{carriage}} passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, {{who falls in love}} with him at once.|$|E

5|$|Polo {{was finally}} {{released}} from captivity in August 1299, {{and returned home}} to Venice, where his father and uncle in the meantime had purchased a large palazzo in the zone named contrada San Giovanni Crisostomo (Corte del Milion). For such a venture, the Polo family probably invested profits from trading, and even many gemstones they <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East. The company continued its activities and Marco soon became a wealthy merchant. Marco and his uncle Maffeo financed other expeditions, but likely never left Venetian provinces, nor returned to the Silk Road and Asia. Sometime before 1300, his father Niccolò died. In 1300, he married Donata Badoèr, the daughter of Vitale Badoèr, a merchant. They had three daughters, Fantina (married Marco Bragadin), Bellela (married Bertuccio Querini), and Moreta.|$|E
5|$|The French {{military}} invaded Antananarivo in September 1894, {{prompting the}} queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted {{a hole through}} a building at the Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo, walkways and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive. They chose Antaninarenina as {{the site for the}} French Governor General's Residency; upon independence it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure were introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs {{at the foot of the}} hill, was <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ikopa River.|$|E
5|$|The acting Commander, 7th Division Australian Army Service Corps (AASC), Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Richardson, assumed {{control of}} {{logistics}} {{on the track}} on 10 September. Supplies were then <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Base Supply Depots at Sogeri and Ilolo to Newton's Depot in 3-ton trucks by the 2/5th AASC Company. The 2/4th AASC Company moved them by jeep to the roadhead at Owers' Corner. The flying fox was used {{to take them to}} the floor of the Goldie River Valley, from whence the 1st Independent Light Horse Troop carried them to Uberi. From there, they were carried on the backs of Papuan porters, known as carriers. If there were more stores than the animals could carry, they would assist with that too.|$|E
