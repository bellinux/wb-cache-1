The investigations to search the optimal design of the support structure were conducted in order to solve such problem. At the first stage patent and bibliographic analysis of technical solutions was done, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} were revealed and new design options were proposed, the most efficient design was determined. The next step is objective function making for determining its optimal parameters, imposition of restrictions, acquisition of objective function approximation and restrictions in the form of polynomials. At the third stage numerical implementation of function optimization was proposed, optimal design parameters were determined with graphical method. Results methods have coincided. Findings. The most efficient design of support structure was determined; its optimum geometrical dimensions were described. Originality. The author provides the mathematical formulation of optimal design of tank car supports using the minimum materials consumption criteria. The graphic and numerical methods were used during the investigations. Practical value.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{synthetically}} analyzed essential {{features of}} various support methods in engineering geological soft rock, proposed a scheme that organically combines active support(like anchor bolt support) with passive support (like U-shaped steel <b>bracket</b> <b>support),</b> analyzed fundamentals of this combined support scheme, and forecasted support {{effect of this}} support scheme. It provides roadway support design with fresh ideas. U-shaped steel bracket can be translated into special anchor plate {{with the help of}} a section of simple steel channel beam, so effect of anchor bolt can be ensured; U-shaped steel bracket, this extremely long curved beam,will be divided into several sections of short beams, so its bearing ability will be several times improved. Cost of this combined support scheme is low, its process is simple and its application prospect is wide. 1 Engineering geological features of soft rock At present, soft rock that scholars are talking about is the “engineering soft rock”, that is, the engineering rock which will have a significant plastic deformation under the actions of engineering forces. Engineering soft rock is divided into four categories: expansive soft rock (or low-pressure soft rock), high-stress soft rock, fractured soft rock and composite soft rock...|$|E

40|$|In an {{aircraft}} engine, basic functionality of configuration {{system is to}} form the network of supply lines for air, fuel & oil. Configuration hardware mainly consists of tubes, ducts, valves & support brackets. Many of the Aircraft engines are failed due to failure of fuel pipes and caused big hazards. Hence to avoid accidents, hard wares are designed properly against the failures. In order to use the resources properly optimum design of hard wares is necessary. The two basic design requirements for configuration systems are: (a) high cycle fatigue (vibratory stresses) and (b) low cycle fatigue (thermally induced stresses). Under these design requirements optimum design can be done through the selection of critical design parameters. Critical design parameters in a configuration system considered {{in the present study}} are: (i) Support location for the tube layout and (ii) <b>Bracket</b> <b>support</b> type at this location. The judicious selections of these two design parameters greatly influence the high cycle fatigue and low cycle fatigue life. This also helps in reducing the weight and cost of the system. Design optimisation is an iterative process and computer software can help to obtain an optimum design. In the present study, user friendly software is developed using TCL/TK environment. This is linked with a commercial software ANSYS and PEZ tool. ANSYS is used to carry out the structural analysis considering preliminary support locations. Analysis results from ANSYS are the inputs for the optimization analysis. PEZ tool modifies the support locations based on the optimization results. ANSYS will analyse the structure once again based on the modified support locations. This loop will continue till target reaches...|$|E
