5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 recalibration, a clear divergence <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E

They were allowed to return after 1856. During their period of exile, rivalry <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> factions became obvious, a conflict which became the basis for political allegiances in later years.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gates {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either the dialogue <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> characters or the thoughts of the protagonist.

Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part of}} the wooden core of the bow.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 25 May, {{the ground}} forces of XV Mountain Corps {{were not able}} to advance as quickly as planned. There was {{unexpected}} resistance from the Partisan 1st, 5th and 8th Corps along their axes of advance, and there was very poor communication and coordination <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> columns. The ground forces were also subjected to Allied air attacks throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state movement of goods, but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out for more, and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year after he left the FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E
5|$|NWA/WCW United States Tag Team Championship reigns were {{determined}} by professional wrestling matches, in which competitors are involved in scripted rivalries. These narratives create feuds <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> competitors, which cast them as villains and heroes. Overall, there were 19 reigns among 15 tag teams, all of which occurred in the United States. From the information known, The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane)'s first reign was the longest in the title's history at 346 days, while The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers)' second reign was the shortest, at 19 days. The Midnight Express also held the most reigns overall as a tag team and individually, with three.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May, Morgan {{was in a}} {{position}} to advance in force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking advantage of the poor communications <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>various</b> elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and over the next few days the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E
