50|$|The only {{significant}} mechanical {{change from the}} FB was {{the introduction of the}} first automatic transmission to be offered on a Holden. Marketed as the Hydra-Matic, it was a well-regarded three-speed unit which was fully imported from the United States. It was only offered as an option on the Holden Special models. Other options included more than 30 approved NASCO Accessories, such as a <b>bonnet</b> <b>lock,</b> a locking tank cap, a car heater, external rear-view mirrors, or a sunshade.|$|E
2500|$|The GT variant {{gained a}} bigger V8, the [...] Canadian-made Windsor engine, {{producing}} [...] equipped with dual exhausts and sports air cleaner. The styling of the GT went wilder {{with the addition}} of an offset racing-style <b>bonnet</b> scoop, <b>bonnet</b> <b>locks,</b> and blackouts, as well as 'Super Roo' stripes along the full length of the car (these and the bonnet blackouts were a 'delete option'). GT wheels were now 12-slot steel with flat centre caps over the lug nuts and stainless steel dress rims. The twin 'driving lights' introduced on the XT GT were carried over to the XW GT.|$|R
2500|$|Power-assisted front {{disc brakes}} were now {{standard}} across the Falcon range. The GT {{variant of the}} XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland [...] V8 known as the 'big port' engine, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with 'small port' heads. A notable difference in performance is seen between these engines, and also in resale value, as the early US-powered GTs are rarer, so more collectable. The twin driving lights remained, as did the <b>bonnet</b> <b>locks.</b> The <b>bonnet</b> scoops of the GT were now integrated into the [...] "power bulge" [...] on the bonnet, the bumpers were now body-coloured, and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and valances were painted in a contrasting colour to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).|$|R
50|$|The M4 {{was used}} as a safety car at MotoGP races from 2014-present. The car was {{unveiled}} at the 2014 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix. It features Recaro racing seats , a roll bar, <b>bonnet</b> with motorsport <b>lock,</b> LED lights at roof and front apron, main electricity switch at bonnet, removal of the rear seat, fuel pump system, a fire extinguisher and a race display on the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|The car {{was based}} on the XB Falcon 500 Hardtop and {{featured}} a 302 inÂ³ (4.9 L) Cleveland V8, and some specific options including the GS Rally Pack which featured full dash instrumentation, a 3-spoke steering wheel, vented <b>bonnet</b> (hood) with <b>locking</b> pins, and 12-slot steel road wheels. A separate item featured on all John Goss Special hardtops were the cosmetic side body vents that were also a feature of contemporary Falcon GT hardtops.|$|R
40|$|DE 3915862 A UPAB: 19930928 The {{motor vehicle}} is {{provided}} with a centrally controlled locking system for the doors, boot lid, and <b>bonnet.</b> Each <b>lock</b> is actuated by means of two rolling diaphragms (10, 11) installed in chambers (4) and (5) respectively which are mounted side by side. The diagram shows the lock mechanism in the locked position. The lock is released either by actuating an outside lever (24) or an inside lever (25) which set the pump (8) operating. This pump draws air from the chamber (5) so that the rolling diaphragm moves upwards and swings the anti-theft lever (17) upwards. The rod (27) attached to the diaphragm (11) opens the valve (9) so that air is drawn from the second chamber (4) and the second diaphragm moves upwards together with the rod (12) to allow the security lever (14) to move upwards. The mechanism is held in this position by a spring-loaded ball catch (20). USE - Central locking for motor vehicles. 1 /...|$|R

If I posted the letter, it wouldn't go. Besides, to-morrow I may hear from Mrs. Oldershaw. I ought to wait to hear from Mrs. Oldershaw. I can't {{consider}} myself a free woman till I know what Mrs. Oldershaw means to do. There is a necessity for waiting till to-morrow. I shall take my <b>bonnet</b> off, and <b>lock</b> the letter up in my desk." ...|$|R
