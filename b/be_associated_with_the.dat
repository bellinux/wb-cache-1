Some of the 32mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear to <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Incapillo volcanic complex. These rocks form the last pulse of the Pircas Negras volcanism. Specific ages of the Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4.7±0.5mya, 3.2±0.3mya and 1.9±0.2mya. Later, andesitic-rhyolitic volcanism formed ignimbrites and lava domes 2.9±0.4–1.1±0.4mya, with the youngest pre-caldera dome being 0.873±0.077mya old. The lava domes formed through non-explosive extrusion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E

When he headed the English Department, it introduced the study of Commonwealth/New Literatures in English, and of English language as a major so that graduates would be better equipped to teach English in schools and junior colleges.

5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted.

Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Moon itself but could {{be a result of}} unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E
5|$|Osiris's {{death is}} {{followed}} either by an interregnum or by {{a period in}} which Set assumes the kingship. Meanwhile, Isis searches for her husband's body with the aid of Nephthys. When searching for or mourning Osiris, the two goddesses are often likened to falcons or kites, possibly because kites travel far in search of carrion, because the Egyptians associated their plaintive calls with cries of grief, or because of the goddesses' connection with Horus, who is often represented as a falcon. In the New Kingdom, when Osiris's death and renewal came to <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> annual flooding of the Nile that fertilized Egypt, the waters of the Nile were equated with Isis's tears of mourning, or with Osiris's bodily fluids. Osiris thus represented the life-giving divine power that was present in the river's water and in the plants that grew after the flood.|$|E

5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disease.
