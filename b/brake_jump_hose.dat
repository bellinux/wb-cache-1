6000|$|... "Now I'll die," [...] he said, in a detached, dreamy voice, {{as though}} he were the dying motion of the swing. She watched him, fascinated. Suddenly he put on the <b>brake</b> and <b>jumped</b> out.|$|R
50|$|On January 13, 2008, a home-built {{aircraft}} ran {{off the end}} of runway 21 after a <b>brake</b> failure, <b>jumped</b> {{over the}} hillside, landing on a service road. The three passengers on board were not hurt, although the kit-built aircraft was damaged severely. The runway was closed for 20 minutes.|$|R
25|$|The {{hollow shaft}} {{mechanism}} lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear {{that the driver}} is likely to need next under acceleration or <b>braking,</b> or <b>jump</b> immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain {{in control of the}} vehicle at all times.|$|R
50|$|Due to a {{breakdown}} in communication, {{the crew of the}} coal train was not aware the specials were approaching. They backed their train onto the main line just before the lead special arrived. The engineer of the special was able to throw the engine into reverse, set the <b>brake,</b> and <b>jump</b> clear of his engine, but {{he was not able to}} prevent the collision.|$|R
5000|$|Boomerang: The rider {{applies the}} front <b>brakes</b> and <b>jumps</b> {{from either the}} pedals or rear {{dropouts}} while tucking the legs into the chest and spins around with the handlebars 360 degrees. *note* Can be done without brakes, {{also known as a}} Rolling Boomerang. A variant of the Rolling Boomerang exists known as the Stick Man, with the rider leaving the legs straight out and to the side while locking the handlebars level with the hips.|$|R
50|$|Daredevil Dennis is a {{platform}} game of sorts where the player takes {{the role of}} Daredevil Dennis, a stuntman. Dennis must {{use a variety of}} vehicles (motorbike, jet-ski and ski-doo) to perform a number of stunts. The only controls are accelerate, <b>brake</b> and <b>jump.</b> The screen is split into four platforms. When the character leaves the end of one, he appears {{at the start of the}} next. Both the controls and screen layout are same as in Atari's 1977 Stunt Cycle arcade game.|$|R
50|$|Percy And The Brake VanPercy {{thinks he}} has no need for brake vans {{at the end of}} his goods trains. Percy sets off with his goods train without {{realising}} his brake van has not been coupled. A weak coupling breaks and the trucks run downhill! The guard quickly jumps in to put his <b>brakes</b> on and <b>jumps</b> straight out! He manages to halt the trucks and the brake van stays on the rails. Percy realises brake vans are useful after all.|$|R
50|$|Mieres scored {{his best}} result of 1953, however, in the non-championship Grand Prix de l'Albigeois held in Albi, France, {{finishing}} in fourth place. He also {{finished third in}} a sports car handicap race at Caen in July 1953, which was won by Jean Chancel. In January 1954 Mieres came in second at the Buenos Aires Grand Prix. Maurice Trintignant was victorious after Mike Hawthorn skidded close to the finish. The tail of Mieres' Maserati caught fire during the 1954 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps. After belatedly realising this, he slammed on the <b>brakes</b> and <b>jumped</b> to safety. Mieres then finished fifth in a Maserati at the 1954 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. In the 1957 City of Buenos Aires sports car race Mieres drove a 3.5 litre Jaguar to a fourth-place finish. His driving partner was Ninian Sanderson of Scotland. Mieres later teamed with Anton Van Dorey for a win in the 1959 USAC Road Racing Championship Daytona 1,000 km, the predecessor to the modern Rolex 24 at Daytona.|$|R
40|$|This wooden {{schooner}} {{was built}} in 1892 at Algomac, Michigan and listed out of Port Huron in the early days. In 1906 she was owned by Chas. A. Eddy of Bay City, Mich. She was stranded and lost in 1907. This view from 1895 shows the old harbor entrance during the 1890 s. "Abram Smith" is layed up at the wooden lighthouse on the west pier, which was rebuilt in 1875, replacing the former one that stood there built in 1831. The old pier was in a delapidated condition. In {{the early part of}} 1900 this was replaced by a wider concrete pier and the coast guard station was built at about where the break in the dock shows. This was replaced in 1895 by a more modern station. In that year an accident occured on Nov. 16 when the draw of the Central Ave. viaduct was open to let the "Abram Smith" go through. The draw was open when a Cedar-Jennings Ave. street car was crossing from the east. The derailing system was in use at the time, and on approaching the derailer, the conductor got off the car, set the switch and gave the go-ahead sign. Jumping on the car, he entered, and as the car came near the open draw too late, the motorman applied the <b>brakes</b> and <b>jumped</b> just as the car was ready to make its plunge. The car dropped 100 ft. into 15 ft. of water. Seventeen lives were lost, four were saved...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or <b>braking,</b> or <b>jump</b> immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|R
