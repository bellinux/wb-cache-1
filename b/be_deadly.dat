5|$|Strategies {{to defend}} {{themselves}} against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, {{and their ability to}} hide. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> to humans.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning in mud under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E

Several companies have been researching the abilities of this chemical to help memory loss due to various diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Gilatide, derived from exendin-4, {{has been shown to}} dramatically heighten memory in a study with mice. Gilatide is likely to be researched further to provide help to Alzheimer’s patients.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> for pups.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, it can <b>be</b> <b>deadly.</b> Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side}} of the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E

5|$|While {{members of}} the Liliaceae s.s. {{have been used as}} food sources in humans, the bulbs of some species are {{poisonous}} to household pets (bulb toxicosis) if eaten and may cause serious complications, such as renal failure in cats from Lilies, particularly Lilium longiflorum (Easter Lily). Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. Fritillaria imperialis, Fritillaria meleagris) bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> if ingested in quantity, while other species such as Fritillaria camschatcensis and Fritillaria affinis are edible. Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves and stems of Fritillaria. These are also toxic to a variety of animals.|$|E

25|$|During the American Revolution, Middlesex Parish was {{controlled}} by Patriots but frequently raided by local Tories who had fled to British-controlled Lloyd's Neck on Long Island. Often, their property had been confiscated and the raids offered them vengeance, recompense or both. They would row across the Sound on whaleboats to steal food and clothes for their families. The raids could <b>be</b> <b>deadly,</b> and on foggy or moonless nights Patriots had to keep especially wary.|$|E

25|$|Skin has mesodermal cells, pigmentation, such as melanin {{provided}} by melanocytes, which absorb {{some of the}} potentially dangerous ultraviolet radiation (UV) in sunlight. It also contains DNA repair enzymes that help reverse UV damage, such that people lacking the genes for these enzymes suffer high rates of skin cancer. One form predominantly produced by UV light, malignant melanoma, is particularly invasive, causing it to spread quickly, and can often <b>be</b> <b>deadly.</b> Human skin pigmentation varies among populations in a striking manner. This {{has led to the}} classification of people(s) on the basis of skin color.|$|E
25|$|The northeastern Hindu Kush {{mountain}} range, in {{and around}} the Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan, is in a geologically active area where earthquakes may occur almost every year. They can <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> and destructive sometimes, causing landslides in some parts or avalanches during the winter. The last strong earthquakes were in 1998, which killed about 6,000 people in Badakhshan near Tajikistan. This was followed by the 2002 Hindu Kush earthquakes in which over 150 people were killed and over 1,000 injured. A 2010 earthquake left 11 Afghans dead, over 70 injured, and more than 2,000 houses destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Nematodes {{commonly}} parasitic {{on humans}} include ascarids (Ascaris), filarias, hookworms, pinworms (Enterobius), and whipworms (Trichuris trichiura). The species Trichinella spiralis, {{commonly known as}} the 'trichina worm', occurs in rats, pigs, and humans, and is responsible for the disease trichinosis. Baylisascaris usually infests wild animals, but can <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> to humans, as well. Dirofilaria immitis are known for causing heartworm disease by inhabiting the hearts, arteries, and lungs of dogs and some cats. Haemonchus contortus {{is one of the most}} abundant infectious agents in sheep around the world, causing great economic damage to sheep. In contrast, entomopathogenic nematodes parasitize insects and are mostly considered beneficial by humans, but some attack beneficial insects.|$|E

25|$|In the {{electric}} eel, some 5,000 to 6,000 stacked electroplaques {{can make a}} shock up to 860 volts and 1 ampere of current (860 watts) for two milliseconds. Such a shock is extremely unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> for an adult human, due to the very short duration of the discharge. Atrial fibrillation requires that roughly 700 mA be delivered across the heart muscle for 30 ms or more, far longer than the eel can produce. Still, this level of current is reportedly enough to produce a brief and painful numbing shock likened to a stun gun discharge, which due to the voltage can be felt for {{some distance from the}} fish; this is a common risk for aquarium caretakers and biologists attempting to handle or examine electric eels.|$|E
25|$|Domitian's reign {{marked a}} {{significant}} turning {{point on the}} road to monarchy. After making himself Consul for ten years, Domitian made himself Censor for life, and unlike his father, he used these powers to further subjugate the senate by controlling its membership. He also changed the law so that he could preside over capital trials against senators. The manner in which he was able to dominate his Consular colleagues helped to further illustrate the powerlessness of the Consulship. To reduce the risk of an armed uprising against him, Domitian ensured that no single general could command more than two legions at once. Domitian did, however, divide the empire into smaller administrative units. This system was quite efficient, and was revived two centuries later by the emperor Diocletian. Domitian, ultimately, was a tyrant with the character which always makes tyranny repulsive, and this derived in part from his own paranoia. Since he had no son, and thus no obvious heir, he was constantly in danger of being overthrown. Thus, the unresolved issue of succession again proved to <b>be</b> <b>deadly,</b> and in September 96, Domitian was murdered.|$|E
25|$|However, for Derbyshire Mitchell {{went from}} {{strength}} to {{strength in the}} dry summers of 1933 and 1934, at times bowling with sensational skill, as when he dismissed Worcestershire for 48 on a good pitch in 1934. He {{was close to the}} top of the averages in those two seasons, but from the 1935 season appeared to sacrifice length to gain more spin and often suffered heavy punishment. Still, he could <b>be</b> <b>deadly</b> on his best days, as when he took all ten wickets in an innings against Leicestershire for 64 runs at Leicester in 1935 or when he took 7 for 26 against Gloucestershire on a blameless pitch at Derby a year later. Mitchell set a record for Derbyshire with 168 wickets in 1935, but in Derbyshire's Championship win in the 1936 season he was considerably less successful and at times very expensive even when conditions favoured bowlers (e.g. against Kent at Burton-on-Trent and Warwickshire at Edgbaston). Still, on Mitchell's good days Derbyshire's bowling that season could compare with almost any county side in history, and the following two seasons still saw him as one of the best spin bowlers in England.|$|E

500|$|The carronade {{was adopted}} by the Royal Navy in 1779; the lower muzzle {{velocity}} of the round shot when fired from this cannon was intended to create more wooden [...] when hitting the structure of an enemy vessel, as they were believed to <b>be</b> <b>deadly.</b> The carronade was much shorter, and weighed between a third to a quarter less than an equivalent long gun; for example, a 32pounder carronade weighed less than a ton, compared with a 32pounder long gun, which weighed over 3tons. The guns were, therefore, easier to handle, and also required less than half as much gunpowder, allowing fewer men to crew them. Carronades were manufactured in the usual naval gun calibers, but were not counted in a ship of the line's rated number of guns. As a result, the classification of Royal Navy vessels in this period can be misleading, as they often carried more cannon than were listed.|$|E
500|$|By {{end of the}} 15th century, several {{technological}} advancements were made, making cannon more mobile. Wheeled gun carriages and trunnions became common, and {{the invention of the}} limber further facilitated the transportation of artillery. As a result, field artillery became viable, and began to emerge, often used alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges. The better gunpowder, improved, cast-iron projectiles, and the standardization of calibers meant that even relatively light cannon could <b>be</b> <b>deadly.</b> In The Art of War, Niccolò Machiavelli observed that [...] "It is true that the arquebuses and the small artillery do much more harm than the heavy artillery." [...] This was the case at Flodden, in 1513: the English field guns outpaced the Scottish siege artillery, firing twice, or even thrice, as many rounds. Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still much slower {{than the rest of the}} army: a heavy English cannon required 23 horses to transport, while a culverin, nine, yet, even with this many animals transporting them, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organization, discipline, and tactics, the combination of pike and shot still dominated the battlefields of Europe.|$|E
