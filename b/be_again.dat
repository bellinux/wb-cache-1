5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector was to <b>be</b> <b>again</b> the Thomas gate, {{to take full}} advantage of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps so that they could not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2001) {{takes place}} in the future, when Jason has again been inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig), decides that cryonic {{suspension}} is the only method of stopping him, but Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he can <b>be</b> <b>again</b> imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the cryo‑chamber, but he ruptures the tank and freezes both himself and Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams. Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

25|$|The {{infantry}} came to <b>be</b> <b>again</b> {{organized in}} regiments in 1842. It now included the Queen's Grenadiers Regiment, 16 line infantry regiments and 18 caçadores battalions.

In 1855, it would however cease to have a special status and be transformed into a regular line infantry regiment.|$|E

25|$|Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS): The CAPS is {{a direct}} sensing {{instrument}} that measures the energy and electrical charge of particles that the instrument encounters (the number of electrons and protons in the particle). CAPS measured the molecules originating from Saturn's ionosphere and also determine the configuration of Saturn's magnetic field. CAPS also investigated plasma in these areas {{as well as the}} solar wind within Saturn's magnetosphere. CAPS was turned off June 2011 due to an electrical short circuit that occurred in the instrument. The instrument was powered on in March 2012; after 78 days a second short circuit forced the instrument to <b>be</b> <b>again</b> shut down.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Langton {{continued}} under Henry's reign to {{work for}} the political independence of England. In 1223 he again appeared as the leader and spokesman of the barons, who demanded that King Henry confirm the charter. He went to France on Henry's behalf to call on Louis VIII of France for the restoration of Normandy, and later he supported Henry against rebellious barons. He obtained a promise from the new pope, Honorius III, that during his lifetime no resident legate should <b>be</b> <b>again</b> sent to England, and won other concessions from the same pontiff favourable to the English Church and exalting the see of Canterbury.|$|E

25|$|The 18 {{teams were}} divided into two groups of nine. In the style of a {{round-robin}} tournament, each team played six other teams in their group both home and away. The other two teams were faced just once. The top four teams from each group qualified for the knockout stage: a three-round single-elimination tournament. The winner of each group had a home match in the quarter-finals against the fourth team from the other group. The runner-ups from each group played at home against the third placed team from the other group. The semi-finals were a free draw from all the qualified teams. Finals Day will <b>be</b> <b>again</b> be held at Edgbaston.|$|E

25|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{involves}} an artery or vein {{from the patient}} being implanted to bypass narrowings or occlusions in the coronary arteries. Several arteries and veins can be used, however internal mammary artery grafts have demonstrated significantly better long-term patency rates than great saphenous vein grafts. In patients with two or more coronary arteries affected, bypass surgery is associated with higher long-term survival rates compared to percutaneous interventions. In patients with single vessel disease, surgery is comparably safe and effective, and may be a treatment option in selected cases. Bypass surgery has higher costs initially, but becomes cost-effective in the long term. A surgical bypass graft is more invasive initially but bears less risk of recurrent procedures (but these may <b>be</b> <b>again</b> minimally invasive).|$|E

25|$|In Syria {{the right}} {{belongs to the}} {{paternal}} male cousin alone and the maternal male cousin has no special rights. The custom is however less frequent in big cities such as Damascus and Aleppo. Patai reports that in the decades preceding 1962 the right was often ignored among the Syrian urban middle class. Among the upper classes it appeared to <b>be</b> <b>again</b> more common, as certain leading families protected their wealth and status by reserving daughters for their cousins, though sons had more freedom of choice. This situation was also loosening {{at the time of}} Patai's work. This holds also among the Syrian Turks and Kurds. But the Syrian Circassians hold cousin marriage absolutely forbidden, similar to the Circassians of the Caucasus.|$|E
25|$|Two days later, Chaytor {{received}} {{orders for}} another attack across the Jordan on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt.

The division, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was to support the 60th Division in a minor role. The force crossed the Jordan overnight on 29/30 April. The division supported the 60th Division's, assaults on Shunet Nimrin, {{but they could not}} break the Turkish position. Shea the GOC 60th Division used the ANZAC brigades on his flanks, but they were prevented from getting forward by the strong defences in the rugged terrain.

For a harddisk the code in the Master Boot Record (first sector) determines the active partition. The code in the boot sector of the active partition could then <b>be</b> <b>again</b> a NTLDR boot sector looking for ntldr in the root directory of this active partition. In a more convoluted scenario the active partition can contain a Vista boot sector for the newer Vista boot manager with an {ntldr} entry pointing to another partition with a NTLDR boot sector.|$|E
