5000|$|The 1898 [...] "System Lohner-Porsche" [...] {{created a}} press {{whirlwind}} across Europe. Lohner received his first order from E.W. Hart, himself a coachbuilder of Luton, Britain. Hart asked for significant modifications. His vehicle {{was to be}} capable of running on petrol, as well as electricity, of carrying four passengers, and employing four-wheel drive. The custom coach was a monster dubbed La Toujours Contente ('always satisfied' in French), a jab at record-holder Camille Jenatzy's electric La Jamais Contente, and was exhibited at the December 1900 Paris Exhibition. The enormous Lohner required 1.8 tonnes of batteries consisting of a 44-cell 80-volt lead-acid battery, all housed in a spring-suspended <b>battery</b> <b>container</b> to protect the fragile cells. The four electric motors weighed a total of 1280 pounds, contributing to a total vehicle weight of over 4 tonnes on its Continental pneumatic tires. With a battery capacity around 270 amp-hours and four forward speeds, the 56-horsepower coach ran in several expositions and competitions. It cost 15,000 Austrian crowns.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) investigations of electrochemical systems require gas-tight and non-metallic cell housings. This contribution {{reports on the}} development and evaluation of a cylindrical <b>battery</b> <b>container</b> in combination with a numerically optimized saddle coil that is suitable for NMR investigations of battery cells over hundreds of charge-discharge cycles. The reliability of the new cell container design and its long-time gas-tight sealing are shown by rate capability comparisons to standard housings with LiCoO$_{ 2 }$ (LCO) vs. Li-metal electrodes {{as well as a}} charge-discharge experiment of a LCO vs. graphite batteries over more than 2000 hours. To demonstrate the performance of the entire NMR setup, long-run in-operando measurements on a Li-metal vs. graphite cell are presented. The NMR data reveal the formation and evolution of mossy and dendritic Li microstructures over a period of 1000 h. Analyzing the measured rate of microstructure growth could help to identify dendrite mitigation strategies, such as enhanced cell pressure or additives, and could enable a method for battery lifetime prediction.

40|$|Recently, {{electric}} vehicles and hybrid cars are being promoted as alternatives to reduce automobile emissions. Generally, thin sheet {{materials such as}} aluminum alloy AA 300 X and cold-rolled steel sheet such as JIS-G- 3141 are used for the container for the lithium-ion secondary batteries. In this study, a multi-stage deep drawing process is used to produce a rectangular cup from thin stainless steel sheet material, SUS 409 L, with an initial blank thickness of 0. 4 mm for the <b>battery</b> <b>container</b> application. Numerical simulations of the first through the fifth stages for the multi-stage deep drawing with thin SUS 409 L sheet were conducted using LS-Dyna 3 D Implicit/Explicit. Special consideration {{was given to the}} deformation characteristics due to the normal anisotropy of the sheet material. The numerical simulations were conducted with both isotropic properties and the anisotropic properties of the initial blank material.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a design study {{to compare the}} manufacturing costs {{at a level of}} 100, 000 hybrid vehicle batteries per year for flexible package (Flex) cells and for rigid aluminum container (Rigid) cells. Initially, the Rigid cells were considered to have welded closures and to be deep-drawn containers of about the same shape as the Flex cells. As the study progressed, the method of fabricating and sealing the Rigid cells was expanded to include lower cost options including double seaming and other mechanically fastened closures with polymer sealants. Both types of batteries were designed with positive electrodes containing Li(Ni{sub 1 / 3 }Co{sub 1 / 3 }Mn{sub 1 / 3 }) O{sub 2 } and graphite negative electrodes. The use of a different combination of lithium-ion electrodes would have little effect on the difference in costs for the two types of cells. We found that 20 -Ah cells could be designed with excellent performance and heat rejection capabilities for either type of cell. Many parts {{in the design of the}} Flex cells are identical or nearly identical to those of the Rigid Cell, so for these features there would be no difference in the cost of manufacturing the two types of batteries. We judged the performance, size and weight of the batteries to be sufficiently similar that the batteries would have the same value for their application. Some of the design features of the Flex cells were markedly different than those of the deep-drawn and welded Rigid cells and would result in significant cost savings. Fabrication and processing steps for which the Flex cells appear to have a cost advantage over these Rigid cells are (1) container fabrication and sealing, (2) terminal fabrication and sealing, and (3) intercell connections. The costs of providing cooling channels adjacent to the cells and for module and battery hardware appear to favor Rigid cell batteries slightly. Overall, Flex cell batteries appear to have an advantage of about $ 1. 20 -$ 3. 70 per cell for a 25 -kW Battery of 20 cells or about $ 24 to $ 74 per <b>battery.</b> <b>Container</b> experts assisted with this study, including a paid consultant and personnel at container manufacturing companies. Some of the companies are considering entering the business of manufacturing containers for hybrid vehicle battery manufacturers. For this reason they provided valuable guidance on overall approaches to reducing the costs of the cell containers. They have retained the description of some specific designs and procedures for future possible work with battery manufacturers, with whom they are now in contact. Through the guidance of these experts, we determined that a new type of container could be manufactured that would have the best features of performance and low cost of both the Rigid and Flex containers. For instance, the aluminum layer in a tri-layer sheet can be sufficiently thick to form a rigid container that can be fabricated in two halves, much like a Flex container, and mechanically joined at the edges for strength. In addition to the mechanical joint, this container can be sealed at the edges, much like a Flex container, by means of an inner polymer liner that can be heat-sealed or ultrasonically welded. The terminals can be flat strips of metal sealed into the top of the container as part of the edge sealing of the container, as for the Flex cell. Ridges can be stamped into one side of the container to provide cooling channels and the exterior layer of the container stock can be coated with a thin, electrically insulating, polymer layer. We expect this type of container will provide excellent sealing and durability and be less expensive than either the Flex or the Rigid container, which the study initially considered. A major cost for the original Rigid container is the welding required for sealing the container. However, the welding of the current collector tabs to the terminal piece may be even more complex and costly than welding the container. It is important, therefore, to develop an inexpensive procedure for attachment of the foils to the terminal pieces. A lower-cost procedure, such as ultrasonic welding or mechanical clipping, might replace laser welding of the foils to the terminal pieces. A conclusion from our discussions with the container experts is that the manufacturing rate required for the containers for hybrid vehicle batteries is fairly low, and thus favors procedures requiring low tooling costs and little development effort. These conditions favor flexible packaging, heat sealing, shallow stamping, double seaming and ultrasonic welding. It works against deep drawing and untested procedures for welding and joining...|$|E

40|$|The {{appropriate}} sizing {{of storage}} areas {{to optimize the}} management of intermodal transport, the adoption of environment protection systems and the appropriate flow’s regulations inside manoeuvre’s zones can solve many problems encountered today in a intermodal marine terminal. For these reasons the “integrated design” of storage areas for vehicles and containers is considered essential to ensure efficiency and functionality for all harbour-system. So is here proposed a simulative model {{as a tool for}} a more correct design of waiting areas by considering the real stochastic conditions of the process of the arrivals. For the sizing of areas for containers in the harbours, it is necessary to report the storage capacity in terms of TEU that can be stored (and handled) in the unit of time, e. g. in one year, with the extension of sites for storage of boxes and furniture with the other specific operating parameters. The sizing of storage areas of the goods date constitutes a delicate problem the frequent shortage of the areas available. The ability to warehouse of the terminal is essentially determined from the interrelation between fixed and static parameters in the short period which the extension of the storage area, the height of the overlapping <b>batteries</b> of <b>container</b> (defined also like number of “shooting”), the means of movements and, at last, a series of parameters that can vary the efficiency’s degree according to of the operatives of the terminal.

40|$|Polypropylene {{is a very}} durable polymer {{commonly}} used in aggressive environments including automotive <b>battery</b> casings, fuel <b>containers</b> and the like. Because of its excellent resistance to harmful chemical environments, the use of polypropylene to manufacture nonwoven geotextiles for waste containment systems is a beneficial use of this versatile polyolefin. Presently, nonwoven polypropylene geotextiles are used in more than 80 % of all waste containment applications. Moisture Resistance Unlike nonwoven polyester geotextiles, polypropylene does not absorb water nor does the presence of water have any effect whatsoever on tensile strength or other mechanical properties. Chemical Resistance (pH) Extensive research has shown polypropylene is very resistant to certain concentrations of aggressive chemicals such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Therefore, polypropylene geotextiles have been found acceptable in most solid and hazardous waste landfills. Leachate Compatibility Biological Resistance Many independent leachate immersion tests conducted in accordance with EPA Method 9090 have shown no significant reduction in mechanical properties of our nonwoven polypropylene geotextiles. Since polypropylene does not support, attract or deteriorate from fungal growths, SI Geosolutions nonwoven geotextiles are rot and mildew resistant.

40|$|During eye surgery, {{the surgeon}} uses an {{illuminating}} instrument called an opthalmoscope for {{close examination of}} the retina or {{the interior of the}} eye. Ordinarily, electric power for the head-mounted light is supplied through a cord from an overhead swivel arm or a floor pedestal. Within limits of cord length and swivel arm movement, the surgeon has considerable freedom of motion. But when more than one opthalmoscope is involved, tangling and interference of the power cords becomes a problem. St. Luke's Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio asked Lewis Research Center for assistance in finding a solution. Lewis responded with a battery-powered system that totally frees the surgeon of attached cords and swivels.
