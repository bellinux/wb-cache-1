40|$|Objective: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the cost effectiveness of treating diabetic foot ulcers with <b>becaplermin</b> (Regranex(R)) plus good wound care (GWC) compared with GWC alone in a variety of European healthcare settings. A secondary objective was to analyse the effect of different treatment practices on the economics of caring for diabetic foot ulcers. Design and setting: Markov-based simulation study from the perspective of a national health system. Methods: A 12 -month Markov computer simulation model was used to assess the cost effectiveness in 4 European countries of treating diabetic foot ulcers with <b>becaplermin</b> plus GWC versus GWC alone. Transition probabilities were taken from a prospective study of 183 patients and <b>becaplermin</b> efficacy was based on 20 -week healing rates in a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials involving 449 patients. Country-specific treatment cost data were collected in collaboration with local economic consultations and combined with the disease model to estimate the incremental cost per ulcer-free month gained. The model was then run using hypothetical low- and high-intensity resource usage profiles to investigate the economics of caring for diabetic foot ulcers. Results: Over the course of 1 year, individuals who received <b>becaplermin</b> plus GWC were, on average, predicted to spend an additional 0. 81 months (24 % longer) free of ulcers and to experience a 9 % lower risk of undergoing a lower extremity amputation than individuals who received GWC alone. Consequently, <b>becaplermin</b> plus GWC was estimated to be net cost saving in Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. In France, the addition of <b>becaplermin</b> was estimated to add $US 19 (1999 values) for each additional ulcer-free month gained. There were substantial intercountry differences in treatment practices and the costs of treating diabetic foot ulcers. Conclusions: <b>Becaplermin</b> may be a cost-effective treatment for neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers in a wide range of European settings. In Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, <b>becaplermin</b> may even be cost saving. Substantial intercountry differences in resource patterns appear, at least partly, to be the logical outcome of differences in unit costs. <b>Becaplermin,</b> Cicatrizants, Cost analysis, Cost effectiveness, Foot ulcer, Pharmacoeconomics, Wound healing...|$|E

In this study, the efficacy of <b>becaplermin</b> gel in the treatment of chronic full thickness pressure ulcers was compared with that of placebo gel. A total of 124 adults (â€¡ 18 years of age) with pressure ulcers were assigned randomly to receive topical treatment with <b>becaplermin</b> gel 100 m g/g (n = 31) or 300 m g/g (n = 32) once daily alternated with placebo gel every 12 hours, <b>becaplermin</b> gel 100 m g/g twice daily (n = 30), or placebo (sodium carboxymethylcellulose) gel (n = 31) twice daily until complete healing was achieved or for 16 weeks.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a model capable of assessing the cost-effectiveness in Sweden of treating diabetic neuropathic lower extremity ulcers with <b>becaplermin</b> gel (Regranex) plus good wound care (GWC) relative to treating them with GWC alone. MethodsA Markov simulation model was developed that includes six health states: Uninfected Ulcer, Infected Ulcer, Gangrene, Healed Ulcer, Healed Ulcer-History of Amputation, and Deceased. To predict clinical outcomes, information was taken from a specially designed prospective 9 -month follow-up study of 183 neuropathic patients in the US treated with GWC. Cost of treatment data were taken primarily from a study of a cohort of 314 patients in Sweden. The efficacy of <b>becaplermin</b> was assumed equal to that achieved in a pooled analysis of four randomized clinical trials. A model application provides expected clinical outcomes for a cohort of patients. Annual treatment costs per patient were estimated using treatment practice and unit prices from Sweden. ResultsDue to a higher rate of healing and a shorter average healing time, treatment with <b>becaplermin</b> gel was predicted to increase the average number of months spent in the healed state over the first year following development of an ulcer by 24 % relative to GWC alone. In addition, the corresponding number of amputations was 9 % lower for the becaplermin-treated cohort. The average expected cost of $ 12, 078 US for an individual treated with GWC alone declines to $ 11, 708 US for one treated with <b>becaplermin,</b> in spite of $ 1262 <b>becaplermin</b> costs. Expenses related to topical treatment and inpatient care account for 83 % of the resources conserved. ConclusionOur results suggest that in Sweden treatment with <b>becaplermin</b> in conjunction with GWC consumes fewer resources and generates better outcomes than treatment with GWC alone for diabetic neuropathic ulcers. In light of the high and increasing incidence of such ulcers, the potential savings in costs and suffering may be important. Results are difficult to extrapolate internationally because they are strongly related to country-specific treatment practices and price levels...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ulcers as {{a result}} of {{diabetes}} mellitus are a serious problem with an enormous impact on the overall global disease burden due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Because of long hospital stays, rehabilitation, often required home care and the use of social services diabetic foot complications are costly. Therapy with growth factors could be an effective and innovative add-on to standard wound care. Research questions: What is the benefit of therapies with growth factors alone or in combination with other technologies in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer assessed regarding medical, economical, social, ethical and juridical aspects? Methods: We systematically searched relevant databases limited to English and German language and publications since 1990. Cost values were adjusted to the price level of 2008 and converted into Euro. A review and an assessment of the quality of publications were conducted following approved methodical standards conforming to evidence-based medicine and health economics. Results: We identified 25 studies (14 randomized controlled trials (RCT), nine cost-effectiveness analyses, two meta-analyses). The RCT compared an add-on therapy to standard wound care with standard wound care/placebo alone or extracellular wound matrix: in six studies <b>becaplermin,</b> in two rhEGF, in one bFGF, and in five studies the metabolically active skin grafts Dermagraft and Apligraf. The study duration ranged from twelve to 20 weeks and the study population included between 17 to 382 patients, average 130 patients. The treatment with <b>becaplermin,</b> rhEGF and skin implants Dermagraft and Apligraf showed in eight out of 13 studies an advantage concerning complete wound closure and the time to complete wound healing. Evidence for a benefit of treatment with bFGF could not be found. In four out of 14 studies the proportion of adverse events was 30 % per study group with no difference between the treatment groups. The methodological quality of the studies was affected by significant deficiencies. The results showed <b>becaplermin</b> being cost-effective whereas no obvious statement can be made regarding Dermagraft and Apligraf because of diverging cost bases and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Discussion: Differences in standard wound care are complicating the comparison of study results. Taking into consideration the small to very small sample sizes and other methodological flaws with high potential of bias, the validity of the results with regard to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness has to be considered limited. The duration of treatment and follow-up examinations is not long enough to assess the sustainability of the intervention and the surveillance of ulcer recurrences or treatment related adverse events like the development of malignancy. Conclusions: There are indications of an advantage for the add-on therapy with growth factors in diabetic foot ulcers concerning complete wound closure and the time to complete wound healing. Further more studies of high methodological quality with adequate sample sizes and sufficient follow-up periods are necessary also investigating patient-relevant parameters like the health-related quality of life, the acceptance and tolerance of the intervention in addition to clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers is increas-ing {{significantly in the}} United States. These ulcers and infec-tions {{are the result of}} long-term complications of diabetes in-cluding neuropathy and vascular insufficiency. These infections can be classified into mild, limb threatening, and life threatening. This classification helps clarify the expected organisms involved and consequently appropriate, empiric antibiotic therapy. Mild infections are generally caused by Gram-positive organisms and can usually be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics. Antibiotics used for mild in-fections include cephalexin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Moderate to severe or limb-threatening infec-tions are usually polymicrobial and frequently require hospi-talization. These infections are typically treated with more broad-spectrum antibiotics including ampicillin/sulbactam, imipenem, or the combination of clindamycin and a fluoroquinolone. Severe or life-threatening infections also re-quire broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other therapeutic options besides antibiotics include growth factors, such as <b>becaplermin,</b> and various skin substitutes...|$|E
40|$|For most of {{the last}} century, chronic wound care was a {{practice}} of pas-sive techniques, designed to prevent the progression of the wound. The last decade, however, has seen a change in active wound care. These advanced techniques focus on improving the wound at the molecular level to acceler-ate wound healing. Successful modalities include tissue-engineered products, hyperbaric oxygen, negative pressure therapy, electrical stimulation, and recombinant growth factors [1 â€“ 7]. This shift in the treatment of wound care saw the development of a recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rh PDGF-BB), approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for nonhealing diabetic ulcers in 1997 [8, 9]. Now commonly used for treatment, <b>becaplermin</b> (REGRANEX) stimulates granulation and in-creases the incidence of complete wound closure [2, 8 â€“ 10]. Another develop-ment was found to protect growth factors and granulation tissue by inhibiting wound proteases [11]. This product is oxidized regenerated cellu-lose (ORC) /collagen (PROMOGRAN).

40|$|Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a {{platelet}} concentrate {{that has}} been wide-ly used {{in a variety of}} clinical applications. A number of studies showthat PRP enhances and accelerates both soft tissue and hard tissue healing. 1 â€“ 3 The effectiveness of PRP is based on its high level of growth fac-tors such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth fac-tor-Î² (TGF-Î²), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), etc. These growth factors are important in modulating mesenchymal cell recruitment, proliferation, and extracellular matrix synthesis during the healing process. Chronic cutaneous wounds are a frequent problem in developing coun-tries and are often difficult to heal because they lack the growth factors nec-essary for the healing process, and are frequently complicated by superin-fection. 4 Conventional therapies such as dressings, surgical debridement, and even skin graft cannot provide satisfactory healing since these treatments are not able to provide enough necessary growth factors to modulate the healing process. Patients with chronic ulcers frequently have to undergo long-term dressing regimens and repetitive debridement without a definitive outcome.

Finally, data from two additional clinical trials were used to assess replicability of the DFS-SF subscale structure. Results: The DFS-SF contains a total of 29 items comprising six subscales. The results of both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses provided support for the scaling algorithm. The DFS-SF subscales showed good internal consistency, reliability and construct validity, and demonstrated sensitivity to ulcer healing.

40|$|Diabetic foot ulcers and {{infections are}} common and incur {{substantial}} economic burden for society, patients and families. We performed a comprehensive review, {{on a number}} of databases, of health economic evaluations of a variety of different prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies in the area of diabetic foot ulcers and infections. We included English-language, peer-reviewed, cost-effectiveness, cost-minimization, cost-utility and cost-benefit studies that evaluated a treatment modality against placebo or comparator (i. e. drug, standard of care), regardless of year. Differences were settled through consensus. The search resulted in 1885 potential citations, of which 20 studies were retained for analysis (3 cost minimization, 13 cost effectiveness and 4 cost utility). Quality scores of studies ranged from 70. 8 % (fair) to 87. 5 % (good); mean_=_ 78. 4 %_+-_ 5. 33 %. In diagnosing osteomyelitis in patients with diabetic foot infection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 82 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. MRI cost less than 3 -phase bone scanning + Indium (In) - 111 /Gallium (Ga) - 67; however, when compared with prolonged antibacterials, MRI cost $US 120 (year 1993 value) more without additional quality-adjusted life-expectancy. Prevention strategies improved life expectancy and QALYs and reduced foot ulcer rates and amputations. Ampicillin/sulbactam and imipenem/cilastatin were both 80 % successful in treating diabetic foot infections but the latter cost $US 2924 more (year 1994 value). Linezolid cure rates were higher (97. 7 %) than vancomycin (86. 0 %) and cost $US 873 less (year 2004 value). Ertapenem costs were significantly lower than piperacillin/tazobactam ($US 356 vs $US 503, respectively; year 2005 values). <b>Becaplermin</b> plus good wound care may be cost effective in specific populations. Bioengineered living-skin equivalents increased ulcer-free months and ulcers healed, but costs varied between countries. Promogran(R) produced more ulcer-free months than wound care alone (3. 75 vs 3. 41 months, respectively). Treatment with cadexomer iodine resulted in higher rates of healed ulcer (29 % vs 11 %) and lower weekly treatment costs (Swedish krona [SEK] 903 vs SEK 1421; year 1993 values) than standard care. Filgrastim decreased hospital stays, time to resolution and costs (36 % lower) compared with usual care. Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen produced an incremental cost per QALY at year 1 of $US 27 _ 310 and $US 2255 at year 12 (year 2001 values). Overall, preventive strategies were shown to be cost effective and potentially cost saving. Various antibacterial regimens are cost effective but empiric choices should be based on local resistance patterns. MRI was cost effective compared with three-phase bone scanning + In- 111 /Ga- 67 but not against prolonged antibacterial therapy. Other innovations (<b>becaplermin,</b> bioengineered living-skin equivalents, filgrastim, cadexomer iodine ointment, hyperbaric oxygen, Promogran(R)) may be cost effective in this population but more studies are needed to confirm these findings.

40|$|Wounds {{that fail}} to heal in a timely manner, for example, {{diabetic}} foot ulcers, pose a health, economic, and social problem worldwide. For decades, conventional wisdom has pointed to growth factors as the main driving force of wound healing; thus, growth factors have become the center of therapeutic developments. To date, <b>becaplermin</b> (recombinant human PDGF-BB) is the only US FDA-approved growth factor therapy, and it shows modest efficacy, is costly, and {{has the potential to}} cause cancer in patients.

Here, we report that a 115 -aa fragment of secreted Hsp 90 Î± (F- 5) acts as an unconventional wound healing agent in mice. Topical application of F- 5 peptide promoted acute and diabetic wound closure in mice far more effectively than did PDGF-BB. The stronger effect of F- 5 was due to 3 properties not held by conventional growth factors: its ability to recruit both epidermal and dermal cells; the fact that its ability to promote dermal cell migration was not inhibited by TGF-Î²; and its ability to override the inhibitory effects of hyperglycemia on cell migration in diabetes. The discovery of F- 5 challenges the long-standing paradigm of wound healing factors and reveals a potentially more effective and safer agent for healing acute and diabetic wounds...|$|E
