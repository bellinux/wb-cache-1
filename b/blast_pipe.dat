25|$|When the {{locomotive}} is running under power, a draught {{on the fire}} is created by the exhaust steam directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught – where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. The blower is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive's duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver's line of vision.|$|E

The Giesl ejector ensures improved suction draught and a correspondingly better use of energy. The existing blastpipe in a locomotive is replaced by several, small, fan-shaped, diverging <b>blast</b> <b>pipes,</b> from which the diffuser gets its flat, long, drawn-out shape.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCO 2 {{injection}} {{to enhance}} oil recovery (CO 2 -EOR), which can both sequester CO 2 and increase crude oil supply, is now widely used {{all over the}} world. According {{to the prediction of}} international energy agency (IEA) in 2008, the potential ability of enhancing oil recovery for CO 2 -EOR is about 1600 × 108 – 3000 × 108 barrels, which will make a positive contribution to the sustainable development of oil and gas. However, CO 2 injection pipes in deep wells are often suffering acid corrosion, by which the structural integrity of steel was destroyed. Thus, boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) accident is more than likely to happen for CO 2 injection pipes with high operating pressure. This paper gives a short description of CO 2 BLEVE and presents results from preliminary, small scale experiments of CO 2 BLEVE in injection pipes. The results indicated that CO 2 undergone special decompression behavior during injection and the rapid phase transitions in BLEVE were different from gas explosions. But tremendous amounts of energy could also be released during BLEVE of this nonflammable pressurized liquefied gas (PLG) in P 110 injection pipe, which made the burst pressure be more than 50 MPa and the <b>pipes</b> <b>blasted</b> in several fragments.

5000|$|The post-1945 years saw {{the erosion}} of some Welsh traditions, such as {{religious}} non-conformity and Sunday closing, but the increasing reassertion of Welsh distinctiveness. In 1955, Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George proclaimed Cardiff as {{the capital city of}} Wales and in 1964 the first Secretary of State for Wales was appointed, heading a Welsh Office, the first stage in administrative devolution. In 1967 the Wales and Berwick Act, which specified that for legal purposes the term [...] "England" [...] should include Wales, was repealed. Nationalism became a major issue {{during the second half of}} the 20th century. In 1962 Saunders Lewis gave a radio talk entitled Tynged yr iaith (The fate of the language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. This led to the formation of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh Language Society) the same year. Nationalism grew particularly following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965, drowning the village of Capel Celyn to create a reservoir supplying water to Liverpool. In 1966 Gwynfor Evans won the Carmarthen seat for Plaid Cymru at a by-election, their first Parliamentary seat. The flooding of Capel Celyn also prompted the formation of militant groups such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (MAC - Welsh Defence Movement). In the years leading up to the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb <b>blasts</b> destroying water <b>pipes</b> and tax and other offices.

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructural and piping stress {{analyses}} are generally conducted separately {{in most of}} the situations. A pipe stress analysis is performed based on loads caused by pressure, temperature variations, weight of the pipe (with contents) and <b>blast.</b> The <b>pipes</b> are analysed for several load cases separated into different design types like sustained, expansion and occasional. Established practice in piping design and calculation does not specifically account for structural flexibility. It is assumed that flexibility in the structure is minimal and that the structure is stiff relative to the piping load and in comparison with the piping itself. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the conservatism of the established practice. Run different types of sensitivity analysis regarding stiffness of pipe versus stiffness of the supporting structure, i. e pipe-structure interaction. Limitations for this thesis I have chosen to look at a 20 inch pipe in a simplified system and is supported in ten equally spaced locations of 5 m. Three pipe thicknesses are chosen, 4. 73 mm, 12. 70 mm and 20. 62 mm. For calculations of piping stress and restraint support loads Caesar II has been used. Four pipe supports has been modeled using the structural analysis program STAAD. Pro. Pipe support in node 70 and 90 (Caesar ref.) is set as fixed to a concrete deck and pipe support in node 110 and 130 (Caesar ref.) is set as sliding restraints fixed to a steel beam deck. For design loads the vertical load is the weight of the operating pipe span carried by the supports, the horizontal load will be assumed equal to the friction force. The pipe line and the pipe support are also to be calculated to withstand explosion loads directed from 6 locations. This model for pipeline and supports will be tested in four cases. The first case: The established practice where structural and piping stress {{analyses are}} run separately. The second case: Structural and piping stress analyses will be runned combined by implementing the deck deflection calculated in the first case for pipe support in node 110 and 130. The supports for node 70 and 90 are fixed to concrete deck and are assumed to have zero deflection. The third case: Structural and piping stress analyses will be runned combined by implementing the max acceptable deck deflection (L/ 200) for pipe support in node 110 and node 130. The fourth case: In this case the pipe support for node 110 and 130 are set to fail, which means that these two pipe supports will not take any loads from the <b>pipe,</b> only direct <b>blast</b> loads. These four cases will be compared with respect to changes in pipeline restraint forces, utilization of pipe line stress, pipe line deflection, structural deck deflection, utilization of support beam, displacements in the pipe support. Figure 1 Model for piping and structural As a conclusion on the results from this thesis it can be stated that pipe lines with large stiffness can have a very big impact on the pipe supports when included the variation in deck deflection. On the other hand deflection did not seem to have any large impact on the pipe stress other than expansion in this thesis. A flexible pipe line seems to be more beneficial for a pipe support considering the restraint loads, thus leading to a higher utilization and deflection in pipe stress analysis. As I experienced in performing this thesis, interacting piping and structural is very time consuming and as current engineering schedule often means that structural deflection are not available at the time of pipe stress analysis, it will result in additional analysis, where the results might not give a result that makes any significance in the end. As a guide it is important to take in to consideration possible large deck deflections that can occur and have an impact on piping as vell as structural...|$|R
50|$|Exhaust steam was {{extracted}} from the steam chest and fed through a 100 mm diameter pipe under the locomotive to the tender. There the steam was fed directly into the feedwater, which thus heated up to boiling point. The remaining steam was allowed to escape to atmosphere through a second chimney on the tender. The quantity of steam could be regulated using a cock on the tender. The Rohrbeck system differed in detail from the Kirchweger condenser.

5000|$|A {{locomotive}} boiler {{has three}} main components: a double-walled firebox; a horizontal, cylindrical [...] "boiler barrel" [...] containing {{a large number}} of small flue-tubes; and a smokebox with chimney, for the exhaust gases. The boiler barrel contains larger flue-tubes to carry the superheater elements, where present. Forced draught is provided in the locomotive boiler by injecting exhausted steam back into the exhaust via a <b>blast</b> <b>pipe</b> in the smokebox.|$|E
5000|$|The boilers were a {{conventional}} type with round-topped firebox and a working pressure of [...] The boiler barrel was 4 ft in diameter, 13 ft long between the tubeplates, {{and there were}} 198 brass boiler tubes, 2 in in diameter.
