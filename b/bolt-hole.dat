While weekend and mid-week-break trade are tending to replace the traditional week-long family holiday, the beaches and attractions are always very busy throughout summer, a marked contrast to the quieter winter months when Scarborough is often seen as a peaceful <b>bolt-hole</b> from cities such as Leeds and Bradford. Confidence in the hospitality industry is high, evidenced by major refits in recent years, often targeted at a higher-spending clientele. Significant amongst these is the Grand, Scarborough's biggest hotel, which overlooks the South Bay, and also the Palm Court Hotel.|$|E

2500|$|As {{it became}} clear that any non-crumbling face could be conquered with {{sufficient}} perseverance and <b>bolt-hole</b> drilling, some climbers began searching for El Cap routes that could be climbed either free or with minimal aid. The West Face route was free climbed in 1979 by Ray Jardine and Bill Price; but despite numerous efforts by Jardine and others, The Nose resisted free attempts for another fourteen years. The first free ascent of a main El Cap route, though, was not The Nose, but Salathé Wall. Todd Skinner and Paul Piana made the first free ascent over 9 days in 1988, after 30 days of working the route (graded 5.13b on the Yosemite Decimal System). [...] The Nose was the second major route to be freeclimbed. Two pitches on The Nose blocked efforts to free the route: the [...] "Great Roof" [...] graded 5.13c and [...] "Changing Corners" [...] graded 5.14a/b. In 1993, Lynn Hill came close to freeing The Nose, making it past the Great Roof and up to Camp VI without falling, stopped only on Changing Corners by a piton jammed in a critical finger hold. After removing the piton she re-climbed the route from the ground. After 4 days of climbing, Hill reached the summit, making her the first person to free climb The Nose. A year later, Hill returned to free climb The Nose in a day, this time reaching the summit in just 23 hours and setting a new standard for free climbing on [...] "El Cap." ...|$|E

Here, too, Mahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead at Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer.

30|$|There are upper {{limits of}} {{clearances}} in <b>bolt-holes</b> that allow practical advantages of considering the synthetic resistance of combined joints.

30|$|An {{experimental}} study on combined steel-to-timber joints with nails and bolts is conducted in this study. Principal results are as follows: The initial stiffness and effective allowable resistance of combined joints depend obviously on clearances in predrilled <b>bolt-holes.</b> The combined joints with nails and bolts have high potential of energy capacity to resist strong earthquake forces. There are upper limits of clearances in predrilled <b>bolt-holes</b> that allow advantages of considering the synthetic resistance of combined joints in practical structural design. Combining the joint components with appropriate design will give higher performance against strong earthquakes increasing the safety margin and energy capacity until the failure. The combined joints {{should be designed}} under the restrictions of particular specifications in closed design systems because the advantages of combining the joint components are influenced obviously by various actual conditions, which are too difficult to consider in detail in open design systems.|$|R
30|$|A Monte-Carlo {{simulation}} {{was conducted}} to estimate the design initial slips of the bolted joints with clearances in predrilled <b>bolt-holes.</b> Assuming a 5.0 % single-tailed normal distribution probability [4, 5], 1000 random combinations of initial locations of bolts in their predrilled holes of steel plates and wood members in the loading direction, which corresponded to initial slips, were generated {{with a standard deviation}} that made 95 % of the random location distributed within the clearance 2  mm in the steel plate and the same clearance in the wood member [6 – 9]. The random numbers due to the normal distribution are often generated by the Box–Muller method and the method using central limit theorem [10]. In this, the central limit theorem was adopted to approximate the normal distribution and the random ratios of initial slips to the total clearances in predrilled <b>bolt-holes</b> were generated by the random function of Visual Basic, which distributed from 0 to 1 [11].|$|R

30|$|On the contrary, maximum {{resistance}} of nailed or screwed joints used alone {{can be improved}} by combining with additional bolted joints. Even if the clearances in predrilled <b>bolt-holes</b> of bolted joints hinder the obvious increase of the allowable resistance estimated following the current design standard, the actual maximum resistance or safety factors of them will increase if the nailed or screwed joints are designed appropriately to have far greater ultimate slips than probable initial slips of the bolted joints.|$|R

This organization Tetragammaton and these characters (Dr. Vang, Michael Dalke, and Martin Kong) have appeared in previous Hendrix novels involved in the long-term survival of humanity through the creation of mind-machine interfaces. This conversation reveals that Tetragammaton, was involved in the creation of the pandemic but that it has gone out of control. Dalke and Kong claim that the GNOMES were ultimately responsible for creating the pandemic as a complete defence against extinction and by orders of mysterious entity the Allesseh. The Allesseh is a massive consciousness at the centre of the galaxy, described in Hendrix's novel Better Angels.|$|E

30|$|The load-slip {{curves of}} the {{combined}} joints (Fig.  3 c) had characteristic drops-in-grooves (DIG), which showed transition phases of load bearing from only by nails to both by nails and bolts. These transitions are the results of inevitable initial slips of the bolts located in predrilled <b>bolt-holes</b> of greater diameter, which bring about a difficulty of evaluating the lateral resistance of combined joints. The load-slip behavior {{of the combined}} joints after reaching the maximum loads depends on the ductility of the joint components {{as can be seen}} in Fig.  3 b and c.
