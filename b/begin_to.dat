5|$|Females den {{in hollow}} trees. Kits are born blind and helpless. They are {{partially}} covered with fine hair. Kits <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> crawl after about 3 weeks. After about 7 weeks they open their eyes. They start to climb after 8 weeks. Kits are completely {{dependent on their}} mother's milk for the first 8–10 weeks, after which they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> switch to a solid diet. After 4 months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at 5 months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which {{goes on to}} form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E
60|$|The wind <b>began</b> <b>to</b> blow, {{the dust}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> fly, the sun <b>began</b> <b>to</b> burn; and the {{freshness}} and serenity {{of the morning}} passed.|$|R
6000|$|Accordingly, the suet pudding was made; the men <b>began</b> <b>to</b> eat; the gale <b>began</b> <b>to</b> [...] "take off", as seaman express it; and, {{although}} {{things were}} still very {{far removed from}} a state of comfort, they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be more endurable; health <b>began</b> <b>to</b> return to the sick, and hope {{to those who had}} previously given way to despair.|$|R

5|$|March 1957. Guevara {{deals with}} {{debilitating}} bouts of asthma as his group of revolutionaries {{meet up with}} Castro’s. Together, they attack an army barracks in the Sierra Maestra on May 28, 1957. After that, they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> win over the rural peasant population of Cuba and receive increasing support, while battling both the government and traitors in their midst. Gradually, however, the government loses control {{of most of the}} rural areas. Soon afterward, the July 26th Movement forges alliances with other revolutionary movements in Cuba, and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> assault towns and villages. Most fall to the rebels with little to no resistance.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a new {{prion disease}} named Psychotic Outburst Syndrome (or POS) is {{affecting}} dogs, causing friendly pets to become violent. Officials struggle {{to control the}} disease and immediately terminate any dogs that catch it. Humans soon <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> contract the disease.|$|E
50|$|The crew’s efforts <b>began</b> <b>to</b> take effect. Chopper {{lost the}} headway that {{was taking her}} deeper, and even <b>began</b> <b>to</b> make sternway. Her bow <b>began</b> <b>to</b> rise, reached level, and {{continued}} <b>to</b> climb. Chopper <b>began</b> <b>to</b> ascend with a rapidly increasing up-angle until she was again nearly vertical in the water, now bow up.|$|R
50|$|In June 1997, Comic BomBom skyrocketed out {{of nowhere}} and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> rise to its Golden Age, due to the {{popularity}} of BomBoms new Medarot and Cyborg Kuro-chan manga. As years flew by, BomBom <b>began</b> <b>to</b> run more original manga than before. The magazine <b>began</b> <b>to</b> include small prizes in every issue. At one point, Comic BomBoms sales <b>began</b> <b>to</b> increase higher than the sales of CoroCoro Comic. But in 2005, sales and popularity <b>began</b> <b>to</b> decline again.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, {{political}} power players <b>began</b> <b>to</b> move out, and Greenlaw <b>began</b> <b>to</b> lose political muscle. The government <b>began</b> <b>to</b> bulldoze older mansions in the 1930s, leaving empty lots in many cases.|$|R

5|$|Mkhedruli {{becomes more}} round and free in writing. It breaks the strict {{frame of the}} {{previous}} two alphabets, Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri. Mkhedruli letters <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> get coupled and more free calligraphy develops.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is {{facilitated}} by seeds collected as the fruits <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> dry. The species {{is used in}} commercial landscaping as ornamental features, particularly in desert environments. Plants are considered deer resistant. E. reichenbachii earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, supercells <b>began</b> <b>to</b> appear in Texas. One of these {{produced}} an EF4 wedge tornado which ripped through parts of Garland and Rowlett, Texas, causing major damage. As the storm complex <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{move to the}} north, more supercells <b>began</b> <b>to</b> pop up with several more tornadoes being reported. By early on December 27, the supercells had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> merge into a squall line, with tornado reports <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> diminish, but occasionally a few isolated tornadoes would be produced by the storm.|$|R

5000|$|Gondwana <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{break up}} in the early Jurassic and the early Cretaceous (about [...] ) {{accompanied}} by massive eruptions of basalt lava, as East Gondwana, comprising Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and Australia, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> separate from Africa. South America <b>began</b> <b>to</b> drift slowly westward from Africa as the South Atlantic Ocean opened, beginning about 130 Mya during the Early Cretaceous, and resulting in open marine conditions by 110 Mya. East Gondwana then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> separate about 120 Mya when India <b>began</b> <b>to</b> move northward.|$|R
5|$|Symptoms can <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{manifest}} at {{any point}} from the ingestion of the meal to 120minutes thereafter. However, the more common range is between 30seconds to 1hour {{after the completion of}} a meal. Symptoms tend to cease when the ruminated contents become acidic.|$|E

5|$|The route heads {{northwest}} from Winthrop, {{passing through}} heavily forested areas of St. Lawrence County. As NY420 passes out of Stockholm and into Norfolk, the forests surrounding the highway <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> taper off and {{give way to}} small pockets of residences and cultivated fields. The amount of homes along the route <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> increase upon intersecting Plum Brook Road, at which point NY420 becomes lined with residences for much of its run through north Norfolk. However, the string of homes ends near the northern town line, and the highway becomes flanked by forests once more as it curves northward and enters the town of Massena.|$|E

50|$|As {{the airline}} {{market in the}} United States became deregulated, {{airlines}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> compete by price. Airline ticket prices <b>began</b> <b>to</b> decrease, and airlines <b>began</b> <b>to</b> charge extra for services that were once included in the airfare.|$|R
60|$|For an hour Johnson {{kept his}} word. Then he {{suddenly}} sat up, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> gaze fixedly {{at a corner}} of the cabin.

Then he lay quiet again.|$|R
5|$|While the Myrmica ant colony can {{identify}} {{each other through}} chemical signaling, social ranks are partially determined by sound acoustics. Therefore, once the P. rebeli <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> mimic {{the sound of the}} queen ant, the worker ants <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> treat the P. rebeli {{as if it were the}} queen ant. On the other hand, the queen ant treats the P. rebeli larvae and pupae as if they were rivals, as she is the only one in the colony that recognizes that the P. rebeli larvae is not ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|With {{the aliens}} gone the {{abducted}} townsfolk <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> remember their pasts. Still a wanted man, Jake decides to leave, though the sheriff and Dolarhyde {{say they will}} claim {{he was killed in}} the invasion. The citizens intend to reconstruct their town.|$|E
5|$|Women with Lynch {{syndrome}} should <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> have annual biopsy screening {{at the age}} of 35. Some {{women with}} Lynch syndrome elect to have a prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{colonization}} of Rwanda {{and the arrival}} of western systems of law, Rwandan society soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> change as a whole. With this implementation and usage of western legal systems, Rwandans <b>began</b> <b>to</b> go to courts to deal with their disputes. In turn, kings and wisemen soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> lose their legitimacy within Rwandan society. And with this loss of legitimacy, Gacaca courts <b>began</b> <b>to</b> dwindle down in numbers.|$|R

5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
