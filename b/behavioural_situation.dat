40|$|The {{relation}} between mean aortic pressure (mAoP) and {{the duration of}} cardiac cycle (C) has been studied in resting conscious dogs in normal condition (n), after vagal blockade (vb), after sympathetic blockade (sb), and after combined blockade of the two systems (sb+vb). The relation {{has been found to}} be negative in all conditions. The different conditions are clearly differentiated by the slope of the {{relation between}} mAoP/C (= kPa/s = mW/ml) and C. The hypothesis is put forward that the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activities on the heart and the vessels produces the best compromise between the pump function of the heart and the afterload, in relation to the actual <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation,</b> in conscious animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{behaviour}} is usually {{understood in terms}} of three distinct components: sensory processing, decision making and movement control. Recently, this view has been questioned on the basis of physiological and behavioural data, blurring the distinction between these three stages. This raises the question to what extent the motor system itself can contribute to the interpretation of behavioural situations. To investigate this question we use a neural model of sensory motor integration applied to a behaving mobile robot performing a navigation task. We show that the population response of the motor system provides a substrate for the categorization of behavioural situations. This categorization allows for the assessment of the complexity of a <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation</b> and regulates whether higher-level decision making is required to resolve behavioural conflicts. Our model lends credence to an emerging reconceptualization of behavioural control where the motor system can be considered as part of a high-level perceptual system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{movements}} of both {{eyes and the}} head were recorded with search coils in unrestrained, freely moving chameleons. As a main result I found that the generation of saccades in {{the left and the}} right eye was either independent from each other or was highly corre-lated according to the <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation.</b> When no prey item was fixated, disconjugate saccades were ob-served which was in accordance with earlier observa-tions in chameleons. During prey tracking the chame-leons switched to a different oculomotor behaviour and pursued the moving prey with synchronous saccades. At higher target velocities, the tracking movement of the head was also saccadic and was synchronised with the two eyes. Binocular coupling affected only the timing of the saccades but not the metrics: the amplitudes of the synchronous saccades were usually different in the two eyes. These observations suggest the existence of two in-dependent premotor neuronal circuits for left and right eye saccadic motor control in the chameleon. Binocular coupling in prey-tracking chameleons is probably achieved by neuronal coupling of these premotor circuits during eye–head coordination. The ability to switch be-tween synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye move-ments has not been described for any other vertebrate. This unique ability of the chameleon may help to under-stand the organisation of the oculomotor system of other vertebrates since evidence for separate left eye and right eye saccade generation and position control has recently also been reported in primates...|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{activity}} of the dog's hippocampus was recorded in (a) an operant behaviour situation, and (b) a field situation by a radio-telemetering system. The dominant frequency of the theta rhythm shifted consistently from 4 – 5 c/sec to 6 – 7 c/sec when a dog (a) withdrew from a pedal after being rewarded or (b) switched from a ‘turning around’ type of activity to an act performed to catch an object thrown some distance away. The frequency shift was quantified by integrated frequency analysis.

40|$|The {{production}} of 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in rats {{has been associated}} with both positive social interactions and appetitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations.</b> Furthermore, there is significant evidence showing that these vocalizations are controlled by the meso-limbic dopamine system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform a pharmacological analysis of 50 kHz calls by using dopamine and two dopamine agonists amphetamine and apomorphine, to induce calls. The acoustic parameters of the different call types were compared across each agonist. All three agonists were able to significantly induce more 50 kHz vocalizations compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, calls elicited by apomorphine had a significantly higher bandwidth compared to those elicited by dopamine and amphetamine. All three agonists also had significantly different pharmacokinetic properties. These observations suggest that the D 2 receptor sub-type is involved in the length of call bandwidths...|$|R
40|$|Interneurones in the {{respiratory}} rhythm generator of the locust {{were identified by}} means of intracellular recording and staining techniques. A description is made of the properties and structures of nine intersegmental neurones which reset {{the respiratory}} rhythm when injected with current pulses. All but one of these neurones discharged in phase with expiration. The injection of constant depolariz-ing current into these interneurones altered the respiratory rate (increase for six, decrease for three). The respiratory rhythm generator extends more posteriorly within the ventral nerve cord than the metathoracic ganglion. In the first fused abdominal ganglion, four individual interneurones were identified descending into the unfused abdominal ganglia. In the first unfused abdominal ganglion an intemeurone which reset the respiratory rhythm was found ascending into the metathoracic ganglion. The respiratory rhythm generator also extends more anteriorly within the ventral nerve cord than the metathoracic ganglion. Two interneurones influencing the respiratory rhythm send their axons from the first fused abdominal ganglion into the meta- and mesothoracic ganglia. One of these directly excited a mesothoracic intemeurone which also influenced the respiratory rhythm when injected with current. In the suboesophageal ganglion another intemeurone was found which, although capable of resetting the respiratory rhythm, was not alway active during respiration. We conclude that the respiratory rhythm generator is distributed over abdominal, thoracic and suboesophageal ganglia. At least {{one part of the}} respiratory rhythm generator (in the suboeso-phageal ganglion) is not always active and can be recruited during vigorous respiration. Thus the number of active components in the respiratory rhythm generator is variable and additional elements can be recruited depending on the <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{response}} {{characteristics to}} light stimuli of first order ocellar interneurons in the bee (Apis mellifera carnica) were analysed with intracellular re-cordings. The neurons were identified using intracel-lular dye injection (Lucifer yellow). The responses of L-(large) neurons can vary. They range from transient graded hyperpolarizations i re-sponse to light-On and-Off, (sometimes accompanied by tonic hyperpolarization during the light stimulus), to spontaneous tonic action potentials which are in-hibited by light. Some neurons how both hyperpolar-izations and action potentials. The varying responses to light stimuli are depen-dent {{only on the}} state of the L-neuron and are not correlated systematically with particular types of L-neurons. The experiments demonstrate hat the action po-tentials are generated within the L-neurons and are not conducted antidromically from other neurons. The amplitude and frequency of the action potentials depend on the membrane potential of the L-neuron. With light stimulation, or application of hyperpo-larizing current, spikes can be generated within some of the L-neurons. Presumably non-spiking L-neurons are refractory due to maintained epolarization. They have membrane potentials of about- 40 inV. Action potentials in L-neurons were recorded only with high resistance microelectrodes. The vitality of the animal can not be correlated with the occurrence of spikes. Functional significance of spontaneous tonic spike discharges in L-neurons is discussed in the context of behavioural experiments in the bee. It is possible, that a given L-neuron uses either spiking or non-spiking signal transmission depending on the <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation.</b> Although very fine microcapillary electrodes were used, no successful recordings or stainings of S-(small) neurons in the ocellar nerve were achieved. Therefore, results of non-identified ocellar interneu-rons which have been attributed to S-neurons hould be critically reviewed...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the use of evidence by the UK policy community to tackle Islamist-inspired terrorism. It focuses on how evidence for such terrorism is generated, interpreted and organized, and in particular pinpointing the challenges of reliability and prediction facing those with responsibility for tackling terrorism and its associated causes. Counter-terrorism policy is heavily exposed to risks of bias and distortion, but it is also vulnerable to various kinds of institutional group-think and vested interests. This article scrutinises three aspects of CT evidence-based policymaking. First, there are imperfections in the evidence base, mostly arising from data limitations and practical shortcomings. These include factual gaps in knowledge, difficulties in comparing evidence about Muslims with non-Muslims, methodological weaknesses, and difficulties in measuring profoundly subjective feelings about alienation and grievance. Secondly, the scope of the problem to which policy is addressed (and the policy paradigms that are alluded to) shape the priorities placed on the evidence base. How much weight should be given to evidence about the narrative of oppression or dissent used by extremists? Background oppositional identities are extensively researched and yet policymakers may choose to concentrate instead on factors in the foreground {{that have to do with}} actual violent conspiracies. Thirdly, important nuances in the evidence-policy nexus arise from the implicit generalizations that are held by policymakers. Evidence describing the problem of terrorism is better accompanied by an appreciation of (and perhaps evidence about) the <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation</b> of decision-makers and decision-making structures. This involves trade-offs, bargaining and accommodations to carry different constituencies, and has a bearing on the kind of evidence that is used in CT. The article closes with a discussion of the above distinctions, and concludes that there is a risk of naivety in evidence-based policymaking that is not alive to the politics of radicalization and extremism...|$|E
40|$|The {{arrester}} or fixation {{system of}} the head in adult Odonata is unique among arthropods. This system involves the organs of two body segments: the head and the neck. It consists of a skeleton–muscle apparatus that sets the arrester parts in motion. The parts comprise formations covered with complicated microstructures: fields of microtrichia on the rear surface {{of the head and}} post-cervical sclerites of the neck. The arrester immobilizes the head during feeding or when the dragonfly is in tandem flight. Thus, it may serve as an adaptation to save the head from violent mechanical disturbance and to stabilize gaze in a variety of <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations.</b> This study shows the evolutionary trend of the arrester in the order Odonata by using scanning electron microscopy and measurements of arrester structures in 227 species from 26 odonate families. The arrester design occurring in the Epiophlebiidae, Gomphidae, Neopetaliidae, Petaluridae and Chlorogomphinae is suggested to be the basic one. Two convergent pathways of head-arrester evolution among Zygoptera and Anisoptera are proposed. The possible functional significance of the arrester system is discussed...|$|R
40|$|C-fibre {{activation}} induces {{a long-term}} potentiation (LTP) in the spinal flexion reflex in mammals, presumably to provide enhanced reflexive protection of damaged tissue from further injury. Descending monoaminergic pathways {{are thought to}} depress sensory input but may also amplify spinal reflexes; the mechanisms of this modulation within the spinal cord remain to be elucidated. We used electrical stimulation of primary afferents and recordings of motor output, in the rat lumbar spinal cord maintained in vitro, to demonstrate that serotonin is capable of inducing a long-lasting increase in reflex strength at all ages examined (postnatal days 2 – 12). Pharmacological analyses indicated an essential requirement for activation of 5 -HT 2 C receptors while 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B, 5 -HT 7 and 5 -HT 2 A receptor activation was not required. In addition, primary afferent-evoked synaptic potentials recorded in a subpopulation of laminae III-VI spinal neurons were similarly facilitated by 5 -HT. Thus, serotonin receptor-evoked facilitatory actions are complex, and may involve alterations in neuronal properties at both motoneuronal and pre-motoneuronal levels. This study provides the first demonstration of a descending transmitter producing a long-lasting amplification in reflex strength, accomplished by activating a specific serotonin receptor subtype. It is suggested that brain modulatory systems regulate reflex pathways to function within an appropriate range of sensori-motor gain, facilitating reflexes in <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations</b> requiring increased sensory responsiveness...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century {{it became}} clear that the human brain {{operates}} with more than a dozen of neurotransmitters and a large number of neuropeptides and hormones. The relationships between these different chemical systems are complex as some of them suppress and some of them induce each other’s release during neuronal exchanges. This complexity of relationships devalues the old approach of assigning “inhibitory vs. excitatory” roles to neurotransmitters: the same neurotransmitters can be either inhibitory or excitatory depending on what system they interact with. It became clear that an impressive diversity of neurotransmitters and their receptors is necessary to meet a wide range of <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations,</b> but the links between temperament traits and specific neurotransmitters are still a matter of research. Several attempts were made to assign specific (single) neurotransmitters to specific (single) traits. For example, dopamine was proposed to be a neurotransmitter of the trait of Extraversion, noradrenalin was linked to anxiety, and serotonin was thought to be a neurotransmitter of an inhibition system. These assignments of neurotransmitter functions appeared to be an oversimplification when confronted by the evidence of much more diverse functionality. Research groups led by Petra Netter in Germany and Trevor Robbins in Cambridge, UK had most extensive studies of the links between temperament traits or dynamical properties of behavior and groups of neurotransmitters ...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis (mostly) {{concerns}} {{the application of}} alternative mathematical methods to understand patterns in human cognition and to model them. The different chapters presented in this thesis show research that {{concerns the}} application of quantum probability (QP) theory in the modeling of human decision-making. Quantum probability (QP) theory is a theory for how to assign probabilities to events. QP theory {{can be thought of}} as the probability rules from quantum mechanics, without any of the physics. This work is not about the application of quantum physics to brain physiology. Rather, we are interested in QP theory as a mathematical framework for cognitive modelling. This theory is potentially relevant in any <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation</b> that involves uncertainty. QP theory is analogous to classical probability theory, though QP theory and classical probability (CP) theory are founded from different sets of axioms (the Kolmogorov and Dirac/von Neumann axioms respectively) and so are subject to alternative constraints. In this thesis we show that especially over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in decision-making and cognitive models using a quantum probabilistic (QP) framework. We see how this development encompasses publications in major journals (see Pothos and Busemeyer, 2013; Wang et al., 2014; and Yearsley and Pothos, 2014; among others), special issues, and dedicated workshops, as well as several comprehensive books (Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012; Khrennikov, 2010; and Haven and Khrennikov, 2010). However, uncertainty itself is neither ethical nor unethical – yet it is inherent to most situations in which, for instance, moral judgments and decisions have to be made. For a descriptive understanding of judgment and decisions in moral situations, it is an important lesson to acknowledge both the cognitive side (bounded rationality) and the environment (ecological rationality) – and thus the uncertainty of the world and how the mind deals with it. This thesis also shows significant interest in moral and social psychology. Specifically, we consider present technologies that suggest a need for evaluating alternative contexts for ethical decision-making. How the research on human-machine interaction feeds back into humans’ understanding of themselves as moral agents? This key question ultimately relates to the nature of ethical theory itself. Overall, this dissertation presents and addresses not only standard aspects of decision- making processes, such as similarity judgments (Chapters 1 to 4) or the constructive role of articulating impressions (Chapter 5), but also standard aspects of social psychology, such as moral judgments (Chapters 6 and 7) and game theory (Chapter 8). As stated in the Declarations section, the present thesis is a combination of a standard and a publication- based dissertation...|$|E
40|$|In {{expanding}} my {{theoretical and}} practical knowledge in fostering successful collaborative learning opportunities, my major project {{is an example of}} participatory arts-based action research. I was e nthusiastically inspired to incorporate collaborative design and an active painting process into this research project, as I have been an avid community-oriented artist since a tender age. I was able to enhance my range of skills through large scale set design projects, municipal banners, graphic design projects, constructive sculpture, advanced painting, and drawing practices within my undergraduate degree in Geography and Visual Arts at Vancouver Island University. I am an advocate for the diversification of cultural development to encourage creativity and to increase our perceptive sensibilities. Individuals can achieve an internalized understanding of a particular area of study if they are fully engaged in the process, thus making the experience more influential. By conducting interdisciplinary research {{in the form of a}} literature review of contemporary agricultural development, environmental philosophy, and popular education theory, I designed my major project to concentrate on communicating the urgency of socio-cultural and environmental justice embedded within transnational food sovereignty issues. Raj Patel (2009) describes in the Journal of Peasant Studies how a heavy "technocentric approach could exacerbate current conditions of poverty and inequity" due to a concentration of "power and privilege" within a "narrow set of world views at the expense of pertinent local knowledge and socio-cultural and political specificities" (693). The rapid growth of global agricultural development and lack of transnational education pertaining to ecological studies has greatly influenced cultural development, consumer behaviouralism, and expanding corporate ownership. There is an increase in the fragmentation of ecological stability within agricultural productionawell as a lack of ethical responsibility within the cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, and trade practices. In providing participant questionnaires and facilitating a collaborative mural project within my research, this series of popular education workshops aided in expressing sustainable cultural and educational activities. The results from the workshops encapsulated the diversity of perceptions participants had of contemporary agricultural and ecological development. "They dreamed of an open, democratic education, one that would instill in their children a taste for questioning, a passion for knowledge, a healthy curiosity, the joy of creating, and the pleasure of risk without which there can be no creation"(Freire, P., 2012, 122). Paulo Freire (1921 - 1997) and his work as an educational theorist, influential author, and philosopher, has been a significant influence in the expansion of my own academic and personal ideologies. Upon developing this major research project, similarly to the progressive topics expressed in the writings on popular education and social justice of Paulo Freire, the purpose was to inspire critical thought, conversation, and creativity. I aimed to build cohesive interconnectivity, inter- relationality, and environmentalist phenomenological perspectives relative to ' just sustainability'. The "crisis of sustainability", as quoted by Robert Costanza (1987) in David Orr's Hope Is an Imperative, is more of a rational <b>behavioural</b> <b>situation,</b> a social trap, and a cultural avoidance tactic (Orr, 2011, 75). Additionally, Julian Agyeman (2003) within his text Just Sustainabilities: Development in an Unequal World describes just sustainability as recognizing vast societal inequalities with references to "anthropocentrism", "ecological democracy", "feminism and gender", "selective victimization", "risk society", "biocultural assimilation", and "ecological modernization" (Agyeman, 2003). Just sustainability aims at finding a critical balance between environmental and social justice. The organizational world we live in is structured and shaped into systems in all areas including our economies, governments, families, cultures, sciences, and individual selves. It is possible to transition from exclusive systems to more inclusive systems, where we can attempt to actualize our aspirations for "a fair distribution of power, human dignity, and a livable environment" (Merchant, xii, 1992). Within John P. Miller's (2013) text The Holistic Curriculum, he elaborates how our sense of individualism has "promoted the fragmentation as there is less attempt to define the common good, much less work towards such a goal" (pp. 48). Our world has become increasingly homogenized through the process of globalization, as there is a loss of diversity due to monocultural domination as opposed to ensuring the survival of "polycultural praxis" (Gonzalez, 2004, 447). It will require that our contemporary cultures value diversity, cultural sovereignty, and traditional inter-generational values. Within environmental education, to reach a deeper level of collective and collaborative understanding of these developmental issues we must embody the varying local sociocultural contexts, as well as the natural processes of the particular bioregions and ecological systems. I have also been inspired by a Deep Ecological critical pedagogy of self-realization, as described by author and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912 - 2009). Our goal is to enhance our collective understanding of the self, how we determine values, and what spirituality may mean in relation to one another, our communities, our historical nationalities, and our local and global ecological systems. Arne Naess in his interpretation of self-realization stated "the maturity of self has been considered to develop through three stages, from ego to social self, comprising the ego, and from there to the metaphysical self, comprising the social self" while incorporating nature and reaching the critical potential of the "ecological self" (Naess, as quoted in Drengson & Yuichi, 1995, 14). I aimed to include these ideals into a popular educational praxis in a participatory fashion through allowing participants to express themselves within the greater context of our environmentalist topics in a social community in the form of symbolism and artwork. The structure of the design loom I developed aimed to empower critical educational dialogue with discussion-based action research and surveys. Topics covered include defining eight definitions: vCulture, Health, Globalization, Deep Ecology, Ecological Stewardship, Sacred Economics, Just Sustainability, and Agroecology (See Ch. 3. 2 & Appendix E). The intention of focusing on these terms was to aid in discussing diversity within environmental philosophy, deconstructing the complexity of agricultural studies, developing personal-communal ecological identities, as well as engaging discussions pertaining to fostering healthy sustainable cultures and communities. This research design was reviewed and approved by the FES Human Participants Research Committee on behalf of York University for the year 2014. I held two successful workshops in two locations in Toronto, Ontario in May and June of 2014. Participant involvement in these workshops varied depending on personal availability and one's desired contribution to this major research. Participants were given the opportunity to contribute to a group discussion, a 'People's Dictionary' popular education activity, a personal anonymously documented questionnaire, as well as collaborative mural design and painting. This study was completely voluntary and participants had the right to withdraw at any time. This collaborative arts-based action research project was an exciting activity to facilitate, as it gave participants an opportunity to share their stories and opinions, as well as elaborate upon their knowledge of agricultural and ecological studies while exercising their creative skill sets. The content within the research interview questionnaire (Appendix C) was relative to each participant's personal contribution to the greater systems of agricultural development, their own moral value-based criteria associated with consumer products, dietary requirements or habits, and lastly if they had any relative practical/educational experience in agricultural production or ecological systems knowledge. Within rapidly globalizing urban cultures, an increasing fragmentation between nature and society can occur. More specifically, there can be a growing lack of transparency in relation to the origin, composition, and accurate social implications of our consumables, as well as to the integrity of environmental health. We are expanding our agricultural production rates, though the margins of inaccessibility are increasing: "Last year record numbers of the world's poor experienced hunger, this at a time of record harvests and record profits for the world's major agrifood corporations" (Holt- Gimenez, 2009, 143). There is an increase in transnational corporate ownership of agricultural land and development, consequently a decrease in diversity, an increase in demand, and a lack of proper equitable distribution. Our cultures and systems are continually evolving, this contemporary post-colonial developmental trend is due to "ecological imperialism", a term coined by Alfred W. Crosby (1986), which describes the transformation of our physical, biological, atmospheric, and fluvial systems, as well as traditional societal structures and practices (Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 76). Similarly, the exponential rate of globalization has fostered an expanding global economic structure, while these developmental impacts have "perpetuated poverty, widened material inequalities, increased ecological degradation, sustained militarism, fragmented communities, marginalized subordinated groups, fed intolerance and deepened crises of democracy" (Scholte, 1996, as quoted in Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 111). Though we claim to be fostering values of social justice, there are barriers to equality and a diminishing sense of responsibility on a global scale. We continue to disassociate ourselves from the biogeographical origins of our ingredients and natural resources, as well as the labour force and communities who increase the opportunities for prosperity and sociocultural innovation in developed urban regions. Primarily within my research, I obtained a substantial spectrum of anonymous data from my participant groups to assess the level of interest, intention, and awareness one may have of contemporary transnational agricultural and ecological issues. In a progressive lens, I aimed to inspire participants to broaden their imaginative minds and critical perspectives within the framework of an artistic practice. With literary, energetic, vocal, and creative contributions, I hope their experiences were positive on personal-communal, existential, and internal levels. In fostering environmental stewardship and ecological literacy we are searching for "patterns, unity, and connections between people of all ages, races, nationalities, and generations" as well as between people and the natural world; embellishing a "tradition grounded in the belief that life is sacred and not to be carelessly expended on the ephemeral" (Orr, 2011, 260). As Gary Snyder (1990) once described in his article 'Ecology, Place, and the Awakening of Compassion' that an "ecosystem is a kind of mandala in which there are multiple relations that are all powerful and instructive", while it can be described as hierarchical in terms of "energy-flow", its basis relies on all entities as being equal and a part of a whole (Snyder, 1990, as quoted in Drengson & Inoue, 1995, 238). Our interwoven interconnectivity is a metaphysical and existential symbiotic system, similar to the sociopolitical ecologies we weave within the constraints of nature, therefore we must maximize our conscientious awareness of these intimate relationships...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of {{attention}} and promotion of behavioural flexibility are functions attributed to both the noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC receives a large innervation from LC and small changes in catecholaminergic activity in PFC profoundly affect cognitive function. It {{is crucial to the}} understanding of learning-related plasticity, that the cognitive context driving LC neurons be determined and the relation to activity in PFC be elucidated. To this end simultaneous recordings were made from LC and prelimbic cortex (PL) during an odour-reward association task in the rat. Neuronal activity related to orientation {{of attention}}, reward predictability, reward itself, and changes in stimulus reinforcement contingencies, was measured. All LC neurons and a significant proportion of PL neurons were engaged during several aspects of a Go/NoGo task, especially after the signal for trial onset and CS+ presentation. LC activation was, however, more tightly aligned to the behavioural response than to the CS+ 22 % of PL neurons were activated during the response-reward delay. This suggests that the activity of both these structures is related to reward anticipation. Finally, LC neurons exhibited rapid plasticity when the reward-contingency was modified. Within-trial response latencies were always shorter in LC than in PL and between-trial response adaptation in LC preceded that in PL by many trials. Identifying such temporal relationships is an essential step toward understanding how neuromodulatory inputs to forebrain networks might promote or permit experience-dependent plasticity in <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations...</b>|$|R

From all bottlenose dolphins sound repertoire the most studied communication signals are whistles which have been commonly categorized by their shape. Dolphin communication through sound has a variety of functions in their behaviours. Bottlenose dolphins have been observed producing whistles in many different <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations</b> that allows them to communicate. Although it seems that this whistles can transmit information, it is still unclear which exactly role they have in communication, therefore this study tries to give further information about how dolphins use sound production in different behavioural states. In the present study we analysed if behaviour was influencing whistle production and whistle variability in wild populations of bottlenose dolphins from the Arousa Ria (Galicia). The data used was collected from April to October of 2015. Survey for dolphins were conducted from a research vessel and behavioural information was collected following the predominant activity sample (PAS). Dolphins’ behaviour were categorized in feeding, socializing or travelling states and acoustical recordings were collected with an omni-directional hydrophone (frequency response of 0. 02 - 100 kHz). Whistles were later selected, analysed and categorized by their contour or shape. Our findings showed that group size was not causing any effect on whistle production (Pearson p-value = 0. 4942 and r = 0. 25) and neither a specific behavioural state was influencing on whistle rates (Anova p-value= 0. 42). In contrast, whistle variability was found to be associated to a given behaviour (Chi 2 p-value 2. 84 e- 26). Our results differ from what found {{in other areas of the}} world regarding whistle production and behaviour but are similar regarding whistle variability.

In contrast, if the situation is weak, then recruitment and a rewards system are better influencers of behaviour. A case study based around a small engineering enterprise demonstrates how the use of QFD can guide managers on the introduction of the most appropriate initiatives to improve performanc...|$|R

40|$|In January 2001, the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) jointly set up Pre-School Qualification Accreditation Committee (PQAS) {{to oversee}} the {{standards}} and quality of pre school teacher training for both kindergarten and Childcare sectors. The MOE and the MCYS introduced an integrated Pre-School Education (PSE) framework for teacher training and accreditation applicable to р re-school personnel. The training route for pre-school teachers came into effect in January 2001. Teacher training and the qualifications offer high leverage opportunities for enhancing standards of training and expanding career opportunities for pre-school professionals in Singapore. The various levels of training are planned to cater to the different needs of the teachers and prepare them for leadership in the sector. This will ensure that pre-school professionals are well equipped to provide our young children with an enriched learning environment, to nurture their social skills and values, and prepare them for lifelong learning (wwwl. moe. edu. sg/preschooleducation). The majority of teacher trainees involved in this research have been working as caregivers in most Child Care Centres in Singapore without relevant knowledge of the child. The study is underpinned by the contemporary argument that any adult who works with children needs to know about Child Development, Theories of Childhood and Play-based Learning Environment, which actively challenge the traditional stereotypical notions that experiences alone would be sufficient. Understanding the growing child would no doubt help to focus on appropriate tasks for the child. Central to {{the focus of the}} study is to gain an understanding of the existing knowledge of the teacher trainees (both who are working with children and otherwise) before and after the study sessions and how such an increase of knowledge could empower and enfranchise the teachers to make informed decisions in the child’s life. At the completion of the course they were able to comprehend the most important factors of the growing child that they were considerably unaware of and better manage <b>behavioural</b> <b>situations</b> with the child. The teachers' final records of Observation and Evaluation, Professional Journals of the children combined with a final powerful public presentation of the Child Study Making Learning Visible no doubt heighten the educational process as a learning discipline, a vital link that provides a powerful medium to interact with the growing child.

Social skills training (SST) aims to increase the ability to perform key social behaviours that are important in achieving success in social <b>situations.</b> <b>Behavioural</b> SST methods include instructions, modelling, behaviour rehearsal, feedback and reinforcement, frequently used in association with interpersonal problem solving and social perception skills training. Effective change in social behaviour also requires interventions that reduce inhibiting and competing behaviours, such as cognitive restructuring, self- and emotional-regulation methods and contingency management.

40|$|The {{flights of}} {{free-flying}} houseflies are analysed in different <b>behavioural</b> and environmental <b>situations.</b> The angular movements about the vertical body axis {{are characterized by}} a cascade of steplike changes of long axis orientation (`turns'). Most of these turns are separated by periods of little or no rotation. Turns about the vertical axis are short (under 120 ms). They are performed at angular velocities of up to about 4000 deg s^(- 1). These characteristics are found (i) when a single fly cruises in a stationary environment; (ii) if the visual input is eliminated; (iii) if a textured surround (optomotor stimulus) is moved around the fly; (iv) during visually guided pursuit of small targets in stationary {{as well as in}} moving environments. Optomotor stimulation increases the number of turns in the direction of pattern motion relative to those against it. This leads to a correlation between the average angular velocity of the fly and the stimulus velocity. However, optomotor stimulation does not interfere with chasing and tracking. A model is proposed that qualitatively accounts for the observed behaviour in free flight of houseflies...|$|R
40|$|Perspective-taking, {{understanding}} {{false belief}} and deception are considered by mainstream psychologists {{to be critical}} for competent cognitive development. Theory of Mind researchers, in particular, have devoted considerable attention to these cognitive domains. By contrast, these phenomena have traditionally attracted little or no interest from <b>behavioural</b> psychologists. This <b>situation,</b> however, has begun to change in recent years with behavioural researchers working {{under the rubric of}} Relational Frame Theory devoting considerable effort to empirical analyses of these cognitive abilities. The current paper reviews some of the first empirical evidence generated by the relational frame approach to perspective-taking, false belief and deception as related relational skills. The results of this work show considerable overlap with more traditional Theory of Mind findings, and thus suggest that these topics may be an important area of integration between these two disparate traditions. Additional evidence from studies in which specific relational repertoires were targeted for remediation when perspective-taking, false belief and deception were found to be absent also suggest the applicability of the relational frame interpretation of these abilities. Although much more work needs to be done, current empirical evidence suggests that from both conceptual and applied perspectives, the relational fram...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Behavioural syndromes, i. e. {{consistent}} {{individual differences}} in behaviours that are correlated across different functional contexts, are a challenge to evolutionary reasoning because individuals should adapt their behaviour {{to the requirements of}} each <b>situation.</b> <b>Behavioural</b> syndromes are often interpreted as a result of constraints resulting in limited plasticity and inflexible behaviour. Alternatively, they may be adaptive if correlated ecological or social challenges functionally integrate apparently independent behaviours. To test the latter hypothesis we repeatedly tested helpers in the cooperative breeder Neolamprologus pulcher for exploration and two types of helping behaviour. In case of adaptive behavioural syndromes we predicted a positive relationship between exploration and aggressive helping (territory defence) and a negative relationship between these behaviours and non-aggressive helping (territory maintenance). Results As expected, helpers engaging more in territory defence were consistently more explorative and engaged less in territory maintenance, the latter only when dominant breeders were present. Contrary to our prediction, there was no negative relationship between exploration and territory maintenance. Conclusion Our results suggest that the three behaviours we measured are part of behavioural syndromes. These may be adaptive, in that they reflect strategic specialization of helpers into one of two different life history strategies, namely (a) to stay and help in the home territory in order to inherit the breeding position or (b) to disperse early in order to breed independently. </p...|$|R
40|$|M. A. (Psychology) This {{investigation}} {{is aimed at}} enhancing the degree of behavioural compliance in individual clients through the utilization of cognitive dissonance {{as an adjunct to}} a behavioural prescription. The literature on behaviour therapy holds that behavioural prescription is accepted in its own right as an effective procedure for inducing behavioural compliance. At the same time it is evident that in certain <b>situations</b> <b>behavioural</b> prescription alone is not effective in inducing behavioural compliance. The reason for this is given as the tendency for certain individuals to respond to a behavioural prescription with defiance, or to use reactance. Such a tendency is known as the reactance-potential of the individual. Several variables have been linked in the literature to reactance-potential, for example, locus of control. This variable {{has the potential to be}} used to predict reactance-potential, and thus the likelihood of an individual responding to a behavioural prescription with reactance. Reactance is seen as a process that can be utilized in the therapeutic relationship in the service of change. Cognitive dissonance theory allows for the utilization of reactance in the psychotherapeutic context so that the response to cognitive dissonance induction is behavioural compliance. The experimental hypothesis was based on the theory that cognitive dissonance induction would direct the individual "s reactance towards the reduction of the state of cognitive dissonance that was induced. The goal of the therapeutic intervention was an increased degree of behavioural compliance in the experimental group that received cognitive dissonance induction. Therapeutic instructions were applied to two groups. The control group [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{contributes}} to the evolving process of moving the study of Complexity from the arena of metaphor to something real and operational. Acknowledging this phenomenon ultimately changes the underlying assumptions made about working environments and leadership; organisations are dynamic and so should their leaders be. Dynamic leaders are behaviourally complex. Behavioural Complexity {{is a product of}} behavioural repertoire - range of behaviours; and behavioural differentiation - where effective leaders apply appropriate behaviour {{to the demands of the}} <b>situation.</b> <b>Behavioural</b> Complexity was operationalised using the Competing Values Framework (CVF). The CVF is a measure that captures the extent to which leaders demonstrate four behaviours on four quadrants: Control, Compete, Collaborate and Create, which are argued to be critical to all types of organisational leadership. The results provide evidence to suggest Behavioural Complexity is an enabler of leadership effectiveness; Organisational Complexity (captured using a new measure developed in the thesis) moderates Behavioural Complexity and leadership effectiveness; and leadership training supports Behavioural Complexity in contributing to leadership effectiveness. Most definitions of leadership come down to changing people’s behaviour. Such definitions have contributed to a popularity of focus in leadership research intent on exploring how to elicit change in others when maybe some of the popularity of attention should have been on eliciting change in the leader them self. It is hoped that this research will provoke interest into the factors that cause behavioural change in leaders that in turn enable leadership effectiveness and in doing so contribute to a better understanding of leadership in organisations.

This study aimed at assessing whether unpredictable and repeated negative stimuli (URNS) influence feeding behaviour in quail. Sixty-four quail {{were exposed to}} URNS from day 17 to 40, while 64 quail were undisturbed. Two lines divergently selected on their inherent emotionality {{were used to assess}} the effect of genetic factors on the sensitivity to URNS. All quail were submitted to a sequential feeding procedure (using two diets of different energetic values) which placed them in a contrasting <b>situation.</b> <b>Behavioural</b> tests were performed to assess the emotional reactivity of the two lines. Results confirmed that differences exist between them and that their emotional reactivity was enhanced by URNS. Diet preferences, motivation and daily intake were also measured. URNS did not change the preferences for the hypercaloric diet compared to the hypocaloric diet in choice tests, but they reduced daily intakes in both lines. Motivations for each diet were differently affected by URNS: they decreased the motivation to eat the hypercaloric diet in quail selected for their low inherent fearfulness whereas they increased the motivation to eat the hypocaloric diet in quail selected for their high inherent fearfulness, which suggested a devaluation process in the former and a compensatory behaviour in the later. Growth was furthermore reduced and laying delayed by URNS in both lines. In conclusion, the exposure to URNS induced interesting changes in feeding behaviour added with an increase in emotional reactivity and an alteration of production parameters. This confirms that both lines of quail experienced a chronic stress state. However differences in feed motivation and emotional reactivity between lines under chronic stress suggested that they experienced different emotional state and use different ways to cope with it depending on their genetic background...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{optimize}} behavioural performance {{when confronted with}} continuously evolving environmental demands {{is a key element}} of human cognition. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which lies on the medial surface of the frontal lobes, is important in regulating cognitive control. Hypotheses about its function include guiding reward-based decision making, monitoring for conflict between competing responses and predicting task difficulty. Precise mechanisms of dACC function remain unknown, however, because of the limited number of human neurophysiological studies. Here we use functional imaging and human single-neuron recordings to show that the firing of individual dACC neurons encodes current and recent cognitive load. We demonstrate that the modulation of current dACC activity by previous activity produces a behavioural adaptation that accelerates reactions to cues of similar difficulty to previous ones, and retards reactions to cues of different difficulty. Furthermore, this conflict adaptation, or Gratton effect, is abolished after surgically targeted ablation of the dACC. Our results demonstrate that the dACC provides a continuously updated prediction of expected cognitive demand to optimize future <b>behavioural</b> responses. In <b>situations</b> with stable cognitive demands, this signal promotes efficiency by hastening responses, but in situations with changing demands it engenders accuracy by delaying responses. 1 R 01 EY 017658 - 01 A/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States 1 R 01 NS 063249 /NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States 5 R 01 DP 000339 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United StatesMH 086400 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesP 41 RR 14075 /RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 DA 026297 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 EY 017658 /EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesR 25 NS 065743 /NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesR 25 NS 065743 /NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesHoward Hughes Medical Institute/United States 2013 - 02 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 22722841 PMC 341692...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: StartReact is the {{acceleration}} of reaction time by a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS). The SAS is thought to release a pre-prepared motor program. Here, we investigated whether the StartReact effect is applicable to the very first trial {{in a series of}} repeated unpractised single-joint movements. Methods: Twenty healthy young subjects were instructed to perform a rapid ankle dorsiflexion movement in response to an imperative stimulus. Participants were divided in two groups of ten. Both groups performed 17 trials. In one group a SAS (116 dB) was given in the first trial, whereas the other group received a non-startling sound (70 dB) as the first imperative stimulus. In the remaining 16 trials, the SAS was given as the imperative stimulus in 25 % of the trials in both groups. The same measurement was repeated one week later, but with the first-trial stimuli counterbalanced between groups. Results: When a SAS was given in the very first trial, participants had significantly shorter onset latencies compared to first-trial responses to a non-startling stimulus. Succeeding trials were significantly faster compared to the first trial, both for trials with and without a SAS. However, the difference between the first and succeeding trials was significantly larger for responses to a non-startling stimulus compared to responses triggered by a SAS. SAS-induced acceleration in the first trial of the second session was similar to that in succeeding trials of session 1. Discussion: The present results confirm that the StartReact phenomenon also applies to movements that have not yet been practiced in the experimental context. The excessive SAS-induced acceleration in the very first trial {{may be due to the}} absence of integration of novel context-specific information with the existing motor memory for movement execution. Our findings demonstrate that StartReact enables a rapid release of motor programs in the very first trial also without previous practice, which might provide a <b>behavioural</b> advantage in <b>situations</b> that require a rapid response to a potentially threatening environmental stimulus...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of individual variations in behaviour {{has been demonstrated}} in all species investigated. Horses do show individual variations {{in a variety of}} behaviours from an early age on, as well as in behavioural traits underlying temperament/personality. Temperament is generally described as the “biological” (i. e. genetic) basis on which personality, as a result of environmental influences (i. e. experience), will be constructed. Indeed, genetic factors such as breed or patriline do have an influence on aspects like emotional reactions to fear-inducing situations or cognitive abilities while environmental factors, such as the conditions of life or the type of work performed, have also an influence on horse personality. We will review here the existing evidence of this interplay between genetic and environmental influences, showing that different traits can be differently influenced, and then look more thoroughly at the processes involved. A particular accent will be given to the influence of the human-horse relation on personality traits of horses, both at adult stages through management, daily interactions and type of work, and at early stages through management and handling of foals. The question of the stability of traits across situations and over time, that is of the possible predictibility of behavioural traits, is central, especially where the transfer from experimental <b>situations</b> (<b>behavioural</b> tests) to working situations and performance is concerned. The question of methodological approaches (behavioural tests, observations, questionnaires) can be crucial here and will be discussed. In overall, this review should help understanding the determinants of horse temperament/personality traits and their implication in terms of choice of the appropriate horse for a given owner, better management and training for a better welfare and horse-human relationship. Genetic influences may lead to different susceptibilities to the same environmental conditions which mean that there are no such thing as “bad” or “good” horse temperaments but rather different horse types that may require different management or training schedules...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{development}} of new technologies in the automotive industry integrates more and more different complex safety systems. Some of these security systems (ADAS) are based on the monitoring of the driver's cognitive state (Wang, Xu, & Gong, 2010). To this aim, these systems take into account some physiological and/or behavioural parameters in order to estimate for example the level of stress/anxiety or the level of mental workload. Nevertheless, most of these systems do not integrate in their functioning the type of driving situation in which the driver is (e. g., overtaking of a truck, sudden occurrence of a pedestrian). Furthermore, the temporal period for which physiological and behavioral data are affected by a given driving situation still needs to be determined. Therefore, a study has been driven on a simulator so as to investigate how 1) driving could impact drivers' internal state; 2) which indicator (physiological and/or behavioural) was the more sensitive to these changes. Participants had to perform three different driving situations (left-turn, overtaking and pedestrian occurrence) within two sessions (baseline and experimental sessions). The traffic conditions were manipulated to increase traffic density and/or time pressure for each situation of the experimental session, when compared to the baseline session. After each driving situation, the driver had to perform a standardized car following task (Brookhuis, Waard, & Mulder, 1994) during five minutes while the driver's cognitive state was analyzed through physiological (EDA and ECG) and behavioural (driving performance parameters). Besides, subjective measures (questionnaires) were performed after each driving session. The results highlighted the relationship between high mental workload and physiological variations after all experimental <b>situations.</b> Nevertheless, <b>behavioural</b> reactions following the unexpected event seemed to differ from those obtained after a situation inducing anxiety, because of a high traffic density. Moreover, the signatures of behavioural and physiological reactions to the experimental situations did not present the same duration. While, physiological data quickly returned to their baseline value, (after one minute following the <b>situation),</b> <b>behavioural</b> variations persisted on a longer period (variations visible during the five minutes following the situation). Despite the fact that these results have to be confirmed by future studies, suggestions can already be made for the conception of the future ADAS centered on the driver's cognitive state...|$|R
