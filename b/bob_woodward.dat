25|$|According to Isikoff, as {{based on}} his sources, Armitage told <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> Plame's {{identity}} three weeks before talking to Novak, and Armitage himself was aggressively investigated by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, but was never charged because Fitzgerald {{found no evidence that}} Armitage knew of Plame's covert CIA status when he talked to Novak and Woodward.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, Clawson was {{the subject}} of many {{articles}} pointing to him as the possible identity of Deep Throat, <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> confidential source in the Executive Branch.

25|$|Executive editor Ben Bradlee, a Kennedy loyalist, put the newspaper's {{reputation}} and resources behind reporters <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> and Carl Bernstein, who, {{in a long}} series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington. The Post dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately {{played a major role in}} the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|His {{statements}} {{seem to be}} {{backed up}} by <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> Bush at War, where he quotes Bush as saying [...] "I know (Osama bin Laden) was a menace... but I didn't feel that sense of urgency." [...] Clarke has been backed up by testimony of former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, the National Security Council's Flynt Leverett, and Clarke's deputy, Roger Cressey.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1975, Ford reshuffled {{his cabinet}} in the Halloween Massacre. He named Rumsfeld {{to become the}} 13th U.S. Secretary of Defense; George H. W. Bush became Director of Central Intelligence.

5000|$|President Bill Clinton told People in December 1997 {{that the}} first {{audiobook}} he ever listened to was Taking Charge by Michael Beschloss. In <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> Plan of Attack, President George W. Bush is quoted as telling the author Elie Wiesel in February 2003, [...] "I read your views on Auschwitz in Michael Beschloss' book", referring to The Conquerors. Bush also refers to Beschloss' book [...] "Presidential Courage" [...] in his 2010 memoir Decision Points.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, Hersh {{was hired}} as a {{reporter}} for the Washington bureau of The New York Times, where he served from 1972 to 1975 and again in 1979. Hersh reported on the Watergate scandal, though most of the credit for that story went to Carl Bernstein and Hersh's longtime rival <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward.</b> Nonetheless, Hersh's Watergate investigations led him in 1983 to the publication of The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House, a damning portrait of Henry Kissinger that won the National Book Critics Circle Award.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, Post reporters <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into {{the upper reaches of}} the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed Judy Hoback Miller, the bookkeeper for Nixon, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} has won 47 Pulitzer Prizes. This includes six separate Pulitzers {{awarded in}} 2008, the second-highest number ever awarded {{to a single}} newspaper in one year, second only to The New York Times seven awards in 2002. Post journalists have also received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards. In the early 1970s, in the best-known episode in the newspaper's history, reporters <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> and Carl Bernstein led the American press' investigation into {{what became known as}} the Watergate scandal; reporting in the newspaper greatly contributed to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. In years since, its investigations have led to increased review of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.|$|E
50|$|Downie {{worked on}} the Post's Metropolitan staff as a {{reporter}} and editor for 15 years, and ran the staff as Assistant Managing Editor for Metropolitan news from 1974 until 1979. As Deputy Metropolitan Editor, Downie supervised much of The Post’s Watergate coverage. According to <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> 2005 book The Secret Man, Downie {{was one of the}} few people to know the true identity of Watergate scandal informant Deep Throat before it was revealed to be Mark Felt.|$|R
2500|$|On October 6, {{political}} scientist and analyst Stuart Rothenberg {{wrote that the}} scandal may have helped to [...] "set {{the stage for a}} blowout of cosmic proportions next month" [...] in the November elections. University of Virginia {{political scientist}} Larry Sabato, on October 5, wrote in the Crystal Ball that [...] "the congressional page scandal [...] joined leaked reports of poor progress in Iraq and <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> [...] to deliver Bush and Republicans their worst, most catastrophic week of 2006." ...|$|R
2500|$|Goldman {{wrote the}} famous line [...] "Follow the money" [...] for the {{screenplay}} of All the President's Men; while {{the line is}} often attributed to Deep Throat, it is not found in <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> notes nor in Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book or articles. However, the book does have the far less-quotable line from Woodward to Senator Sam Ervin, {{who was about to}} begin his own investigation: [...] "The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced..." ...|$|R
25|$|The Nixon White House tapes {{reveal that}} Bob Haldeman told Nixon that Felt {{was the source}} of leaks of {{confidential}} information contained in the FBI’s investigation to various members of the press, including <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> of The Washington Post. Gray claimed that he resisted five separate demands from the White House to fire Felt, stating that he believed Felt's assurances that he was not the source. Eventually, Gray demanded to know who was claiming Felt to be leaking. Attorney general Richard Kleindienst told Gray that Roswell Gilpatric, former deputy secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and now outside general counsel to Time, had told John Mitchell that Felt was leaking to Sandy Smith of Time magazine.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E
500|$|Washington Post journalists Carl Bernstein and <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> {{used the}} phrase [...] "Tinker to Evers to Chance" [...] in their account of the Post {{investigation}} of the Watergate scandal in their 1974 book, All the President's Men. The reference described the smooth operation of President Richard Nixon's White House staff in responding to [...] allegations of misconduct.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as Defense Secretary, Rumsfeld was noted for his candor and quick wit when giving weekly press {{conferences}} or speaking with the press. U.S. News & World Report called him [...] "a straight-talking Midwesterner" [...] who [...] "routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter". By the same token, his leadership was exposed to much criticism through provocative books covering the Iraq conflict, like <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> State of Denial, Thomas E. Ricks' Fiasco, and Seymour Hersh's Chain of Command.|$|R
5000|$|Donilon was 'criticized' by National Security Advisor James L. Jones, for {{his lack}} of {{overseas}} experience, telling him that as a result: [...] "You have no credibility with the military", according to <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> book Obama's Wars. Jones said that Donilon was not good in his dealings with his staff at the National Security Council, displaying [...] "too little feel {{for the people who}} work day and night ...". Donilon did visit Afghanistan in March 2010 during President Obama's six-hour late-night visit to the country.|$|R

500|$|As {{chief of}} staff, Emanuel {{would make his}} staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel {{is said to have}} looked at him and said: [...] "Whatever you're taking, I want some." [...] Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, {{political}} maneuvering, communications and economic policy. <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> wrote in Obama's Wars that Emanuel made a habit of telephoning CIA Director Leon Panetta and asking about the lethal drone strikes aimed at Al Qaeda, asking [...] "Who did we get today?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{untitled}} Itchy & Scratchy short, with [...] "guest director" [...] Oliver Stone, is {{a parody}} of the scene where Jack Ruby shoots Lee Harvey Oswald in Stone's film JFK: someone is heard to shout, [...] "Oh God! Get his gun!" [...] as the screenplay draws to a close. The song [...] "O Whacking Day" [...] uses the same tune as the Christmas carol [...] "O Tannenbaum", known in English as [...] "O Christmas Tree". Additionally, <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> is shown to be {{the author of the}} book The Truth About Whacking Day.|$|E
500|$|In a {{pre-recorded}} embargoed {{interview with}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward</b> of The Washington Post in July 2004, Ford {{stated that he}} disagreed [...] "very strongly" [...] with the Bush administration's choice of Iraq's alleged {{weapons of mass destruction}} as justification for its decision to invade Iraq, calling it a [...] "big mistake" [...] unrelated to the national security of the United States and indicating that he would not have gone to war had he been President. The details of the interview were not released until after Ford's death, as he requested.|$|E
2500|$|Zelikow's role in {{the second}} Iraq war is {{discussed}} at some length in <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> State of Denial, which presents him as an internal critic {{of the way the}} war was being conducted in 2005 and 2006, and as an originator of the alternative approach termed [...] "clear, hold, and build." [...] He is also named by sources such as Jack Goldsmith's The Terror Presidency as an internal critic of the treatment of terrorist captives, and there was wide attention given to an address he made on this subject after leaving office in April 2007.|$|R
50|$|Smith became {{involved}} with heroin use in the late 1970s. In <b>Bob</b> <b>Woodward's</b> book Wired, she appears as a drug dealer to Rolling Stones band members Ron Wood and Keith Richards during their touring and rehearsals as The New Barbarians. She moved to Los Angeles and, as her addiction increased, she became a full-time drug dealer and courier to Wood, Richards, {{and others in the}} entertainment world. Smith first met comedian John Belushi on the set of Saturday Night Live in 1976, when The Band were the musical guests.|$|R
5000|$|On October 6, {{political}} scientist and analyst Stuart Rothenberg {{wrote that the}} scandal may have helped to [...] "set {{the stage for a}} blowout of cosmic proportions next month" [...] in the November elections.
