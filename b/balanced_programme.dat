These changes were implemented in October 1967. From then on, the programme has been subject to regular revision; the Scout standards were replaced in 1984 by the Scout Award, Pathfinder Award and Explorer Award with a fully revised Chief Scout's Award. The Cub arrows were replaced in 1991 with the Cub Scout Award, Adventure Award and Adventure Crest Award. All these awards were replaced following the introduction of the Programme Review in February 2002. A new concept called the <b>Balanced</b> <b>Programme</b> replaced the previous scheme. Challenge Awards could be earned by participating in activities in various Programme Zones such as outdoors, fitness, community or international.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the cost {{effectiveness of a}} proprioceptive <b>balance</b> board training <b>programme</b> {{for the prevention of}} ankle sprains in volleyball. METHODS: A total of 116 volleyball teams participated in this study which was carried out during the 2001 - 2002 volleyball season. Teams were randomly allotted to an intervention group (66 teams, 628 players) or a control group (52 teams, 494 players). Intervention teams followed a prescribed <b>balance</b> board training <b>programme</b> as part of their warm up. Control teams followed their normal training routine. An ankle sprain was recorded if it occurred as a result of volleyball and caused the subject to stop volleyball activity. The injured player completed a cost diary {{for the duration of the}} ankle sprain. Analyses were performed according to the intention to treat principle. Mean direct, indirect, and total costs were calculated and were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The total costs per player (including the intervention material) were significantly higher in the intervention group (36. 99 (93. 87)) than in the control group (18. 94 (147. 09)). The cost of preventing one ankle sprain was approximately 444. 03. Sensitivity analysis showed that a proprioceptive <b>balance</b> board training <b>programme</b> aimed only at players with previous ankle sprains could be cost effective over a longer period of time. CONCLUSIONS: Positive effects of the <b>balance</b> board <b>programme</b> could only be achieved at certain costs.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} this electricity market mechanism, let us consider the Dutch electricity market. Market participants, referred to as Program Responsible Parties (PRPs), submit their price-quantity bids before 11 am for the delivery period covering the following day from midnight to midnight. The Program Time Unit (PTU) on the balancing market is of 15 minutes. Balancing of the 15-minute averaged power is required from all electrical producers and consumers connected to the grid, who for this purpose may be organised in sub-sets. Since these sub-sets {{are referred to as}} <b>Programmes,</b> <b>balancing</b> on the 15-minute scale is referred to as <b>Programme</b> <b>Balance.</b> <b>Programme</b> <b>Balance</b> now is maintained by using the production schedules issued the day before delivery and measurement reports (distributed the day after delivery). When the measured power is not equal to the scheduled power, the Programme Imbalance is the difference between the realised sum of production and consumption and the forecast sum of production and consumption. If only production from wind energy is taken into account, Programme Imbalance reduces to realised wind production minus forecast wind production. The programme imbalance is the wind production forecast error.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} six decades, work life and family life spheres of {{employees}} have undergone various changes. This paper presents an empirical study of major factors which have influenced employee work-life balance and popular work-life balance tools initiated at organisational level to help an employee balance different life segments such as work, family, personal finances, career and health. Current work-life balance approach, tools and programmes at organisational level primarily address those issues of work and personal life which got highlighted between the 1950 ’s and later years of the 20 th century. Current global recession in the 21 st century has created an uncertain economic scenario in which employers and employees are facing new challenges and earlier work-life balance research might not be sufficient enough address the new issues.

5000|$|Although {{the company}} of the Opéra-Comique was disbanded (followed 20 years later by the closure of the opéra comique classes at the Paris Conservatoire), from 1978 works were staged again at the theatre, both from its {{traditional}} repertoire (Le médecin malgré lui and Werther) as well as more adventurous repertoire: La chatte anglaise in 1984, Denisov's L'Écume des Jours, as well as productions with international stars, including Jessye Norman as Dido in 1984. While still battling for survival the theatre hosted one of the major baroque revivals: Atys, with Les Arts Florissants in 1987. The company regained its autonomy and returned, albeit with an inadequate budget, to the Salle Favart in 1990. Although its budget amounted to less than most provincial French opera houses, the first new director of the independent Opéra-Comique, Thierry Fouquet, attempted to run a <b>balanced</b> <b>programme</b> but handed over in 1994 to Pierre Médecin, who was responsible for the centenary season in 1998 with a new production of Pelléas et Mélisande. The loss of private sponsors led to a policy of musical comedy and operetta under Jérôme Savary from 2000. A decree of November 2004 put the theatre on a new basis, stressing the variety of productions it should mount: [...] "de l'opéra baroque à la création contemporaine et le patrimoine de l'Opéra-Comique".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine work-life balance in the Irish hotel sector from an {{employee}} perspective with implications for HRM. 246 questionnaires from employees were returned which was a 22 % response rate. Company benefits were not associated with numerical flexibility, but company benefits were associated with functional flexibility and work-life balance supports. This would suggest an integrated approach to human resource management (HRM), whereby some companies engage in a contemporary employee-focused approach, whereas other companies tend to be more traditional. The study advances the literature on the link between work-life <b>balance</b> <b>programmes</b> and other HRM practices such as company benefits and functional flexibility. We see that educational reasons and time for leisure were significant drivers of work-life balance arrangements.

In order to successfully enhance a child’s musical development, nursery teachers should ensure that music activities are equally represented within the programme (singing, playing musical instruments, listening to music, listening to music during creative activities, creating music itself, didactic music games). One of the principles that should be followed by nursery teachers and is set out in the Slovene Kindergarten Curriculum (1999) is the principle of a <b>balanced</b> <b>programme.</b> The main purpose of this thesis was to establish if the nursery teachers from kindergartens (“Vrtec Martin Krpan Cerknica”, “Vrtec Postojna”, nursery unit at “Tone Šraj’s Elementary School Nova vas” and from kindergarten “Polhek at Janez Hribar’s Elementary School Stari trg pri Ložu”) follow the guidelines of a <b>balanced</b> <b>programme</b> for musical activities. In addition to that, the thesis’s main focus was to examine to what extent the level of education, additional musical training and years of service influence the implementation of a balanced musical programme. The findings from this thesis suggest that regardless of the level of education, additional musical training or years of service, nursery teachers observed during the research do not follow the principle of a <b>balanced</b> <b>programme</b> of musical activities. Activities which combine creativity while listening to music and creating music itself are the least implemented. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study how the Norwegian Olympic Youth Team experienced the first winter Youth Olympic Games (YOG) by examining how they balanced the regular competitive programme, the Culture and Education Programme (CEP) in addition to several innovative events. Nine athletes were interviewed. Their experiences and perceptions of stressors differed according to the extent of their sports competitive programme during the 10 days of the Games. The results are presented in three narratives: the curler (with an extensive competitive programme), the biathlete (with a more <b>balanced</b> <b>programme),</b> and the luger (with one competition and sufficient time {{to take part in the}} CEP). As the curler took part both in a regular competitive event and an innovative one, YOG was all about competing and trying to get enough rest whenever possible. The biathlete with a <b>balanced</b> <b>programme</b> had time to experience all that YOG had to offer, while the luger would have benefitted from additional competition, regular or innovative. In order to cope, different types of social support from coaches, teammates and parents, together with cognitive strategies, were mentioned as important. The athletes' main goal for YOG is to take part in competition. However, if the International Olympic Committee wants all the athletes to embrace the cultural learning possibilities offered during the Games, future organizers should balance a cultural-competitive programme for all athletes...|$|E
