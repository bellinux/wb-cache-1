50|$|By {{the nature}} of their use, steam wagons were often {{required}} to use feedwater that was either dirty or contaminated with dissolved minerals. Untreated, this builds up <b>boiler</b> <b>scale</b> on the tubes and particularly deposits sludge in the lower parts of the boiler. Both of these disturb circulation and risk local overheating and damage, scale also reduces boiler efficiency and wastes fuel.|$|E
50|$|However the {{contamination}} of boiler feedwater with foreign bodies was a problem. Old sources report {{erosion of the}} boiler plates which was caused by fatty acids contained in the lubricant accompanying the exhaust steam. On the other hand the formation of scale in the boiler was delayed because a proportion of the <b>boiler</b> <b>scale</b> constituents had already been {{left behind in the}} tender.|$|E

50|$|Cornish boilers {{had several}} {{advantages}} over the preceding wagon boilers: they were composed of mostly curved surfaces, better {{to resist the}} pressure. Their flat ends were smaller than the flat sides of the wagon boiler and were stayed by the central furnace flue, and sometimes by additional long rod stays. A less obvious advantage was that of <b>boiler</b> <b>scale.</b> Wagon or haystack boilers were heated from beneath and any scale or impurities that formed a sediment settled upon this plate, insulating it from the water. This reduced heating efficiency and could in extremis lead to local overheating and failure of the boiler plates. In the flued boiler, any sediment fell past the furnace flue and settled out {{at the bottom of}} the boiler shell, where it had less effect.|$|E
50|$|The boiler of a steam {{locomotive}} {{had to be}} cleaned at regular intervals. Although boiler feedwater was thoroughly filtered, it contained a number of chemical compounds that did not fully evaporate. These compounds precipitated in due course as sludge and <b>boiler</b> <b>scale,</b> which could in time block the tubes or impede heat transfer within the boiler, leading to hazards in operating the engine. This meant that boilers had to be washed out regularly, either every ten to 14 days or after 2,000 kilometres for express locomotives and 1,500 kilometres on goods train locomotives. Cold washing a boiler took up to 14 hours. For hot washing, a special washout point was needed. For this purpose, locomotive sheds had a separate washout road with a washout channel. Every Bahnbetriebswerk had an additional washout road outside the shed. The used washing water drained into this channel and {{could be used for}} other purposes if need be.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{it became}} clear {{additional}} motive power was required in the North Island, but the process of dieselisation was yet to begin. Consequently, NZR chose to order 16 steam locomotives from North British {{to the design of}} the successful J class. These locomotives contained a number of differences to both the J class and Hillside JAs - although turned out with the cross-compound pump, roller bearings on the rods were limited to the connection between the connecting and driving rod, mechanical lubrication was employed. In January 1951 the order had been made for the 16 JA to be more coal burners, and North British regarded the order as essentially a repeat order, virtually identical to 1939 J, but in April 1951 the NZR CME requested the order to be changed to oil burning due to perceived long term coal shortage due to the waterfront strike and the associated strike by miners and unavailability of shipping for coal and the expected long term high imported coal price and the long time it would take to build up coal stocks to safe levels, and the class were built as oil burners, with no grate, ash pan or fire door (the only class of locomotives on the NZR to be built completely as oil burners)and ACFL blow down was incorporated late in their construction. A significant improvement was the incorporation of French T.I.A, blow down equipment which enabled rapid ejection of boiler sludge and reduced the <b>boiler</b> <b>scale,</b> enabling much faster turnaround and higher availability. The system of injection of the oil flow into the burners is different and far more effective than in NZR 1948-50 conversion of 12 Js to oil burning. Other detail differences was the use of Stone's headlights and electrical generator instead of the usual Pyle National equipment, the [...] "Butterfly" [...] number boards on the front headlight, and the lack of smokebox number plate (although a smokebox plate was specified by the NZR).|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the quality}} of the water under supply, it may need to be treated {{chemically}} to eliminate hardness which induces scale buildup on the inside of the locomotive <b>boiler.</b> The <b>scale</b> which builds up on heat transfer surfaces forms a layer of insulation between the metal and the boiler water.

This report will consider several possible working fluids and describe a scaling methodology to achieve thermal-hydraulic similarity between an actual potassium system and scaled representations of the Rankine cycle boiler or condenser. The most practical scaling approach examined is based on the selection of perfluorohexane (FC- 72) as the simulant. Using the scaling methodology, a series of possible solutions have been calculated for the FC- 72 boiler and condenser. The possible scaled systems will then be compared and preconceptual specifications and drawings given for the most promising design.

The {{aim of the research}} was to investigate the influence of the <b>boiler</b> <b>scale</b> on the thermal stresses and strains of the structure of hot water boilers. Results show that maximum thermal stresses appear in the zone of the pipe carrying wall of the first reversing chamber. This indicates that the most critical part of the boiler are weld spots of the smoke pipes and pipe carrying plate, which in the case of significant scale deposits can lead to cracks in the welds and water leakage from the boiler. The nonlinear effects were taken into account by defining the bilinear isotropic hardening model for all boiler elements. Temperature dependency was defined for all relevant material properties, i. e. isotropic coefficient of thermal expansion, Young’s modulus, and isotropic thermal conductivity. The verification of the FEA model was performed by comparing the measured deformations of the hot water boiler with the simulation results.

Scope of the campaign is the investigation of the combustion behaviour of Greek lignite, i. e. temperature fields, ignition, burnout, emissions, as well as slagging and fouling tendency, while firing with varying levels of recirculated flue gas. Dry coal co-firing conditions in a large <b>scale</b> <b>boiler</b> are simulated by adjusting the volume flow of recirculated flue gas. Two test series representing different boiler operation modes are performed. During the first series the maximum flue gas temperature increase, when co-firing dry coal, is determined, while in the second test series the needed load decrease. in order to keep constant furnace outlet temperature in dry coal co-firing conditions is recorded. A detailed measurement set is carried out including temperature profiles, emissions, fuel, fly ash sampling and slagging and fouling investigations through the installation of dedicated deposition probes. The anticipated increase of the furnace temperature profiles by decreasing the inserted recirculated flue gas is confirmed by the experimental results. No clear trend of dry coal co-combustion on the emissions' behaviour is noticed, while dry coal firing appears to have a moderate effect on the deposition behaviour of Greek lignite.
