5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion should not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters.

Pups are more vulnerable, and may <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
