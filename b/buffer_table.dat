The extension of network size happens due to the entry of nodes into the network.

In traditional AODV, the link failure is overcome by re-routing from the source node which is a time consuming process that increases the overhead of the nodes. Also in case of multiple link failures, there are chances for loss of data packet. Maintaining the performance of the network dynamically during link failure, specifically in case of long data transfer such as the stream of voice data, is a challenging problem. In order to overcome such performance related issues, we developed the Local Link Failure Recovery algorithm (LLFR) for Ad hoc networks that establishes recovery from link failures spontaneously at the point of link breakage.

Considering this value, the inland penetration limit has been calculated for each <b>buffer</b> (<b>Table</b> 5) resulting in a max value of 223.67 m, a minimum value of 203.95 m and an average value of 210.47 m. Estimation for boulder B 4 (Table 5) furnished a HT value a little bit lower with respect to that assessed for the boulder B 3, reaching an height of 3.174 m, inland penetration limits ranging between a minimum value of 81.23 m and a maximum value of 103.16 m with an average value of 91.09 m. For the boulder B 13 (Table 5), a HT of 3.566 m has been estimated; consequently, the minimum inland penetration limit is about 82.72 m, the maximum is about 104.78 m, the average value 92.19 m. Average inland penetration limit estimated for B 4 and B 13 appear to be in good agreement, suggesting that the two boulders could have been transported during the same event. This is confirmed by radiocarbon age determination performed by Scicchitano et al.

It enables us to identify when, how, and where a phenomenon of interest takes place such as gene expression and interaction of molecules. To understand the sequential events happening in the brain, it is of special importance to assess more than one parameter simultaneously. In this protocol, we describe detailed methods of simultaneous and long-term measurement of gene expression and neuronal activity from a cultured brain slice. We introduce bioluminescence imaging using CCD camera for measurement of gene expression and multi-electrode array dish for recording of neuronal activity, which enables us to analyze not only functions in a single cell but also cellular communications. The present bimodal recording system reveals spatiotemporal relationship between gene expression and neuronal activity in a single neuron, which promotes us to understand complex phenomena in the brain. ### Introduction Long-term monitoring of cellular activities of neurons is crucial to understand brain functions in mammals. However, current in vivo monitoring systems such as PET or fMRI are still far from focusing cellular functions, while in vitro monitoring using cultured brain slices presents sometime outcomes difficult to interpret in reference to a specific brain function. With respect to the latter issue, circadian rhythms (ca. 24 h rhythms), is unique. Circadian rhythms are detected not only in a single organism but also in cells and tissues, which enables us to analyze the brain in vitro without missing a functional marker. In mammals, the central clock which generates circadian rhythm and entrains to environmental time cues is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (1, 2). The unilateral SCN contains about 10, 000 neurons (3) and individual SCN neurons show circadian rhythms in electrical activity, cytosolic Ca 2 +, and gene expressions (4 - 9). However, specific cell networks are required for the expression of circadian rhythm in a tissue level, namely for functioning as the SCN circadian pacemaker. A current hypothesis of circadian rhythm generation in a single cell is a molecular feedback loop composed of several clock genes, such as *Period (Per), Cryptochrom (Cry), Clock* and *Bmal 1 *, and their protein products. The molecular oscillation transmits circadian signals to other cellular functions such as membrane potential and finally to behavioral activity rhythms. In turn, signals from other SCN cells modify the molecular oscillation through intracellular signal transduction (10). To understand the structure and functions of circadian pacemaker in the SCN, a sequential events happing in a single oscillating cell and cellular communication in the SCN should be monitored. Recently, we established simultaneous and long-term measurement of clock gene expression, (Per 1) or clock gene product (PER 2) and electrical activity at a single cell level in a cultured mouse SCN slice (11). We monitored clock gene expression and clock gene product by means of bioluminescence imaging using a luciferase reporter and electrical activity using a Multi-electrode array dish, respectively (11 - 14). The protocol provides useful information to scientists who are interesting in cell and tissue level events not only related to the brain but also other bodily functions. ### Materials 1. Collagen (Cellmatrix, Type I-C, Nitta Gelatin) - Buffer for collagen solution (refer to Table 1) - 10 x DMEM for MED coating with no supplemental materials sterilized with a 0. 22 µm pore size filter (store in 0. 2 ml/ 1. 5 ml tube at - 30 ºC until it is used). - Culturing medium in CO 2 incubator: DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen cat. No. 12100 - 046) + 32. 1 mM NaHCO 3, 20 mg/L kanamycin (Gibco) sterilized with a 0. 22 µm pore size filter. 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) for first 3 days, 5 % culture media supplements after 3 culture day. - Recording medium in air: DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen cat. No. 12100 - 046) + 10 mM HEPES, 2. 7 mM NaHCO 3, 20 mg/L kanamycin (Gibco) sterilized with a 0. 22 µm pore size filter. 5 % culture media supplements. - FBS (Gibco) - Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Sigma, cat. No. H 8264) - Culture media supplements (refer to Table 2) - D-Luciferin potassium salt (Wako, 126 - 05116) ### Equipment 1. MED probe (MED-P 210 A, Alpha med scientific) - MED 64 system (Alpha med scientific) - Tissue chopper (McIlwain) - EM-CCD camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu photonics) - CO 2 incubator - 100 mm Petri dish - O 2 permeable film (High-sensitivity membrane kit, YSI) - Dissecting microscope - Scalpel blades (No. 10 curved) - Transfer pipette (Falcon) - Laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet ### Procedure - **Preparation of the MED probes** 1. The MED probe is placed in a sterilized disposable Petri dish (100 mm diameter). - Rinse with sterilized distilled water (SDW) three times, and then with 70 % EtOH one time about 15 - 30 min. - Rinse the MED probe again with SDW 3 times, and dry up and expose to UV light for 15 - 30 min. - On the day before culture (or the same day of culture), treat the surface of the MED probe with brief (within one second) and repeated exposures to blue flame to increase its hydrophilicity. Exposure was repeated 8 - 12 times and each exposure followed by cooling for ~ 10 sec. - Put the MED probe in to 4 ºC for about 15 min. - Put collagen Type 1 -C 0. 8 ml (Nitta gelatin; Cellmatrix), x 10 DMEM 0. 1 ml, and <b>buffer</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) 0. 1 ml into the 1. 5 ml tube on ice, and gently mix. - The MED probe is place on a cold pack, and apply the mixed collagen solution into the probe. After evenly wet the whole surface of MED probe, rest of the collagen solution must be removed as much as possible. - Apply SDW in the Petri dish outside of the MED probe to keep moisture. Incubate the MED probe in 37 ºC for 1 - 2 hours to firm the collagen gel. Be sure that the collagen gel is formed by microscopic observation, since collagen some lot of Collagen Type I-C does not form collagen gel. - Rinse with SDW one time, and the MED probe is pre-incubated with culturing medium contained 5 % FBS until it is used. - **SCN slice preparation for long term culturing on the MED probes** - Hypothalamic slices (200 µm thick) containing the SCN are obtained from the hypothalamic block (≈ 2 × 1 x 5 mm) of mice of 2 - 5 days of age using a tissue chopper. - After trimming, hypothalamic slice containing the SCN is placed on the collagen-coated MED probe using a transfer pipette. Set the slice so that the SCN covers the electrodes. - Removed medium on the MED probe, and then the SCN slice is incubated in a CO 2 incubator with 100 % humidity for 1 - 2 h until the slice attaches to the collagen gel. - After 1 - 2 h incubation, add 250 μl culturing medium contained 5 % FBS into the MED probe, and the SCN is incubated in a CO 2 incubator. Half volume of medium (add 250 μl and remove 250 μl) is exchanged every day for first 10 culture days, thereafter medium exchange is performed every other day. For first three days, medium should contain 5 % FBS, but thereafter 5 % of supplement instead of serum. Within a few days, neurites start to extend from the periphery of the explants as shown in Figure 1 b. - **Measurement of clock gene and neuronal activity rhythms from the SCN on the MED probe** - To measure clock gene expression from the SCN neuron, transgenic mice carrying a luciferase reporter are used. Transfection of luciferase reporter may also be used. We used transgenic mice carrying a luciferase reporter listed below. - ・ Per 1 -luc (Per 1 promoter driven luciferase reporter) (14) - ・ PER 2 ::LUC (Luciferase reporter fused to Per 2 protein) (15) - One to three weeks after preparation, recording is started by setting the MED probe with cultured SCN slice in an MED connector. The connector is then placed in the stage-top incubator of a microscope. To keep humidity of and oxygen level for cultured SCN slice stable, the MED probe is sealed with O 2 permeable film by attaching the film {{to the edge of the}} probe wall with silicone grease. 16, Stage-top incubator (280 mm width x 200 mm depth x 70 mm height) is made of an acrylic glass of 8 mm thick. Temperature in the incubator is controlled by circulated warmed air (Figure 1 a). - Bioluminescence is captured by an EM-CCD camera, and microscope should be covered dark box to prevent unnecessary light. Since intensity of bioluminescence is very weak, expose time could vary 20 - 60 min depending on the reporter signals. Bioluminescence imaging of the SCN on the MED probe is shown in Figure 1 b. CCD camera is set at the top or the bottom port of the microscope. For the upright microscope, a CCD camera is set at the top port, and the stage-top incubator needs a whole for the objective lens. The hole should be sealed with insulation foam, and the lens may be warmed with e. g. heating band. For the inverted microscope, a CCD camera is set to the bottom port of the microscope. The stage-top incubator does not need a hole on the top, but the objective lens beneath the MED probe needs to be warmed. Electrodes interrupt the bioluminescence signals when images are taken from the bottom port of the microscope. - Spontaneous firing frequency is counted if an amplitude of an action potential is exceeded a threshold level. In the SCN slice, we set the threshold level to signal to noise ratio ≈ 2. 0. ### Timing - Step 1 - 4 : Pre-treatment for coating: 60 - 90 min - Step 5 - 9 : Collagen coating: 2 - 2. 5 h - Step 10 - 13 : Preparation of SCN slice culture: 15 min per one slice - Step 14 - 18 : Recording: It is possible to record about 2 - 3 weeks without medium exchange. ### Troublshooting For long-term and simultaneous measurements of neuronal activity and bioluminescence from the SCN, the MED probe should be prepared with special care. - 4, Exposure of MED probe to blue frame should be brief. If the surface of the probe is still hydrophobic, repeat brief exposure with cooling after each exposure. Please refer to Movie 1. - 6, Collagen coating of the MED probe should be done on cold pack or ice block to coat it uniformly. Avoid forming bubbles in collagen solution. - 11, Mechanical stress to the brain slice, such as flushing with medium or touching with forceps, should be minimized while setting the slice on the electrodes of the MED probe. - 13, Of critical importance, adjust the medium volume so that the slices is kept wet but not submerged in medium. ### Anticipated Results The protocols and results present the relationship between clock gene expression and its output signal, neuronal activity rhythms, in the SCN slice. This methods enable us to measure gene expression and neuronal activity of neuron of interest simultaneous at real-time for several weeks without medium exchange. Responses of the two parameters can also be monitored simultaneously to various kind stimuli, e. g. by passing electric currents of desired frequency and amplitude to the selected electrode and by applying drugs. Optical tools can also be applied, such as caged compounds and optogenetics. ### References 1. Moore, R. Y. & Eichler, V. B.

To improve file access latency under NLTSS the implementation was changed significantly to put the most latency sensitive processes (in particular the file server) [...] "in the kernel".

Communication to users was unchanged (still through <b>buffer</b> <b>tables,</b> LINCS tokens, etc.), but file operations avoided some significant context changes that were the primary cause of the higher latencies over what the older LTSS and the competing Cray Time Sharing System provided.

DPR’s Risk Management Directive {{determined that the}} primary effect observed with acute exposure to chloropicrin is sensory irritation, and the appropriate regulatory target level to restrict acute exposure to chloropicrin is 73 ppb or 0. 073 ppm averaged over an eight-hour period. As with other fumigants, {{a key element in}} mitigating exposure is establishing a buffer zone between a fumigated area and residents and bystanders. Label revisions for chloropicrin products developed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) went into effect in December 2012 (Phase 2 labels). One of the main mitigation measures employed on the new labels is buffer zones. On the Phase 2 labels, U. S. EPA presents for each particular use scenario a main <b>buffer</b> zone <b>table</b> containing <b>buffer</b> zones of maximum length, then gives buffer zone credits of up to 80 % to reduce the size of...|$|R

Trees ≥ 1 cm DBH to < 10 cm DBH were the only diameter class with significant differences in mortality rates associated with different shrub guilds; mortality was significantly higher in montane chaparral and generalist patches relative to riparian patches (both P < 0.001; Table 5).|$|R
40|$|Data {{prefetching}} is a {{well known}} technique for improving cache performance. While several studies have examined prefetch strategies for scientific and commercial applications, no published work has studied the special memory requirements of multimedia applications. This paper presents data for three types of hardware prefetching schemes: stream <b>buffers,</b> stride prediction <b>tables,</b> and a hybrid combination of the two, the stream cache. Use of the stride prediction table is shown to eliminate up to 90 % of the misses {{that would otherwise be}} incurred in a moderate or large sized cache with no prefetching hardware. The stream cache, proposed {{for the first time in}} this paper, has the potential to cut execution times by half with the addition of a relatively small amount of additional hardware. 1 Introduction As multimedia datatypes and applications become ubiquitous, new processors and architectures will have to support these applications as a matter of course.

This paper investigates and evaluates the range of possible {{data structure}}s for text sequences. The ADT interface to the text sequence component of a text editor is examined. Six common sequence data structures (array, gap, list, line pointers, fixed size <b>buffers</b> and piece <b>tables)</b> are examined and then a general model of sequence data structures that encompasses all six structures is presented. The piece table method is explained in detail and its advantages are presented. The design space of sequence data structures is examined and several variations on the ones listed above are presented.

Oracle Streams AQ enables user applications to enqueue messages into a queue, ande subsequently dequeued by subscribers or recipients. A queue can contain {{a message of}} a particular type or of a generic type ???SYS. AnyData???. Oracle AQ can track, preserve, document, query, filter, and transform queued messages. In particular, messages are processed using the core Oracle SQL processing engine, meaning that messages are managed as persistent (transactional) or <b>buffered</b> (non-transactional) <b>table</b> rows. Enqueued messages can be handled using either single or multiple queues, and thus, there will be performance {{differences between the two}} setups. Our simulations were limited to persistent messaging. In the single queue setup all messages are handled by one queue. In the multiple queues setup, messages are distributed among queues each of which handle a different message type. The simulation results from the single queue setup and the results from the implementation of single queue setup in Oracle were compared. The comparison showed that the simulation was accurate. The data from the single queue simulation was studied and used as a benchmark to build a three queue setup simulation. The results of this simulation were then compared with the first simulation for performance enhancements. The project discusses the methods in which the simulation models (written in GPSS) were created, how the implementation in Oracle was achieved and how the results were gathered and compared. The project also compared GPSS model results and Oracle AQ actual behavior against classical queuing theory steady state statistics such as average queue length, server utilization, and so forth.

30|$|Studies in the {{literature}} except Ding and Sun (2004) and Gunay and Kula (2017) consider resequencing function of the buffer rather than its storage function. These studies can also be classified into two fold: (i) buffer capacity determination problem, and (ii) FA entrance sequence determination problem. Inman (2003) determines buffer capacity of an ASRS type buffer to restore the altered sequence for a specified service level defined by car manufacturers. Meissner (2010) also studies buffer capacity determination problem for restoring the altered sequence for mix-bank type buffer and also compares the resequencing performances of both ASRS and mix-bank buffer by measuring the similarity between FA entrance sequence and scheduled sequence. Gusikhin et al. (2008) find optimal FA entrance sequence that minimizes the violation from FA station capacities for ASRS type buffer. Boysen et al. (2010, 2011) consider same problem for other common <b>buffer</b> type, pull-off <b>table.</b> They also perform a numerical study to determine buffer capacity. Extending these researches on pull-off table, Boysen and Zenker (2013) propose exact and metaheuristic methods to decide FA entrance sequence under minimization of FA constraint violation for mix-bank buffer. Mehrjoo and Bashiri (2013) propose a decision support system to predict the production capability of an automobile company for a given production plan based on the historical shop floor data. They consider the stochastic nature of the production environment in terms of defect occurrences, machine breakdowns, etc. and suggest a logistic regression-based prediction tool to do a pre-check on production planning before the detailed plan on FA sequence {{and the number of}} spare vehicles to be located in the pre-assembly buffer.|$|R

40|$|Access to a {{safe and}} {{affordable}} water supply of drinking is universally recognized as a basic human need for preset generation and precondition for the development and care of the next. But, many Tigray rural communities are suffering from lack of safe drinking water supply facilities specifically in Ahferom woreda. So, in order to realize the severity of shortage of safe water in the rural community and to find timely solutions {{it is important to}} take an assessment on the existing accessibility situation of the woreda. To do that, detail accessibility assessment has been taken in the issues of: Type of water technologies introduced to the woreda, growth trend of water schemes, spatial coverage of water schemes and ratio to the beneficiaries, accessibility coverage of safe water in relation to regional standard and the determinant factors for the non-functionality of water schemes were detail analyzed. To do that spatial and non-spatial data were collected from primary and secondary and analyzed using <b>buffer,</b> descriptive statistical <b>tables</b> and graphs and by visualizing the results in the map. As a result, the study identified 520 water schemes spatially distributed in the study area. Of the total, 396 (76. 2 %) and 124 (23. 8 %) were functional and non-functional water schemes respectively. The basic reasons for non-functionality of water schemes were: lack of ownership in the beneficiaries, weakness in maintenance and operation system, lack of spare part accesses and quality, poor financial capacity of the community to repair the breakdown water schemes and for different activities, Lack of training to the water committee and poor management system were accepted by the respondents as key problems to the non-functionality of water schemes in their district. And also the study found that, three types of potable water technologies: Hand dug well, Shallow well and protected springs were introduced to the study area. Hand dug well covered majority of the woreda, 62 percent followed by shallow well 26 percent and protected spring 11. 9 percent. In Ahferom woreda the spatial coverage of water schemes and the ratio to beneficiaries in 2013 was, one water scheme to 3. 25 square kilometers area and 2. 36 water schemes to 1000 beneficiaries. The actual average potable water per capita (L/d) of the beneficiaries in the rural area was 7. 6 l/d. Therefore, in contrast to the regional standard (15 L/d) the consumption level of the Woreda is below the regional standard. Also the distributions of water schemes have not equity to the existing population and to the given area. The accessibility coverage as a standard within 1. 5 km radius of travel distance and 15 l/day also analyzed and the result was found below the regional coverage which is only 39 %(65, 463) population were within 1. 5 km radius and 15 L/day access. The growth rate of water schemes was also analyzed and the result showed an increment from time to time but not in similar ranges throughout the four of the five years plan of the woreda. But, a steady increment has been observed in the first five year (1996 - 2000) with 91. 4 percent and second five years (2001 - 2005) with 13. 1 percent. In general the average growth rate of water schemes throughout the twenty years was 23. 7 percen...|$|R
