5000|$|Burnt ends are flavorful {{pieces of}} meat {{cut from the}} [...] "point" [...] half of a smoked brisket. When brisket muscles are separated, the lean [...] "first cut" [...] or [...] "flat cut" [...] is the deep pectoral, while the fattier [...] "point", {{also known as the}} [...] "second cut", [...] "fat end", or [...] "triangular cut", is the {{superficial}} pectoral. A traditional part of Kansas City barbecue, burnt ends are considered a delicacy in barbecue cooking. Either the entire brisket is cooked whole, then the <b>point</b> <b>end</b> removed and cooked further, or the point and flat are separated prior to cooking. Due to the higher fat content of the <b>brisket</b> <b>point,</b> it takes longer to fully cook to tender and render out fat and collagen. This longer cooking gave rise to the name [...] "burnt ends". Sometimes when the flat is done, the point is returned to the smoker for further cooking. Some cooks re-season the point at this time.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{striated}} muscle the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of polar actin filaments are {{directed toward the}} center of the sarcomer. Formed filaments keep a constant length of about 1 μm. As polymerization and depolymerization at free <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> are not sufficiently slow to account for the constant length of the filaments, we searched for proteins which occur in sarcomers and can stabilize the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments. We observed that tropornyosintroponin complex reduces the rate of association and dissociation of actin molecules at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> more than 30 -fold. On the average, every 600 s one association or dissociation reaction has been found to occur at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> near the critical actin monomer concentration...|$|R

40|$|Many {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown to cap the fast growing (barbed) ends of actin filaments, but none {{have been shown}} to block elongation and depolymerization at the slow growing (<b>pointed)</b> filament <b>ends.</b> Tropomodulin is a tropomyosin-binding protein originally isolated from red blood cells that has been localized by immunofluorescence staining to a site at or near the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of skeletal muscle thin filaments (Fowler, V. M., M. A., Sussman, P. G. Miller, B. E. Flucher, and M. P. Daniels. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 120 : 411 - 420). Our experiments demonstrate that tropomodulin in conjunction with tropomyosin is a <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> capping protein: it completely blocks both elongation and depolymerization at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of tropomyosin-containing actin filaments in concentrations stoichiometric to the concentration of filament ends (Kd < or = 1 nM). In the absence of tropomyosin, tropomodulin acts as a "leaky" cap, partially inhibiting elongation and depolymerization at the <b>pointed</b> filament <b>ends</b> (Kd for inhibition of elongation = 0. 1 - 0. 4 microM). Thus, tropomodulin can bind directly to actin at the <b>pointed</b> filament <b>end.</b> Tropomodulin also doubles the critical concentration at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of pure actin filaments without affecting either the rate of extent of polymerization at the barbed filament ends, indicating that tropomodulin does not sequester actin monomers. Our experiments provide direct biochemical evidence that tropomodulin binds to both the terminal tropomyosin and actin molecules at the <b>pointed</b> filament <b>end,</b> and is the long sought-after <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> capping protein. We propose that tropomodulin plays a role in maintaining the narrow length distributions of the stable, tropomyosin-containing actin filaments in striated muscle and in red blood cells...|$|R
40|$|The Arp 2 / 3 {{complex is}} a stable {{assembly}} of seven protein subunits including two actin-related proteins (Arp 2 and Arp 3) and five novel proteins. Previous work showed that this complex binds {{to the sides}} of actin filaments and is concentrated at the leading edges of motile cells. Here, we show that Arp 2 / 3 complex purified from Acanthamoeba caps the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments with high affinity. Arp 2 / 3 complex inhibits both monomer addition and dissociation at the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments with apparent nanomolar affinity and increases the critical concentration for polymerization at the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> from 0. 6 to 1. 0 μM. The high affinity of Arp 2 / 3 complex for <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> and its abundance in amoebae suggest that in vivo all actin filament <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> are capped by Arp 2 / 3 complex. Arp 2 / 3 complex also nucleates formation of actin filaments that elongate only from their barbed ends. From kinetic analysis, the nucleation mechanism appears to involve stabilization of polymerization intermediates (probably actin dimers). In electron micrographs of quick-frozen, deep-etched samples, we see Arp 2 / 3 bound to sides and <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments and examples of Arp 2 / 3 complex attaching <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of filaments to sides of other filaments. In these cases, the angle of attachment is a remarkably constant 70 ± 7 °. From these in vitro biochemical properties, we propose a model for how Arp 2 / 3 complex controls the assembly of a branching network of actin filaments at the leading edge of motile cells...|$|R

40|$|Phostensin, {{a protein}} {{phosphatase}} 1 F-actin cytoskeleton-targeting subunit encoded by KIAA 1949, consists of 165 amino acids and caps the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments. Sequence alignment analyses suggest that the C-terminal region of phostensin, spanning residues 129 to 155, contains a consensus actin-binding motif. Here, we have verified {{the existence of an}} actin-binding motif in the C-terminal domain of phostensin using colocalization, F-actin co-sedimentation and single filament binding assays. Our data indicate that the N-terminal region of phostensin (1 &# 8211; 129) cannot bind to actin filaments and cannot retard the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> elongation of gelsolin-actin seeds. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of phostensin (125 &# 8211; 165) multiply bind to the sides of actin filaments and lacks the ability to block the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> elongation, suggesting that the actin-binding motif is located in the C-terminal region of the phostensin. Further analyses indicate that phostensin binding to the <b>pointed</b> <b>end</b> of actin filament requires N-terminal residues 35 to 51. These results suggest that phostensin might fold into a rigid structure, allowing the N-terminus to sterically hinder the binding of C-terminus to the sides of actin filament, thus rendering phostensin binding to the <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of actin filaments...|$|R

40|$|Tropomodulin (Tmod) is an actin pointed-end capping {{protein that}} regulates actin {{dynamics}} at thin filament <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> in striated muscle. Although pointed-end capping by Tmod controls thin filament lengths in assembled myofibrils, {{its role in}} length specification during de novo myofibril assembly is not established. We used the Drosophila Tmod homologue, sanpodo (spdo), to investigate Tmod's function during muscle development in the indirect flight muscle. SPDO {{was associated with the}} <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> of elongating thin filaments throughout myofibril assembly. Transient overexpression of SPDO during myofibril assembly irreversibly arrested elongation of preexisting thin filaments. However, the lengths of thin filaments assembled after SPDO levels had declined were normal. Flies with a preponderance of abnormally short thin filaments were unable to fly. We conclude that: (a) thin filaments elongate from their <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> during myofibril assembly; (b) <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> are dynamically capped at endogenous levels of SPDO so as to allow elongation; (c) a transient increase in SPDO levels during myofibril assembly converts SPDO from a dynamic to a permanent cap; and (d) developmental regulation of pointed-end capping during myofibril assembly is crucial for specification of final thin filament lengths, myofibril structure, and muscle function...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTropomyosins are coiled-coil {{proteins}} that bind actin filaments and regulate multiple cytoskeletal functions, including actin network dynamics near {{the leading edge}} of motile cells. Previous work demonstrated that tropomyosins inhibit actin nucleation by the Arp 2 / 3 complex and prevent filament disassembly by cofilin. We find that the Arp 2 / 3 complex and cofilin, in turn, regulate the binding of tropomyosin to actin filaments. Using fluorescence microscopy, we show that tropomyosin (non-muscle Drosophila Tm 1 A) polymerizes along actin filaments, starting from “nuclei” that appear preferentially on ADP-bound regions of the filament, near the <b>pointed</b> <b>end.</b> Tropomyosin fails to bind dendritic actin networks created in vitro by the Arp 2 / 3 complex, in part because the Arp 2 / 3 complex blocks <b>pointed</b> <b>ends.</b> Cofilin promotes phosphate dissociation and severs filaments, generating new <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> and rendering Arp 2 / 3 -generated networks competent to bind tropomyosin. Tropomyosin’s attraction to <b>pointed</b> <b>ends</b> reflects a strong preference for conformations localized to that region of the filament and reveals a basic molecular mechanism by which lamellipodial actin networks are insulated from the effects of tropomyosin...|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of ATP hydrolysis, {{filaments}} elongate approximately 10 times faster at their barbed <b>ends</b> than their <b>pointed</b> <b>ends.</b> At steady-state, the polymerization rate at the barbed end matches the depolymerization rate at the <b>pointed</b> <b>end,</b> and microfilaments {{are said to be}} treadmilling. Treadmilling results in elongation in the barbed end and shortening in the pointed-end, so that the filament in total moves. Since both processes are energetically favorable, this means force is generated, the energy ultimately coming from ATP.|$|R
