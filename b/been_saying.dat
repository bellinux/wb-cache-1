5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b> The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
25|$|He placed {{second in}} MoveOn.org's primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, {{particularly}} Internet-based ones. This led many activists {{to believe that}} his showing in the primaries might be better than what Gallup polls had <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b> However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in the caucuses around the country.|$|E
25|$|Locomotive : This {{pattern is}} {{produced}} {{when all the}} planets are contained within 240 degrees or nine signs of the zodiac, so that a whole 120 degrees is completely unoccupied. The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence {{the life of the}} person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of what they have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> all along.|$|E

500|$|The Nazi in {{this episode}} {{appears to be}} Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel, Heinrich Himmler. Aside from looking like the character, Himmler was also both a Nordicist and a Nazi Occultist. At {{one point in the}} episode, a scared elderly woman points at him screaming, [...] "It's him... it's him...!" [...] This has a double meaning, as she could have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "It's him!" [...] or she could have been trying to say [...] "It's Himmler!" ...|$|E
500|$|On July 21, 2016, Gingrich {{argued that}} members of NATO [...] "ought to worry" [...] about a U.S. {{commitment}} to their defense. He expanded, saying, [...] "They ought to worry about commitment under any circumstances. Every president has <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that the NATO countries do not pay their fair share". He also stated that, {{in the context of}} whether the United States would provide aid to Estonia (a NATO member) {{in the event of a}} Russian invasion, he [...] "would think about it a great deal".|$|E
500|$|The {{strain in}} race {{relations}} {{led to the}} Singaporean 1964 Race Riots, which PAP Malay politician Othman Wok later insinuated were planned beforehand by the ultras. In the year following the riots, tension continued growing. Syed Jaafar Albar declared that [...] "Wherever I am, I am a Malay", drawing harsh return fire from Lee, who stated in Parliament: [...] "If I had been going round and saying what [...] has <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> — wherever I am, I am a Chinese — where would we be?

500|$|Another {{threat to}} Phelps' goal was Serbia's Milorad Čavić. In Athens 2004, Čavić was leading in a {{semifinal}} of the 100 metre butterfly, but right after his final turn, his suit {{opened at the}} neck and sucked in water, causing Čavić to finish last {{with a time of}} 53.12 seconds. At the 2008 European Championships, Čavić won the men's 50 metre butterfly and was the heavy favorite to win at twice that distance, but was suspended for wearing a [...] "Kosovo is Serbia" [...] T-shirt on the medal podium. American swimmer Gary Hall, Jr. told The New York Times that although [...] "Mike (Phelps) has <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> he’s going to win the 100 fly at the Olympics for the last year", he thought that Čavić would be the winner.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – I {{want to see what}} is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters {{at the same time as}} them". However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that {{the easiest to}} understand is Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E
500|$|... "Gossip" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Several commentators particularly {{praised the}} comedic performance of Ed Helms, {{as well as}} the line by Kevin, [...] "Who's <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that there's another person inside of me working me with controls?" [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "not an instant classic, but a solid start to the season". Sepinwall said it started slowly, but gradually built to a [...] "very funny, and kinda sweet climax in the conference room". New York magazine writer Will Leitch said [...] "Gossip" [...] appeared to be a return to a more normal Office atmosphere, compared to the surprises and twists of the fifth season. Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said he was concerned the season premiere would not be good because Steve Carell, John Krasinski and Ed Helms would be too distracted with their growing film careers. But, he said, [...] "Thankfully, if Thursday's premiere was any indication, it appears that the Dunder Mifflin crew still has a lot to offer." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said, [...] "'Gossip' had some terrific moments, but I don't know that I'd put it on my all-time great episodes list." [...] She specifically praised the performances of Brian Baumgartner and Jenna Fischer.|$|E
500|$|Tim Sendra of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars review, and said the album had the [...] "cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good", [...] "the duo stick to the template , considering {{the uniqueness of the}} sound they've created and also the fact that it's a debut record made by teenagers, and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that." [...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months, the kids have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the last time we hear from the New Boyz." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times, Wolf denied ever advising Gore on his wardrobe.

2500|$|In June 2017, Coogan {{endorsed}} Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election.
