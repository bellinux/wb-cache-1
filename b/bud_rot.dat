40|$|ABSTRACT This work {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} ionizing radiation on the physico-chemical and sensory characteristics of the potato cultivar Ágata (Solanum tuberosum L.), including budding and deterioration, with the end goal of increasing shelf life. For this, four groups of samples were harvested at the maturation stage. Three of them were separately exposed to a Co- 60 source, receiving respective doses of 0. 10, 0. 15 and 2. 00 kGy, while the non-irradiated group was kept as a control. All samples were stored for 35 days at 24 °C (± 2) and at 39 % relative humidity. The following aspects were evaluated: <b>budding,</b> <b>rot,</b> loss of weight, texture, flesh color, moisture, external and internal appearance, aroma, soluble solids, titratable acidity, vitamin C, protein, starch and glucose.

50|$|Although {{the common}} name of Phytophthora palmivora is <b>bud</b> <b>rot</b> of palms, it affects many {{tropical}} plants {{and has a}} moderately broad host range. P. palmivora is well studied in coconuts and papaya trees, however there are multiple hosts that are less commonly studied. One common symptom of P. palmivora is fruit rots which are found in papaya, citrus, coconuts, durian, and cacao. Root rots are another symptom of P. palmivora and {{can be seen in}} Red Maples, citrus, papaya, mango, durian, and black pepper. Another symptom is the presence of cankers which are found in Red Maple, papaya, rubber, mangoes, and cacao. Bud rots can also be seen in papaya and coconuts infected with P. Palmivora. Bud rots are also found in Palmyra Palms and coconut palms. Collar rots are found on citrus, mango, and black pepper infected with P. Palmivora. The signs of P. palmivora are microscopic and can be differentiated from other oomycetes by the presence of oval shaped papillate sporangia with short pedicles and spherical oogonia with narrow stalks (Widmer, 2014).|$|E

40|$|The {{predominant}} disease affecting {{oil palms}} in Colombia is <b>bud</b> <b>rot,</b> a decay {{of the growing}} leaf tissues that may eventually reach the meristem. Previous studies have suggested many biotic and abiotic causes, but Koch’s Postulates have recently confirmed Phytophthora palmivora as the primary pathogen of <b>bud</b> <b>rot.</b> In this paper, we describe the infection process in immature leaflets inoculated with zoospores of P. palmivora using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Initially, zoospores were attracted primarily to leaf trichomes, where some developed appressorium-like structures and subsequently penetrated the tissue. Germinated zoospores were also observed penetrating the stomata or intercellular spaces. After penetration hyphae colonized the intercellular leaf spaces, followed by intracellular invasion, penetrating to the vascular bundles and then spreading throughout the host tissue. Between 12 and 24 h after inoculation, hyphae emerged {{from the surface of}} the leaflet through the stomata, trichomes and intercellular spaces. Within 36 and 48 h, sporangia, chlamydospores, and newly released zoospores were observed, starting a new cycle of secondary infections. This sequence was consistently observed in repeated experiments. We suggest that in the field collection of moisture at the base of emerging leaflets stimulates the release of zoospores and infection. Colonization is restricted once the leaflet emerges, leaving dormant chlamydospores and hyphae in small necrotic lesions. Successive rain events stimulate the formation of new generations of sporangia, zoospores and infections, which, if frequent enough, may completely colonize the bud area. Subsequent colonization of infected tissues by opportunistic bacteria and fungi increases the severity of <b>bud</b> <b>rot</b> symptoms.

40|$|Oil palm {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} oil crops in the world. Because of its high productivity and perennial nature, it has been expanding quickly. Commercial plantations consist mostly of the African palm E. guineensis Jacq. However, producers in Latin America are increasingly planting the O × G interspecific hybrid, a cross between African palm (E. guineensis) and the American palm (E. oleifera (Kunth) Cortés). This interspecific hybrid has emerged as a promising solution to diseases such as the <b>bud</b> <b>rot</b> of oil palm because of the apparent partial resistance of this genotype to the disease. This work studied and described the phenology of the O × G interspecific hybrid. The phenology stages were coded using the BBCH scale. The scale for the phenophases was defined using a three-digit code. Due to the nature of the palm, no descriptions were used for stage two (formation of side shoots/tillering) and stage four (development of harvestable vegetative plant parts or vegetative reproductive organs) because these stages do not apply to oil palm. The scale was constructed using germinating seeds, pre-nursery and nursery plants and five year-old palms. For the description of the stem elongation, different age palms of the same O × G hybrid were used. Observations were performed during an 18 -month period. Additionally, the interval for the change from one phenology stage to another was determined both in days and degree-days (DD).

30|$|Mexican Washingtonian trees, Washingtonia robusta, are {{a member}} of the family Arecaceae, which is native to Northwestern Mexico. It is one of the most {{regularly}} planted palm trees around the world as an ornamental plant (Broschat 2018). Although considered a desert palm, it is native to regions having permanent surface or subsurface water (Broschat 2018). A disorder resulting in the death of 4 – 5 -year-old W. roubsta palms in a farm north of Al Shehia district, Al Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, was brought to our attention in March 2015. Many fungal species have been reported to cause bud roots in palm trees, including Botryodiplodia, Chalara (Thielaviopsis), Colletotrichum, and Fuasrium. Phytophthora species, oomycetes, also caused various diseases on various palms including seedling blights and damping off, trunk and leaf spots, crown and root rots, blights and petiole rots; nut drop; and apical, bud, or heart rot, followed by plant death (Garofalo and McMillan 1999). About 59 identified species of Phytophthora are known as pathogens causing disease in roots, crowns, stems, leaves, and fruits of a wide range of agricultural plant species (Erwin and Ribeiro 1996). Phytophthora is a soil-borne fungus-like organism from the water mold group (Ho 2018). Phytophthora <b>bud</b> <b>rot</b> is one of the most common diseases detected in palms in wet tropical climates (Garofalo and McMillan 1999). Phytophthora nicotianae (synonym = P. parasitica) has been reported to infect ornamental palms, more than 301 different ornamental plants and vegetable hosts such as onion, Allium cepa; carnation, Dianthus caryophillus; tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum; and poinsettia, uphorbia pulcherrima. It was recently reported to infect dwarf fan palm, Chamaero pshumilis, in Iran and Italy (Faedda et al. 2011 and Nazerian and Mirabolfathi 2013). Several Lysobacter spp. including L. enzymogenes, L. antibioticus, and L. capsici (Hayward et al. 2010) reported to have the potential as one of the biological control agents for plant diseases. 3.1 T 8 and OH 11 strains of L. enzymogenes were very effective in inhibiting the mycelial growth of Phytophthora capsici, Pythium ultimum, Py. aphanidermatum, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium graminearum, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Christensen & Cook, 1978, Folman et al. 2003, Jiang et al. 2005, and Qian et al. 2009).|$|E

In this study, we report {{for the first time}} that C. radicicola also causes black scorch disease in Qatar. In April to May 2013, we conducted a disease survey in 11 farms located in northern and southern Qatar where three infected farms had an average of 10 % disease incidence. Infected trees manifested different disease symptoms such as black scorch of leaves, inflorescence blight, and heart and <b>bud</b> <b>rot.</b> Infected tissues were surface sterilized with 1. 0 % NaOCl for 60 s, rinsed with distilled water, blotted dry, and then plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 50 mg/liter Rose Bengal. Single fungal colonies were picked from hyphal tips and grown on PDA for 7 days at 25 °C for further examination of the mycological characteristics. Colonies of five C. radicicola isolates on PDA developed aerial mycelium with a light gray color in culture plate, which later changed to black. Both light and scanning electron microscopy were employed to delineate species by spore morphology. Colonies produced ovate aleuroconidia (14 to 17 × 9 to 12 μm) and cylindrical phialoconidia (7 to 9 × 3 to 4 μm) characteristic features of C. radicicola. Phialoconidia (endoconidia) were hyaline to brown in chains produced from endoconidiophore, clamydospores (aleuroconidia), which were single with smooth or slightly rough wall. Additionally, C. radicicola produced single alueroconidia from conidiophores. Amplification of ITS rDNA region from fungal genomic DNA of five isolates, using universal primers ITS 1 (5 ′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG- 3 ′) and ITS 4 (5 ′-CCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC- 3 ′) confirmed the isolated fungus as C. radicicola with no intra-specific variation among the fungal isolates. The length of ITS-rDNA sequence was 534 bp (KJ 410228) and had 99 and 93 % sequence identity with ITS-rDNA region from C. radicicola (HQ 443203) and C. paradoxa (HC 415073. 1), respectively. A pathogenicity test was conducted using 3 -year-old trees from three cultivars (Khalas, Khneezi, and Barhi) growing in sandy loam soil under greenhouse conditions (25 to 29 °C and 12 / 12 -h light/dark). Six trees from each cultivar were used for pathogenicity test, where three were inoculated and three other mock-inoculated. Eight millimeter diameter mycelial plugs were obtained from a C. radicicola culture on PDA medium and used to inoculate rachis region and basal petioles of date palm leaves with a 9 -mm wound created with a cork borer. Control plants were mock-inoculated with PDA plugs. The inoculated area was covered with wet cotton to prevent dryness and the whole plant was covered for 72 h. Four days post infection (dpi), a rusty black infection appeared on the plants. Fifteen dpi, the whole leaf of inoculated stem showed typical symptoms, from which the fungus was re-isolated and colonies were maintained in PDA for morphological characterization, which were confirmed as C. radicicola. All trees from three cultivars showed symptoms with a variable severity from cultivar to another. To our knowledge, this is the first report of black scorch disease caused by T. punctulata in Qatar. This report highlighted the incidence of black scorch disease in Qatar demanding future research study to control the pathogen. Scopu...|$|E
