5|$|After {{the poor}} {{decision-making}} of Senators Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch, Morton succeeded in raising Indiana to national prominence during his lifetime. The {{state and its}} citizens were once the common subject of jokes to the eastern states, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> that ceased after the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, in-game {{dialogue}} was recorded in Los Angeles by local Asian actors, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company. Audio design was complicated; scripting was handled in Vancouver and the recording was in Hong Kong. There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the sound design team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E
5|$|Hansell's successor, Major General Curtis LeMay, assumed {{command in}} January 1945 and {{initially}} {{continued to use}} the same precision bombing tactics, with equally unsatisfactory results. The attacks initially targeted key industrial facilities <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese manufacturing process was carried out in small workshops and private homes.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} ideas leading to vector spaces {{can be traced}} back as far as the 17th century's {{analytic}} geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E
5|$|The house retains {{most of its}} {{internal}} structural decoration, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the furniture, fittings and contents that Burges designed has been dispersed. Many items, including the Great Bookcase, the Zodiac settle, the Golden Bed and the Red Bed, are now in institutions such as The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, while others are in private collections.|$|E
5|$|Tom McCarthy {{directed}} the original pilot, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> this was later re-shot by Tim Van Patten as {{the pilot was}} reworked into the first episode of the complete season. Van Patten also {{directed the}} second episode. McCarthy is still credited as a consulting producer for the series' first episode. Brian Kirk and Daniel Minahan directed three episodes each, and Alan Taylor directed the final two.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} at Wigan Athletic in 2003, he joined West Bromwich Albion, with whom he again won {{promotion}} to the Premier League. In 2006, he moved to Sheffield United, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his time there was spent on loan to other clubs, namely Leeds United, Leicester City and Scunthorpe United. Horsfield announced his retirement from football in 2008 after being diagnosed with testicular cancer, but after successful treatment he resumed his career, signing a six-month contract for Lincoln City in January 2009. In July of that year he was appointed player-assistant manager at Port Vale under Micky Adams, and the following summer he took up coaching full-time, before leaving the game completely in May 2012. In March 2013 he returned to playing football for Alvechurch.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls {{was only half}} their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least Â£80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, {{and as a result}} further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E

5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|During a {{televised}} {{address to the}} nation on 7 September 2004, Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards. An example of the failure, cited by the OSCE, was the pre-marking of ballots. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E

5|$|For {{a number}} of items {{relating}} to works of art near the coast of Asia Minor and in the adjacent islands, Pliny was indebted to the general, statesman, orator and historian Gaius Licinius Mucianus, who died before 77. Pliny mentions the works of art collected by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace and in his other galleries (XXXIV:84), <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his information about the position of such works in Rome is from books, not personal observation. The main merit of his account of ancient art, the only classical work of its kind, {{is that it is}} a compilation ultimately founded on the lost textbooks of Xenocrates and on the biographies of Duris and Antigonus.|$|E
5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{what is to be}} said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E
5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it {{was not included in the}} game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridgeâabout two compact discs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant death duties, coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.|$|E
5|$|Princes Street was {{developed}} during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the Central Otago gold rush, and consequently {{is one of}} New Zealand's most historic streets, with about 70 buildings in close proximity listed on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Register. Originally {{the site of the}} city's wharf, a substantial area of land to the east of the street was formerly part of Otago Harbour, much of it reclaimed via rock removed during the lowering of Bell Hill which separated Princes Street from northern Dunedin {{in the early years of}} settlement. In the years following the gold rush, Princes Street was the heart of Dunedin's central business district, <b>but</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the city's main retail area has now shifted north to George Street.|$|E
