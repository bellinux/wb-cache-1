5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It {{is easy to see}} why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe <b>based</b> <b>his</b> court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant <b>based</b> <b>his</b> ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|An opium-addicted British soldier {{named after}} his {{signature}} weapon. The character was partly inspired by RZA's late cousin Ol' Dirty Bastard. Crowe <b>based</b> <b>his</b> performance on Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry (1971) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976). Crowe {{agreed to join}} the cast because of his previous working relationship with RZA. Crowe was only able to spend 10 days filming his scenes.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and <b>based</b> <b>his</b> character Diotima in the Symposium on her, while others suggest that Diotima {{was in fact a}} historical figure. According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|Bach used {{a rather}} unusual melody by Caspar von Stieler, whereas he <b>based</b> <b>his</b> later chorale cantata on this hymn on the melody by Jacob Regnart. The hymn {{is treated as}} in a chorale fantasia, with string ritornellos between the verses.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's books also {{inspired}} {{some readers}} to visit Patagonia and Australia. As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had <b>based</b> <b>his</b> characters on, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E

5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set to protect it from the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman <b>based</b> <b>his</b> Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E
5|$|Forman <b>based</b> <b>his</b> {{story on}} a {{real-world}} incident {{from his past}} and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on {{trying to create a}} real-life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own, utilizing a largely non-professional cast, relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation, and employing documentary-style cinematographic techniques.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Georges Cuvier {{originally}} {{described the}} yellow stingray as Raia jamaicensis in 1816, in Le Règne Animal distribué d'après son organisation pour servir de base à l'histoire naturelle des animaux et d'introduction à l'anatomie comparée. He <b>based</b> <b>his</b> account on specimens obtained from Jamaica, though no type specimens were designated. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Urolophus, {{and then to}} the genus Urobatis (some literature still refers to this species as Urolophus jamaicensis). Other common names used for this ray include the yellow-spotted ray, the round ray, and the maid ray.|$|E

5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never <b>based</b> <b>his</b> questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes <b>based</b> <b>his</b> description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{another son}} of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, <b>based</b> <b>his</b> novel, Off to Philadelphia in the Morning , {{on the events}} in the life of Joseph Parry. The book became a BBC three-part {{presentation}} of the same name in 1978. Jones never offered the book as anything except a work of fiction; despite this, some aspects of the novel have been misconstrued as fact.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors {{on a daily basis}} is derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor's authority. Historically, the party in control of the General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor <b>based</b> <b>his</b> party affiliation, and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.|$|E
5|$|Its {{musical theme}} forms {{one of the}} three {{arrangements}} on which English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams <b>based</b> <b>his</b> Sea Songs, originally arranged for military band in 1923 as the second movement of his English Folk Song Suite, and subsequently re-arranged for full orchestra in 1942 by the composer.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He <b>based</b> <b>his</b> speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Placed in {{the family}} Rallidae—the rails—this species was {{originally}} described as Fulica Cajanea by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller, in his 1776 Vollständiges Natursystem. Müller <b>based</b> <b>his</b> description on the illustration “Poule d’Eau de Cayenne” (Cayenne’s water hen) by French naturalist and artist Edme-Louis Daubenton in his Planches Enlumineés d’Histoire Naturelle. It was eventually moved to the new genus Aramides, the wood rails, by Jacques Pucheran in 1845, and the specific epithet was changed to cajaneus.|$|E
5|$|Soegija {{arrived in}} Muntilan in September 1926, where he began {{teaching}} algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little {{is known about}} his period as an instructor at the school, although records indicate that he <b>based</b> <b>his</b> teaching style on that of van Lith, {{who had died in}} early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's gamelan and gardening programs and became the chief editor of Swaratama. Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 7th and 9th Divisions {{converged on}} Lae, which fell on 16 September. MacArthur {{advanced}} his timetable, {{and ordered the}} 7th to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the offensive bogged down, partly because MacArthur had <b>based</b> <b>his</b> decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen, when in fact there were nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.|$|E
