500|$|In June 2011, the AFI {{proposed}} {{the establishment of}} an [...] "Australian Academy". The objectives for the proposed academy was to raise the profile of Australian film and television in Australia and abroad, and to change the way it rewards talent by mimicking the methods used in foreign film organisations, such as Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) and British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). The voting system would change through {{the establishment of an}} [...] "Honorary Council", which will govern fifteen chapters composed of professionals from industry guilds and organisations including actors, directors, producers and screenwriters. It was also stated that the Academy would not replace the AFI and past winners of the AFI Awards would [...] " [...] constitute the founding heritage of an ‘Australian Academy.’" [...] When the announcement of the proposal was made, the AFI began the consultation phase where members of the public and screen industry gave their feedback on the proposed changes throughout June, 2011. Of the announcement Damian Trewhella, CEO of the AFI said, [...] "We thought a better way to engage with the industry would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and improve our professional membership structure It's quite a big improvement on the way the AFI does things." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} Walter smoking his own strain of {{marijuana}} {{while listening to}} [...] "Roundabout" [...] by the band Yes. The scene was originally removed out of concern it would be airing on network television, but was later reinserted because [...] "the story itself had so many different genres playing. We had a noir element. We had a musical element. and it just really played funnier coming from an altered state of Walter", according to co-producer Tanya Swerling. Jeff Pinkner added [...] "We {{set out to do}} an episode that explored Walter's state of mind — he's dealing with some very upsetting news. When we realized that the way Walter would deal with such news would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to anesthetize himself with copious amounts of marijuana, well, singing and dancing became a natural outcome." [...] Music supervisor Charles Scott IV and J.R. Wyman are big Yes fans, and consequently chose the song that appeared in the opening scene. As the episode was done with a 1940s aesthetic, every department had to act accordingly. Torv's normally straight hair was placed into a curl hairdo fashionable for the time period, and lighting changes were made to reflect the period as well. New furniture was brought in for various sets, such as Walter's lab and Nina's office at Massive Dynamic, which was then removed in preparation for the following week. The ending was a challenge for the producers, as it was supposed to end with Ella's version of the story conclusion and Walter still feeling upset over Peter's absence, but they felt this ended making viewers feel depressed. They debated ways to make it a happier tone, so Wyman added the Observer scene to change the feeling of the episode, and prepare viewers for next week.|$|E
