30|$|India ranks third {{among the}} leading textile-producing {{countries}} in the world behind China and European nations, and more than 95 million peoples got engaged in textile and related sectors in India [1]. <b>But</b> <b>despites</b> of significance, the textile industries are the main source of pollution due to discharge of hazardous effluent containing colours and organic chemicals used for bleaching, dyeing, printing and other finishing processes [2]. Globally, about 10 – 15 % of total dyestuff (equivalent to 280, 000 tonnes) is released annually into the environment during the manufacturing of textile products, which leads to the contamination of water reservoirs, and thereby affects human and animal health [3, 4].|$|R

Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
