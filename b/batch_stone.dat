The National Centre for Arts and Culture (NCAC) is a semi autonomous institution established by an Act of Parliament in 1989 to promote and develop Gambian Culture. It takes care of performing and fine arts, copyright, sites and monuments and museums. There are other public museums under the stable of the NCAC: Arch 22 museum in Banjul; Slavery museum in Juffureh; Wassu Stone Circles Museum at Wassu, 300 km from Banjul; Fort Bullen Museum in Barra, and the Culture museum at Kerr <b>Batch</b> <b>Stone</b> circles site in the Central River Region. Kachikally sacred crocodile museum in Bakau, 15 km outside Banjul and Tanji village museum are privately run.|$|E
5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first <b>batch</b> of <b>stone</b> had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|R
40|$|Multi-view shape-from-silhouette {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} used for analysing stones. This thesis presents methods to estimate stone shape and to recognise individual stones from their silhouettes. Calibration of two image capture setups is investigated. First, a setup {{consisting of two}} mirrors and a camera is introduced. Pose and camera internal parameters are inferred from silhouettes alone. Second, the configuration and calibration of a high throughput multi-camera setup is covered. Multiple silhouette sets of a stone are merged into a single set by inferring relative poses between sets. This is achieved by adjusting pose parameters to maximise geometrical consistency specified by the epipolar tangency constraint. Shape properties (such as volume, flatness, and elongation) are inferred more accurately from the merged silhouette sets than from the original silhouette sets. Merging is used to recognise individual stones from pairs of silhouette sets captured on different occasions. Merged sets with sufficient geometrical consistency are classified as matches (produced by the same stone), whereas inconsistent sets are classified as mismatches. Batch matching is determining the one-to-one correspondence between two unordered batches of silhouette sets of the same <b>batch</b> of <b>stones.</b> A probabilistic framework is used to combine recognition by mergin...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 229 - 239). Multi-view shape-from-silhouette {{systems are}} increasingly used for analysing stones. This thesis presents methods to estimate stone shape and to recognise individual stones from their silhouettes. Calibration of two image capture setups is investigated. First, a setup {{consisting of two}} mirrors and a camera is introduced. Pose and camera internal parameters are inferred from silhouettes alone. Second. the conﬁguration and calibration of a high throughput multi-camera setup is covered. Multiple silhouette sets of a stone are merged into a single set by inferring relative poses between sets. This is achieved by adjusting pose parameters to maximise geometrical consistency speciﬁed by the epipolar tangency constraint. Shape properties (such as volume, flatness, and eiongation) are inferred more accurately from the merged silhouette sets than from the original silhouette sets. Merging is used to recognise individual stones from pairs of silhouette sets captured on different occasions. Merged sets with sufﬁcient geometrical consistency are classiﬁed as matches (produced by the same stone), whereas inconsistent sets are classiﬁed as mismatches. Batch matching is determining the one-to-one correspondence between two unordered batches of silhouette sets of the same <b>batch</b> of <b>stones.</b> A probabilistic framework is used to combine recognition by merging (which is slow, but accurate) with the efﬁciency of computing shape distribution-based dissimilarity values. Two unordered batches of 1200 six-view silhouette sets of uncut gemstones are correctly matched in approximately 68 seconds (using a 3. 2 GHz Pentium 4 machine]. An experiment that compares silhouette-based shape estimates with mechanical sieving demonstrates an application using the developed methods. A batch of 494 garnets is sieved 15 times. After each sieving, silhouette sets are captured for sub-batches in each bin. Batch matching is {{used to determine the}} IS sieve bins per stone. Better estimates of repeatability, and better understanding of the variability of the sieving process is obtained than if only histograms (the natural output of sieving) were considered. Silhouette-based sieve emulation is found to be more repeatable than mechanical sieving...|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} wastes {{proposed for the}} removal of water pollutants in this study are seeds of two Saudi date lines which are quite abundant in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, having high ion exchange capacity for organic compounds. Two goals can be achieved when using these type of date stones: the first is to evaluate the potentiality of date stones to sorb inorganic and organic pollutants from drainage water to render it suitable for irrigation of crops in the Kingdom and the second is to get rid of harmful {{agricultural wastes}}. Chemical and elemental analyses were carried out for date <b>stones.</b> <b>Batch</b> technique experiments were conducted to determine the adsorption properties of date stones to harmful pesticides such as Endrin, Lindane and Aldrin. Affecting parameters such as adsorbent weight, contact time and polluted water pH values were also studied to control and increase the efficiency of adsorption. The obtained results showed that the date stones can be considered as an efficient adsorbent for the investigated pesticides from prepared waste water. The resultant uptake efficiency was found to be more than 75 % for the tested pollutants. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} adsorbed pesticides can not be disturbed from the loaded date stones. Comparative methods between the Saudi and Egyptian date stones were also studied...|$|R

Sodium calcium carbonate is reacted with sand generate formation of sodium silicate and wollastonite, Na 2 Ca(CO 3) 2 + 2 SiO 2 ⇒ Na 2 SiO 3 + CaSiO 3 + 2 CO 2, at 900 °C. The alternative way of Batch-to Melt conversion is to replace lime stone by natural wollastonite (CaSiO 3). This reaction has occurred by crossing over the step of the reaction Na 2 Ca(CO 3) 2. This means that the melting process can be emerged easier than batch with lime stone; batch with wollastonite requires lower energy. From the calculated thermodynamic exploited heat of glass batch includes wollastonite which is required 10 % lower than using lime stone. When the lime stone is replaced by wollastonite, the kinetic is investigated by Thermal gravity and Differential Scanning Calorimeterv (TG/DSC). Then the next analysis is the melting process of both batches by using Batch-Free Time method with the same condition. The concern of wollastonite is minor impurity, especially iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3), because iron can present in green color for clear glass production. From this experiment, wollastonite can be replaced lime stones and some parts of silica. Regarding to this experiment, batch containing wollastonite melts easier than lime <b>stone</b> <b>batch.</b> In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the two composite glasses were of the same properties...|$|R
