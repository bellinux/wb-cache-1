40|$|Network {{connections}} {{have been}} shown to be correlated with structural or external attributes of the network vertices in a variety of cases. Given the prevalence of this phenomenon network scientists have developed metrics to quantify its extent. In particular, the assortativity coefficient is used to capture the level of correlation between a single-dimensional attribute (categorical or scalar) of the network nodes and the observed connections, i. e., the edges. Nevertheless, in many cases a multi-dimensional, i. e., vector feature of the nodes is of interest. Similar attributes can describe complex behavioral patterns (e. g., mobility) of the network entities. To date little attention has been given to this setting and there has not been a general and formal treatment of this problem. In this study we develop a metric, the vector assortativity index (VA-index for short), based on network randomization and (empirical) statistical hypothesis testing that is able to quantify the assortativity patterns of a network with respect to a vector attribute. Our extensive experimental results on synthetic network data show that the VA-index outperforms a <b>baseline</b> <b>extension</b> of the assortativity coefficient, which has been used in the literature to cope with similar cases. Furthermore, the VA-index can be calibrated (in terms of parameters) fairly easy, while its benefits increase with the (co-) variance of the vector elements, where the baseline systematically over(under) estimate the true mixing patterns of the network...|$|E

30|$|Here, {{we discuss}} when the shallow {{reservoir}} developed. Our modeling {{suggests that a}} shallow reservoir with a volume of at least 7 [*]×[*] 105 m 3 existed before the 2014 eruption. During {{the development of a}} reservoir of this size, there should be pressurization-induced inflation due to fluid accumulation. The reservoir might have formed either slowly over a relatively long time period or might have formed instantaneously in association with certain episodic events. We can suggest four candidates for the inflation period. The first candidate is a small inflation event 1  month prior to the 2014 eruption (Takagi and Onizawa 2016). The second one is syn-eruptive deformation during the 2007 eruption. The third one is slow extensional change from 2002 to 2007. The final one is unknown deformation before 2002 when there are no GNSS data for the TO baseline. The first candidate is an inflation event small enough that it can only be detected by stacking several GNSS baselines data around Ontake Volcano (Miyaoka and Takagi 2016). The absence of extensional change of 1.5  cm in the TO baseline, which is the simulated value from the deflation source model, rules out this possibility (Fig.  7). The second candidate has already been modeled as a spherical inflation source at 3  km depth below Jigokudani Valley (Takagi and Onizawa 2016) and can also be ruled out. From 2002 to 2007 (third candidate), although there were relatively large seasonal fluctuations, we can recognize a slight <b>baseline</b> <b>extension</b> of about 1  cm. Finally, the fourth possibility cannot be discarded owing to lack of data before 2002. Thus, the shallow reservoir may have formed before 2002 or between 2002 and 2007 and remained stable until the 2014 eruption.|$|E

Methods Exploratory {{analysis of the}} Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Nonsurgical versus Surgical Treatment (KANON) trial (ISRCTN 84752559). Relationships between prognostic factors (baseline cartilage, meniscus and osteochondral damage, <b>baseline</b> <b>extension</b> deficit, baseline patient-reported outcomes, number of rehabilitation visits, graft/contralateral ACL rupture, non-ACL surgery and ACL treatment strategy) and 5 -year Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain, symptoms, sport/recreation {{and quality of life}} (QOL) scores were explored using multivariable linear regression. Estimates were adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, preinjury activity level, education and smoking. Results For all participants (n= 118), graft/contralateral ACL rupture, non-ACL surgery and worse baseline 36 -item Short-Form Mental Component Scores were associated with worse outcomes. Treatment with exercise therapy alone was a prognostic factor for less knee symptoms compared with early reconstruction plus exercise therapy (regression coefficient 10. 1, 95 % CI 2. 3 to 17. 9). Baseline meniscus lesion was associated with worse sport/recreation function (− 14. 4, 95 % CI − 27. 6 to – 1. 3) and osteochondral lesions were associated with worse QOL (− 12. 3, 95 % CI − 24. 3 to – 0. 4) following early reconstruction plus exercise therapy. In the same group, undergoing additional non-ACL surgery and worse baseline KOOS scores were prognostic for worse outcome on all KOOS subscales. Following delayed reconstruction, baseline meniscus damage was a prognostic factor for less pain (14. 3, 95 % CI 0. 7 to 27. 9). Following exercise therapy alone, undergoing non- ACL surgery was prognostic for worse pain. Conclusions Treatment-dependent differences in prognostic factors for 5 -year outcomes may support individualised treatment after acute ACL rupture in young active individuals. </p...|$|E

Methods Patients suffering nonspecific LBP for more than 3 months were included prospectively and randomized into lumbar stabilization exercise group (n= 11) or lumbar dynamic strengthening exercise group (n= 10). Exercises were performed for 1 hour, twice weekly, for 8 weeks. The strength of the lumbar extensors was measured at various angles ranging from 0 ° to 72 ° at intervals of 12 °, using a MedX.

Maximum isometric knee extension strength in the dominant leg was measured during comprehensive medical check-ups at baseline and follow-up. Interviews with participants included questions on their history of 11 diseases and lifestyle-related factors such as physical activity as well as dietary, smoking, and drinking habits. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses yielded inconsistent results regarding the associations between lifestyle-related factors and knee extension strength. While going out more frequently and regular physical exercise positively affected <b>baseline</b> knee <b>extension</b> strength, they did not affect knee extension strength in the longitudinal analysis. The longitudinal analysis revealed that more frequent intake of soy products or green and yellow vegetables at baseline decreased age-related knee extension strength decline.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a detailed, technical {{design of the}} Natural Capital Index framework (NCI), version 1. 0. It provides information {{on the state of}} natural and agricultural ecosystems to support policy makers in nature conservation at the national level. The Natural Capital Index is defined as the product of the size of an ecosystem (quantity) and its quality. Ecosystem quality is defined as the ratio between the current state and a postulated baseline state set in pre-industrial times. The NCI has been determined for 15 ecosystem types (ET). For each, a core set of characteristic species has been selected to determine its quality. The species selection is based on nine criteria. Currently a total of 980 species has been chosen. A calculation procedure to determine the NCI on various spatial scales has been worked out. The quantity of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the Netherlands has declined to 40 % of its total territory, while the average quality of these ecosystems is estimated at a modest 44 %. The resulting NCI of these natural ecosystems is thus 18 %, the product of quantity and quality. So roughly speaking, 18 % of the average abundance of the characteristic species remains in comparison with the baseline state. In 1900 and 1950 the NCI was been estimated about 55 % and 30 % respectively. The current NCI for agricultural land is 17 %. In 1950 this was about 50 %. Recommendations for improving the current NCI, version 1. 0, include the following: a better underpinning of <b>baseline</b> values, <b>extension</b> of the core set of species, adjustment of the monitoring programme, {{a better understanding of the}} NCI representativeness, and finally, extension of its policy orientation to focus on specific ecosystem types and translation of policy targets into NCI terms...|$|R

40|$|Background: Injury {{rates among}} triathletes have been {{reported}} to be as high as 87 %. Previous research has established that some triathletes display altered kinematics during running after cycling, compared to an isolated run. These kinematic changes include increased anterior pelvic tilt, decreased hip extension, and increased variability in stride length and time. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a hip flexor stretch performed in the brief transition period between cycling and running would result in a post-cycling (transition) run more similar to a control run. Methods: Twelve participants performed a 5 -minute baseline run, a 15 -minute transition run with no intervention, and a 15 -minute transition run with a bilateral hip flexor stretch between the cycling and running periods. Kinematic data were collected with a Vicon motion capture system. Segment angles, joint angles and stride lengths were calculated at a single time point in the baseline run and at 3 time points in each of the transition runs. Results: Peak forward trunk lean, peak anterior pelvic tilt, peak hip extension, and peak hip flexion were significantly dependent upon run condition. Trunk lean and pelvic tilt significantly increased at all time points in both the no-stretch and stretch transition runs compared to <b>baseline.</b> Hip <b>extension</b> increased in the first minute of the stretch transition run, while hip flexion decreased in the first minute of the no-stretch transition run and in the 1 and 5 -minute time points in the stretch transition run compared to baseline. Forward trunk lean and anterior pelvic tilt were lower in the stretch transition run before the 10 -minute time point compared to the no-stretch transition run, though these differences were not significant. Conclusion: An intervening hip flexor stretch provided only a modest and non-significant improvement in anterior pelvic tilt and forward trunk lean in the early stages of post-cycling running. The sustained increases in anterior pelvic tilt and trunk lean suggest that hip flexor tightness is not the only factor driving kinematic changes during transition running. Further investigation is needed to determine the mechanisms of cycling’s effects on running biomechanics...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Strontium {{ranelate}} 2 g/day {{has proven}} efficacy against vertebral and nonvertebral fracture over 5 years in postmenopausal osteoporosis, though many women require longer-term treatment. This {{article describes the}} efficacy, safety, and tolerability of this agent over 8 years. Methods: Postmenopausal osteoporotic women having participated in the 5 -year efficacy trials SOTI and TROPOS were invited to enter a 3 -year open-label extension study. The results presented here focus on patients who received strontium ranelate for 8 years. Results: At the <b>extension</b> <b>baseline,</b> the population treated for 8 years (n = 879; 79. 1 +/- 5. 6 years) had femoral neck T-score of - 2. 61 +/- 0. 71. The cumulative incidences of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures (13. 7 % and 12. 0 %, respectively) over years 6 to 8 were non-statistically different from the cumulative incidences in the first 3 years of the original studies (11. 5 % and 9. 6 %). Lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) increased throughout the 8 -year period. Annual relative change in BMD was significant at every visit, except the 8 -year visit for femoral neck and total hip BMD. Strontium ranelate was safe and well tolerated over 8 years. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with strontium ranelate 2 g/day in postmenopausal osteoporotic women leads to continued increases in BMD at all sites. The data also provide some evidence for a sustained antifracture efficacy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the stretching duration (15, 30, 60 seconds) with or without a dynamic warm-up that resulted in the longest lasting acute effects in hamstring flexibility. Subjects. Forty subjects (17 male, 23 female) (age: 20 - 35 years) were selected to participate in this study using a sample of convenience from university graduate students. Methods. This study contained 7 treatment conditions in which each subject completed in random order. Three groups consisted of a 5 -minute treadmill warm-up at a self-selected velocity (SSV) followed by one of three stretching durations (15, 30, or 60 sec). Three other groups consisted of only one of the three stretching conditions without the treadmill warm-up. The final group consisted of only walking for 5 min on the treadmill at SSV without receiving a static stretch. A <b>baseline</b> passive knee <b>extension</b> range of motion (ROM) was taken in supine followed by the stretching/treadmill intervention. Subsequent knee ROM measurements were taken each minute until knee ROM returned to baseline. Results. The presence of treadmill warm-up resulted in significantly greater duration of increased hamstring ROM (p≤ 0. 0005). Within the four treadmill conditions, there was no significant difference in duration of increased hamstring ROM. There was no observed statistically significant difference among the three static stretch groups with no treadmill warm-up as well. Conclusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{report that}} intracoronary {{administration}} of autologous bone marrow mononucleated cells (BM-MNCs) may improve remodeling {{of the left}} ventricle after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Subgroup analysis suggest that early treatment between days 4 and 7 after AMI is probably most effective; however, the optimal time point of intracoronary cell administration has never been addressed in clinical trials. Furthermore, reliable clinical predictors are lacking for identifying patients who {{are thought to have}} most benefit from cellular therapy. STUDY DESIGN: In a multicenter trial, 192 patients with AMI successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the infarct-related artery will be randomized in a 1 : 1 : 1 pattern to 1 control and 2 BM-MNC treatment groups. The control group will be treated with state-of-the-art medical management. The treatment groups will receive intracoronary administration of autologous BM-MNC at 5 to 7 days or 3 to 4 weeks after the initial event, respectively. Left ventricular function as well as scar size, transmural extension, and regional wall motion score will be assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies at baseline and after 4 and 12 months. METHODS: Fifty milliliters of bone marrow will be harvested by aspiration from the iliac crest and then carried by courier to a centralized cell processing facility. The mononucleated cell fraction will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 10 mL of injection medium. The cells will be characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and tested for sterility and potency both "in vitro" and "in vivo. " Bone marrow MNC will then be reinfused directly in the infarct-related coronary artery. END POINTS: The primary end point is the change in global left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction by CMR at 4 months as compared to baseline. Comparisons will then be made between each of the prespecified therapy subgroups (early and late after AMI) and the control group. Secondary end points include change in infarct size, change in regional myocardial thickness, and wall motion at 4 and 12 months compared to <b>baseline.</b> Infarct <b>extension</b> (size and transmural extension), time delay to PCI, and coronary flow characteristics after PCI will be assessed as potential predictors of LV remodeling and change after cell therapy. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, rehospitalization for heart failure) will be assessed at 4, 12, and 24 months and time to MACE will be estimated. DISCUSSION: With the present study, we aim to determine the optimal time point of intracoronary administration of autologous BM-MNC after AMI on LV remodeling...|$|R
40|$|Reduced neuron {{models are}} {{essential}} tools in computational neuroscience to aid understanding from the single cell to network level. In this thesis I use these models to address two key challenges: introducing experimentally verifi�ed heterogeneity into neocortical network models, and furthering understanding of post-spike refractory mechanisms. Neocortical network models are increasingly including cell class diversity. However, within these classes significant heterogeneity is displayed, an aspect often neglected in modelling studies {{due to the}} lack of empirical constraints on the variance and covariance of neuronal parameters. To address this I quantified the response of pyramidal cells in neocortical layers 2 / 3 - 5 to square-pulse and naturalistic current stimuli. I used standard and dynamic I-V protocols to measure electrophysiological parameters, a byproduct of which is the straightforward extraction of reduced neuron models. I examined the between- and within-class heterogeneity, culminating in an algorithm to generate populations of exponential integrate-and-�re (EIF) neurons adhering to the empirical marginal distributions and covariance structure. This provides a novel tool for investigating heterogeneity in neocortical network models. Spike threshold is dynamic and, on spike initiation, displays a jump and subsequent exponential decay back to <b>baseline.</b> I examine <b>extensions</b> to the EIF model that include these dynamics, fi�nding that a simple renewal process model well captures the cell's response. It has been previously noted that a two-variable EIF model describing the voltage and threshold dynamics can be reduced to a single-variable system when the membrane and threshold time constants are similar. I examine the response properties of networks of these models by taking a perturbative approach to solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, �finding the results in agreement with simulations over the physiological range of the membrane to threshold time constant ratio.

This 188 -week open-label {{extension of the}} dose-escalation study assessed the long-term efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of drisapersen (PRO 051 /GSK 2402968), 6 mg/kg subcutaneously, in 12 DMD subjects. Dosing was once weekly for 72 weeks. All subjects had a planned treatment interruption (weeks 73 - 80), followed by intermittent dosing (weeks 81 - 188). Subjects received a median (range) total dose of 5. 93 (5. 10 to 6. 02) mg/kg drisapersen. After 177 weeks (last efficacy assessment), median (mean [SD]) six-minute walk distance (6 MWD) improved by 8 (- 24. 5 [161]) meters for the 10 subjects able to complete the 6 MWD at baseline (mean age [SD]: 9. 5 [1. 9] years). These statistics include 2 subjects unable to complete the test at later visits and who scored "zero". When only the 8 ambulant subjects at week 177 were taken into account, a median (mean [SD]) increase of 64 (33 [121]) meters in 6 MWD was observed. Of 7 subjects walking ≥ 330 m at <b>extension</b> <b>baseline,</b> 5 walked farther at week 177. Of 3 subjects walking < 330 m, 2 lost ambulation, while 1 declined overall but walked farther at some visits. Over the 188 weeks, the most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, raised urinary α 1 -microglobulin and proteinuria. Dystrophin expression was detected in all muscle biopsies obtained at week 68 or 72. Drisapersen was generally well tolerated over 188 weeks. Possible renal effects, thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions warrant continued monitoring. Improvements in the 6 MWD at 12 weeks were sustained after 3. 4 years of dosing for most patients. For a small, uncontrolled study, the outcomes are encouraging, as natural history studies would anticipate a decline of over 100 meters over a 3 -year period in a comparable cohort.

40|$|Purpose: The {{inverted}} and supine body {{positions are}} not common postures humans adopt. During unusual situations (e. g. overturned helicopters, motor vehicle accidents, gymnastics) when body position is altered, neuromuscular and cardiovascular (CV) responses can change. To optimally manage these situations, {{it is necessary}} to examine the changes in muscle force output, activation and CV parameters. In previous research, impairments during posture change were believed to be secondary to inhibition of sympathetic nervous system activity in recreational subjects. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the neuromuscular and CV changes in supine and inverted body positions on a group of aerobically trained athletes before and following physical fatigue. Methods: Twelve male athletes completed three trials in the upright, supine and inverted seated positions. At <b>baseline</b> (upright), leg <b>extension</b> (LE) and elbow flexion (EF) evoked contractile properties and MVCs were performed. The participant was then positioned for 150 s in each posture, followed by a 30 s MVC (MVC 30). During each trial, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (Q), heart rate (HR), time and frequency domain HR variability measures and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measurements were recorded. As well, force-fatigue and EMG relationships were evaluated. Results: An ANOVA showed no statistical differences in EF MVC force, but a tendency (p= 0. 12) for LE MVC decline across positions with moderate effect size. EF evoked resting twitch (p= 0. 1) had a decline in force that was not significant from upright to inverted and no change from upright to supine. Potentiated peak twitch (p= 0. 06) force displayed a tendency towards an increase from upright to supine and decline in force from upright to inverted postures (p= 0. 1). LE evoked resting twitch had a non-significant (p= 0. 1) but large magnitude increase in force across the three positions and there was a significant increase in potentiated twitch force (p= 0. 03). Force-fatigue, electromyography-fatigue relationships and HR variability during MVC 30 fatigue across positions were not affected. HR and Q were significantly (p< 0. 01) lower with inversion following both LE and EF fatigue. Conclusions: The lack of significant postural changes in resting force and CV measures may demonstrate that highly trained individuals may adapt better to the supine and inverted positions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{demands of}} modern day sport require athletes {{to reach their}} optimal {{sporting}} performance. Flexibility {{is an important component}} of exercise performance. The high incidence of hamstring strain injuries in various sporting codes has been linked to reduced hamstring flexibility. Stretching has been used as the primary method to improve or maintain flexibility as a prophylactic prevention of muscle strains in many sporting codes. While a variety of stretching techniques exist, contract-relax-agonist-contract (CRAC) stretching, a type of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching, appears to induce greater flexibility improvements than other forms of stretching. However, the effectiveness of this stretch as a method of enhancing agility and sprint performance, as functional measures of athletic performance, has yet to be determined. Objective: To determine the effect of hamstring contract-relax-agonist-contract stretch on flexibility, agility and sprint performance as functional measures of muscle performance in moderately active adult males. Methods: Forty healthy male volunteers between the ages of 21 and 35 years, who performed between three and five hours of physical activity per week were recruited for this study, which had a true experimental design. Participants provided written informed consent, and completed medical- and exercise-related questionnaires. Body mass, stature and body mass index were measured. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group, which received the CRAC intervention, or the control group, which did not receive CRAC intervention. Participants attended a total of three testing sessions. During the first session, hamstring flexibility and sprint and agility times were measured. In the second session, pre- and post-CRAC hamstring flexibility was measured and the best of twotimed trials was recorded for the sprint and agility tests. During the final testing session, pre-CRAC hamstring flexibility was recorded and following a standardised warm-up, post-CRAC hamstring flexibility was measured at specifically timed intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, and 20 min) on a randomly selected leg (referred to as the "thixotropy" leg). The hamstring flexibility of the opposite leg (the "control" leg) was measured at 0 and 20 min only. A standardised warm-up was performed prior to the hamstring CRAC stretch in all testing sessions. During testing sessions, participants in the control group were asked to rest in supine lying for 6 min, which was equivalent to the time taken to perform the CRAC stretch for participants in the experimental group following the warm-up. Results: There was a significant difference between groups in body mass (p = 0. 02), with participants in the experimental group (n = 20) having a significantly higher body mass, compared to participants in the control group (n = 20). There {{were no significant differences between}} groups for any other descriptive variables. There was a significant increased percentage change in hamstring flexibility of the experimental group, compared to the control group (p <. 001). No significant differences were found in the percentage of change of agility, best 10 m or best 25 m sprint times between groups. There was a significant difference between groups with repeated flexibility measurements conducted over regularly timed intervals (F(7, 266) = 38. 95; p <. 001). Hamstring flexibility remained significantly increased for the duration of 8 min in the experimental group post-CRAC stretch, compared to the control group (p <. 001). There were no significant differences between the knee extension angles of the "thixotropic" and "control" leg in the experimental and control groups at the 20 minute interval when compared to <b>baseline</b> knee <b>extension</b> angles within each group. Conclusion: Hamstring flexibility was significantly increased for up to 8 min following the CRAC stretch. However, the CRAC stretch was ineffective in enhancing agility and sprint performance. The need for further research into the use of CRAC stretching as a method of functional performance enhancement was highlighted. There should be a standardised protocol of CRAC application, and future studies should determine the effects of chronic stretch adaptations following regular, longterm hamstring CRAC application on measures of exercise performance. This study showed that CRAC is an effective, time-efficient method of stretching that does not have a detrimental effect on exercise performance...|$|R

40|$|Many onshore windfarms in Scotland {{are being}} built on peatlands. As a consequence, the impacts of {{development}} activities on the peatland and downstream environments are an important emerging issue. For example, a reduction of the quantity of carbon (C) stored in the peatland and increased phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in streams may cause changes in the peatland carbon sink strength and aquatic carbon emissions, and exceedance of EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) P threshold values, respectively. To further assess the impacts from peatland-based windfarm development, the following four research questions were posed: 1. Which specific development activities have {{the greatest impact on}} concentrations of C, N and P in streams? How long does it take for C, N and P concentrations to return to baseline conditions? 2. Which specific windfarm development activities caused the greatest aquatic export of carbon and nutrients? 3. What are the controls on concentration and export of aquatic C, N and P in streams draining peatland developments? 4. How effective are site-derived adsorbent materials and an iron ochre at preventing phosphorus from entering upland streams on peatland? Presented in this thesis, are the results from 3 -weekly spatial streamwater sampling of 18 sub-catchments (ranging 0. 03 - 12 km 2) – from October 2011 to March 2013 – which covers the majority of the peatland-based development and one year beyond, of the Whitelee windfarm Phase 2 extension 16 km south of Glasgow, Scotland. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC/POC), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total oxidised nitrogen (TON) concentrations were measured and exports were calculated from stream gauging. The spatial catchment controls on stream water chemistry were investigated through a multiple linear regression analysis. Fraction of sub-catchment area that was subject to forest felling was found to be significantly positively correlated with concentrations and exports of DOC, POC, SRP and TON; with TON specifically by felling that had occurred more than one year previously. Density of tracks / cable trenches / turbines, and fraction non-forested area in general exerted a negative control on exports. Evidence of SRP attenuation processes in addition to dilution were found in some streams. While neither river sediment nor track or cable trench gravels were very effective at removing SRP, from the results of batch adsorption experiments, a sample of mineral subsoil was. SRP was attenuated in areas where there was a greater proportion of peaty gleys, in the riparian zone along the main stream, and the outcome of the batch adsorption experiments points to attenuation of SRP onto mineral subsoils, where present. Comparing long-term (seven year) time series of the original Whitelee windfarm directly north of the site, with the extension site (this study) it was possible to estimate the time required for recovery to pre-development concentrations. Mean annual [DOC] increased to 31. 4 mg l- 1 during development of the extension site. While it took five years for the DOC to recover at the original site, in the year following development at the extension site, mean annual [DOC] was still above the baseline. Mean annual [POC] increased to a maximum of 2. 6 mg l- 1 during development of the extension site, and as with the original site it returned to the baseline the year following development. The mean annual [SRP] increased to a maximum of 50. 5 μg l- 1 during development, leading to a reduction in water quality from ‘good’ to ‘moderate’ based on comparison with Environmental Quality Standards (EQS). It took four years for the SRP to recover at the original site, and mean annual [SRP] was still above <b>baseline</b> at the <b>extension</b> site in the year following development. The streamwater C, N and P has not been measured as close to, and for such a range of, windfarm development activities. This research has demonstrated links between windfarm development, forest felling in particular, and increased concentrations and exports of DOC, POC, SRP and TON in streams. While the increases were localised within the site itself, investigation of attenuation processes point to peaty gley soils along the main stream, and tracks, cable trenches and turbines – and their associated settling lagoons and silt fences – as potentially mitigating the increased dissolved carbon and nutrients. Outcomes of this research are suggested improvements to the guidance for developing peatlands, especially with regards to monitoring streamwater carbon for a sufficient period post-development, and for the removal of brash on peat soils. Further research could investigate the use of adsorption materials to mitigate phosphorus mobilisation from brash sources to streams, over a time scale of at least two years at the field scale. Laboratory-based environmental fate studies of the increased streamwater carbon could investigate the rates of CO 2 efflux with time and with varying concentrations of nutrients, which would help to improve the Scottish Government's carbon calculator estimates of carbon loss from peatland-based windfarm development...|$|R
