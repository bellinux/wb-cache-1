Thirteen innings reached fifty, but <b>Booth</b> was the only player to reach three figures. English captain Ted Dexter attempted to shut down Booth's scoring by employing leg theory. In the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Fred Titmus bowled outside leg stump with five men on the on side, but <b>Booth</b> completed consecutive centuries with 103 in the second innings. As a result of Dexter's defensive field placings, <b>Booth</b> scored at only half the rate he managed in the First Test. <b>Booth</b> took six hours to reach triple figures and hit only four boundaries. His innings was not enough to prevent England from completing a seven-wicket victory. <b>Booth</b> was unable to maintain his form {{for the rest of the}} season, with 34 and 77 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide being the only other times that he passed 20.

5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so <b>Booth</b> {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG.

However, there was to be no fairytale for <b>Booth,</b> who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E
