50|$|Dilatation of benign {{oesophageal}} strictures using semi-rigid <b>bougies</b> existed {{long before}} the advent of flexible endoscopes. Since that time oesophageal dilatation has been carried out using either <b>bougies</b> or endoscopic balloons, and can be used to treat benign oesophageal strictures and achalasia.|$|E
50|$|Mercury-weighted <b>bougies</b> are blindly {{inserted}} <b>bougies</b> {{placed into}} the esophagus by the treating physician. They are passed in sequentially increasing sizes to dilate the obstructed area. They {{must be used}} with precaution in patients with narrow strictures, as they may curl proximal to the obstruction.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, {{equipped}} with 40 mm Bofors guns, 45 LAA Regt {{was attached to}} Allied Force Headquarters for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. The troop convoys assembled in the River Clyde in October 1942 and sailed to North Africa, where the British troops began landing at Algiers on 8 November. The force then moved eastwards to seize the port of <b>Bougies</b> and Djidjelli airfield, 45 LAA Regt following them by sea. It had been intended to land two LAA troops on the beaches near Djidjelli, but sea conditions prevented this and the whole regiment disembarked at <b>Bougies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bougie over {{guidewire}} dilators {{are used}} {{at the time of}} gastroscopy or fluoroscopy.

50|$|Initially, <b>bougies</b> {{were used}} to dilate benign strictures of the oesophagus. These could be passed {{alongside}} the endoscope, allowing visualisation of the bougie passing through the stricture, but the technique of passing a guidewire through the stricture endoscopically, then removing the endoscope and passing the bougie over the guidewire was more commonly used.|$|E
50|$|More recently, balloon {{dilatation}} of the oesophageal strictures {{has become}} more common. It is thought that this technique carries a lower complication rate than the use of <b>bougies,</b> and since endoscopy balloons are single use items there are no concerns about equipment sterilization.

50|$|Several {{treatment}} regimens {{have been}} described for esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis. Because the condition is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, proton pump inhibitors as anti-acid medications are used to treat the condition. If the condition is associated with spasm of the esophagus, antispasmodic medications such as butylscopolamine can be used. Dilation of areas of stricturing using esophageal <b>bougies</b> may provide relief of swallowing symptoms. The pseudodiverticulae themselves rarely cause symptoms, and treatment is not directed toward them.|$|E
50|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, AA defences for the Algiers area were built up into an {{integrated}} joint-service organisation, with the RAF installing early-warning radar and an operations room, and US Army AA Artillery units acquiring operational experience alongside British units. As the build-up continued, 22 AA Bde could be released from commitments in the rear areas and assigned to airfield defence for No. 242 Group RAF. By January 1943, 58 HAA Rgt had a troop at Souk-el-Khemis Airfield, another at Souk-el-Arba Airfield and railhead, and a battery defending the port of <b>Bougies</b> under 52 AA Bde, while the third battery was supporting the advance of V Corps. Later the battery from <b>Bougies</b> was released and the airfield defences raised to a battery apiece by March. In {{the final phase of}} the Tunisian Campaign (Operation Vulcan), 58 HAA came under 52 AA Bde as part of a mobile AA reserve ready to move up to Bizerta and Tunis immediately behind the battle groups. Some AA guns were deployed 'protecting' dummy armour assembly positions to deceive the enemy. As the Allies moved into Bizerta on 7 May the AA advance parties came under shellfire from the remaining enemy outside the town. The campaign ended on 12 May 1943, with 58th HAA Rgt claiming to have shot down 37 enemy aircraft during its course.

The African fabric markets were starved of Dutch Wax for the entirety of the war and when in 1945 Vlisco managed to send a shipment of a fabric called Six <b>Bougies</b> , it was an immediate success. So much so, that from 1963 onwards, all Vlisco fabrics have the text Guaranteed Dutch Wax Vlisco stamped on the side, because the fabrics were and still are widely counterfeited.|$|E
2500|$|At [...] on 16 July, the 8th Royal Scots (8th RS) and the 153rd RAC {{advanced}} towards Gavrus, {{the tanks}} attacking {{to the side}} of the hill on the left flank, protected from the Germans in Évrecy by the ridge, to get behind the village and menace the German line of retreat, while the infantry overran the village. By [...] the 8th RS had taken the village and [...] A similar attack was made on <b>Bougy</b> and another [...] were taken, after the garrison was routed. During the day several counter-attacks were made on the Scottish positions, which were repulsed by artillery barrages, with many German casualties. In the afternoon, the Germans counter‑attacked twice with Tiger and Panther tanks accompanied by infantry. Mortar fire on forward positions was continuous throughout the afternoon and evening but no ground was lost and many casualties were inflicted on the Germans in a mutually costly defensive action. The tank crews fought or were at instant readiness for thirty hours without relief, from the zero hour until the German counter-attacks ended. The 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers (6th RSF) were moved forward to Gavrus and the 8th RS formed up at <b>Bougy.</b> On the left flank, the situation deteriorated after the 227th Brigade attack on Évrecy failed; touch with the 6th KOSB became tenuous.|$|R

'B' Squadron was soon engaged by enemy armour and the battle continued until nightfall, with casualties including the squadron commander. 153 RAC's total casualties for this two-day operation comprised 10 tanks knocked out or destroyed, 16 officers and 70 other ranks killed, wounded, or missing.

40|$|Refractory benign esophageal {{stricture}} (RBES) is a frequently encountered problem worldwide. These strictures {{arise from}} various causes such as corrosive injury, radiation therapy, peptic origin, ablative therapy, and after surgery. Most strictures {{can be treated}} successfully with endoscopic dilatation using <b>bougies</b> or balloons, {{with only a few}} complications. Those patients who fail after serial dilatation with <b>bougies</b> or balloons will come to the category of refractory strictures. Dilatation combined with intralesional steroid injections can be considered for peptic strictures, whereas incisional therapy has been demonstrated to be effective for short anastomotic strictures. When these therapeutic options do not resolve the stenosis, stent placement should be considered. Self-bougienage can be proposed to a selected group of patients with a proximal stenosis. Most of the patients of RBES respond to above-mentioned treatment and occasional patient may require surgery as the final treatment option. This review aims to provide a comprehensive approach toward endoscopic management of RBESs based on current literature and personal experience...|$|E

It transpired that the Germans were withdrawing. On 5 August, 153 RAC made a rapid cross-country move to Mondrainville to support 177th Brigade of 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, which was attacking towards Mont Pincon.
