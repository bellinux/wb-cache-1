(The {{turn on the}} third line is considered a pivot-in-place because the turn uses a cross stance as a transitional movement.) This indicates that the associated trigram is three broken lines; this is the trigram for earth ("gon"). The Kukkiwon teaches that this poomsae serves as the foundation (i.e., the earth) for the student's future training (i.e., black <b>belt</b> <b>training).</b>|$|E

50|$|Tom Somerville, Neil Frazer and Warwick Lobb were {{instrumental}} in establishing Yoshukai Karate in New Zealand and later in Australia. Tom Somerville was a New Zealander {{who lived in the}} United States and trained with Mike Foster's students Charles Scanlan and Kevin Bradford in New Jersey in the mid seventies. He returned to New Zealand and in 1979 set up a dojo at the University of Canterbury. In the early 1980s, Neil Frazer and Warwick Lobb traveled from New Zealand to New Jersey to complete their black <b>belt</b> <b>training,</b> and Neil Frazer took over running the Canterbury club with assistance from Warwick. In 1990 Dave Leathwick started a club in Palmerston North known as the Tokomaru Dojo, and in 2004 Darel Hall started the third New Zealand club in Wellington.|$|E
5000|$|The Martial Arts Instructor Course {{certifies}} Marines as Martial Arts Instructors (MAI) (secondary MOS 0916, formerly 8551) in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program {{by providing}} the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to conduct all aspects of training. The graduating student will {{have the capability to}} certify Marines at belt levels the same as his or her own; supervise sustainment and integration training; conduct the combative sports program; and conduct the combat conditioning program. In order to obtain instructor qualifications for a higher belt, Marines must first meet the belt requirements and progress through the training program. In order to become a Martial Arts Instructor Trainer (MAIT), which can also certify green, brown, and black belt (1st Degree) Instructors, they must go through a seven-week MAIT course at Marine Corps Base Quantico. Once the black belt is obtained, Marines can acquire up to six degrees of black <b>belt</b> <b>training,</b> distinguished by Tan (MAI) or Red (MAIT) stripes {{on the right side of}} the belt.|$|E
40|$|Background Since 2012, Singapore Management University’s (SMU) Li Ka Shing Library {{has been}} {{actively}} responding to three primary drivers of change: The {{first is the}} University’s educational initiative to encourage blended learning and project based learning; The second {{is the need to}} increase {{the quality and quantity of}} Library spaces, to create more quiet spaces, to improve the zoning for teaching and learning activities in support of collaborative, team and project based learning; The third is the Library’s own Culture of Assessment initiative to encourage decision making and continuous improvement based on data and evidence. In late 2013, the Library received funding to begin staged renovations based on a master planning exercise initiated in 2012 which included observational studies, focus groups and interviews to inform space planning. Additional assessment methods included a 2013 LibQual survey, an SMU Student Association survey, student, staff and faculty feedback collected over 3 years. While the master planning for the Library space renovations were underway, librarians and staff were participating in the Lean Six Sigma Green <b>Belt</b> <b>training</b> offered through SMU’s Office of Business Improvement. Methods learned in the training informed space planning decisions and now are informing assessment of the space renovation. In November 2013, priority library spaces targeted for immediate implementation were identified with objectives to increase seating, provide more flexible multi-use learning and teaching spaces. In August 2014, the renovations were completed which included a 24 / 7 Learning Commons area with a separate entrance, with two shareable technology enabled project rooms, a reflective area for quiet study, two ‘phone booths’, study booths and the Hive, a flexible learning space equipped with innovative technology for collaborative, project based learning. Purpose At the completion of the first term, December 2014, the Library is performing an assessment to measure the outcomes and impact of the new learning spaces. The assessment activities are providing an opportunity for librarians to apply knowledge and methods as learned in the Lean Six Sigma training to build and enforce management competencies related to continuous assessment and improvement. The results of the assessment will be used to inform continuous improvements to the spaces and to demonstrate the extent the Library, as a flexible learning space, contributes to the success of teaching, learning and community activities. The assessment will also contribute to the literature that examines how students and faculty engage with learning spaces designed to encourage discussion, collaboration and project based learning. To fully benefit from the assessment, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations and deeper analysis will be undertaken. Design, methodology or approach The methodology applied involves both qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the extent the new spaces are meeting the needs of faculty and students; and, to increase the understanding of how the library spaces directly contribute to teaching and learning success. Methods used, within the Six Sigma framework of Design, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control, includes: focus group results; quantitative and textual analysis of suggestion board feedback; observational studies and LibQual surveys. Each of the methods applied in 2015 will be benchmarked against 2013 results to study the impact. The previous works majorly focussed on the quantitative studies to study the various aspects of library spaces. However, the qualitative analysis which comes majorly in the form of free text is not analysed for evaluations. In this work, with support from SMU’s School of Information Systems, we adopt algorithms from text mining research to aid the analysis of the users’ feedback which is expressed in free text. Such analysis aids in the study correlated aspects as well as to discover the users’ opinions or suggestions towards the library spaces. Originality and value of the proposal Findings will be of interest to other libraries embarking on library space transformation projects as well as libraries interested in using space assessment as a professional learning development exercise...|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Thanksgiving in 1912, {{young men}} from the {{football}} team of the Third District Agricultural School (TDAS) rode mules to Coach George RufordTurrentine’s home north of the campus at Magnolia, Arkansas. In that year’s final game, they had played a scoreless tie game with Fordyce High School at TDAS on “Turkey Day,” November 28, {{and they wanted to}} talk over the season with the coach. It was not unusual for young men in the rural South to ride mules; as the animal used most often in Southern agriculture, they were easily available. In the school’s early years, football teams may have ridden mules occasionally to reach McNeil, five miles north of TDAS. It was there that they caught the Cotton <b>Belt</b> <b>train</b> to away games. There were only four automobiles in Columbia County in 1912 and no paved roads. Muddy roads in flooding weather conditions made travel difficult, even by wagon. Riding a mule was a more reliable means of transportation.|$|R
25|$|Rather ill-fated was the {{adoption}} of diesel services. In 2001, a total of 20 units were commissioned for use on the Dresden-Munich and Munich-Zurich lines, but these class 605 (ICE-TD) units experienced trouble from the start so the trains were mothballed. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, they were used for supplemental services. Their top speed is 125mph (200km/h). They are expensive to use within Germany since full diesel tax must be paid. Starting {{at the end of}} 2007, the class 605 has been deployed on the Hamburg-Copenhagen route. This route, using the Fehmarn <b>Belt</b> <b>train</b> ferry needs diesel trains for both the railway and the ferry, as neither has an electric supply. Later the Hamburg-Aarhus started to use these trains. The Danish railway currently has a severe shortage of long-distance diesel trains since their new IC4, with features similar to the ICE-TD, has also been ill-fated and severely delayed in delivery. The ICE-TD can have lower operational cost for this traffic, since diesel for train usage has lower tax in Denmark, and the trains fill their tanks there.|$|R
