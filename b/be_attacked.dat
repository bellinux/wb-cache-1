5|$|Iridium is {{the most}} {{corrosion-resistant}} metal known: it is not attacked by almost any acid, aqua regia, molten metals, or silicates at high temperatures. It can, however, <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> by some molten salts, such as sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, as well as oxygen and the halogens (particularly fluorine) at higher temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The OKL {{believed}} that the British were down to their last 300 fighters, with only 250 being produced. To stop fighter production, factories in Bristol were to <b>be</b> <b>attacked.</b> London was also {{to be subjected to}} round the clock bombing.|$|E
50|$|Reinstatement labellings {{distinguish}} arguments {{not accepted}} because they <b>are</b> <b>attacked</b> by accepted arguments from undefined arguments—that is, {{those that are}} not defended cannot defend themselves. An argument is undec if it <b>is</b> <b>attacked</b> by at least another undec. If it <b>is</b> <b>attacked</b> only by arguments out, it must be in, and if it <b>is</b> <b>attacked</b> only by arguments in, then it is out.|$|R
50|$|The {{circumstances}} in which Ali <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> <b>is</b> subject to debate; some scholars maintain that he <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> outside the mosque, others state that he <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> while initiating the prayer and still others reiterate that ibn-Muljim assaulted him midway through the prayer while Ali was prostrating.|$|R

5|$|The tree {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> by the horse {{chestnut}} scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap {{from the trunk}} and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{high risk}} of predation, {{dolphins}} often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks. Injured or ailing whales may also <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in 2006 near Hawaii. A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and have been documented doing so alongside great whites.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar {{at the bottom of}} the screen indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with the front and rear areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
50|$|Hospitals in Aleppo have <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> {{multiple}} times. Before March 2016, {{more than}} six hospitals <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> in the Aleppo Governorate. In April 2016, over two dozen were killed when a Russian airstrike hit a hospital; the hospital served as the area's primary pediatric care facility. In July 2016, M2 Hospital <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by aircraft. By {{the end of the}} month, six hospitals in Aleppo had been destroyed. In October 2016, M10 Hospital <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by airstrikes.|$|R
25|$|The {{communal}} violence spread to Bihar (where Muslims <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> by Hindus), to Noakhali in Bengal (where Hindus were targeted by Muslims), to Garhmukteshwar in the United Provinces (where Muslims <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> by Hindus), {{and on to}} Rawalpindi in March 1947 in which Hindus <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> or driven out by Muslims.|$|R
50|$|Japan is {{the only}} nation that has <b>been</b> <b>attacked</b> with atomic weapons. In 1995 it <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> with {{chemical}} weapons in a domestic terror attack.|$|R
5|$|Fragile Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> using ships, {{missiles}} and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{wanted to}} {{maintain}} the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital. Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale. He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former. Instead, he pressed for attacks against residential areas. Hitler refused. He ordered that only military targets in London were to <b>be</b> <b>attacked.</b>|$|E
5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E
50|$|Journalists {{covering}} the riots <b>were</b> also <b>attacked</b> by the mob. Sunday Leader journalist Binoy Suriarachchi was held hostage {{for several hours}} and his driver Upul <b>was</b> <b>attacked.</b> Sunday Times journalist Sarath Siriwardana <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by a mob in Aluthgama {{on the night of}} 15 June 2014. An Al Jazeera crew travelling between Mathugama and Aluthgama on 17 June 2014 <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> by a mob who damaged their vehicle's windscreen.|$|R
50|$|Hospital <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{not limited}} to Aleppo. In October 2015, a Russian {{aircraft}} attacked a medical facility operated by the Syrian American Medical Society {{in the town of}} Sarmin. In February 2016, a children's hospital was hit in Azaz; Russians claimed they targeted ISIL infrastructure. That same month two hospitals in Maarrat al-Nu'man <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> by Syrian forces, one being a Doctors Without Borders supported facility; Syria claimed that one of the <b>attacks</b> <b>was</b> done by American forces. In July 2016, a hospital <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by Russian forces in Atarib. In August 2016, a medical facility <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> once every 17 hours. One of these <b>attacks</b> <b>was</b> an <b>attack</b> on the last functioning hospital in Darayya; the <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> done with barrel bombs filled with napalm. In April 2017, a hospital <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> in Maarat al-Nu'man. After a chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun, a clinic treating those who <b>were</b> gassed <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by Syrian forces; due to this event U.S. launched a missile strike against Shayrat Air Base.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2013 Quebec Charter of Values, many Muslim women wearing the headscarf <b>were</b> <b>attacked.</b> On September 17, a 17-year old Muslim girl <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> in St. Catharines. She was punched in the nose, that left her bleeding and her headscarf was pulled off. In November, a woman wearing the hijab in Montreal <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by two men; one of them spat on her, while the other pulled off her headscarf. In December, a woman wearing a hijab <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> when another woman tried to forcibly remove her headscarf from her head.|$|R
5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale. Civilians {{who took part in the}} war effort through such activities as building fortifications and manufacturing munitions and other war materials in factories and workshops were considered combatants in a legal sense and therefore liable to <b>be</b> <b>attacked.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} grey heron, European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks pose a threat to their offspring.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1945, the United States Third Fleet sortied from Leyte Gulf in the Philippines {{under the}} command of Admiral William Halsey to attack the Japanese home islands. Halsey's plans {{included}} the use of battleships and cruisers to bombard military facilities and factories. To prepare for these attacks, US Navy submarines sailed into Japan's inshore waters to search for naval mines. USAAF B-29 Superfortress and B-24 Liberator aircraft also conducted photo reconnaissance flights over much of Japan in search of airfields and facilities which could <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> by the Third Fleet.|$|E
50|$|In March and April 2008 their Manchester store <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by criminals firing ball {{bearings}} at the windows. There <b>were</b> two separate <b>attacks</b> which cost the business £10,000 {{due to the}} size of the windows which had <b>been</b> <b>attacked.</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 April 1972 the {{airfield}} <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> by B-52s, destroying one MiG-17 and cratering the runway. The base <b>was</b> <b>attacked</b> again by US Navy A-6s in May 1972.|$|R
5000|$|... 2017 - snowboarders near Aspen, Colorado <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> {{shortly after}} {{being caught in}} an {{avalanche}}. They were able to escape the avalanche with some injuries but then <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> by a moose.|$|R
5|$|On July 3, Father John Patrick Dunn of the Church of St. Philip Neri in the Southwark District {{was warned}} {{in advance of}} a planned parade by the Native American Party that the church might <b>be</b> <b>attacked.</b> The Native American Party, a nativist {{political}} party, planned to hold a large parade the next day on Independence Day.|$|E
5|$|The Leopold Cafe, {{a popular}} {{restaurant}} and bar on Colaba Causeway in South Mumbai, {{was one of}} the first sites to <b>be</b> <b>attacked.</b> Two attackers, Shoaib alias Soheb and Nazir alias Abu Umer, opened fire on the cafe on the evening of 26 November, killing at least 10 people, (including some foreigners), and injuring many more.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{assault was}} {{thoroughly}} prepared. The plan was for six Portuguese squadrons under dom João da Silva {{to block the}} entrance to the bridge, isolating the redoubt from Fort San Crisóbal. The fort would in turn <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> by Alfonso Futrado and Simon Correa da Silva. Maestre de Campo dom Diogo Gomes was given the task of cutting the communication lines along the Guadiana river and Pedro Almado of distracting several minor forts nearby. Some cavalry regiments were deployed in the expectation of a fierce Spanish resistance.|$|E

In both cases, there was damage to the buildings but no casualties.|$|R
5|$|The crop can <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> by larvae of {{the carrot}} fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, {{burrowing}} its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted {{by the smell of}} bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's predators include {{birds and}} aquatic mammals. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are the {{predominant}} land predator of chicks, responsible {{for up to}} 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are too large to <b>be</b> <b>attacked</b> {{by the time of}} its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may defend their chick from attack, although it may be more passive if the chick is sickly.|$|E
5|$|The male common {{chiffchaff}} {{is highly}} territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20metres (66ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds may also <b>be</b> <b>attacked.</b> The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if {{they approach the}} nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.|$|E
