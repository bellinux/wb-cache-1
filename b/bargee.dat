500|$|Barker's {{theatrical}} success {{enabled him}} to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name [...] "Ronald", was now {{referred to as the}} less formal form [...] "Ronnie", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggit's. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the lookout Able Seaman 'Fatso' Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton, in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes. He also featured in the show's radio spin-off The TV Lark as Fatso Johnson, a camera operator, and as a trainee chef in Crowther's Crowd in 1963, and had roles on Variety Playhouse. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn's show I'm Not Bothered. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch). This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint and The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover. In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpson's gentle comedy, The <b>Bargee,</b> as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbett's rascally Hemmel Pike. Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).|$|E

2500|$|Steptoe and Son led Corbett to comedy films: as James Ryder in Ladies Who Do (1963); with Ronnie Barker in The <b>Bargee</b> (1964), {{written by}} Galton and Simpson; Carry On Screaming! (1966); the [...] "Lust" [...] segment of The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins (1971); and Terry Gilliam's Jabberwocky (1977). There were two Steptoe and Son films: Steptoe and Son (1972) and Steptoe and Son Ride Again (1973). He {{also had the}} leading role in two other {{television}} series, Mr. Aitch (written especially for him, 1967) and Grundy (1980).|$|E
60|$|I am sure I {{would rather}} be a <b>bargee</b> than occupy any {{position}} under heaven that required attendance at an office. There are few callings, I should say, where a man gives up less of his liberty in return for regular meals. The <b>bargee</b> is on shipboard--he is master in his own ship--he can land whenever he will--he can never be kept beating off a lee-shore a whole frosty night when the sheets are as hard as iron; and so far as I can make out, time stands as nearly still with him as {{is compatible with the}} return of bed-time or the dinner-hour. It is not easy to see why a <b>bargee</b> should ever die.|$|E

50|$|The Dolphin Inn next to {{the lock}} was built for <b>bargees</b> in 1728. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|R
6000|$|... "More fool you! Construe," [...] said McTurk. [...] "Those six <b>bargees</b> scragged the Czar, {{and left}} no evidence. Actum est with King." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, not at all,' replied Charteris. 'I enjoyed it.' (He felt he {{had said}} the right thing there. Your real hero always 'enjoys it'.) 'I'm sorry those <b>bargees</b> frightened you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Welch, you {{remember}} the <b>Bargee</b> who scragged Tony? Well, there have been all sorts of fresh developments. He's just been pacing {{me all the way}} from Stapleton.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are an idiot. And {{now this}} <b>Bargee</b> man will go {{straight}} to the Old Man and run you in. I wonder you didn't think of that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And this <b>bargee</b> {{has got the}} old un," [...] said Tillotson, {{using the}} terms Glover had {{employed}} in his narrative. [...] "I don’t see {{what is to be}} done, Glover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, Smith,' said Mike quickly, 'can't we stop him? These chaps {{are getting}} fed up, {{and they look}} <b>bargees</b> enough to do anything. They'll be going for him or {{something}} soon.' ...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{there was}} a chapel {{situated}} {{on the site of}} the current church. This chapel was devoted to Mary and to Saint Nicholas, the patron of the <b>bargees</b> who cast off the vessels at the Westerhaven (Westerharber).|$|R
50|$|Dodgson was {{concerned}} about the canal workers on the Bridgewater Canal running past his parish. Together with Egerton, who was a wealthy local landowner, he converted a barge into a floating chapel, moored at Preston Brook, and held weekly services there for the <b>bargees.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There, {{that will}} do. A young lady is {{supposed}} to be able to answer a question with a simple yes or no, without swearing about it like a <b>bargee</b> on the Regent's Canal." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} joyfully {{followed}} {{into the little}} cabin, and were soon satisfying their hunger on bread and cold meat. The <b>bargee</b> drew a jug {{of water from the}} breaker and placed it before them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Like a devil. Then {{he nearly}} {{went to sleep}} in our study just now. I expect he'll be all right when he wakes up. Rummy business! Conscientious old <b>bargee.</b> You ought to have heard his apologies.' ...|$|E
50|$|The canal was {{constructed}} in 1820 to carry cargo from Limehouse into the canal system. There is no tow-path in the tunnel so <b>bargees</b> had to walk their barges through, braced against the roof. Commercial use of the canal has declined since the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|... "…was {{notorious for}} its {{arguments}} between <b>bargees</b> and millers, who being {{in possession of}} the lock, {{whether it was a}} flash or pound lock, could preserve their head of water, and not let it flow down river, by opening the gates, as long as they wished." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{however, the}} School was getting {{some of its}} own back. The <b>Bargees</b> had brought down a player of some {{reputation}} from the North, and were as strong as ever in the scrum. But St Austin's had a great team, and were carrying all before them. Charteris and Graham at half had the ball out to their centres {{in a way which}} made Merevale, who looked after the football of the School, feel that life was worth living. And when once it was out, things happened rapidly. MacArthur, the captain of the team, with Thomson as his fellow-centre, and Welch and Bannister on the wings, did what they liked with the Bargees' three-quarters. All the School outsides had scored, even the back, who dropped a neat goal. The player from the North had scarcely touched the ball during the whole game, and altogether the <b>Bargees</b> were becoming restless and excited.|$|R
60|$|He {{carried her}} safely over, and {{exchanged}} some friendly words with the <b>bargee.</b> Then he took Henrietta forward, and stood watching {{the water as}} they were borne along noiselessly between the hilly pastures of the country.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was at the}} Brocas, and a <b>bargee</b> told me that an Eton fellow {{had been}} drowned above Surley, and the only Eton boat above Surley to-day, as I can learn, is Buckhurst's four-oar. That is all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|King {{was behind}} them, and every well-weighed word {{went up the}} {{staircase}} like an arrow. [...] "I can only swear," [...] said Beetle, [...] "that King cursed like a <b>bargee.</b> Simply disgustin'. I'm goin' to write to my father about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Above the top {{lock the}} canal passes through Sydney Gardens {{including}} two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800. Cleveland tunnel is [...] long and runs under Cleveland House, the former {{headquarters of the}} Kennet and Avon Canal Company. A trap-door in the tunnel roof was used to pass paperwork between clerks above and <b>bargees</b> below.|$|R
40|$|In {{thinking}} about <b>bargees</b> or, more speciﬁcally, {{men and women}} living on canal boats with their families, readers in nineteenth-century Britain were encouraged to: “picture them going silently along the waterways of our land, [ [...] . ] half a million souls, to whom a decent life is simply impossible” (Pearse, Rob Rat, 25 – 6; original emphasis). There are vast disparities in accounts {{of how many people}} lived on board boats full-time, but it was, campaigners, inspectors, proselytisers, and authors agreed, precisely their movement along the network of Britain’s canals that made a “decent life” unachievable. Indecent lives were characterised by unsanitary conditions, insobriety, a lack of school and church attendance, violence, crime, and immorality. The nomadism of the “ﬂoating population” was the presumed cause of this supposedly appalling state and its perpetuation (Smith, Our Canal Population, 17). It was not just the canal boat people who showed the effects of continual movement, however; the “picture” of <b>bargees</b> described above was just as nomadic...|$|R
5000|$|Another Etymology, however, is the Old English {{word for}} turn - [...] "Windan", (pronounced {{with a short}} I (as in windlass, a handle for winding (long I) gears)). Old English was in use up to and {{including}} the 18th century when the canals where built. Much UK canal terminology comes from spoken rather than written tradition and from <b>bargees</b> who did not read or write.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no reply}} from the <b>bargee.</b> The master {{led the way}} to the cabin, and {{lighting}} a lamp, which appealed to more senses than one, took a seat on a locker, and again requested the other to fire away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear chap, how can I? It's {{on our own}} ground. These <b>Bargee</b> beasts are visitors, if {{you come}} to think of it. I'd like to wring the chap's neck who did it. I didn't spot who it was. Did you see?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, dash it,' said Charteris indignantly, 'if he {{had lost}} his hair he might have drawn the line at falling on Tony like that. It wasn't the {{tackling}} part of it that crocked him. The beast simply jumped on him like a Hooligan. Anyhow, I made him sit up a bit before we finished. I gave Prescott the tip to mark him out of touch. Have you ever been collared by Prescott? It's a liberal education. Now, there you are, you see. Take Prescott. He's never crocked a man seriously in his life. I don't count being winded. That's absolutely an accident. Well, there you are, then. Prescott weighs thirteen-ten, and he's all muscle, and he goes like a battering-ram. You'll own that. He goes as hard as he jolly well knows how, and yet the worst he has ever done is to lay a man out {{for a couple of minutes}} while he gets his wind back. Well, compare him with this <b>Bargee</b> man. The <b>Bargee</b> weighs a stone less and isn't nearly as strong, and yet he smashes Tony's collar-bone. It's all very well, Babe, but you can't get away from it. Prescott tackles fairly and the <b>Bargee</b> scrags.' ...|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{there are}} the Occupational Travellers - Travelling Showpeople/Show Travellers (known in France as Forains Industriel), Circus and <b>Bargees.</b> These groups formed around {{particular}} crafts and professions that required frequent mobility. Groups such as Travelling Showpeople usually follow a set pattern of nomadism year after year. Membership of these groups have, over the years been drawn from other communities (including, {{in the case of}} travelling funfairs and circuses, Romani people).|$|R
50|$|Above the Top Lock {{the canal}} passes through Sydney Gardens via two short tunnels and under two cast iron {{footbridges}} dating from 1800. Cleveland Tunnel is 173 ft long and runs under Cleveland House, the former {{headquarters of the}} Kennet and Avon Canal Company and now a Grade II* listed building. A trap-door in the tunnel roof was used to pass paperwork between clerks above and <b>bargees</b> below. Many of the bridges over the canal are listed buildings.|$|R
50|$|Following a thaw in 1893, {{the bridge}} {{collapsed}} when blocks of ice carried {{down by the}} river shattered the supporting legs. <b>Bargees</b> who had been ensnared by the frozen conditions attempted to protect the bridge by adding heavy loads, and by fending off the ice floes. When the bridge finally gave way, James Thompson ended up on afloat on the ice, and was washed downstream, but he later reached the riverbank unharmed. The wooden bridge was reconstructed after this incident.|$|R
