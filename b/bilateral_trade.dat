5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average tariff rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.|$|E
5|$|Faisalabad is {{recognised}} as {{the centre}} of the textile industry in Pakistan, contributing to half of Pakistans total textile shipments. At the end of June 2012, textile mills employed 20% of the nation's workforce, and generated 1.3trillion rupees ($13.8billion) in textile products, most of which were exported to the US and Europe. While Punjab's economy is driven primarily by agriculture, the textile industry along with leather products and light engineering goods play an important role, with more than 48,000 industrial units spread across Punjab. In an effort to boost <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade,</b> Romania and Turkey have honorary-consulates in Faisalabad which enable trade links with the city.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest trading partner in Asia after China. In 2006, German imports from Japan totaled €15.6billion and German exports to Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due to the global financial crisis. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>trade</b> between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with imports from Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German exports to Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E
5|$|When the QIZ program {{came into}} being in 1996, {{observers}} regarded it {{as a vehicle to}} support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between Israel and the two Arab states (Jordan and Egypt) with which it had signed peace treaties. In both cases, however, a tenuous peace continues to prevail between Israel and the two Arab states. Since the conclusion of the JordanIsrael peace treaty in October 1994, large numbers of Jordanians, particularly fundamentalists, those of Palestinian origin, and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion of commercial relations. With the establishment of 13 QIZs in Jordan, there has been an increase in the volume of <b>bilateral</b> <b>trade,</b> though the overall totals remain modest.|$|E
40|$|This three-paper series {{deals with}} the {{dispatch}} of power networks under mixed pool/bilateral trading. The major questions examined are (i) to what degree does the relative level of pool versus <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> influence performance in terms of individual power levels, costs, prices, revenues and expenditures; (ii) what is the comparative performance of mixed trading with firm and nonfirm bilateral contracts under various curtailment strategies; and (iii) is the revenue derived from the pool and <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> consistent with the corresponding unbundled costs? The above issues are sequentially addressed {{in each of the}} three parts. The eventual goal of these results is to help generator and load-serving entities choose appropriate relative levels of pool versus <b>bilateral</b> <b>trades</b> while considering risk, economic performance, as well as physical constraints. This paper proposes a one-step optimal power flow model that dispatches the pool in combination with the privately negotiated bilateral contracts while minimizing cost and accounting for both losses and congestion. In part I, notions of pool/bilateral demand and generation as well as a number of technical and economic performance measures for each competing entity are defined. This dissection of total and individual financial measures according to pool or <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> allows the market participant to evaluate the profitability of each component of its chosen pool/bilateral mix. A number of simulation results illustrate the effect of varying the relative levels of pool/bilateral trading on the values of individual performance measures...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} naive {{traders in}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading.</b> These traders report their true types in direct mechanisms and bid/ask their values/costs in auctions. We show that by expropriating naive traders in direct mechanisms, the mechanism designer can subsidize additional trades by strategic traders and improve efficiency. In fact, complete expropriation of naive traders {{is a necessary}} condition for constrained efficiency. A significant implication is that in the presence of naive traders, ex-post individually rational mechanisms are not constrained efficient. In contrast, if the traders must use a given mechanism, then the introduction of naive traders has an ambiguous effect on efficiency. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> Naive traders Efficiency Ex-post individual rationality...|$|R

40|$|The market {{mechanisms}} {{built into the}} Kyoto Protocol have the potential of significantly reducing costs of limiting greenhouse gases. But if trading proceeds on a bilateral project-by-project basis rather than on a frictionless market, the total cost saving potential of trading is unclear. This paper provides the first attempt to explain market-level implications of <b>bilateral</b> CO 2 <b>trading</b> by developing a many-polluter cap-and-trade model where <b>bilateral</b> <b>trades</b> are coordinated by a time-taking matching process. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> entails frictions that alter the total number {{and the size of}} private trades, and the basic properties of the CO 2 market as a transfer-mechanism. Perhaps surprisingly, frictions can also increase, not only decrease, the size of private trades. A calibration using previous cost estimates of CO 2 reductions in the EU and economies in transition shows that frictions need not damage both sides of the market. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> game between a seller and a buyer who have private valuations for an indivisible good. The seller makes a price offer which the buyer can either accept or reject.

If the seller can not observe the valuation (if information is asymmetric), then the outcome must be inefficient, as is {{known from the}} Myerson-Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem. We embed this <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> game between a single buyer and a single seller into a matching market with a continuum of traders.

40|$|Simulation {{models and}} theory prove that {{emission}} trading converges to market equilibrium. This paper {{sets out to}} falsify these results using experimental economics. Three experiments are conducted for the six largest carbon emitting industrialized regions. Two experiments use auctions: the first single-bid auction and the second a Walrasian auction. The third relies on <b>bilateral,</b> sequential <b>trading.</b> The paper finds that, {{in line with the}} standard theory, both auctions and <b>bilateral,</b> sequential <b>trading</b> capture a significant part (88 to 99 percent) of the potential cost savings of emission trading. As expected from dynamic trade theory, all experiments show that the market price converges (although not fully) to the market equilibrium price. In contrast to the theory, the results also suggest that not all countries will gain from trading. In both the <b>bilateral</b> <b>trading</b> experiment and the Walrasian auction, one country will actually be worse off with <b>trade.</b> In particular, <b>bilateral,</b> sequential <b>trading</b> leads to a distribution of gains significantly different from the competitive market outcome.
