This provision is stated to be [...] "ithout prejudice to the generality of Article 12". Article 16(2) declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> not be any discrimination on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, eight teams participated, {{including}} Slovakia for {{the first}} time. The Canadian and American teams outscored opponents in the preliminary round by 41–2 and 31–1 margins, respectively. This brought on more criticism about uneven competition. IOC president Jacques Rogge said, [...] "There is a discrepancy there, everyone agrees with that. This is maybe the investment period in women's ice hockey. I would personally give them more time to grow <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be a period of improvement. We cannot continue without improvement." [...] Swedish team coach Peter Elander said {{it is hard for}} other nations to compete {{because of a lack of}} funding and a smaller pool of players to choose from. He said, [...] "The finances for all teams have to be the same. ... If you want to have a close tournament in Sochi (for the 2014 Olympics), have (comparable) national programs in all countries." [...] Some critics suggested that a mercy rule be implemented to prevent such lopsided scores. René Fasel said the IIHF would consider adding one. Chinese team coach Hannu Saintula, whose team was defeated 12–1 by the Americans, and American coach Mark Johnson, did not favor the idea.|$|E
500|$|Pond's {{article was}} viewed {{by some as}} a {{criticism}} of those in the Prairie School who overemphasized the horizontal over the vertical. [...] In this regard, Pond wrote:"In architectural composition, as in music, order is comprehended in rhythm. [...] Rhythm is expressed in the flow of part into part, of mass into mass, in the appearance and reappearance of certain proportions which are made to exist between the subordinate masses and between these masses and the dominant mass; between all the parts of the perfect whole. [...] Without order there is no architecture; without rhythmic composition no vital architecture can be. [...] That is the highest architecture in which rhythmic action of the structural forces becomes apparent. [...] Vertical forces in action, by the law of gravity, tend to work in right lines; horizontal forces, acted upon by this same law tend to work in curves. ... It is not enough that the rhythmic movement be in horizontal direction only, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be a rhythmic flow vertically as well. [...] The result of these combined movements should be that of unity -- simple in its effect though complex in its harmonies." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{common law}} rule from Great Britain permits {{searches}} incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule {{has been applied}} in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that [...] "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when [...] "there is no possibility" [...] that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that [...] "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been {{considered to be a}} strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation {{at the time of the}} arrest. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." [...] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the [...] "immediate control" [...] of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to [...] "modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," [...] and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain [...] "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{coverage}} in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts was banned for three matches for the offence. Roberts commented that this [...] "left [...] "a bitter taste" [...] – especially after England captain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales." [...] The Football Association said there was [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was [...] "despite his admission in The Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology." [...] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I do not want players to get suspensions and fines, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be consistency, regardless of who the player is."

2500|$|Cricket {{was played}} in 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China and 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. India skipped both times. There was further calls for {{subsequent}} Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation asked the ICC {{to participate in}} the 2014 and 2018 Commonwealth Games, but the ICC turned down the invitation. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee recognised cricket as a sport which could apply {{to be included in the}} Olympic Games, but in 2013 the ICC announced that it had no intentions to make such an application, primarily due to opposition from the [...] BCCI. ESPNcricinfo suggested that the opposition might be based on the possible loss of income. In April 2016, ICC [...] chief executive David Richardson said that Twenty20 cricket can have a chance of getting in for the 2024 Summer Games, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be collective support shown by the ICC's membership base, in particular from BCCI, in order for there to be a chance of inclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{element of}} Rylands {{is that the}} thing be {{something}} [...] "likely to do mischief if it escapes". Before Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council this {{did not have to}} be a dangerous item (see below); the risk was instead in its behaviour if it escapes. In Rylands the [...] "thing" [...] was water. Other examples are fire, as in Jones v Festiniog Railway, gas, as in Batchellor v Tunbridge Wells Gas Co, fumes, as in West v Bristol Tramways Co, and electricity, as in Hillier v Air Ministry. The extent of the [...] "thing"'s accumulation can also be considered, as in Mason v Levy, where it was not just the type of thing kept but the sheer amount which created the danger. It is essential for a Rylands claim that there be an escape of a dangerous thing [...] "from a place where the defendant has occupation of or control over land to a place which is outside his occupation or control". In Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd, an explosion in a munitions factory killed an inspector on the property. Rylands was held not to apply, because there was no escape. The dangerous thing that escapes does not always have to be the thing which was accumulated, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be a causal link. In Miles v Forest Rock Granite Co (Leicestershire) Ltd, explosives stored on the defendant's land led to the escape of rocks in a blast, and the defendant was found liable.|$|E
2500|$|Advisors counsel that {{applicants}} {{should meet}} deadlines, spend time researching colleges, be open-minded, have fun, communicate what [...] "resonates" [...] to the applicant {{about a particular}} school, not {{fall in love with}} one or two colleges, follow directions precisely and make sure to click the [...] "submit" [...] button. Rudeness towards staff members, feigning enthusiasm, and being pretentious are other turnoffs reported by admissions officers. There is strong consensus among counselors and advisors that starting the college search early is vital. One recommends starting early in the twelfth grade; another suggests that even this is too late, and that the process should begin during the eleventh grade and summer before twelfth grade. And sources suggest that students who begin the process earlier tend to earn more acceptance letters. Another advantage of beginning early is so that applications can be proofread for mistakes. Advisors suggest that emails should be sent to specific persons in the admissions office, not to a generalized inbox. Advisors suggest that applicants sending in paper applications should take care that handwriting is legible, particularly email addresses. Advisors counsel that mistakes or changes should be explained somewhere in the application; for example, an adviser at Grinnell College suggested that a record need not be perfect <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>must</b> be an [...] "explanation for any significant blip." [...] Advisors suggest that applicants should [...] "own up to any bad behavior" [...] such as suspensions since schools are [...] "dutybound to report them", and suggest that a person should [...] "accept responsibility and show contrition for [...] "lessons learned," [...] according to one view. Disciplinary actions are usually reported to the colleges by the high school as a matter of course. Advisors suggest that the application should help a student position themselves to create a unique picture. It helps, according to one advisor, if a person knows himself or herself, because that enables an applicant to communicate effectively with a prospective school. A report in the New York Times in 2016 suggested that some universities were considering changing their admissions guidelines to be more inclusive of less affluent applicants, to put less emphasis on standardized test and AP scores, and to put more emphasis on determining [...] "which students' community-service projects are heartfelt and which are merely window dressing"; the report suggested that college admissions policies were often [...] "cited as a culprit in sleep deprivation, anxiety and depression among students." ...|$|E
