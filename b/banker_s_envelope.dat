40|$|Clearly, a new {{agenda is}} {{emerging}} for private international banks. Political {{issues such as}} human rights {{seem to be a}} current concern. But what about democracy? What about political regimes? Are they taken into account by private banks when they decide whether to invest in a country? Put another way, do private banks have democratic political preferences? In this article, we focus on cross-border lending from international <b>bank(er)</b> <b>s.</b> The questions asked are as follows. Do <b>bank(er)</b> <b>s</b> react positively (that is by increasing their lending) when an emerging democracy appears? Do we witness increased bank lending after democratic transitions? Lastly, is there any relation between democratic consolidation and bank lending?...|$|R

5000|$|The Florence Mill, known {{later as}} the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Envelope</b> Building after being {{absorbed by the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>Envelope</b> Company, is a former {{industrial}} facility located at 121 West Main Street in the Rockville section of Vernon, Connecticut. It is a four story brick structure, more than 200 ft in length, with a Second Empire-style mansard roof and an Italianate tower. It was built in 1864 to replace an earlier textile mill which was destroyed by fire. [...] In 1881, it was described as the largest brick building in Rockville. After purchase by White & Corbin, the building was expanded and became the largest manufacturing plant {{of its kind in}} the United States. The building was used for the manufacture of envelopes until 1975. Currently, the building is used as an independent living retirement home and has 113 apartments.|$|R
50|$|Proteins that {{contribute}} to the overall structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (<b>S),</b> <b>envelope</b> (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In the specific case of the SARS coronavirus (see below), a defined receptor-binding domain on S mediates the attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Some coronaviruses (specifically the members of Betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).|$|R
40|$|We {{identified}} two novel naturally occurring mutations (W 74 L and L 77 R) {{in the small}} <b>S</b> <b>envelope</b> protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Mutation L 77 R alone resulted in > 10 -fold-reduced secretion of virions. In addition, the 2. 8 -fold reduction of the extracellular HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) of mutant L 77 R from transfected Huh 7 cells appeared to be correlated with a 1. 7 -fold reduction of intracellular HBsAg, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Surprisingly, opposite to the ELISA results, Western blot analysis revealed a near- 10 -fold-increased level of the intracellular mutant small <b>S</b> <b>envelope</b> protein. The discrepancy between ELISA and Western blot data was due to significant accumulation of the mutant L 77 R HBsAg in the intracellular pellet fraction. In contrast to HBsAg, the secretion of HBeAg was normal in L 77 R-transfected cells. The wild-type HBsAg was usually more diffuse and evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, often outside the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, as observed by immunofluorescence assay. In contrast, the L 77 R mutant HBsAg tends to be highly restricted within the ER and Golgi, often accumulated in the Golgi compartments distal from the nucleus. The almost exclusive retention in the ER-Golgi of L 77 R HBsAg was similar to what was observed when the large envelope protein was overexpressed. These multiple aberrant phenotypes of mutant L 77 R can be corrected by a second naturally occurring <b>S</b> <b>envelope</b> mutation, W 74 L. Despite the accumulation of L 77 R HBsAg in ER-Golgi of transfected Huh 7 cells, we detected no increase in Grp 78 mRNA and proteins, which are common markers for ER stress response...|$|R

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) is {{coated with}} large (L), middle (M), and small (<b>S)</b> <b>envelope</b> proteins encoded by coinfecting hepatitis B virus (HBV). To study {{the role of the}} HBV envelope proteins in the assembly and infectivity of HDV, we produced three types of recombinant particles in Huh 7 cells by transfection with HBV DNA and HDV cDNA: (i) particles with an <b>envelope</b> containing the <b>S</b> HBV <b>envelope</b> protein only, (ii) particles with an <b>envelope</b> containing <b>S</b> and M proteins, and (iii) particles with an <b>envelope</b> containing <b>S,</b> M, and L proteins. Although the resulting S-, SM-, and SML-HDV particles contained both hepatitis delta antigen and HDV RNA, only particles coated with all three envelope proteins (SML) showed evidence of infectivity in an in vitro culture system susceptible to HDV infection. We concluded that the L HBV envelope protein, and more specifically the pre-S 1 domain, is important for infectivity of HDV particles and that the M protein, which has been reported to bear a site for binding to polymerized albumin in the pre-S 2 domain, is not sufficient for infectivity. Our data also show that the helper HBV is not required for initiation of HDV infection. The mechanism by which the L protein may affect HDV infectivity is discussed herein...|$|R

30|$|This {{variation}} {{noted in}} oxygen surface groups is further confirmed upon observing the XPS results of O 1 s. In the first place, {{there was a}} significant increase in the atomic percent of oxygen (Table 1) after oxidizing the originally prepared CNTs. This oxygen content is strongly reduced after reacting OCNT with the amine due to the formation of the corresponding amide. This provides insight into the type of interaction existing between acidic oxygen groups and basic amine. This could be further elucidated after deconvolution of the O 1 <b>s</b> <b>envelope</b> into three peaks [10]. There was a noticeable decrease (to almost half its initial value) in the COOH peak (at about 534.4 eV) when comparing ACNT with OCNT, which suggests acid/base reaction to form water and the amide function. The nitrogen functional group at ACNT is further confirmed by the presence of a N 1 s peak at 399.9 eV.|$|R
