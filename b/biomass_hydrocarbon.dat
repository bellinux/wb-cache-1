40|$|Production of {{hydrocarbons}} and biofuels from microalgae is {{an emerging}} field that shows {{great potential for}} carbon neutral production. The green alga Botryococcus braunii is widely recognized as a potential carbon-neutral source of hydrocarbons and biofuels. However {{a number of issues}} hamper its commercial development including, low growth rates and <b>biomass</b> production, low <b>hydrocarbon</b> yield, problems associated with scaling up of production, harvesting of biomass, and recovery of hydrocarbons and/or biofuel. This study addressed these issues using a series of laboratory-scale and large-scale experiments. Examination of the effects of three growth-media on <b>biomass</b> and <b>hydrocarbon</b> production in two B. braunii Race-B strains, Kossou- 4 and Overjuyo- 3, previously reported to produce high yields of hydrocarbons including triterpenoids showed that growth of B. braunii in Blue-green- 11 medium (BG 11) resulted in significantly higher biomass (dry-weight) compared to Jaworski&rsquo;s medium (JM) and Bold-base- 3 -nitrogen medium (BBM- 3 N) after 15 days for both strains. Oil production was also significantly higher in BG 11 whether measured as oil weight or absorbance. Examination of the effects of nutrients (nitrogen, iron) and environmental conditions (temperature, light intensity, photoperiod) on <b>biomass</b> and <b>hydrocarbon</b> production in Kossou- 4 and Overjuyo- 3 grown in BG 11 showed highest biomass and oil production was obtained at nitrogen concentration 750 mg l- 1, iron concentration 6 mg l- 1, 25 oC, and 135 &mu;mol m- 2 s- 1 with photoperiod of 16 h light/ 8 h dark. Culturing the strains in modified BG 11 containing optimized nutrients resulted in up to ~ 10. 6 fold increase in biomass from 0. 16 g l- 1 and 0. 31 g l- 1 in normal BG 11 to 1. 74 g l- 1 and 2. 17 g l- 1 in optimized BG 11 and growth conditions for Kossou- 4 and Overjuyo- 3 respectively. This was accompanied by ~ 8 - 10 fold increase in oil production compared to that in normal BG 11, with final oil yields of 264. 2 mg l- 1 (Kossou- 4) and 220. 6 mg l- 1 (Overjuyo- 3). Growth of Overjuyo- 3 and Kossou- 4 in 500 L open tanks with 24 h light (54 &mu;mol photons m- 2 s- 1) at 25 &deg;C in modified BG 11 for 60 days were then carried out. Maximum growth was reached after 40 days with Overjuyo- 3 producing more biomass (3. 05 g l- 1) than Kossou- 4 (2. 55 g l- 1). However, Kossou- 4 produced more hydrocarbons (29 % of dry weight) compared to Overjuyo- 3 (20 % of dry weight). The final stage investigated the feasibility of harvesting large-scale B. braunii using co-culture with a fungus to induce flocculation. Co-culture with the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus resulted in a flocculation efficiency of over 90 % through co-pelletisation with both Overjuyo- 3 and Kossou- 4. Investigation of the ratio of fungus to algal broth found that 1 : 40 was optimal, resulting in large-scale flocculation efficiencies of 97 % for Kossou- 4 and 98 % for Overjuyo- 3 after 12 h following inoculation. To determine the effects of co-culture with A. fumigatus potential energy yields, pyrolysis was conducted. Proximate analysis showed the proportions of bio-oil, bio-char and bio-gas were very similar for the pure Kossou- 4 biomass and the co-cultured pellets resulting from harvest using A. fumigatus. Similar results were found for Overjuyo- 3 confirming that the co-culture harvest method did not compromise the end product.

A credible option for the production of sustainable biodiesel or biojetfuels could be microalgae oils.

Indeed, the same species includes strains producing a high chimio-diversity of hydrocarbons, strains therefore classified into four races.

Methanol reacts on acidic zeolite catalysts via an indirect “hydrocarbon-pool” mechanism to form {{a wide variety of}} hydrocarbons including light olefins, gasoline-range hydrocarbons, and aromatics. The hydrocarbon-pool mechanism involves two reaction cycles simultaneously operating inside the zeolite pores: an olefins-based reaction cycle and an aromatics-based reaction cycle.

Quantifying the relative propagation of these two catalytic cycles and understanding how these cycles contribute to the overall product distribution under varying reaction conditions, varying feed composition, and on different zeolite topologies or morphologies, is critical for developing structure-function relationships for MTH catalysts. In this work, the effects of independently varying (i) the feed composition (by co-feeding hydrocarbons or oxygenates), (ii) the concentration of active sites (by changing the chemical composition of the zeolite), and (iii) the diffusion characteristics of the zeolite (by changing the crystallite size or silylating the external surface), on the relative rates of propagation of the aromatics- and olefins-based cycles, and consequentially on the observed MTH product selectivity are presented...|$|R

Straw from rye, representing C 3 grasses and maize, representing C 4 grasses, was charred in the presence of limited oxygen at 300, 400 and 500 °C. Typical n-alkane distribution patterns with a strong predominance of long chain odd-numbered n-alkanes maximising at C 31 were observed in raw straw. Upon combustion at 300 °C aliphatic hydrocarbons in char were dominated by sterenes, whereas at 400 °C sterenes disappeared and medium chain length n-alkanes, maximising around n-C 20, with a balanced odd/even distribution were present. At a charring temperature of 500 °C n-alkane chain length shifted to short chain homologues, maximising at C 18 with a pronounced predominance of even homologues. Even numbered, short chain n-alkanes in soils may thus serve as a marker for residues of charred <b>biomass.</b> Aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> indicate an onset of aromatization of biomass already at 300 °C, followed by severe aromatization upon incomplete combustion at 400 – 500 °C. The diagnostic composition of aliphatic and aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> from charred <b>biomass</b> affords potential for identifying residues from burned vegetation in recent and fossil soils and sediments...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{react to}} biotic and abiotic {{stresses}} {{with a variety}} of responses including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in programmed cell death (PCD). The mechanisms underlying ROS production and PCD have not been well studied in microalgae. Here, we analyzed ROS accumulation, <b>biomass</b> accumulation, and <b>hydrocarbon</b> production in the colony-forming green microalga Botryococcus braunii in response to several stress inducers such as NaCl, NaHCO 3, salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate, and acetic acid. We also identified and cloned a single cDNA for the B. braunii ortholog of the Arabidopsis gene defender against cell death 1 (DAD 1), a gene that is directly involved in PCD regulation. The function of B. braunii DAD 1 was assessed by a complementation assay of the yeast knockout line of the DAD 1 ortholog, oligosaccharyl transferase 2. Additionally, we found that DAD 1 transcription was induced in response to SA at short times. These results suggest that B. braunii responds to stresses by mechanisms similar to those in land plants and other  organisms...|$|R
40|$|To improve biomass and microalgal oil {{production}} of Botryococcus braunii, fed-batch culture {{was investigated in}} an airlift photobioreactor. The optimal feeding time of the fed-batch culture was after 15 days of cultivation, where 1. 82 ?g/L of the microalgal biomass was obtained in the batch culture. Nitrate nutrient was the restrictive factor for the fed-batch cultivation while phosphate nutrient with high concentration {{did not affect the}} microalgal growth. The optimal mole ratio of nitrate to phosphate was 34. 7 : 1, where nitrate concentration reached the initial level and phosphate concentration was one quarter of its initial level. With one feeding, the biomass of B. braunii reached 2. 56 ?g/L after 18 days. Two feedings in 2 -day interval enhanced the biomass production up to 2. 87 ?g/L after 19 days of cultivation. The hydrocarbon content in dry biomass of B. braunii kept at high level of 64. 3 % w/w. Compared with the batch culture, <b>biomass</b> production and <b>hydrocarbon</b> productivity of B. braunii were greatly improved by the strategic fed-batch cultivation...|$|R
40|$|The immobilized biofilm {{cultivation}} was {{a promising}} method to greatly improve the biomass productivity of microalga Botryococcus braunii, which was considered as an feedstock of renewable biofuel. In this research, {{the effects of}} different nitrogen sources and supply methods on growth and hydrocarbon production of B. braunii under immobilized biofilm cultivation (attached cultivation) were studied. Of the total 5 different nitrogen sources, NaNO 3 {{was selected as the}} best one with which the high <b>biomass</b> productivity and <b>hydrocarbon</b> productivity of 6. 45 g m(- 2) d(- 1) and 2. 79 g m(- 2) d(- 1) were obtained respectively. The optimized nitrogen concentration was 0. 99 mM for non-circulating medium supply model, while for the circulating model, the optimized nitrogen concentration as well as medium volume was 1. 49 mM and 1. 2 L, respectively. Furthermore, nitrogen inputs based on growth of 1 kg dry algae biomass was only 28. 92 g with circulating model. Attached cultivation was high efficient in light, nutrient and water utilization.

40|$|The green alga Botryococcus braunii is {{regarded}} as a potential source of renewable fuel due to its high lipid and hydrocarbon contents. However, the slow growth rate damaged its feasibility for biofuel production. In this study, a novel method of 'attached cultivation' was introduced to incubate B. braunii FACHB 357 (B race). A high biomass productivity of 6. 5 g m(- 2) d(- 1) was achieved in single layer attached system at early stage of cultivation. At day 10, the <b>biomass,</b> lipid and <b>hydrocarbon</b> productivities were 5. 5, 2. 34 and 1. 06 g m(- 2) d(- 1), respectively. Under nitrogen starvation condition, both of the contents of lipid and hydrocarbon were increased, whereas the profile of hydrocarbon kept almost unchanged, while the content for oleic acid (18 : 1) increased and linolenic acid (18 : 3) decreased. With a multi-layer photobioreactor, a biomass productivity of 49. 1 g m(- 2) d(- 1) or a photosynthetic efficiency of 14. 9 % (visible light) were obtained under continuous illumination of 500 mu mol m(- 2) s(- 1).

40|$|In this paper, {{cost-benefit}} analysis is performed to compare eight different hydrogen production technologies using the classical analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the Fuzzy AHP. The technologies considered are steam methane reforming, coal gasification, partial oxidation of <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>biomass</b> gasification, photovoltaic-based electrolysis, wind-based electrolysis, hydro-based electrolysis, and water splitting by chemical looping. For {{each of the}} hydrogen production technologies, five criteria are used for evaluation: greenhouse gas emissions, raw material and utilities consumption, energy efficiency, scalability, as well as waste disposal and atmospheric emissions. The results obtained for benefits category using AHP and Fuzzy AHP are plotted against the normalized equivalent annual costs of each technology. It is concluded that the fossil fuel based processes appear to have less beneficial qualities including greater environmental impacts, but are more cost-effective. On the other hand, the renewable based processes appear to have more benefits {{as well as being}} more expensive for hydrogen production. However, the {{cost-benefit analysis}} results imply that the process of water splitting by chemical looping among the renewable approaches is the most promising new technology.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} petroleum phytoremediation enhancement by plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR), specifically the correlation between petroleum hydrocarbon fractions and bacterial community structure affected by remediation and PGPR inocula. Aged petroleum contaminated soil was remediated by tall fescue (Testuca arundinacea L.) inoculated with two PGPR strains. Hydrocarbon degradation was measured by GC-MS (Gas-chromatography Mass-spectrometer) based on carbon fraction numbers (C 8 -C 34). Changes in bacterial community structure were analyzed by high-throughput pyrosequencing of 16 s rRNA. PGPR inoculation increased tall fescue <b>biomass</b> and petroleum <b>hydrocarbons</b> were removed in all the treatments. Maximum hydrocarbon removal, particular high molecular weight (C 21 -C 34) aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), was observed in tall fescue inoculated with PGPR. The relative abundance of phyla gamma-proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased after different treatments compared with controls. Moreover, a bacterial guild mainly comprising the genera Lysobacter, Pseudoxanthomonas, Planctomyces, Nocardioides, Hydrogenophaga, Ohtaekwangia was found to be positively correlated with C 21 -C 34 petroleum hydrocarbons fractions removal by RDA analysis, implying that petroleum degradation was unrelated to bacterial community diversity but positively correlated with specific petroleum degraders and biosurfactant producers.
