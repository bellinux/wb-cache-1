30|$|Barium {{chromate}} (BaCrO 4), first synthesised and analysed by Vauquelin, {{resulted from}} adding {{a solution of}} barium nitrate to a chromate or dichromate (e.g. sodium or potassium) solution [1]. Barium chloride may {{also be used as}} an alternative source of barium [2, 13]. Throughout the 19 th century, barium chromate was known under several different names including: <b>barium</b> <b>yellow,</b> lemon yellow, ultramarine yellow, baryta yellow and Steinbühl yellow [2, 14].|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was {{analytical}} investigations of Egyptian paintings, mainly Coptic icons and Islamic wooden ceilings, dating from 1300 - 1900 using multiinstrumental techniques. Twenty three Coptic icons and three wooden ceilings dated from different periods and painted by different painters in case of icons were examined. The materials used including pigments, media, varnishes, ground layers and gold layers. The surface stratigraphy of paint samples, their layered structured and the composition of materials used in each layer were analysed. Variations in painting techniques, pigments palettes, paint media and varnishes applied in Egyptian paintings according to painters, time and type of paintings were revealed. A total of twenty-eight organic and inorganic pigments were identified in this study, of which nine have never been previously included {{as a part of the}} Egyptian pigment palettes, namely; smalt, lapis lazuli, indigo, pararealgar, Prussian blue, chrome yellow, <b>barium</b> <b>yellow,</b> barium white and hydromagnesite. The identification of hydromagnesite, which has never been to date considered as a pigment either in Egypt or elsewhere and the identification of smalt from the mid- 14 th century, whose reported earliest large scale use was in the 16 th century. Two types of resins were identified as a constituent of the oil/resin varnish applied on Coptic icons of which Venice turpentine has been identified for the first time as an ingredient of Egyptian varnishes. The identification of mosaic gold in an 18 th C. icon, a novel usage of dammar resin and the multilayered structure of the white ground layers were revealed.

30|$|Four {{brightly colored}} calligraphic prints from the “Poem” series (1970 / 71) by Japanese artist Haku Maki (1924 – 2000) were {{examined}} using multiple light-based analytical techniques {{in an effort}} to address conservation concerns regarding these artworks. A distracting white haze on the surface of some of the prints was determined by light microscopy and infrared microanalysis to be fungal mycelium from an inactive mold infestation that occurred prior to the artwork’s acquisition by the museum. Pigment analysis by Raman, X-ray fluorescence, and infrared microspectroscopies identified the artist’s palette as containing common printing ink colors such as aniline black (PBk 1), carbon black (PBk 7), phthalocyanine blue (PB 15), Prussian blue (PB 27), ultramarine blue (PB 29), molybdate orange (PR 104), chrome yellow (PY 34), <b>barium</b> <b>yellow</b> (PY 31), viridian (PG 17), barium sulphate (PW 21), and synthetic organic red pigments (PR 3, PR 22, PR 48 : 3). Although aniline black and molybdate orange are common industrial pigments, reference vibrational spectra to assist in their identification have not appeared previously in the conservation literature. Moreover, this investigation includes to the authors’ knowledge the first published identification of these pigments in a work of fine art. Haku Maki’s unique ‘cement-on-woodblock’ printing technique in combination with his vibrant palette creates dynamic, embossed effects in these prints. However, lightfastness testing using a microfade tester identified the potential for light-based damage to the artwork, in some instances showing poorer lightfastness for colors reported to be stable pigments and greater stability than anticipated for others. These analyses are the first objective study of this innovative artist’s material choices, and they enhance our understanding of his printing technique while helping to determine the proper stewardship protocols to protect his artistic legacy.|$|E

30|$|In {{previous}} publications, {{the authors}} have demonstrated the unique value of the Winsor & Newton (W&N) 19 th century archive database for providing efficient access to records covering the commercial preparation of 19 th century artists’ materials [23, 24]. Following the methodology established {{for the study of}} W&N’s lead chromate yellow pigments [25], this paper investigates the preparation and chemistry of barium, zinc and strontium chromate pigments. During the 19 th century, these pigments were sold by W&N under the trade names Lemon <b>Yellow</b> (<b>barium</b> chromate), Citron <b>Yellow</b> (zinc potassium chromate) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate). According to Carlyle, who studied the powders and oil colours available in the W&N 19 th century catalogues, the first was listed in c. 1835 while the latter two appeared {{for the first time in}} a catalogue from c. 1861. Strontian Yellow last appeared in a catalogue from c. 1896 [5].|$|R
30|$|The pigment {{composition}} {{in the production}} records is in agreement with W&N’s declaration of their pigment compositions from 18921 where Lemon Yellow is described as chromate of <b>barium</b> and Citron <b>Yellow</b> is given as chromate of zinc. On the other hand, it is notable that Strontian Yellow {{is not included in}} W&N’s 1892 declaration. Its absence is likely because it was considered too fugitive for W&N and may explain why there are so few records for the production of strontium chromate. Evidence for this assumption appears in a book belonging to Arthur Henry Newton (son of W&N’s founder Henry Charles Newton). Associated with a recipe for a physical mixture of Lemon <b>Yellow</b> (<b>barium</b> chromate) with Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate) which appears under the name: “Strontian Yellow: No. 2 for Oil”, dated 23 / 11 / 1859, is a note: “In Father’s opinion this is a much safer color to use in oil than Chromate of Strontia” (W&N Database Unique Recipe Code: P 2 P 264 AL 07). In W&N’s 1892 declaration, this physical mixture appears under the name Primrose Yellow and is described as “similar in colour to the old ‘Strontian Yellow’ (Chromate of Strontium) but keeps its colour better”. Despite this observation both Citron Yellow and Primrose Yellow were nevertheless designated fugitive in oil in W&N’s 1892 declaration, with only Lemon Yellow considered permanent in oil. Interestingly, this is contrary to the position of Jehan-Georges Vibert, a 19 th century authority on painting materials and supplier as well as consultant to the 19 th century artists’ colourman Lefranc & Co. [3, 5]. He placed strontium chromate in a list of permanent or “good” pigments, together with zinc chromate whereas barium chromate belonged to the list of “bad” pigments (he declared lead chromate pigments “more or less bad”) [26].|$|R
40|$|A new sorbent material, <b>barium</b> sulfate-Direct Blending <b>Yellow</b> D- 3 RNL hybrid (BSD), was {{synthesized}} and {{characterized by}} various methods. Both the anionic dyes, Reactive Brilliant Red X- 3 B and Weak Acid Green GS were hardly adsorbed by the BSD material, while the sorption of Ethyl Violet (EV) and Victoria Blue B were extremely obvious. The sorption of cationic dyes obeyed the Langmuir isotherm model, which {{depended on the}} electric charge attraction. The saturation amount of EV adsorbed onto the BSD material approached to 39. 36 mg/g. The sorption of EV changed little with pH from 3 to 12 while it increased with increasing levels of electrolyte. A dye wastewater sampled from Jinjiang Chemicals was treated, and the color removal rate {{was more than the}} COD removal rate. In addition, the cationic dye-BSD sludge was utilized as a colorant fill-in coating. The light stability and thermal stability of the colorant was measured and exhibited good features. This work provided a simple and eco-friendly method for dye wastewater treatment with recycling of waste...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical characterisation {{of a series}} of paintings authored by Giorgio Marini (1836 - 1905) from the Museum of Évora. Marini was an Italian painter who lived in Portugal in the 19 th century. He was a very prolific painter and his works, most of them portraits commissioned by urban and rural bourgeois and noble elites, are dispersed all over the country. The general good conservation state of most paintings prevented the collection of micro-samples for detailed study. Hence, material identification of the painting materials was performed primarily by XRF, given its non-destructive and non-invasive nature, and it was complemented when possible by auxiliary techniques optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM-EDX. Pigments and fillers such as yellow and red ochre, lead white, zinc white, <b>barium</b> white, chrome <b>yellow</b> and green chrome are among the identified pigments. This is the first time the palette used by Giorgio Marini was identified, helping to characterised the pigments used by foreign painters during the 19 th century in Portuga...|$|R
30|$|Access to the {{production}} records from W&N’s 19 th century archive database {{made it possible to}} carry out a comprehensive study of their manufacturing processes for yellow chromate pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). One hundred and three production records were found for the manufacture of Lemon <b>Yellow</b> (<b>barium</b> chromate, 69 %), Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate, 25 %) and Strontian Yellow (strontium chromate, 6 %). The majority covers the period between 1838 and 1871. Analysis of W&N’s production records indicates that one main synthetic pathway was found for each pigment. The pH was a key factor controlled by W&N to achieve precipitation of zinc potassium and strontium chromate pigments. There was no evidence that extenders were added during the synthesis of these pigments, whereas their production records for lead chromates do show the addition of extenders [25]. The lack of extenders for these pigments may infer that for W&N, extenders were primarily present to adjust physical properties, tinting strength or hue, rather than functioning predominantly as a means to reduce the cost of materials. The relative tinting strength (TS) of these pigments is lower than pure lead chromate pigments. It was calculated in comparison to pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4,) which was assigned a TS of 100 %. This resulted in a TS of 92 % for barium, 78 % for strontium and 65 % for zinc potassium chromate pigments.|$|R
