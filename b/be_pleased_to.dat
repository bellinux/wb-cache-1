Everlasting thanks be ascribed unto Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast preserved Thy servant from the dangers of the seas, and from the plague and pestilence which have caused the land to mourn. The violence of man has also been restrained, and Thy providential care by night and by day has been exercised over Thine unworthy servant.

[...] In 1924, they pressured Greenfield to resign so Brownlee could replace him; Brownlee scuppered the plot by warning that Greenfield's resignation would be accompanied by his own. [...] A second attempt in 1925 was successful when Wood intervened to convince Brownlee to accept the premiership and Greenfield assured him that he would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> be rid of it.

He {{anchored}} the ship just off Staten Island, where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother-in-law, in which she wrote: [...] "Tell Arthur I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him, and will try to remember anything that happens on the voyage which he would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> hear."

[...] Molnár stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt Liliom as beautifully as they had modified Green Grow the Lilacs into Oklahoma!, he would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> have them do it. [...] The Guild obtained the rights from Molnár in October 1943. [...] The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for [...] "personal services". [...] The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Molnár permit them to make changes in the plot. [...] At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded. [...] Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, [...] "we could never have made Carousel." ...|$|E

[...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} {{have to think that}} hard {{to keep up with the}} Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing."

500|$|The Rhodesian press {{reported}} {{extensively on}} the Lisbon controversy {{during the second half}} of August, generally predicting that neither Britain, Portugal nor Rhodesia would back down. While most reporters believed that Whitehall would take a strong line, few could see any way it could actually stop Reedman from taking office. On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in Lagos, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he would <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in Gwelo on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it [...] "incredible". His administration had not even considered a declaration of independence then, he said, but it was contemplated now, and he believed Anglo-Rhodesian relations were at their all-time lowest ebb. He urged Britain to return to the bargaining table quickly.|$|E
500|$|The LDS Church {{defended the}} {{legitimacy}} of the book by contending that these scholars' methods were faulty. Perhaps most notably, LDS apologists argued that, because many of the Egyptian experts had claimed that the facsimiles were reminiscent of similar documents, or that certain areas on the facsimiles appeared different from known funerary texts, these scholars were merely ignoring potentially key differences in the facsimiles so that their arguments might seem effective. Such a line of reasoning is exemplified by a note written by Church historian B. H. Roberts: [...] "Yes, or some other change might be suggested, and by such a process some other meaning may be read into the place and make it different from the translation of Joseph Smith." [...] The Church eventually hired one Robert C. Webb (the pen name of J. E. Homans), to defend the veracity of the Book of Abraham. In his 1915 work The Case Against Mormonism (in which he claimed to have a PhD, despite this being a deception), he collected several interpretations of Facsimile No. 1 from Egyptologists that sounded unrelated to the layperson (i.e. that the facsimile represented: [...] "an embalming", [...] "the Resurrection of Osiris", or [...] "Anubis guarding the embalmed mummy") and claimed: [...] "If any of these Egyptologists is right, therefore, this drawing must have been radically altered in several essential particulars. In view of their disagreements, {{it will be necessary to}} demonstrate any conclusions drawn. Will some learned person <b>be</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> tell us what this scene represents? Otherwise, how can we condemn Joseph Smith for 'fraud' ?" ...|$|E
