50|$|Sutton had a {{good deal}} of {{experience}} dealing with Energy and Environment issues through her participation in the House Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. In the realm of energy, Sutton supported the company BASF in its pursuit of more advanced lithium-ion <b>battery.</b> <b>Support</b> also went towards the production of this battery from a facility in Elyria, bringing technology jobs back to the locals. Lithium-ion batteries are used in hybrid and electric can and have to power to increase reusable energy across the nation. Another energy achievement made in district 13 was the Cash for Clunkers legislation. This specific legislation created a 58% improvement in fuel efficiency. Cars brought in averaged 15.8 MPG while the new cars that were bought as a replacement averaged 24.9 MPG. These roughly 10 miles to every gallon saved helped to keep our environment a little more clean, even if it seems small. In issues dealing with environment the Congresswoman demonstrated numerous times her ideals on protecting the natural resources and national parks we have. One of the ways Ms. Sutton demonstrated her position on environment was through her acquisition of over 630 acres of undeveloped land {{to be added to the}} Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP). With the new addition to the CVNP it was ensured that the lands would be able to continue untouched for years to come.|$|E

50|$|Six torpedoes {{fired by}} Ghazi are avoided by S21 through simple depth {{changing}} manoeuvers. Ghazi by now has depleted its aft torpedoes. After Ghazi's sixth aft torpedo is fired, the critically damaged S21 dives to 350m {{so that it}} is no longer within Ghazi's sonar range. This is despite the S21 being only designed for a maximum of 250m depth. S21 also has very limited <b>battery</b> <b>support</b> for it to stay hidden from Ghazi. Captain Razak also decides to play the waiting game, although he is not aware of S21's dire situation. With time running out, Arjun decides to instigate Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by 180 degrees so that it can use it's bow torpedoes. Unknown to Razak, with this manoeuver Ghazi is now inside S21's extremely restricted aft torpedoes firing path. However, S21's aft torpedoes by now only can be launched manually due to Compartment 1 being totally flooded. Arjun, decides to dive into Compartment 1 to manually trigger the torpedoes, knowing that he might drown in the process. Arjun dives into Compartment 1 and successfully triggers an aft torpedo. Ghazi also launches its bow torpedo at the same time. The Ghazi torpedo misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by S21 aft torpedo and disintegrates in water, thus ending the stand-off. Arjun is later saved alive from the flooded Compartment 1. The movie ends with XO Devraj waving the national flag on a surfaced S21, signalling an Indian Navy Vessel. The epilogue indicates that the day after the Ghazi incident, Pakistani fighters bomb Indian airfields, marking the beginning of the 1971 Indo-Pak war for liberation of Bangladesh.|$|E
5000|$|Paper {{can be used}} in {{lithium-ion}} batteries as regular, commercial paper, or paper enhanced with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Enhanced paper is used as the electrode and as the separator which results in a sturdy, flexible battery that have great performance capabilities such as good cycling, great efficiency, and good reversibility. Using paper as a separator is more effective than using plastic. The process of enhancing the paper, however, can be complicated and costly, depending on the materials used. A carbon nanotube and silver nanowire film can be used to coat regular paper to create a simpler and less expensive separator and <b>battery</b> <b>support.</b> The conductive paper {{can also be used to}} replace traditionally used metallic chemicals. The resulting battery performs well, while simplifying the manufacturing process and reducing the cost. Lithium-ion paper batteries are flexible, durable, rechargeable, and produce significantly more power than electrochemical batteries. In spite of these advantages, there are still some drawbacks. In order for paper to be integrated with the Li-ion battery, complex layering and insulating techniques are required for the battery to function as desired. One reason these complex techniques are used is to strengthen the paper used so that it does not tear as easily. This contributes to the overall strength and flexibility of the battery. These techniques require time, training, and costly materials. Additionally, the individual materials required are not environmentally friendly and require specific disposal procedures. Paper {{lithium-ion batteries}} would be best suited for applications requiring a substantial amount of energy over an extended period of time. [...] Lithium-ion paper batteries can be composed of carbon nanotubes and a cellulose based membrane and produce good results, but at a high price tag. Other researchers have been successful using carbon paper manufactured from pyrolyzed filter paper. The paper is inserted in between the electrode and cathode.The use of a carbon paper as an interlayer in Li-S batteries improves the batteries efficiency and capacity. The carbon paper increases the contact area between the cathode and the electrode which allows for greater flow of electrons. The pores in the paper allow the electrons to travel easily while preventing the anode and the cathode from being in contact with one another. This translates into greater output, battery capacity and cycle stability; these are improvements to conventional Li-S batteries. The carbon paper is made from pyrolyzed filter paper which is inexpensive to make and performs like multi-walled carbon nanotube paper used as a battery.|$|E

The commercial success of these products greatly depends on the duration of the <b>battery</b> <b>support.</b> In order to consume minimal energy during power-up, sleep, idle and underloaded conditions, many Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a technique based on the resource reservation paradigm. The paradigm is extended to cope with shared resources and critical sections. The bandwidth reserved to each task is controlled by means of a predictor and a feedback algorithm. Taking into account the total utilization factor demand for the processor the frequency and voltage are scaled to keep the overall bandwidth close to 100 %. 1...|$|E

40|$|A novel, fully {{decentralized}} {{strategy to}} coordinate charge operation of electric vehicles is proposed in this paper. Based on stochastic switching control of on-board chargers, this strategy ensures high-efficiency charging, reduces load variations to the grid during charging periods, achieves charge completion with high probability, and accomplishes approximate “valley-filling”. Further improvements on the core strategy, including individualized power management, adaptive strategies, and <b>battery</b> <b>support</b> systems, {{are introduced to}} further reduce power fluctuation variances and to guarantee charge completion. Stochastic analysis is performed to establish the main properties of the strategies and to quantitatively show the performance improvements. Compared with the existing decentralized charging strategies, the strategies proposed in this paper can be implemented without any information exchange between grid operators and electric vehicles (EVs), resulting in a communications cost reduction. Additionally, it is shown that by using stochastic charging rules, a grid-supporting battery system with a very small energy capacity can achieve substantial reduction of EV load fluctuations with high confidence.

30|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) {{has been}} celebrated {{for the past}} decade as a {{photonic}} material, owing to the wide band gap, high exciton binding energy, and availability of large bulk single crystals [1 – 4]. Recently, a series of rationally designed nanogenerators (NGs) with piezoelectric ZnO nanowires (NWs) has shown great potential to convert tiny and irregular mechanical energy into electricity [5 – 7]. The operating mechanism of the electric generator relies on the unique coupling of the piezoelectric and semiconducting properties of ZnO as well as the gating effect of the Schottky barrier formed between the metal tip and the NWs [8, 9]. Based on this mechanism, the NGs constructed from ZnO NWs for harvesting energy from a small-scale dynamic muscle movement, including human finger tapping and the body movement of a hamster, have been developed [10]. This energy could power nanodevices without any battery requirement. The development of wireless nanodevices and nanosystems is of critical importance for bio-sensing, medical science, defence technology and different electronic devices. Furthermore, it is also an essential requirement for implanted biomedical devices, such as biosensors, that they can be self-powered without any <b>battery</b> <b>support.</b> Wireless medical devices may allow in situ, real-time biomedical monitoring and detection [11, 12].|$|E
