Since convertible bond is a hybrid of bond and equity, the conversion feature is known to have profound impact on duration and convexity. In this thesis, I develop a two-factor pricing model for coupon bearing defaultable convertible <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> stock price and interest rate as the stochastic state variables, where the arrival of default is modeled as a Poisson process. By using the bond price as the numeraire, the pricing formulation is reduced to an one-dimensional model. I manage to derive analytic expressions for the bond value, duration, convexity and other Greeks. The value of convertible bond is found to decrease with correlation coefficient between stock price and risk-free bond value. The impact of short rate volatility on convertible value appears to be ambiguous and depends on the correlation coefficient. My analysis also reveals that the duration of convertible <b>bond</b> increases <b>with</b> <b>coupon</b> rate and decreases with default intensity and there is concave relationship between duration and dividend yield. In addition, the convexity of convertible <b>bond</b> decreases <b>with</b> stock price and delta of convertible <b>bond</b> decreases <b>with</b> <b>coupon</b> rate...|$|R

40|$|The main {{problems}} facing annuity providers relate to adverse selection and mortality risk, the {{risk associated with}} mortality improvements, and to interest rate, reinvestment and in¯ation risk. Annuity providers hedge these risks, wherever possible, by holding suitable matching assets against their annuity liabilities: for example, riskless (government) ®xedincome bonds are used to provide the payments on level annuities, and index-linked bonds are needed if index-linked annuities are to be serviced effectively. However, {{in the absence of}} suitable matching assets, providers are unable to hedge the risks associated with mortality effectively and compensate for this by imposing substantial cost loadings. They also face reinvestment risk if available assets are of insuf®cient duration. Annuitants face interest rate risk prior to purchase and, since most of them prefer the higher initial income from a level annuity compared with an indexed annuity, in¯ation risk after purchase. Some solutions to these problems are considered, including a planned programme of phased annuity purchases to hedge interest rate risk, limited price index bonds to partially hedge in¯ation risk, and survivor (or indexed life) <b>bonds,</b> <b>with</b> <b>coupons</b> declining in direct proportion to the realized mortality of a selected group of annuitants, to hedge mortality risk.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to generalize the comprehensive structural model for defaultable fixed income bonds (considered in [1]) into a comprehensive unified model of structural and reduced form models. Here we consider the one factor model and the two factor model. In the one factor model the bond holders receive the deterministic coupon at predetermined coupon dates and the face value (debt) and the coupon at the maturity as well as the effect of government taxes which are paid on the proceeds of an investment in bonds is considered under constant short rate. In the two factor model the bond holders receive the stochastic coupon (discounted value of that at the maturity) at predetermined coupon dates and the face value (debt) and the coupon at the maturity as well as the effect of government taxes which are paid on the proceeds of an investment in bonds is considered under stochastic short rate. The expected default event occurs when the equity value is not enough to pay coupon or debt at the coupon dates or maturity and unexpected default event can occur at the first jump time of a Poisson process with the given default intensity provided by a step function of time variable. We consider the model and pricing formula for equity value and using it calculate expected default barrier.

The analysis yields credit spread curves similar to corporate credit curves: For high risk issuers, i. e.,sovereign with low country wealth relative to debt level,and high litigation costs,the credit spread curves are “hump ”-shaped. Better quality issues exhibit increasing credit spread curves. The numerical analysis with reasonable parameters yields credit spreads of a size compatible to market spreads. A comparison to corporate debt supports the stylized fact that, using the same parameters,corporate debt is less risky than sovereign debt since the threat of liquidation is stronger than the threat of litigation.

40|$|Abstract. We derive optimal {{consumption}} and investment strategies of an investor with CRRA utility of {{consumption and}}/or terminal wealth and {{with access to}} trade in a complete, but otherwise very general, nancial market. Interest rates, excess expected returns, price volatilities, correlations, and con-sumer prices may all evolve stochastically over time, even with non-Markovian dynamics. Our result pinpoints exactly what risks individuals want to hedge and shows how to nance a desired real consumption process by investing in a market of nominal securities. We extend our general result {{to the case of}} HARA utility and power-linear habit utility. We also discuss how to include labor income and undiversiable shocks to the consumer price index. In the special case where real interest rates are Gaussian and real market prices of risk are deterministic, we show that CRRA investors hedge with a single real bond; with utility of terminal wealth only it is the real zero-coupon bond maturing at the horizon, with utility of intermediate consumption it is a <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> contin-uous <b>coupons</b> proportional to the expected future real consumption rate under the forward martingale measure.

In addition to reducing servicing costs, the strategy will relieve some of the burden on the long-maturity fixed-coupon bonds. Reducing the supply of the fixed-coupon bonds should increase prices and decrease long-term yields. Reduction in long-term interest rates enhances spending, construction and capital expenditures.

5000|$|In finance, a {{fixed rate}} bond {{is a type}} of debt {{instrument}} <b>bond</b> <b>with</b> a fixed <b>coupon</b> (interest) rate, as opposed to a floating rate note. A fixed rate bond is a long term debt paper that carries a predetermined interest rate. The interest rate is known as coupon rate and interest is payable at specified dates before bond maturity.Due to the fixed coupon, the market value of a fixed-rate bond is susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates, and therefore has a significant amount of interest rate risk. That being said, the fixed-rate bond, although a conservative investment, is highly susceptible to a loss in value due to inflation. The fixed-rate bond’s long maturity schedule and predetermined coupon rate offers an investor a solidified return, while leaving the individual exposed to a rise in the consumer price index and overall decrease in their purchasing power.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the provision of palliative care services in England by voluntary hospices. The literature on voluntary hospices is fragmented and scattered within and across academic and practitioner discourses. Our argument is that we can consolidate this literature into a descriptive business model. This reveals how charitable income streams donated to voluntary hospices are significant relative to government funding. However, this charitable income is uncertain and volatile. Hospices operate with significant balance sheet reserves as a hedge against uncertainty but these funds, invested in capital markets, recycle uncertainty. Rubbing up against uncertainty, embedded in the hospice business model, is the fact that demand for palliative care will certainly increase. The population is expanding and we are generally living longer and this is set to inflate demand for hospice palliative care. Imaginative government policies, informed by the descriptive business model of hospice palliative care, are required if choice and demand for end of life palliative care are to be satisfied. Policies could include government: underwriting a higher share of hospice income, matching funds for an emergency contingency reserve, inventing ???hospice <b>bonds???</b> <b>with</b> a <b>coupon</b> clip above treasury rate to boost income whilst also preserving development funds set aside. Without change, the capacity to deliver patient choice and hospice palliative care going forward is at risk...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows that, {{contrary}} to the suggestion of some investment advisors, for an individual Canadian investor subject to personal income taxation, the after-tax return on a discount bond is always higher (or, at worse, equal) to the return on an otherwise identical premium bond. This follows because the tax rate on capital gains {{is lower than the}} tax rate on coupon income in Canada. It is also shown that a decline in the capital gains tax rate raises the after-tax yield on discount bonds, but reduces the after-tax yield on premium bonds, and may even cause the yield on premium bonds to become negative. Further, a cut in the tax rate on interest income raises the after-tax yield on all bonds, but raises the yield on premium bonds relative to discount bonds. While the lower after-tax returns on higher coupon bonds might be expected to cause the pre-tax yields on these bonds to rise, no evidence of such tax capitalization is found using a large dataset of matched pairs of Government of Canada bonds for the period 1986 - 2006. The observed near equality of pre-tax yields since 1995 for otherwise equivalent <b>bonds</b> <b>with</b> different <b>coupons</b> implies that individuals in Canada earn a significantly smaller after-tax return from holding premium bonds than discount bonds.
