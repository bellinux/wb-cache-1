50|$|Saffron Technology, Inc., a {{technology}} company headquartered in Cary, North Carolina, develops cognitive computing systems that use incremental learning {{to understand and}} unify <b>by</b> <b>entity</b> (person, place or thing) the connections between an entity and other “things” in data, along with {{the context of their}} connections and their raw frequency counts. This approach provides a semantic and statistical representation of knowledge.

Its patented technology captures the connections between data points at the entity level and stores these connections in an associative memory. Similarity algorithms and predictive analytics are then combined with the associative index to identify patterns in the data. Saffron’s Natural Intelligence platform is utilized by Global 1000 companies across industries including manufacturing, energy, defense and healthcare, to help decision-makers manage risks, identify opportunities and anticipate future outcomes, thus reducing cost and increasing productivity. Competitors include IBM Watson and Grok.|$|E
