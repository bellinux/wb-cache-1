40|$|This {{paper had}} as it’s main {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} feedback that cattlemen, exporters and other actors of the fed cattle market of São José do Rio Preto and Barrtos/SP; Northwester Paraná. Minas Gerais’ triangle, Goiânia/GO and Cuiabá/MT; could obtain from future hedge strategies from September 2000 to November 2003. Such research is worth once it´s new that derivative market has been increasingly adopted due to it’s possibilities of use with hedge prices. The primary data about prices of fed cattle weight {{were obtained from the}} Applied Economy Advanced Studies’ Center (CEPEA – ESALQ/USP) and future prices of fed cattle weight were obtained from Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange (BM&FBovespa S. A.). It can be said, from the various values of basis and basis risk, that each of the regions has it´s own commerce features. However, it was noticed that the more favorable months to hedge selling strategies were April, October and December, while May and July could be pointed as the best mouths to <b>buying</b> <b>hedge</b> strategie...|$|E
5000|$|Brandywine {{implements}} a multi-strategy approach. [...] Brandywine's {{philosophy is}} to create a relatively hedged portfolio, not by <b>buying</b> <b>hedges</b> which cost a premium but by incorporating multiple trading strategies in the portfolio which complement each other. [...] Brandywine follows a methodology based on [...] "return drivers" [...] to trade broadly diversified portfolios in the global currency, interest rate, stock index, metals, energy, and agricultural futures markets. [...] A return driver is the core underlying reason that drives the price of a market. [...] Each strategy must have a high significance of occurring in the future.|$|R
25|$|Those {{that buy}} or sell {{commodity}} futures need to be careful. If a company <b>buys</b> contracts <b>hedging</b> against price increases, {{but in fact the}} market price of the commodity is substantially lower at time of delivery, they could find themselves disastrously non-competitive (for example see: VeraSun Energy).|$|R
50|$|This {{can become}} a very {{powerful}} tool for purposes of estate planning. In essence you can <b>buy</b> a <b>hedge</b> fund inside an insurance policy and the value will grow tax free and upon death the cash value of the policy passes to heirs tax free.

5000|$|The [...] "CVA charge". The hedging of the CVA desk has a cost {{associated}} to it, i.e. {{the bank has}} to <b>buy</b> the <b>hedging</b> instrument. This cost is then allocated to each business line of an investment bank (usually as a contra revenue). This allocated cost is called the [...] "CVA Charge".|$|R
5000|$|The two {{cornerstones}} of Brandywine's investment approach are diversification and non-correlation {{of strategies}} and markets. [...] Brandywine implements a multi-strategy approach, which {{is unique in}} the industry.

[...] Brandywine follows a methodology based on [...] "return drivers" [...] to trade broadly diversified portfolios in the global currency, interest rate, stock index, metals, energy, and agricultural futures markets. [...] A return driver is the core underlying reason that drives the price of a market. [...] Brandywine's investment philosophy is {{based on the belief that}} the most consistent, persistent, and predictable investment returns across a variety of market environments are best achieved by combining multiple uncorrelated trading strategies (each designed to profit from a logical, distinct return driver) into a truly diversified portfolio. [...] Each strategy must have a high significance of occurring in the future.|$|R
50|$|Fixed income {{analysis}} is the valuation of fixed income or debt securities, and {{the analysis of}} their interest rate risk, credit risk, and likely price behavior in hedging portfolios. The analyst might conclude to <b>buy,</b> sell, hold, <b>hedge</b> or {{stay out of the}} particular security.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{their role in}} theory options are in practice not only traded for hedging purposes. Many investors also use them for speculation purposes. For these investors the Black-Scholes price serves only as an orientaTion, their decisions to <b>buy,</b> hold or <b>hedge</b> an option are also based on subjective beliefs and on their personal utility functions (in the widest possible sense). The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a general framework to include different types of investors, especially hedgers, pure speculators and speculators following strategies with bounded risk. We derive their subjective values of an option endogenously from the solution of their decision problems. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} and popular media report almost daily on {{the volatility of}} securities market prices. Yet, many people continue to <b>buy</b> securities to <b>hedge</b> against or speculate on certain risks. People can also buy or sell derivatives to hedge against or speculate on fluctuations in securities prices. This Article discusses three regulatory policy implications of utilizing derivatives markets to reallocate the bearing of securities price risks. First, if there are too few non-redundant derivative markets, a competitive market equilibrium allocation of securities price risks is typically constrained Pareto inefficient. This financial economic result means that for typical economies, a regulator can in principle improve social welfare by financial market interventions. Second, introducing some but not enough non-redundant derivatives markets has indeterminate normative consequences for the allocation of securities price risks. This financial economic result means that for typical economies, introducing a new derivative market can improve, worsen, or {{have no effect on}} the welfare of consumers and investors. Finally, government regulation might not improve the social allocation of securities price risks because of informational or political economy obstacles. This financial economic result means that for typical economies, the ability of regulatory intervention may be constrained by limited knowledge...|$|R
40|$|I {{started writing}} this piece as the sub-prime crisis was unfolding. I wanted to {{establish}} {{the connection between the}} silver basis and the budding banking crisis caused by phony bond insurance schemes and the lack of hedging irredeemable dollar debt with metal holdings. My original title was Putting Clothes on the Naked Bogeyman. As writing progressed I realized that it would take more than one article to dress up the bogeyman; hence the revised title. Trading hedged corn When I tell my audience at Gold Standard University Live that huge quantities of commodities are bought and sold every day without any reference to the price, my words are received with an incredulous silence. It appears incredible to the uninitiated that the price risk can be neatly side-stepped. I have to explain to my listeners that when the professional grain trader gives an order to buy or sell corn, he may be unaware whether the price of corn is up or down. He doesn’t care. He is <b>buying</b> and selling <b>hedged</b> corn, and he takes his clues from the basis, not the price of corn itself. He has replaced price risk with basis risk which he knows how to handle as its behavior is less erratic and more predictable. Most people don’t realize that the bulk of grain trading on the futures markets is driven not by the price but by the basis...|$|R
40|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{but very}} {{valuable}} metal. Decreasing supplies of indium from refining and increasing demands from LCD, low-temperature soldering and compound semiconductors have stimulated the indium price increase dramatically. Traditionally, indium is refined as a by-product of zinc refining. However, this type of indium extraction method is expected to last for the next 10 - 20 years and this opens a window to extract indium from other ores, especially from tin ore. Interestingly, extraction of indium from tin circuit {{can be considered as}} the major business and the pure tin metal is just considered as a by-product due to high indium price and low tin price. Relatively high estimated concentration levels of indium in Malaysian tin ore means that Malaysian tin refiners can withstand high degree of fluctuation of price in the free market due to <b>hedge</b> <b>buying</b> and speculation. Note that the business model for global indium market is duopoly or oligopoly but obviously not monopoly. Between duopoly and oligopoly, the most probable model is oligopoly. Thus, the potential competitors and partnership are also discussed here. Besides, LCD and low-temperature soldering and compound semiconductor are three main applications of indium which affect the indium price. (cont.) The unique properties of indium for three major applications will be discussed from the material engineering prospective. A cost modeling spreadsheet has been built to estimate the cost of production of indium from tin and zinc ores under different conditions. Hence, the decision tree has been drawn based on the conditions of different indium concentration level and price. From the discussions on the sources, market, applications of indium, the future prospects for indium can be concluded. The outcomes of this work can be extended to cases outside of the geographical boundary of Malaysia by gathering some relevant information. by Foo Nun Yong. Thesis (M. Eng.)
