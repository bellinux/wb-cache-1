50|$|Finland {{underwent}} {{severe economic}} depression in 1990-93. Badly managed financial {{deregulation of the}} 1980s, in particular removal of <b>bank</b> <b>borrowing</b> controls and liberation of foreign borrowing, combined with strong currency and a fixed exchange rate policy led to a foreign debt financed boom. <b>Bank</b> <b>borrowing</b> increased at its peak over 100% a year and asset prices skyrocketed. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to a 70% drop in trade with Russia and eventually Finland was forced to devaluate, which increased the private sector's foreign currency denominated debt burden. At the same time authorities tightened bank supervision and prudential regulation, lending dropped by 25% and asset prices halved. Combined with raising savings rate and worldwide economic troubles, {{this led to a}} sharp drop of aggregate demand and a wave of bankruptcies. Credit losses mounted and a banking crisis inevitability followed. The number of companies went down by 15%, real GDP contracted about 14% and unemployment rose from 3% to nearly 20% in four years. Recovery has been based on exports, after currency devaluation of 40% and reviving world economy share of exports as percentage of GDP has risen from 20% to 45%, and Finland has been running consistent current account surpluses.

50|$|By 2005, {{the economy}} in the Baltic States became overheated. GDP (y-o-y % change) in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were 10.2%, 10.6% and 7.9% respectively. Unemployment rate {{continued}} to fall in 2005 as the unemployment rate in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania declined to 7.9%, 8.7% and 8.3%. Consequently, the fall of unemployment rate has resulted in the gross wage in the Baltic States to increase substantially. In Estonia, the gross wage has gone up by 19.1% compared to 2004, while Latvia and Lithuania recorded an increase of 11.4% and 25.6% compared to 2004. Inflation rate also gone up substantially in the Baltic States as the Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania recorded 4.1%, 7.0% and 3.0% respectively.Foreign direct investment into the Baltic States increased sharply by 2005. In Estonia, 80.5% of FDI went into financial intermediaries. FDI into Latvia largely targeted on financial intermediaries (24.1%), manufacturing (11.8%), real estate (6.8%) and construction (4.2%). Manufacturing remained the most important sector in attracting FDI into Lithuania accounting 87.2%.The sign of property bubble in Baltic States were prevalent by 2005. Based on the House Price Index published by Eurostat, Estonia recorded a huge increase in the housing price as it has gone up by 34.6% {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2005. Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia on average recorded an increase of close to 25.5% in 2005 compared to 2004. Tartu and Pärnu also reportedly saw the average housing price up by 25.6% and 21.8%, respectively compared to 2004. At the same time, Latvia also watched the House Price Index edged up 26.8% in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on the first quarter of 2005. By 2005, housing price in Riga remained as the most expansive housing in Latvia as the housing price on average up by 47.1% in 2005 compared to 2004. Housing price in Jūrmala also saw the housing prices gone up by 39.0% in 2005 compared to 2004. Liepāja and Jelgava, on the other hand, observed housing price appreciation by 26.7% and 59.6% compared to 2004.Housing price in Lithuania also observed substantial gain in 2005 as the housing price index rose by 46.9% in 2005. Housing price in major cities of Lithuania was more expansive than Riga (Latvia) in 2005. For instance, an apartment in the suburb of Vilnius on average fetched up LTL2,617 (€758) per metre square, while an apartment in Kaunas and Klaipėda on average were estimated at LTL1,912 (€554) per metre square and LTL1,415 (€410) per metre square. In comparison, an apartment in the suburb of Riga on average was about LVL 335 (€478) per metre square in 2005.High availability of credit combined with low interest rate partly attracted substantial volume of property speculation within the Baltic States. In Estonia, the interest rate on mortgage on average has fallen from 4.4% (2004) to 3.5% (2005). As cheap foreign credit (in the form of FDI) flooded the financial sector in Estonia, 87.0% of mortgage loans for household were denominated in Euro. The ratio of household mortgage loans to total household loans were the highest among the Baltic States, approaching as high as 82.2% in 2005.Latvia also saw a rapid expansion in bank lending to residents give rise to the issue of credits outpaced deposits in 2005. Owing to the low growth of domestic deposits, Latvia has been heavily dependent on FDI as the main source of funding since 2000. By 2005, major banks has to resort to external <b>bank</b> <b>borrowing,</b> backed up by foreign liabilities of banks (mostly through parents), to counter the FDI shortfall. ⅔ of domestic credit expansion has to be funded by net foreign indebtedness of banks. Part of the causes of high loan growth was due to the interest rate in Latvia has gone down from an average of 8.28% (2004) to 5.95% (2005). This has justified the increase of total mortgage loans to household to almost double the amount of mortgage loans approved for household in 2004. In term of household mortgage loans, banks in Lithuania were more prudent than the neighbours. In fact, in 2005, Bank of Lithuania has urged domestic and foreign banks in Lithuania to apply conservative principles in establishing the value of properties especially in dealing unfavourable market developments. Similar to Latvia, majority funding for credits in Lithuania were heavily dependent on lending from foreign parent-bank to subsidiaries. In 2005, total mortgage loans denominated in Euro constituted up to 80.3%, while remaining 19.7% of house loans were denominated in Lithuanian litas. House loans constituted approximately 65% of loans approved for households. Interest rate for mortgage loans has declined from 4.27% (2004) to 3.61% (2005).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} banking relationships on firm performance for a sample of Indian manufacturing firms.

While banking relationships are positively impacted by firm performance, results suggest nonlinearity between bank financing and firm performance, suggesting the possibility of a potential debt overhang concern. This implies that firms with low growth opportunities tend to borrow more from banks due to lack of other opportunities to finance their investments. However, firms beyond a certain threshold of profitability tend to employ lesser debt to finance their investments in order to prevent the wealth transfer from shareholders to creditors. ...|$|E

40|$|For many years, credit {{rationing}} {{has been cited}} {{as one of the}} major challenges universally faced by SMEs. This is thought to have important economic implications given the contributions such SMEs could make to the wider economy if they secured investment financing. Credit rationing has in the past included firms whose credit applications are rejected by banks, and discouraged bank borrowers - firms that do not seek bank credit at all, in part because they believe they would be rejected. Research into rejection and discouraged <b>bank</b> <b>borrowing</b> is abounding and a variety of policy interventions have been implemented over the years, such as government loan guarantee schemes and, more recently, direct initiatives by the UK banking industry through the Business Finance Taskforce. Such efforts have however only realised modest success.

This suggests that results of traditional studies may be biased owing to a failure to control for firm-specific, time-invariant heterogeneity. The results of the fixed effects panel estimation find larger companies to have higher levels of both long-term and short-term debt than do smaller firms, profitability to be negatively correlated with the level of gearing, although profitable firms tend to have more short-term <b>bank</b> <b>borrowing</b> than less profitable firms, and tangibility to positively influence the level of short-term <b>bank</b> <b>borrowing,</b> as well as all long-term debt elements.

Annual data for the period 1960 - 2005, taken from Economic Survey of Pakistan and International Financial Statistic is used for analysis. Simultaneous equation model is used for estimation. The study revealed that bank credit to private sector, government domestic <b>bank</b> <b>borrowing,</b> and foreign reserves have positive significant effect on money supply. Demand for money is positively related to out put and negatively to interest rate. Out put is positively related to consumption expenditure, private investment, public investment, balance of trade and negatively related to real interest rate. Private investment is positively related to out put, bank credit to private sector and negatively related to interest rate. The relationship between private investment and interest rate is statistically significant only at 10 %, signifying that interest rate is not affecting private investment because of the greater return to private investors.
