40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out to detect Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV) in soil samples using RT-PCR and <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> techniques from the sugar beet production area of Tokat, Turkey in 2001. More than 80 % of the soil samples analyzed {{were found to be}} contaminated with the virus. The partial nucleotide sequence of cDNA corresponding to RNA- 3 of BNYVV isolated were analyzed for six different regions of Tokat province. All isolates were assigned to type A strains based on RFLP analysis and DNA sequences. Sequence comparison revealed differences at amino acid positions 35, 68, 71 and 179 of the P 25 coding region amongst Turkish isolates. Additionally, all Turkish isolates were compared with Japanese, French, Kazakh, Italian and Belgian isolates...|$|E
40|$|Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV) and Beet soilborne virus (BSBV) are {{the important}} soilborne virus diseases {{in the production}} areas of sugar beet. A survey was carried out to detect these viruses in soil samples using <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> test and double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and triple antibody sandwich-ELISA (TAS-ELISA) in sugar beet production areas in Tokat, Turkey in 2001. Of the 26 soil samples taken from 8 districts in Tokat province, {{it was found that}} 23 samples (85. 5 %) were infected with BNYVV and 24 samples (92. 3 %) with BSBV. In 2002, total 49 root samples were tested for the presence of these viruses by ELISA. The incidence of BNYVV (67 %) was greater than that of BSBV (8 %). Furthermore, in this study it was determined the relationships between physical and chemical properties of soils and the appearance of BNYVV and BSBV. But, it could not determine any connection between infectious potential of viruses and soil properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} installed with bait cultures {{to extract the}} AMF species present in a rhizosphere soil sample of a native Araucaria angustifolia forest in Campos do Jordao, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with four increasing phosphorus doses (0, 20, 50, and 150 mg kg(- 1), as triple superphosphate), with five replicates, the <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> was araucaria, and all pots were inoculated with 100 g of rhizospheric soil collected in an araucaria forest. After twelve months the spores were extracted, counted and identified, and the percent root colonization was also determined. When taking all four P doses into account, eleven AMF species could be identified: Acaulospora bireticulata, Acaulospora morrowiae, Acaulospora sp., Entrophospora colombiana, Gigaspora margarita, Glomus diaphanum, Glomus etunicatum, Glomus macrocarpum, Scutellospora calospora, Scutellospora gilmorei, and Scutellospora pellucida. There was no effect of the P dose on {{the total amount of}} spores neither on the percent root colonization. However, the correspondence analysis showed that the different AMF species were selectively associated mostly to either one or another P dose...|$|E
40|$|In self-compatible {{plant species}} stigmata receive {{a mixture of}} self and outcrossed pollen and {{competition}} between them is expected {{to play a major}} role in determining the pollen-mediated gene flow. The use of male sterile <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> in field trials to demonstrate the rate of gene flow is questionable due to lack of pollination competition. However, little direct evidence has been published. A field experiment of male sterile and male fertile sorghum pollen recipient <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> was conducted to evaluate pollen competition between wild and cultivated sorghums and the effects of pollen competition on gene flow assessment. Pollen competition between wild and cultivated sorghums was estimated from two-component pollen mixtures of wild and cultivated sorghum (1 : 1 ratio) applied to wild, cultivated and male-sterile maternal <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> Paternity was determined in the progeny using two diagnostic Simple Sequence Repeat markers. The study found that self pollen has higher seed-siring success. Maternal genotype influences the siring ability of the pollen donor components which significantly deviated from the 1 : 1 pollen loads. The study showed that published estimates of gene flow derived from studies using male-sterile <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> seriously overestimate gene flow and that pollen competition may be a significant factor influencing outcrossing rates. The results suggest that the predominant direction of gene flow is from cultivated to wild sorghum, potentially leading to introgression of crop genes into wild sorghum. Pollen competition should be taken into account in gene flow estimation, since presence of self-pollen can account for over half of seed produced irrespective of maternal genotyp...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{examined}} the epidemiology of two potentially devastating plant pathogens, Phytophthora ramorum and P. kernoviae, at Benmore Botanic Garden in Argyll & Bute and Brodick Castle Garden in Arran. Spore traps, river <b>baiting,</b> <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> and soil sampling {{were used to}} both confirm the presence of, and measure the amount of inoculum in the environment in order to quantify the relationship between inoculum levels and disease development. P. ramorum was detected in spore traps at high levels under a sporulating host throughout the year at Benmore. Also, findings at sites where infected hosts had been removed before the study led {{to the conclusion that}} the low level spore traps detect inoculum from soil splash. Rhododendron and Vaccinium <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> were also infected with P. ramorum via soil splash at sites within Benmore where there was no sporulating host present. P. kernoviae was detected in spore traps at Brodick throughout the year but only where there was a sporulating host overhead. P. kernoviae infected <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> only where an infected host is overhead. Water baiting confirmed the presence of P. ramorum in two streams at Benmore but P. kernoviae was not detected using this method despite the large-scale P. kernoviae infection at Brodick. Inoculum continued to be detected in soil in areas of both gardens where infected hosts had been removed two years previously, confirming that both of these pathogens can survive in soil for a considerable period. A number of statistical models were produced to describe conditions required for P. ramorum sporulation and infection. Sporulation occurred during warmer and wetter conditions and infection of <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> occurred in wet conditions and where an infected host is in close proximity. A statistical model was also used to produce a P. ramorum risk map, uniquely at the garden scale, to enable garden managers at Benmore to visualise the areas most at risk within their garden. The findings of this study have clear management implications for the control of disease establishment and spread within the garden setting...|$|R
40|$|When soil in pots was {{infested with}} {{southern}} bean mosaic virus (SBMV), it became infective for highly susceptible Phaseolus vulgaris <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> Soil could be infested by adding either infected plant tops or roots or by growing infected plants in it. Release of SBMV by roots of P. vulgaris cv. Red Kidney reached a maximum at flowering and thereafter declined, but some virus was still recovered in drainage water when the plants were dead. When grown in infested soil P. vulgaris cv. Bountiful was {{more susceptible to}} infection at 26 °C than at 21 or 32 °C, temperatures which were less favourable for plant growth. The addition to virus-infested soil of tomato roots carrying nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.), fungi and other soil biota did not increase virus infection in <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> It is concluded that SBMV resembles tobacco mosaic virus {{in being able to}} infect plant roots abiotically in infested soil...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi {{is often}} genetically diverse in disease fronts and diseased areas. P. cinnamomi has {{considerable}} {{ability to produce}} {{a wide range of}} pathogenic phenotypes measured from ‘plant clone by isolate by environmental factor interactions ’ {{in each of the three}} pathogen clonal lineages of P. cinnamomi isolated in Australia. P. cinnamomi lineages are defined by microsatellite types. In a few disease areas, despite both mating types occurring in the same square metre of soil, or 50 g soil sample or <b>bait</b> <b>plant,</b> no evidence of sexual reproduction (genomic recombination) has been found in the field. Isolates are sexually competent in the laboratory and all lineage combinations are strongly outcrossing. Hence the substantial variation in lineages in a range of traits associated with disease development must be arising asexually. Preventing movement of any P. cinnamomi contaminated material is critical to maximising disease control and minimising risks of introducing new strains which may threaten plant communities, their diversity and the integrity of these ecosystems. Phosphite or other intended phytophthoracide usage, which does not eliminate P. cinnamomi in plant nurseries can, by camouflaging disease, increase potential risks and threats by spreading different strains in diseased materials...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{increases}} {{stress levels}} for crops and affects {{the economic and}} environmental aspects of agricultural management systems. The application of stress tolerance-mediating microorganisms is an auspicious strategy for improving crop protection, and as such, we developed a direct selection strategy to obtain cultivable microorganisms from promising bioresources using the bait plants, maize, oilseed rape, sorghum and sugar beet. Alpine mosses, lichens and primrose were selected as bioresources, as each is adapted to adverse environmental conditions. A 10 % crop-specific selection was found for <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> rhizosphere communities using cultivation-independent fingerprints, and their potential role as stress protecting agents (SPA) was evaluated following the cultivation of captured bacteria. In addition to assays identifying phytopathogen antagonism and plant growth promotion capacities, our evaluation included those that test the ability to allocate nutrients. Moreover, we developed new assays to measure tolerance in diverse stress conditions. A score scheme was applied to select SPAs with desired properties, and three Pseudomonas species with pronounced antagonistic activity that showed elevated tolerance to desiccation and an improved seed germination rate were subsequently chosen. Screening for environmentally-conditioned and host-adapted microorganisms provides a novel tool for target-oriented exploitation of microbial bioresources {{for the management of}} ecofriendly crops facing biotic and abiotic stresses...|$|E
40|$|Beet {{necrotic}} yellow vein virus (BNYVV), {{the agent}} of rhizomania disease, causes severe economic losses in sugar beet fields in all over the world. The virus is transmitted by a plasmodiophorid vector, Polymyxa betae Keskin. Twenty soil samples, collected from sugar beet fields in northern and central parts of Turkey during surveys in 2004 and 2005 and known to be infested with viruliferous cultures of P. betae carrying BNYVV, were selected and used in this study. Sample selection was made according to symptom expression of beet seedlings in preliminary <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> tests and locations of the soil samples that accurately represent the region from which they were taken. Total RNAs were extracted from sugar beet plants grown in these soils and used to amplify RNA- 2 (nt. 19 - 1088) and RNA- 3 (nt. 50 - 1268) of BNYVV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified products showed that most of BNYVV isolates studied were A-type strain, however, two isolates did not exactly match the band profile of A-type strain. Additionally, the presence of BNYVV RNA- 5 component was investigated by RT-PCR using the primers specific for P 26 coding region.

40|$|Tobacco rattle tobravirus (TRV) {{and potato}} mop-top pomovirus (PMTV) are two known viruses in Sweden which impair {{the quality of}} potato tubers by causing spraing. This {{experiment}} aimed at finding the best <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> (plants that is susceptible to infection) for acquiring virus particles from soil, and to analyse the acquired viruses by both ELISA and biotest. The results were finished after 8 weeks with findings that indicate differences {{in the ability of}} acquiring virus particles between the <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> Nicotiana clevelandii and N. debneyi seem to be the best <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> to use. These plants were able to acquire both plant viruses in high concentrations. ELISA results also verify that the vector for PMTV, Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea, and the vector for TRV, Trichodorus/Paratrichodorus were present in the soil. Another interesting discovery was that the only positive result of PMTV was found in soil samples that had been dried for at least two weeks. This could be confirmed by later tests that were made on a new batch of soil samples. Five different indicator plants (plants that develop symptoms after inoculated with virus) were used for the biotest and out of these Chenopodium amaranticolor and C. quinoa seem to be the best to use because of the clearly visible local lesions that were easy to count. The biotest results were compared to the ELISA results and the plants that showed local lesions matched with positive ELISA values but the amount of lesions could not be correlated to high or low ELISA values. A combination of these techniques could be used in future work to increase the certainty of the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} four gene flow {{experiments}} for genetically modified corn crops were conducted, of which two experiments used male-sterile <b>bait</b> <b>plants,</b> and two used male-fertile <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> Dynamic pollen release was affected by plant biological characteristics and weather conditions. The spatial distribution of pollen deposition, and outcrossing ratio with distance from source followed the power law. Using male-sterile <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> obtained significantly higher gene flow estimation than using male-fertile regular plants (average 17 times difference). ^ A simulation model of dynamic atmospheric pollen dispersion and deposition, and final outcrossing from transgenic corn crop, was developed, validated, and used in assessing gene flow for different source field sizes, source strengths, buffer heights, buffer field sizes, atmospheric conditions, and pollen setting speeds. Dynamic pollen dispersion and deposition were predicted by a 3 -D Random-Walk model according to inputs of weather data, plant characteristics, and domain dimensions. Actual gene flow (outcrossing ratio) was obtained according to predicted grand total deposition flux at silk height. The model was validated by experimental data and predicts gene flow with acceptable accuracy (the average normalized gross errors were below 1. 5). The simulations provided 1 % and 0. 1 % distances for depositions and estimated outcrossing ratios at the distances for different sizes of transgenic cornfields from one plant area of 0. 1 m 2 to 3. 1 × 106 m 2 under normal weather conditions. The simulations of the model have shown that source sizes, source strengths, buffer heights, buffer sizes, atmospheric conditions, and pollen settling speeds had important effects on gene flow. While the atmospheric conditions and pollen settling speeds cannot be controlled, choosing appropriate buffer heights and sizes will effectively prevent gene flow. In addition, effective lost seed control is crucial to limit gene flow. ...|$|R

Nine were {{recovered}} directly from P. maximus, {{an indication that}} they had ingested the virus, {{but there was no}} correlation between the ingestion and transmission of these viruses. Raspberry ringspot (English and Scottish strains), arabis mosaic, and strawberry latent ringspot viruses were recovered from the roots of <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> grown in pots together with virus infected plants and P. rnaximus. Under the experimental conditions, these four viruses may have been transmitted by P. rnaxirnus. Sixteen of these viruses were not transmitted by P. maximus.

A new site is reported for P. maximus in a forest nursery in Angus, Scotland where it was causing considerable damage to 3 - and 4 -year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris).

At Banks Island, AM fungi were present and colonized {{at a high}} intensity in all specimens of Potentilla hookeriana Lehm. - Potentilla pulchella R. Br., Arnica angustifolia Vahl, and Erigeron uniflorus L. ssp. eriocephalus (Vahl ex Hornen.) Cronq. sampled. The soil collected under these plants showed a high inoculum potential when tested at greenhouse conditions using Plantago lanceolata L. as a <b>bait</b> <b>plant.</b> Occasional {{occurrence of}} AM fungi was recorded in Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex Frederiksen, Trisetum spicatum (L.)

Despite the fact that potential AM plants are present, no AM was found at the two most northern sites, Ellesmere Island and Ellef Ringnes Island. There seems to be climatic or dispersal limitations to AM colonization at these northern sites. Fine endophytic fungi, formerly named Glomus tenue (Grenall) I. R. Hall, were recorded at all four sites, but most frequently at Banks Island. We thereby provide further evidence that fine endophytes are more frequent in harsh climatic conditions than AM fungi. There was a relatively high proportion of nonmycorrhizal plant species at all sites, and this proportion increased towards the north...|$|E

Soils {{were collected from}} two forest sites: Whiteface Mountain (WF) and Heiberg Forest (HF). The effectiveness of four buffers to elute tomato mosaic tobamovirus (ToMV) from organic and mineral fractions of WF soil amended with ToMV was tested, and virus content was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effectiveness of Chenopodium quinoa (Willd.) bait plants to detect the virus also was tested. Both methods then were utilized to detect tobamoviruses in 11 WF and 2 HF soil samples. A phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7. 0) eluted more ToMV from soil than the other buffers tested. Mineral soil bound more virus than organic soil. Virus recoveries from virus-amended organic and mineral soils were 3 and 10 %, respectively, and the detection sensitivity was 10 to 20 ng/g of soil. Roots of bait plants grown in all virus-amended soils tested positive by ELISA, and virus concentrations averaged 10 ng/g. Both ToMV and tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) were transmitted to C. quinoa by elution from one of two HF soil samples but not from the WF soil samples. A tobamovirus was detected by bait planting in 12 of 73 (16 %) root extracts representing 5 of 13 soil samples (38 %). Tobamovirus-like particles were seen by transmission electron microscopy in 6 of 12 infected root extracts. Tobamoviruses occur in forest soils in New York State. Abiotic soil transmission to trees may permit localized spread and persistence of these viruses in forest ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Sugar beet {{root rot}} has {{severely}} occurred {{in our country}} recently, especially in localities of Pazova, Pećinci, Ruma, Sremska Mitrovica and Šid. From diseased roots {{as well as from}} soil collected from the localities where decay occurred, fungal isolates were obtained by <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> method. Based on their characteristics, they were identified as multinucleate Rhizoctonia sp. During the year of 2004 in Mitrosrem trial field T- 11, where the presence of multinucleate Rhizoctonia sp. was confirmed, an experiment under the coordination of Committee for Acknowledgement and Registration of New Cultivars in our country was conducted in order to determine cultivars' tolerance, i. e. their susceptibility and possibility for growing on infested fields. Six cultivars of sugar beet, Laetitia (as standard) and five new ones were included in the investigation. The trial was conducted in accordance with the established and accepted method (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources, Republic of Serbia). Susceptibility of investigated cultivars was evaluated according to significant production characteristics root yield, sugar content, corrected sugar content, thick juice Q, molasses sugar, content of K, Na and amino-N, polarized sugar yield and white sugar yield, as it was recommended by the method. Conducted investigations have revealed that tested sugar beet cultivars showed different reactions to natural infection with multinucleate Rhizoctonia sp. Concerning root yield as the most important agricultural characteristic, statistically significantly higher yield was obtained with the cultivar under code mark 5 (61. 120 kg/ha) whereas the cultivar marked under code 6 had significantly lower yield comparing to the standard (38. 100 kg/ha) ...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Arbuscular (AM) and ectomycorrhizas (EM) predominate in {{different}} soils. We hypothesise that also climatic factors affect directly their relative success and AM fungi (AMF) generally tolerate drought better than EM fungi (EMF). Here {{we tested the}} colonisation rates of soil-borne AMF and EMF after soil drought treatments. Methods Forest and meadow soils were mixed to include AMF and EMF propagules. There were three soil treatments: soil moisture corresponding to 60 % (control) or 10 % in mass of maximum water retention, or air-dry. The <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> were EM-forming silver birch (Betula pendula), dual-mycorrhiza forming grey alder (Alnus incana) and AM-forming white clover (Trifolium repens). After re-watering, <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> were sown and grown in a growth chamber in favourable conditions. This way, hostplant responses to drought were eliminated. Results Previous soil drought decreased EM colonisation in alder. The spore formation by AMF in clover was negatively affected after the most severe soil drought treatment, suggesting slightly retarded AM formation. Soluble soil potassium concentrations were lower in drought-treated soils and this was reflected in birch foliar concentrations. Conclusions The results provide some support to the hypothesised better drought tolerance of AMF than EMF propagules but further studies in milder drought and in other plant-fungus combinations are needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of two strains of raspberry ringspot virus (RRV) by {{small numbers of}} nematodes was compared. A strain of RRV from Scotland (RRV-S), originally found in the field associated with Longidorus elongatus, was transmitted frequently by L. elongatus but only once by L. macrosoma. A strain from England (RRV-E) associated with L. macrosoma in the field was transmitted infrequently by each species of nematode. The reasons why L. macrosoma infected only {{a small proportion of}} <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> with virus were investigated, and it was found that most of the nematodes tested had fed on the source plants and many had ingested virus. Most nematodes exposed to RRV-E or RRV-S had fed on the roots of the <b>bait</b> <b>plants</b> and, when thin sections were examined by electron microscope, had retained particles (thought to be those of the virus) in the region of the anterior odontostyle, Thus, most nematodes seem to have had ample opportunity to transmit virus, and the low frequency of transmission may have been due to a failure of the virus particles to be released from the site of retention or to a lack of infectivity of the virus when L. macrosoma was the vector and Petunia hybrida was the host...|$|R

40|$|Transmission {{of three}} strains of OMMV by an Olpidium sp. was {{evaluated}} and compared. The three strains were 1) an OMMV wild type (WT) recovered from olive trees, 2) an OMMV variant (L 11) obtained after 15 serial passages of single local lesions induced in Chenopodium murale plants, and 3) a construct OMMV/OMMVL 11 {{in which the}} coat protein (CP) gene replaced that of the wild type. A single-sporangial culture derived from Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) used as a <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> grown in soil of an olive orchard, was identified as Olpidium brassicae based on the size and sequence of the generated amplicon in PCR specific tests. Each of the three virus strains was soil transmitted to cabbage roots {{in the absence of}} the fungus at similar rates of 30 to 40 %. Separate plant inoculation by O. brassicae zoospores incubated with each viral strain resulted in enhanced transmission of OMMV, reaching 86 % of infection whereas that of the other two strains remained practically unaffected at ca. 34 %. Binding assays showed that the amount of virus bound to zoospores, estimated spectrophotometrically, was 7 % in the case of OMMV, and practically nil in the case of the other two viral strains. Substitution of the coat protein (CP) gene of OMMV by that of the OMMV L 11 strain, drastically reduced viral transmissibility in the presence of zoospores to the level of that observed in their absence. Our data shows that OMMV soil transmission is greatly enhanced by O. brassicae zoospores and that the viral CP plays a significant role in this process, most likely by facilitating virus binding and later entrance into the host plant roots...|$|E
40|$|Green roofs are {{increasing}} in {{popularity in the}} urban environment for their contribution to green infrastructure; but their role for biodiversity is not often a design priority. Maximising biodiversity will impact positively on ecosystem services and is therefore fundamental for achieving the greatest benefits from green roofs. Extensive green roofs are lightweight systems generally constructed with a specialised growing medium that tends to be biologically limited and as such can be a harsh habitat for plants to thrive in. Thus, this investigation aimed to enhance the soil functioning with inoculations of soil microbes to increase plant diversity, improve vegetation health/performance and maximise access to soil nutrients. Manipulations included the addition of mycorrhizal fungi and a microbial mixture (‘compost tea’) to green roof rootzones, composed mainly of crushed brick or crushed concrete. The study revealed that growing media type and depth {{play a vital role}} in the microbial ecology of green roofs, with complex relationships between depth and type of substrate and the type of microbial inoculant applied, with no clear pattern being observed. For <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> measurements (heights, leaf numbers, root/shoot biomass, leaf nutrients), a compost tea may have positive effects on plant performance when grown in substrates of shallower depths (5. 5 cm), even one year after inoculums are applied. Results from the species richness surveys show that diversity was significantly increased with the application of an AM fungal treatment and that overall, results suggest that brick-based substrate blends are most effective for vegetation performance as are deeper depths (although this varied with time). Microbial inoculations of green roof habitats appeared to be sustainable; they need only be done once for benefits to still been seen in subsequent years where treatments are added independently (not in combination). They seem to be a novel and viable method of enhancing rooftop conditions...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to shed light on the previously unknown arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities in Southern Arabia. We explored AMF communities in two date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) plantations and the natural vegetation of their surrounding arid habitats. The plantations were managed traditionally in an oasis and according to conventional guidelines at an experimental station. Based on spore morphotyping, the AMF communities under the date palms appeared to be quite diverse at both plantations and more similar to each other than to the communities under the ruderal plant, Polygala erioptera, growing at the experimental station on the dry strip between the palm trees, and to the communities uncovered under the native vegetation (Zygophyllum hamiense, Salvadora persica, Prosopis cineraria, inter-plant area) of adjacent undisturbed arid habitat. AMF spore abundance and species richness were higher under date palms than under the ruderal and native plants. Sampling in a remote sand dune area under Heliotropium kotschyi yielded only two AMF morphospecies and only after trap culturing. Overall, 25 AMF morphospecies were detected encompassing all study habitats. Eighteen belonged to the genus Glomus including four undescribed species. Glomus sinuosum, a species typically found in undisturbed habitats, was the most frequently occurring morphospecies under the date palms. Using molecular tools, it was also found as a phylogenetic taxon associated with date palm roots. These roots were associated with nine phylogenetic taxa, among them eight from Glomus group A, but the majority could not be assigned to known morphospecies or to environmental sequences in public databases. Some phylogenetic taxa seemed to be site specific. Despite the use of group-specific primers and efficient trapping systems with a <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> consortium, surprisingly, two of the globally most frequently found species, Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae, were not detected neither as phylogenetic taxa in the date palm roots nor as spores under the date palms, the intermediate ruderal plant, or the surrounding natural vegetation.

40|$|Aims and Background The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the diversity and distribution of Glomeromycotan fungi forming arbuscular mycorrhizal associations (AMF) in undisturbed and disturbed habitats in the vicinity of Kakadu National Park in tropical Australia. This is a tropical region with a 7 – 9 month dry season and a monsoonal wet season. Complimentary methods of fungus detection were used {{to investigate}} the diversity and relative dominance of AMF at a regional scale. Methods Soils were sampled from 32 sites, representing eucalypt savanna woodlands, wetlands, sandstone escarpment, rainforest, and disturbed mine waste rock mps (overburden or spoil). Populations of AMF were identified and quantified using spores from soil. Morphology patterns of fungi colonising <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> roots were examined and isolates were obtained by four complimentary pot-culturing methods. Results Different methods of detecting fungi produced different answers about which AMF were most important in the tested soils. In particular, spore surveys apparently underestimated the importance of Glomus species and overestimated the activity of Acaulospora species with numerous small spores, while calculated spore biovolumes overestimated the importance of Scutellospora and Gigaspora species with large spores, relative to inoculum levels of these fungus categories measured in bioassays. Spore surveys revealed 15 species of fungi and 8 additional fungi were recovered from the same soil samples using potculture isolation methods. Pot-cultures were especially important for detecting Glomus species that had high inoculum levels, but rarely produced spores in soils. Spores of AMF increased in abundance as vegetation developed in mine habitats reaching a peak that was higher than in undisturbed plant communities. Spore numbers (but not biovolumes) were well correlated with bioassay measurements of inoculum levels. Conclusions Most AMF species were widespread, but several were restricted to disturbed habitats or wetland soils. Undisturbed sites had a substantially higher diversity of AMF than partially vegetated mine waste rock dumps. It is recommended that AMF population surveys should not be based entirely on spore occurrence data, to avoid overlooking important fungi that sporulate infrequently. These fungi could be detected by bioassays or pot culture isolation from soil. Major variations in the detectability of AMF correspond to different life history strategies and can mask variations in their abundance...|$|E
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhiza}} is {{an ancient}} symbiosis between the majority of land plants and fungi from the phylum Glomeromycota. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonize plant roots {{and contribute to the}} mineral nutrient uptake of the hosts in exchange for carbohydrates. AMF species diversity and identity was reported to have a decisive influence on the composition and productivity of natural plant communities. Only around 200 glomeromycotan species described so far were thought to colonize the majority of higher plant species and thus, their host specificity was thought to be very low. In this thesis, molecular methods were used to investigate ecological aspects of root colonizing AMF. The community composition of these fungi was analyzed in two plant species-rich grasslands facing different environmental conditions and harboring different plant communities. One site consisting of two meadows located close to each other was situated in the upper montane zone of the Swiss Alps. The other was located in the lowland in France {{on the edge of the}} Jura mountains. The roots were analyzed using AMF-specific nested PCR, RFLP screening and sequencing of rDNA small subunit and internal transcribed spacer regions. AMF sequences were analyzed phylogenetically and used to define monophyletic sequence types. Overall, 27 different AMF sequence types were detected in the root samples from both field sites. The overlap between the AMF communities in the alpine and lowland site was relatively small - they shared just six sequence types. These results indicate strong geographical differences in the AMF community composition, reflecting different environmental conditions and plant species communities in each site. The question was adressed, whether different host plant species co-occurring in the same area host distinct or similar AMF communities. Gentiana verna, G. acaulis and Trifolium spp. growing in two alpine species-rich meadows harbored significantly different AMF communities, whereas the differences between the two sites were negligible. These results indicate that within a relatively small area with similar soil and climatic conditions, the host plant species can have a major influence on the AMF communities within the roots. In these alpine sites, there was also a focus on green plants from the family Gentianaceae. In contrast to their mycoheterotrophic relatives, the green gentians did not show a high level of specificity towards AMF. The plants sampled harbored AMF communities comprising multiple phylotypes from different fungal lineages. In the lowland site – a calcareous grassland – different culturing methods and their influence on the AMF community composition in the roots were adressed. Four plant species were sampled i) directly in the field, ii) in a <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> bioassay conducted directly in that grassland and iii) in a greenhouse trap experiment using soil and a transplanted whole plant from that grassland as inoculum. The community composition in their roots was strongly influenced by the experimental approach, with additional influence of cultivation duration, substrate and host plant species in some experiments. Some fungal phylotypes, e. g. Glomus mosseae and several members of Glomus group B, appeared predominantly in the greenhouse experiment or in bait plants. These phylotypes can be considered r strategists, rapidly colonizing uncolonized ruderal habitats in early successional stages of the fungal community. Other phylotypes as Glomus badium and GLOM-A 16 were detected almost exclusively in roots sampled from plants naturally growing in the grassland or from bait plants exposed in the field, indicating that they preferentially occur in late successional stages of fungal communities and thus represent the K strategy. The only phylotype found with high frequency in all three experimental approaches as well as in the alpine site was GLOM A- 1 (Glomus intraradices), which is assumed to be a generalist. These ecological strategies of different AMF species or phylotypes should be considered in AMF experimental work. In greenhouse trap experiments it is difficult to establish a rootcolonizing AMF community reflecting the diversity of these fungi in the field roots, because fungal succession in such artificial systems may bias the results. However, the field <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> approach might be a convenient way to study the influence of different environmental factors on AMF community composition directly under the field conditions. Finally, the co-existence of the Glomeromycota in the root samples with fungi from the basidiomycotan order Sebacinales was addressed. These fungi are widely distributed and known to form various types of presumable mycorrhizal associations of different morphology (ecto-, ectendo-, orchid, ericoid, jungermannoid) with a broad range of host plant species. However, their presence in plants forming arbuscular mycorrhiza has not been reported yet. Therefore, the root samples originating from the two species-rich grasslands mentioned above were analyzed with Sebacinales-specific primers for the D 1 /D 2 region of the nuclear 28 S rDNA subunit. Fungi from the order Sebacinales were present in the majority of the root samples from both sites, where they co-existed with the Glomeromycota. In agreement with studies targeting the Sebacinales in ericoid plants, the phylogenetic analysis of sebacinoid sequences from our samples did not reveal any patterns according to their host plant species or geographical origin...|$|E
40|$|In {{tropical}} lowland forests, which {{dominated by}} trees of Dipterocarpaceae family, trees and fungi are strongly linked, through ectomycorrhiza (EcM) formation. However, {{as part of}} rapid deforestation and forest transformation, mixed dipterocarp forests {{have been replaced by}} other vegetation and land use types. Considerable areas of the lowland tropical forest in Sumatra have been turned into Rubber Agroforests (RAF). RAF is a land use type in which rubber trees are planted, while allowing spontaneous establishment of forest tree species. The method presented in this thesis includes four main elements. Firstly, vegetation analysis in seven types of land use. Secondly, study in a nursery using dipterocarps species as <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> to assess the effect of land use change on EcM inoculum and to analyze the effect of soil heating and drying on EcM propagules. Thirdly, an in-situ experiment in RAF with different history was done to assess whether fungal inoculant increased the survival, growth, nutrient uptake and EcM formation on Shorea selanica and Shorea lamellata. Finally, molecular techniques of PCR and sequencing have been applied to identify EcM fungal symbionts on dipterocarps. The study has been conducted in Jambi province, Sumatra, Indonesia. The ex-situ experiment has been conducted in the nursery of the Forest Research and Development Agency, Bogor, Indonesia. Identification of EcM fungi was done in the Fungal Biodiversity Centre (CBS), Utrecht, the Netherlands. The result of vegetation analysis showed that human activity in RAF management has strong effects on species richness. Very few trees dependent on EcM fungi were encountered in RAF. Our study in the nursery shows small differences in EcM colonization between soils derived {{from a wide range of}} land use types. It may indicate that survival of spores and colonization potential are not sensitive to the history of the site. Rapid recolonization of the heated soil in the experiment may imply sufficient availability of EcM fungi for dipterocarps under field conditions, where fire as a tool for land clearing is commonly used in Sumatra. The in-situ experiment in the RAF showed that lack of trees that are dependent on EcM fungi in RAF and in non-forested land does not necessarily imply the absence of EcM inoculum belowground in the ecosystem. EcM inoculum persists in the soil after forest was changed to RAF. Molecular identification of EcM fungi showed that Tomentella was the prevalent genus of EcM fungi colonizing dipterocarp seedlings in nursery stage and in the in-situ test 1 year after the seedlings have been planted in the field. None of the fungi was identified as Scleroderma columnare, which was inoculated to S. lamellata and S. selanica seedlings in the nursery stage. This indicated that indigenous EcM fungi dominated on the dipterocarp seedlings planted in the field, regardless of nursery inoculation. The implementation of this study is potentially of great value for reforestation efforts with dipterocarps in RAF in collaboration with rubber farmers. This reforestation approach will ensure the successfulness of the reforestation managed sustainably by the farmer, from which they may benefit in the future...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary Despite the {{important}} role that plant-microbe relationships play in grassland structure and dynamics, our understanding of these relationships in the grassy ecosystems of southern Australia is limited. This thesis aimed to contribute towards {{a greater understanding of}} the linkages between the above-ground producer and below-ground decomposer communities in the critically endangered Northern Plains Grassland Communities of the Riverine Plains of south-eastern Australia. Firstly, a major functional group of soil microbes was focused on, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which {{play a role in the}} growth and nutrition of plants, particularly in the acquisition of soil phosphorus. Secondly, the dynamics of whole microbial communities was studied by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. A <b>bait</b> <b>plant</b> study (Chapter 2) showed that whilst the two predominant soil types of a Northern Plains grassland community differed in both vegetation and soil resource availability, they did not differ in the availability of propagules of AMF or the distribution of species forming arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). The spatially variable distribution of AMF propagules across the grassland may have implications for the plant community. In a growth experiment (Chapter 3) the four dominant grasses of this grassland (Rytidosperma erianthum, R. caespitosum, R. setaceum and R. auriculatum) showed a negative growth response to the formation of AM, with no increase in plant tissue P in the one species where it could be tested in (R. caespitosum). This may have implications for plant community structure, such as promoting the growth of subordinate plant species. It also highlights the need to incorporate closely related plant species in studies of plant community/AMF community dynamics. Changes in vegetation and microbes were investigated along an agricultural de-intensification gradient (Chapter 4). With agricultural de-intensification, grasslands progressed toward plant community level traits for slow, conservative growth and resource use, alongside conversion from a bacterial- a to fungal-dominated soil flora. This is likely to be associated with changes in important ecosystem functions such as decreases in decomposition and productivity, and more efficient and retentive cycling of nutrients. A lag in fungal biomass recovery indicates potentially different drivers of the above- and below-ground sub-system recovery toward a more native grassland state. It was demonstrated with a nutrient addition experiment (Chapter 5) that nutrient availability may not be one of the strong drivers of the shift toward fungal dominance with agricultural de-intensification. The ratio of fungi to bacteria did, however, vary with seasonal vegetation changes. This indicates that microbial community dominance likely plays a role in the partitioning of soil resources for vegetation growth across seasons in this temporally dynamic semi-arid system. In conclusion, this study demonstrated variability in the spatial distribution and function of AMF communities in relation to vegetation and soil properties in the Northern Plains grassland community of south-eastern Australia. It highlighted a predictable shift from bacterial to fungal dominance alongside a shift toward resource-conservative plant community level traits with agricultural de-intensification, and suggested a role for soil microbes in grassland seasonal dynamics. In the face of continued anthropogenic pressures upon the grassy ecosystems of southern Australia, a greater understanding of the role of plant-microbe interactions in the provision of essential ecosystem functions is required...|$|E

40|$|Bioaerosols of {{interest}} in plant pathology are comprised principally of the air-borne or splash-borne fungal spores or bacterial cells which disperse many plant diseases.

40|$|Beet western yellows virus (designated in {{this study}} as BWYVNZ) was shown to occur in New Zealand and cause {{yellowing}} in beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and turnip (Brassica rapa L.) crops in Canterbury. Subterranean clover red leaf virus (SCRLV) transmitted by Aulacorthum solani (Kalt.) and implicated {{as a cause of}} yellowing in beet, could not be isolated from beet showing leaf yellowing. This virus was shown, however, to be capable of infecting beet in the glasshouse. The host range of BWYV-NZ (natural and experimental) consisted of at least 44 species in 16 plant families. Symptoms induced in hosts consisted mainly of plant stunting, marginal or interveinal yellowing or reddening, and thickening of infected leaves. Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was an efficient vector of BWYV-NZ, having an acquisition threshold period of 5 min, an inoculation threshold period of 3 min and a latent period of 12 - 30 h. This aphid retained the virus for at least 17 days. Aulacorthum solani,Acyrthosiphon pi sum (Harris), Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) and Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt.) were also vectors of BWYV-NZ. An experiment in aphid-proof cages showed that infection of turnip cv. Green Globe with BWYV-NZ decreased total dry weight by 24 %. Plants were inoculated at the 2 nd- 4 th leaf stage and harvested 3 months later. Aphid flight patterns and the spread and incidence of BWYV-NZ and SCRLV were examined, during 1981 - 82, using <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> Plants became infected with both viruses from September to December and from March to May. Infection with BWYV-NZ was 8 times as frequent as infection with SCRLV. Myzus persicae was the most numerous aphid on the <b>bait</b> <b>plants.</b> From November to December 1981, M. persicae was the most abundant aphid on beet. From March to June 1982, the main aphids on turnip were M. persicae and Brevicoryne brassicae (L.). In 1981 - 82, incidence of yellowing in beet and turnip crops, presumably attributable to BWYV-NZ, reached 50 - 100 %. An isolate of SCRLV was purified from Pisum sativum L. and an isolate of BWYV-NZ was purified from Crambe abyssinica Hochst. Using cellulase to assist in virus extraction. Yields of 0. 3 - 3. 0 and 0. 2 - 1. 5 mg/kg tissue were obtained forSCRLV and BWYV-NZ, respectively. Particles of both viruses were isometric of a diameter of 27 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 114 S. Purified preparations were infectious when fed to aphids through Parafilm M membranes. Electrophoresis of disrupted virions in gradient polyacrylamide gels revealed a single polypeptide of each virus of a molecular weight of about 22 200 for SCRLV and 23 250 for BWYV-NZ. Serologically, SCRLV was shown to be very closely related to soybean dwarf virus (SDV) and less closely to BWYV-NZ, bean leaf roll (BLRV), legume yellows (LYV), Indonesian soybean dwarf (ISDV), potato leaf roll (PLRV), tomato yellow top (TYTV) and BWYV (isolate RY-I-R 3 from California). BWYV-NZ was shown to be closely related to BWYV (RY-I-R 3) and less closely to BLRV, LYV, ISDV, SCRLV, SDV, PLRV and TYTV. SCRLV and BWYV-NZ were detected in infected plant tissue by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
