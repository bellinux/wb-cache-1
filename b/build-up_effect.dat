40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the roles of spectral overlap and amplitude modulation (AM) rate for stream segregation for noise signals, as well as to test the <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> based on these two cues. Segregation ability was evaluated using an objective paradigm with listeners’ attention focused on stream segregation. Stimulus sequences consisted of two interleaved sets of bandpass noise bursts (A and B bursts). The A and B bursts differed in spectrum, AM-rate, or both. The amount of the difference between the two sets of noise bursts was varied. Long and short sequences were studied to investigate the <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> for segregation based on spectral and AM-rate differences. Results showed the following: 1. Stream segregation ability increased with greater spectral separation. 2. Larger AM-rate separations were associated with stronger segregation abilities. 3. Spectral separation was found to elicit the <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> for the range of spectral differences assessed in the current study. 4. AM-rate separation interacted with spectral separation suggesting an additive effect of spectral separation and AM-rate separation on segregation build-up. The findings suggest that, when normal-hearing listeners direct their attention toward segregation, they are able to segregate auditory streams based on reduced spectral contrast cues that vary by the amount of spectral overlap. Further, regardless of the spectral separation they were able to use AM-rate difference as a secondary/weaker cue. Based on the spectral differences, listeners can segregate auditory streams better as the listening duration is prolonged—i. e. sparse spectral cues elicit build-up segregation; however, AM-rate differences only appear to elicit build-up when in combination with spectral difference cues...|$|E

Here, we investigated the effect on quiet human stance of changing the visual condition prior to a proprioceptive perturbation produced by vibration of dorsal neck muscles. In complete absence of visual references, the amplitude of the postural responses to neck vibration (forward shift of the centre of foot pressure) was the largest and became progressively larger {{as a function of}} the repetition of administered stimuli. The posture-destabilizing effect of vibration eyes-closed (EC) and the <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> were reduced if vibration was preceded by a period during which vision was allowed (EO). Similarly, the small destabilizing effect of vibration EO was increased if vibration was preceded by an EC period. The fore-period must last more than 3 s in order to affect the response to neck muscle vibration. The responsiveness to a proprioceptive disturbing input does not immediately change on adding or subtracting vision, but a finite time period must elapse before the postural “set” defined by vision is fully established. The findings underline the importance of time when vision is used in re-weighting the excitability of the postural control mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that listeners separate an acoustic mixture by auditory scene analysis (ASA) in which a perceptual description of each sound source is formed – a stream (Bregman, 1990). Typically, ASA {{is seen as a}} precursor to attentional mechanisms which simply select one stream as the attentional focus. However, recent work by Carlyon et al. (2001) has suggested that attention {{plays a key role in}} the formation of streams. A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework (Wang, 1996), in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. The model accounts for a number of interesting phenomena including the subconscious re-direction of attention by the onset of a new, loud stimulus; the streaming effect of alternating tone sequences (van Noorden, 1975) and associated <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> (Anstis and Saida, 1985); the failure of streaming to occur when attending to a distractor task (Carlyon et al., 2001); the grouping of a mistuned harmonic and complex (e. g.

With anterior fields, no material is normally placed over the patient’s skin, thus providing the maximum skin sparing possible with the beam configuration used. A posterior beam normally passes through the treatment couch top and increases the dose delivered to the patient’s skin. Both the Mylar sheeting and the support ribbing material produce {{a significant increase in}} skin dose. Measurements at 6 MV have shown that the basal cell layer dose can be increased by up to 51 % of maximum dose with a carbon fibre/Mylar couch and by 28 % for a tennis string/Mylar couch when compared to anterior beams. These values are associated with the position of the carbon fibre or tennis string ribbing. Dermal layer doses are increased by up to 30 and 24 % of maximum dose for carbon fibre and tennis string, respectively. These values include a combination of dose due to the support ribbing and the Mylar sheeting. Due to the variability in patient positioning on the couch top, these increases would be spread out over the skin surface producing an average increase per unit area at the basal layer of up to 32 and 20 % of the maximum, respectively, for carbon fibre and tennis string couch tops and 21 and 12 % at the dermal layer compared to dose at Dmax. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} interdisciplinary, {{collaborative research}} in the field of synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy (MRT). Synchrotron MRT is an experimental radiotherapy technique under consideration for clinical use, following demonstration of efficacy in tumour-bearing rodent models with remarkable sparing of normal tissue. A high flux, X-ray beam from a synchrotron is segmented into micro-planar arrays of narrow beams, typically 25 μm wide and with peak-to-peak separations of 200 μm. The radiobiological effect of MRT and the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. The ratio between dose in the ‘peaks’of the microbeams to the dose in the ‘valleys’, between the microbeams, has strong biological significance. However, there are difficulties in accurately measuring the dose distribution for MRT. The aim of this thesis is to address elements of both the dosimetric and radiobiological gaps that exist in the field of synchrotron MRT. A method of film dosimetry and microdensitometry was adapted in order to measure the peak-to-valley dose ratios for synchrotron MRT. Two types of radiochromic film were irradiated in a phantom and also flush against a microbeam collimator on beamline BL 28 B 2 at the SPring- 8 synchrotron. The HD- 810 and EBT varieties of radiochromic film were used to record peak dose and valley dose respectively. In other experiments, a dose <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> was investigated and the half value layer of the beam with and without the microbeam collimator was measured to investigate the effect of the collimator on the beam quality. The valley dose obtained for films placed flush against the collimator was approximately 0. 25 % of the peak dose. Within the water phantom, the valley dose had increased to between 0. 7 – 1. 8 % of the peak dose, depending on the depth in the phantom. We also demonstrated, experimentally and by Monte Carlo simulation, that the dose is not maximal on the surface {{and that there is a}} dose <b>build-up</b> <b>effect.</b> The microbeam collimator did not make an appreciable difference to the beam quality. The measured values of peak-to-valley dose ratio were higher than those predicted by previously published Monte Carlo simulation papers. For the radiobiological studies, planar (560 Gy) or cross-planar (2 x 280 Gy or 2 x 560 Gy) irradiations were delivered to mice inoculated with mammary tumours in their leg, on beamline BL 28 B 2 at the SPring- 8 synchrotron. Immunohistochemical staining for DNA double strand breaks, proliferation and apoptosis was performed on irradiated tissue sections. The MRT response was compared to conventional radiotherapy at 11, 22 or 44 Gy. The results of the study provides the first evidence for a differential tissue response at a cellular level between normal and tumour tissues following synchrotron MRT. Within 24 hours of MRT to tumour, obvious cell migration had occurred into and out of irradiated zones. MRT-irradiated tumours showed significantly less proliferative capacity by 24 hours post-irradiation (P = 0. 002). Median survival times for EMT- 6. 5 and 67 NR tumour-bearing mice following MRT (2 x 560 Gy) and conventional radiotherapy (22 Gy) increased significantly compared to unirradiated controls (P < 0. 0005). However, there was markedly less normal tissue damage from MRT than from conventional radiotherapy. MRT-treated normal skin mounts a more coordinated repair response than tumours. Cell-cell communication of death signals from directly irradiated, migrating cells, may explain why tumours are less resistant to high dose MRT than normal tissue...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} introduce gadolinium neutron capture brachytherapy (GdNCB) as a suitable modality for treatment of stenosis. The utility of GdNCB in intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) of stent stenosis is investigated by using the GEANT 4 and MCNP 4 B Monte Carlo radiation transport codes. To study capture rate, Kerma, absorbed dose and absorbed dose rate around a Gd-containing stent activated with neutrons, a 30 mm long, 5 rum diameter gadolinium foil is chosen. The input data is a neutron spectrum used for clinical neutron capture therapy in Studsvik, Sweden. Thermal neutron capture in gadolinium yields a spectrum of high-energy gamma photons, which due to the <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> gives an almost flat dose delivery pattern to the first 4 mm around the stent. The absorbed dose rate is 1. 33 Gy/min, 0. 25 mm from the stent surface while the dose to normal tissue is in order of 0. 22 Gy/min, i. e., a factor of 6 lower. To spare normal tissue further fractionation of the dose is also possible. The capture rate is relatively high at both ends of the foil. The dose distribution from gamma and charge particle radiation at the edges and inside the stent contributes to a nonuniform dose distribution. This will lead to higher doses to the surrounding tissue and may prevent stent edge and in-stent restenosis. The position of the stent can be verified and corrected by the treatment plan prior to activation. Activation of the stent by an external neutron field can be performed days after catherization when the target cells start to proliferate and can be expected to be more radiation sensitive. Another advantage of the nonradioactive gadolinium stent is the possibility to avoid radiation hazard to personnel. (c) 2006 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{feasibility}} of MRT {{has recently been}} demonstrated utilizing a new technology of Carbon-Nano-Tube (CNT) field emission x-ray sources. This approach can deliver very high dose (10 's of Gy) in narrow stripes (sub-mm) of radiation, which enables the study of novel radiation treatment approaches. Here we investigate the application of high- resolution (50 &# 119906;&# 119898; isotropic) PRESAGE®/Optical-CT 3 D dosimetry techniques to characterize the radiation delivered in this extremely dosimetrically challenging scenario. Methods: The CNT field emission x-ray source irradiator comprises of a linear cathode array and a novel collimating system. The device delivers small `stripe' beams of approximately X long and Y wide, at an energy of 160 kVp. To characterize the MRT beams, an ultra-high-resolution prototype 3 D dosimetry system was constructed and optimized, consisting of two parts: a radiochromic 3 D dosimetry material PRESAGE, and a high resolution small field-of-view optical-CT imaging system for dose-readout (DMicrOS - Duke Micro Optical-CT Scanner). Small PRESAGE cylindrical dosimeters (~ 2. 2 cm in height and ~ 2. 5 cm in diameter) were irradiated by CNT MRT delivering 3 stripes of radiation with a nominal entrance dose of 32 Gy (16 Gy for the second batch). PRESGAE dosimeters (with same dimensions) were also irradiated with at 32 Gy entrance dose, with a regular x-ray irradiator collimated to microscopical stripe- beams using a customized cerrobend material collimator. 50 &# 119906;&# 119898; (isotropic) 3 D dosimetry was performed on all dosimeters using an in-house optical-CT system designed and optimized for high-resolution imaging (including a stray light deconvolution correction). The Percentage Depth Dose (PDD), Peak-to-Valley Dose Ratio (PVR) and beam width (FWHM) data were obtained and analyzed in both cases. Independent verification against EBT 2 radiochromic film is ongoing. Results: Basic testing of the DMicrOS system indicated the following performance: Modulated-Transfer-Function (MTF), dynamic range, resolution, largest Field-Of-View (FOV), Point-Spread-Function (PSF) were performed. When applied to the PRESAGE dosimeters irradiated with MRT stripe beams, high-resolution 3 D images were successfully achieved with the prototype system, enabling extraction of dose profiles. The PDDs for the CNT irradiation showed pronounced attenuation in UNC_A and UNC_C (little attenuation in UNC_F), but less <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> than that from the multibeam irradiation. The beam spacing between the three strips has an average value of 0. 9 mm while that for the 13 strips is 1. 5 mm {{at a depth of}} 16. 5 mm. The spacing between the three strips' barely varies with depth, while the 13 beams exhibit clear divergence. The three stripes show consistent PVR values (the average value is 18 at all depth). The stray light corrected image shows line profiles with reduced noise and consistent PVR values. Conclusion: MRT dosimetry is extremely challenging mostly due to little beam divergence tolerance and high dose rate required associated with the ultra small geometry. As a result, various artifacts (ring, donut, "dirty" fluid, imperfection removing the were observed and cannot be removed easily) present in the data. This preliminary application of a novel, ultra-high resolution, optical-CT 3 D dosimetry system showed promise (reduced dose diverging, more accurate dose delivery), but suggested extremely careful techniques (flood matching, mounting, rotation stability). Further work is required to further validate the accuracy of dose distribution and investigate the causes of the artifacts as well as their removal methods. Especially, the stray light correction is believed to have a substantial impact in this extreme geometry, further optimizing the correcting methods is necessary to be explored. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|Conformal {{contacts}} {{like those}} found in journal or inclined slider bearings are widely encountered in various types of machines from small engines to large turbines. These contacts involve convergent gaps {{that are used to}} separate the surfaces in relative motion and generate pressure in the lubricant film. The contacts have to carry a load while keeping friction as low as possible. Environmental and economic concerns require the machines to operate with minimal power loss. A number of design modifications have been proposed over the years in order to decrease bearing power consumption. There are indications that surface topography can have a significant and positive influence on hydrodynamic performance. Texturing of a load carrying surface is a process that would be beneficial in lubricated conformal contacts as {{it would be possible to}} obtain thicker films and reduced frictional losses. Textured lubricated contacts are analysed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code through different geometries. The effects of the texture on hydrodynamic performance of the contact are investigated. For the simulations performed, the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved under steady-state conditions. The flow is taken to be laminar and two- dimensional. A journal bearing with several dimples created on the stationary part is firstly investigated. A realistic multiphase flow cavitation model is introduced and successfully validated. It is shown that the coefficient of friction can be reduced if dimples of suitable depth are introduced. This can be achieved either in the region of maximum hydrodynamic pressure for a bearing with high eccentricity ratio or just downstream of the maximum film for a bearing with low eccentricity ratio. A new effect of pressure build-up, generated by the surface texture, has been identified at low eccentricity ratios. This pressure <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> is more extensively investigated through the study of an inclined slider bearing with a texture located at the inlet part of the contact, i. e. just downstream of the maximum film. The governing mechanism at the origin of an optimum in load carrying capacity for a smooth slider bearing is analysed and the effects of the texture on the pressure build-up and load carrying capacity are explained. The energy received by the fluid from the moving wall is converted into pressure in the first part of the converging contact and into losses in the second part. Convergence ratio can be increased until the limit where flow recirculation begins to occur is reached in order to get the greatest pressure gradient. The texture appears to reach its maximum efficiency when its depth is such that the velocity profile is stretched at its maximum without incoming recirculating flow. Thus, the wall profile shape controlling the velocity profile can be optimized for many hydrodynamic contacts. For such contacts, heat is usually produced due to shearing of the flow and the lubricant is subjected to temperature variations. Since the dynamic viscosity of the lubricant is temperature dependent, variation of the viscosity as well as frictional losses and load carrying capacity is expected. Thermal effects are analysed for different shear rates in this inlet textured slider bearing. Shear losses and subsequent heating reduce load carrying capacity compared with isothermal conditions. Texture has a positive effect in a parallel surface contact when thermal effects are considered. It has been found that for the different convergence ratios considered, the texture enables the sustaining of a load only until a certain critical shear rate is reached. This critical shear stress depends on a number of factors such as the convergence ratio and lubricant parameters including the viscosity-temperature coefficient and the reference dynamic viscosity.

The phantom for investigation was constructed with a cubic air cavity of 4 x 4 x 4 cm 3 located at the centre of a 30 x 30 x 16 cm 3 solid water slab. The cavity cube was used to resemble an extreme case for the nasal cavity. Apart from measuring the dose profiles and central axis percentage depth dose distribution, the dose values in 0. 25 x 0. 25 x 0. 25 cm 3 voxels at regions around the air cavity were obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. A mean dose value was taken over the voxels of interest at each depth for evaluation. Single-field results were added to study parallel opposed field effects. For 10 x 10 cm 2 parallel opposed fields at 4, 6 and 8 MV, the mean dose at regions near the lateral interfaces of the cavity cube were decreased by 1 to 2 % {{due to the lack}} of lateral scatter, while the mean dose near the proximal and distal interfaces was increased by 2 to 4 % due to the greater transmission through air. Secondary <b>build-up</b> <b>effects</b> at points immediately beyond the air cavity cube are negligible using field sizes greater than 4 x 4 cm 2.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the formation of}} intermetallic layers at the interface between aluminium and low-carbon steel during thermal joining using {{state of the art}} electron microscopy techniques applied both ex-and in-situ. To sample a wide range of intermetallic layer formation conditions, the well-established coating method of hot-dip aluminising, as well as more modern welding techniques such as laser beam welding (in conduction mode) and friction stir welding, are applied. The intermetallic layer always consists of brittle phases, mainly Fe 2 Al 5 and Fe 4 Al 13, which makes it a detrimental factor for mechanical properties of the assembly. Therefore, the possibility to control the thickness and morphology of this layer is of great importance for industrial processes. This requires in-depth knowledge about the influence of the joining parameters on the conditions of intermetallic layer formation, the factors affecting its growth, and finally, the resulting microstructure; all of which are discussed in this thesis. Hot-dip aluminising experiments show that a significant reduction of the intermetallic layer thickness can be obtained when the immersion process is performed at sufficiently high temperatures (above 900 °C for 30 s of aluminising). Thus counterintuitively, a high process temperature, even for extended holding times, is an effective alternative to the conventional case of simply limiting growth conditions to reduce the intermetallic layer thickness, owing to increased dissolution of the intermetallic layer in the melt. It also was shown that the intermetallic layer experiences significant growth under insufficiently rapid cooling from high temperatures. Furthermore, evidence of a carbon buildup in front of the growing layer (κ-phase, pearlite, martensite/acicular α-Fe) is presented and discussed in terms of producing a beneficial hardness gradient. The specific influence of the parameters related to the energy density delivered to the assembly (laser power and welding speed) as well as the parameters affecting mainly the heat dissipation in the weld microstructure (overlap size and lateral spot position) was established systematically. Additionally, a correlation with finite element method simulations of thermal cycles, performed for selected points at the aluminium/steel interface, allow determining that mainly the peak temperature and related cooling rate differ between particular welds. Moreover, the laser beam intensity distribution results in a variation of the intermetallic layer thickness and morphology along the weld interface. Regardless of the comparatively faster kinetics induced by the welding process, the intermetallic layer constitution is nearly the same as in case of aluminising: Fe 2 Al 5 and Fe 4 Al 13. Transmission electron microscopy shows that formation of the Fe-richer phases (Fe 3 Al, FeAl and eutectoid: FeAl + FeAl 2) occurs only in the region where the joining temperature approached the melting point of the Fe 2 Al 5 phase. The carbon <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> is not observed in the welds. Electron back-scatter diffraction, applied in a systematic study of this problem {{for the first time in}} this thesis, reveals how the ii width of Fe 2 Al 5 grains is strongly affected by the temperature and time of the joining process, leading to vanishing of the typical tongue-like morphology. In case of laser beam welding, the maximum width of Fe 2 Al 5 grains can reach up to 500 μm with the corresponding height of about 50 μm in comparison to few microns in the initial case. For the first time, using a novel in-situheating transmission electron microscopysetup, a characterisation of the FexAlyphase formation at the weld interface of friction-stir welded samples, used as model microstructures, is attempted in real time. It is shown that Fe 4 Al 13 is the first stable phase that forms under annealing, in agreement to the Walser-Bene model. In addition, a new method of the site-specific sample preparation and lift-out process for in-situheating measurements was proposed. Throughout this thesis, the literature data is discussed and compared to the experimentally obtained microstructures, which are characterised in detail by electron back-scatter diffraction techniques and transmission electron microscopy. Practical applications and potential microstructure optimisation for industrial processing is also discussed. Examples are the reduction ofthe intermetallic layer thickness through enhanced dissolution and combination of high temperature and quenching rates, as well as the tailoring of layer morphology...|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{friction}} {{materials for}} applications in disc brake systems are constituted by composite materials, specifically formulated to ensure proper friction and wear performances, under the sliding contact conditions of braking events. The bases of typical friction compound formulations usually include 10 to 30 different components bonded with a polymeric binder cross-linked in situ. Main requests {{to be fulfilled}} during braking are an adequate friction efficiency and enough mechanical resistance to withstand the torque generated by forces acting on the disc brake. Generally, each component confers distinctive properties to the mixture and their primary function can be classified in the following categories: binders confer mechanical strength to friction material guaranteeing pad compactness during use, abrasives increase friction efficiency and improve compound wear resistance, solid lubricants are responsible for stabilizing friction coefficient and contrasting the <b>build-up</b> <b>effect,</b> reinforcements increase mechanical strength improving wear minimization and stabilization. Furthermore, other modifying components such as fillers and functionalizers are involved which are {{not directly related to}} friction efficiency, e. g. cheap materials, pigments, etc. Organic brake pads for disc-brake applications are based on phenolic resin binders, generally it requires three main manufacturing steps: raw material blending, where friction compound components are mixed by blenders. Hot-molding, where blended friction mix is pressed against a metallic support at controlled high pressure (> 2 kN/cm 2), temperature (150 - 200 °C) and pressing time (3 - 10 minutes). Brake pads post-curing, to complete the hardening of polymeric binder. This last step for phenolic resin is usually performed in a batch convective oven at temperature above 150 °C for 4 - 12 h, or alternatively using a continuous process, such as IR in-line tunnel ovens where the process time is 10 - 15 min, the oven heater temperature is between 500 and 700 °C and brake pad superficial temperature is easily above 300 °C. Such kind of formulations and manufacturing process reflects the generally acknowledged state of the art as regards organic friction materials for passenger cars and light trucks. In this panorama the idea of introducing a completely inorganic binder matrix would represent nowadays an extremely appealing topic in the field considering potential improvements of this alternative approach. The complete elimination of the organic binder would reduce emission of phenol-formaldehyde hazardous derivatives generated at high-temperature e. g. volatile organic compounds, highly toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons etc… Nature and toxicity of the organic compounds released at high temperature was investigated on brake pads manufacturing and compared with preliminary studies recently published. Introducing an inorganic hydraulically bonded matrix in place of the traditional organic-based binders would lead to a substantial reduction of the total embodied energy and water of brake pads considering low-temperature manufacturing process and inorganic binders properties. Primary production embodied energy for phenolic resin is estimated in the range of 75 - 83 MJ/kg (cradle to gate), while primary production water usage (embodied water) is in the range of 94 - 282 l/kg. As a matter of comparison, examples of the embodied energy for inorganic binders typically used for concrete construction are: Portland cements 4. 9 MJ/kg, fly ash 9. 3 MJ/kg, metakaolin 1. 4 MJ/kg, silica fume 0. 036 1. 4 MJ/kg. The embodied water for these raw materials usually is less than 0. 048 l/kg. Well-known properties of such peculiar inorganic materials exploiting the hydraulic activity of binders when exposed to water or alkaline environment. The only energy demanding compound was the alkaline solution (e. g. for sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate the embodied energy is respectively of 22 MJ/kg and 16 MJ/kg). New brake pad manufacturing process allowed the substitution of commonly implied highly energy-consuming procedures with low-temperatures steps. Friction material components except binders were blended together with conventional plow-blade blender forming a dry friction-mix, then this dry friction-mix is blended with the inorganic binder and water or alkaline activators in a planetary mixer forming a wet friction-mix. Eventually wet friction mix is cold-pressed onto a metal back-plate without the need for further treatments at high temperature. It immediately emerges the energetic benefit connected to the manufacturing process of this inorganic binder-based brake pads. After brake pad production, the behavior of these inorganic materials was compared to traditional phenolic-based friction materials. Brake pads were tested on a full scale automotive brake dynamometer and on a real vehicle (in terms of performance and particle emission) following custom and international standard procedures. The aim of this work was to produce brake pad prototypes with friction material based on an inorganic hydraulic binder at performance comparable to commercial brake pads with organic-matrix based friction materials. The results obtained so far resulted particularly promising and paved the way to further developments of these novel class of friction materials. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{global market}} for {{membrane}} separation technologies is forecast to reach $ 16 {{billion by the}} year 2017 due to wide adoption of the membrane technology across various end-use markets. With the growth in demand for high quality products, stringent regulations, environmental concerns, and exhausting natural resources, membrane separation technologies are forecast to witness significant growth {{over the long term}} (Global Industry Analysts Inc., 2011). The future of membrane technology promises to be equally exciting as new membrane materials, processes and innovations {{make their way to the}} marketplace. The current trend in membrane gas separation industry is, however, to develop robust membranes, which exhibit superior separation performance, and are reliable and durable for particular applications. Process simulation allows the investigation of operating and design variables in the process, and in new process configurations. An optimal operating condition and/or process configuration could possibly yield a better separation performance as well as cost savings. Moreover, with the development of new process concepts, new membrane applications will emerge. The thesis addresses developing models that can be used to help in the design and operation of CO 2 capture processes. A mathematical model for the dynamic performance of gas separation with high flux, asymmetric hollow fiber membranes was developed considering the permeate pressure build-up inside the fiber bore and cross flow pattern with respect to the membrane skin. The solution technique is advantageous since it requires minimal computational effort and provides improved solution stability. The model predictions and the robustness of the numerical technique were validated with experimental data for several membrane systems with different flow configurations. The model and solution technique were applied to investigate the performance of several membrane module configurations for air separation and methane recovery from biogas (landfill gas or digester gas). Recycle ratio plays a crucial role, and optimum recycle ratios vital for the retentate recycle to permeate and permeate recycle to feed operation were found. From the concept of two recycle operations, complexities involved in the design and operation of continuous membrane column were simplified. Membrane permselectivity required for a targeted separation to produce pipeline quality natural gas by methane-selective or nitrogen-selective membranes was calculated. The study demonstrates that the new solution technique can conveniently handle the high-flux hollow fiber membrane problems with different module configurations. A section of the study was aimed at rectifying some commonly believed perceptions about pressure build-up in hollow fiber membranes. It is a general intuition that operating at higher pressures permeates more gases, and therefore sometimes the membrane module is tested or characterized at lower pressures to save gas consumption. It is also perceived that higher pressure build-up occurs at higher feed pressures, and membrane performance deteriorates at higher feed pressures. The apparent and intrinsic permeances of H 2 and N 2 for asymmetric cellulose acetate-based hollow fiber membranes were evaluated from pure gas permeation experiments and numerical analysis, respectively. It was shown that though the pressure build-up increases as feed pressure increases, the effect of pressure build-up on membrane performance is actually minimized at higher feed pressures. Membrane performs close to its actual separation properties if it is operated at high feed pressures, under which conditions the effect of pressure build-up on the membrane performance is minimized. The pressure <b>build-up</b> <b>effect</b> was further investigated by calculating the average loss and percentage loss in the driving force due to pressure build-up, and it was found that percentage loss in driving force is less at high feed pressures than that at low feed pressures. It is true that unsteady state cyclic permeation process can potentially compete with the most selective polymers available to date, both in terms selectivity and productivity. A novel process mode of gas separation by means of cyclic pressure-vacuum swings for feed pressurization and permeate evacuation using a single pump was evaluated for CO 2 separation from flue gas. Unlike transient permeation processes reported in the literature which were based on the differences in sorption uptake rates or desorption falloff rates, this process was based on the selective permeability of the membrane for separations. The process was analyzed to elucidate the working principle, and a parametric study was carried out to evaluate the effects of design and operating parameters on the separation performance. It was shown that improved separation efficiency (i. e., product purity and throughput) better than that of conventional steady-state permeation could be obtained by means of pressure-vacuum swing permeation. The effectiveness of membrane processes and feasibility of hybrid processes combining membrane permeation and conventional amine absorption process were investigated for post-combustion CO 2 capture. Traditional MEA process uses a substantial amount of energy at the stripper reboiler when CO 2 concentration increases. Several single stage and multi-stage membrane process configurations were simulated for a target design specification aiming at possible application in enhanced oil recovery. It was shown that membrane processes offer the lowest energy penalty for post-combustion CO 2 capture and likely to expand as more and more CO 2 selective membranes are developed. Membrane processes can save up to 20 ~ 45 % energy compared to the stand-alone MEA capture processes. A comparison of energy perspective for the CO 2 capture processes studied was drawn, and it was shown that the energy requirements of the hybrid processes are less than conventional MEA processes. The total energy penalty of the hybrid processes decreases as more and more CO 2 is removed by the membranes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Accurate {{treatment}} {{delivery in}} high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy requires correct source dwell positions and dwell {{times to be}} administered relative {{to each other and}} to the surrounding anatomy. Treatment delivery inaccuracies predominantly occur for two reasons: (i) anatomical movement or (ii) as a result of human errors that are usually related to incorrect implementation of the planned treatment. Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) were originally developed for patient position verification in external beam radiotherapy and their application has been extended to provide dosimetric information. The authors have characterized the response of an EPID for use with an 192 Ir brachytherapy source to demonstrate its use as a verification device, providing both source position and dosimetric information. Methods: Characterization of the EPID response using an 192 Ir brachytherapy source included investigations of reproducibility, linearity with dose rate, photon energy dependence, and charge <b>build-up</b> <b>effects</b> associated with exposure time and image acquisition time. Source position resolution in three dimensions was determined. To illustrate treatment verification, a simple treatment plan was delivered to a phantom and the measured EPID dose distribution compared with the planned dose. Results: The mean absolute source position error in the plane parallel to the EPID, for dwells measured at 50, 100, and 150 mm source to detector distances (SDD), was determined to be 0. 26 mm. The resolution of the z coordinate (perpendicular distance from detector plane) is SDD dependent with 95 % confidence intervals of ± 0. 1, ± 0. 5, and ± 2. 0 mm at SDDs of 50, 100, and 150 mm, respectively. The response of the EPID is highly linear to dose rate. The EPID exhibits an over-response to low energy incident photons and this nonlinearity is incorporated into the dose calibration procedure. A distance (spectral) dependent dose rate calibration procedure has been developed. The difference between measured and planned dose is less than 2 % for 98. 0 % of pixels in a two-dimensional plane at an SDD of 100 mm. Conclusions: Our application of EPID dosimetry to HDR brachytherapy provides a quality assurance measure of the geometrical distribution of the delivered dose as well as the source positions, which is not possible with any current HDR brachytherapy verification system...|$|R

It uses a current density description of the beam and a slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) for the time evolution of the modes amplitude. A fast running code (IIOMDYN), based on this model has been developed: examples of application are illustrated. 1. WTRODIJCTION The mathematical model of the interaction of high charge, not fully relativistic bunch trains with accelerating structures, that we arc going to illustrate, has already been introduced [l]. With respect o the former work we have added the field excitation term due to a localized antenna in order to study propagation effects inside the cavity during the filling and rc-filling from bunch to bunch passage. Moreover the code has beet 1 tcstcd in comparison with the results given by the reference PIC code ITACA [Z], The code I-IOMDYN now allows to follow the evolution of both the longitudinal and transverse dimensions of each bunch in a train and the energy spread of each bunch and of the whole train, taking into account space charge fields and the interaction with the fundamental and higher order modes of the accelerating structure. We recall that the model uses a current density description of the beam and supposes the envelope of the cavity modes to be varying slowly with respect to their period. ‘l-his approximation leads to only first order equations for the field amplitude, thus reducing the numerical computing time. Motion and field equations are coupled together through the driving current term. The present version deals only with TM monopolc modes: an extension to dipole modes is under development. This code can be advantageously applied to the treatment of RF guns and capture sections where the beam is not fully relativistic...|$|R

Method: Discussion paper reviewing evidence gaps identified during an appraisal of policy options to restrict alcohol marketing. Findings: Evidence requirements can be categorized as follows: (i) the size of marketing effects for the whole population and for policy-relevant population subgroups, (ii) the balance between immediate and long-term effects and the time lag, duration and cumulative <b>build-up</b> of <b>effects</b> and (iii) comparative effects of partial versus comprehensive marketing restrictions on consumption and harm. These knowledge gaps impede the appraisal and evaluation of existing and new interventions, because without understanding the size and timing of expected effects, researchers may choose inadequate time-frames, samples or sample sizes. To date, research has tended to rely on simplified models of marketing and has focused disproportionately on youth populations. The effects of cumulative exposure across multiple marketing channels, targeting of messages at certain population groups and indirect effects of advertising on consumption remain unclear. Conclusion: It is essential that studies into marketing effect sizes are geared towards informing policy decision-makers, anchored strongly in theory, use measures of effect that are well-justified and recognize fully the complexities of alcohol marketing efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{significant}} progress in the understanding and control of machine impedances has allowed obtaining beams with increasing brilliance. Dense positively charged beams generate electron clouds via gas ionization, photoemission and multipacting.

40|$|In this {{research}} the combined mild heat and high pressure (HP) treatment of two food processing targets is under study: one microbiological safety target (Escherichia coli K 12) and one quality related target (carrot Pectin Methylesterase, PME). A polynomial non-monotonous model structure fulfilling {{a number of}} constraints was identified for describing the log-linear inactivation kinetics of E. coli (at T = 5 - 45 degrees C and P = 200 - 500 MPa). Similarly, a polynomial non-monotonous model structure is used in order to describe {{the evolution of the}} carrot PME inactivation kinetics at T = 10 - 65 degrees C and P = 0. 1 - 825 MPa. Iso-rate contour plots are constructed integrating the microbial and enzymatic kinetics for the combined T and P treatments.

30|$|Overall, the {{analysis}} of the active fire and burned area anomalies for the period 2002 to 2014 for the HNP and the BZ shows a consistent pattern in fire occurrence and seasonality with peak fire activity during the Peruvian winter (dry season), and peaks in burning between July and September. These results are consistent with other findings in South America (Carmona-Moreno et al. 2005) and the tropical Andes (Bradley and Millington 2006, Armenteras-Pascual et al. 2010, Román-Cuesta et al. 2014). The active fire anomalies show a consistent higher fire activity in the HNP over the period 2002 to 2014. However, our results concerning the burned area anomalies show a consistently higher fire activity in the BZ during the high fire years in 2003, 2005, 2010, and 2014. The spatial distribution of areas burned between 2002 and 2014 shows the pattern of most recurrent burning was inside the BZ, which is in compliance with the HNP’s policy but in contradiction with local resource managers’ perceptions. However, some of the areas that burned between 2002 and 2014 were located close to the Park’s Strict Protection Zones (SPZ; Figure 6, grid map C 1, E 3, E 5, F 3, F 4 and F 5). In the HNP, the areas zoned for strict protection are spaces in which the ecosystems have been largely or completely undisturbed, or include unique, rare, or fragile species or ecosystems that must be protected from outside influences and require original environmental quality and characteristics for survival. The only activities allowed in these zones are management and environmental monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, scientific research (SERNANP 2010). The SPZs cover 4.76 % of the HNP total area. The increase in fire occurrence and the marked seasonality during the Peruvian winter are probably related to fire use. Wildfires that affect forests, native vegetation, and habitats typically begin when herders set fire to grasslands {{at the end of the}} dry season to fertilize and promote growth for the following grazing season (Sarmiento and Frolich 2002). The vegetation is dry and extremely sensitive to ignition, and these fires can spread rapidly. Most fires in the tropical Andes are human induced (Román-Cuesta et al. 2003, Manta-Nolasco and León 2004, Bradley and Millington 2006, Manta-Nolasco et al. 2010, Román-Cuesta et al. 2011) and natural ignition may frequently be limited to the rainy season (Young 2009). In Peru and Bolivia, Bradley and Millington (2006) found that the coincidence of persistent cloud cover and low fire occurrences most likely corresponds with the low probability of fires being set during the wet season rather than clouds obscuring the detection of active fires by sensor. Due to the absence of ground-based fire references, we cannot report missed fire events or areas identified as fire that are not actually fire. The fire size may also be a limiting factor as both MODIS products have size limitations (Giglio et al. 2009, Tsela et al. 2014). Furthermore, the absence of ignition source data and the low fire return interval for any given location make it difficult to confirm that the fires are human induced, even if some clusters suggest otherwise (Figure 6). Román-Cuesta et al. (2014) followed up major fire event locations in the Puna and Paramo over a nine-year period and concluded that, while fire cycles of 4 yr to 6 yr might occur, they are unlikely to correspond to the repeated burning of the same locations. They also concluded that fuel <b>build-up</b> <b>effects</b> exist but should be larger than 9 yr to 12 yr. Although human activity may locally influence fire dynamics, Román-Cuesta et al. (2014) found that the synchrony and cyclicity of fire responses in the high tropical Andes were mainly influenced by regional climate.|$|R

Regarding the river water quality modelling, two different kinds of river can be single out: large and small rivers.

We characterized the soils with respect to various physicochemical variables as well as fungal community composition, and estimated mite densities through core sampling. Organic fields had a significantly more abundant oribatid community than did conventional fields. Also the abundance of soil fungi was greater in the organically managed field.
