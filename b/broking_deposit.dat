5000|$|Spoofer's Stone, {{according}} to legend, {{was to be}} a piece of the foundation for the oldest building on campus, Old Main. One of the oxcarts hauling the limestone to the construction site <b>broke,</b> <b>depositing</b> this large limestone piece onto {{the ground in front of}} the site, and it was left there after cleanup. In the early days of the university it was a location for lovers to leave notes for one another (when fraternization between the sexes was forbidden). Later it became a popular location for men to propose marriage to women. The stone's ragged appearance is due to the tradition of breaking off a piece of the stone after a proposal, a practice which has been forbidden. The origin of the name [...] "Spoofer" [...] or who Spoofer was, is unknown.|$|R
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "which you broke, and {{you shall}} put them," [...] in [...] Rav Joseph {{noted that the}} verse employs {{superfluous}} words to describe the Tablets. Rav Joseph reasoned that the two mentionings of the Tablets teaches that both the Tablets and the fragments of the Tablets that Moses <b>broke</b> were <b>deposited</b> in the Ark. Rav Joseph deduced from this that a scholar who has forgotten his learning {{through no fault of}} his own (through old age, sickness, or trouble, but not through willful neglect) is still due respect (by analogy to the broken pieces of the tablets that the Israelites nonetheless treated with sanctity).|$|R
50|$|La Nacion {{reported}} on September 5, 2012, that Lanusse had deposited {{a total of}} about $5.4 million in an account in Santandar Rio bank in the name of The Old Fund several weeks before the Boudougate scandal <b>broke.</b> These <b>deposits</b> raised concerns at the bank, which sent a “suspicious transaction report” to the Financial Intelligence Unit. They occurred at a time when The Old Fund was making money, earning $13 million from the Front for Victory (FPV) for the printing of election ballots and contracting with the National Mint for the printing of $100 banknotes at a price of $9.6 million per month. Because of the need to pay wages as well as the debts of the former incarnation of Ciccone Calcografica, the funds Lanusse deposited in the bank were crucial for the firm's survival.|$|R
40|$|Multilayer ceramic chip {{capacitor}} Abstract. Nickel wire {{was used as}} a starting material to fabricate Ni nanoparticles. A glass substrate was placed above the wire to deposit the particles. The wire was heated by applying a d. c. voltage in the range of 2. 2 ~ 4. 0 V in oxygen atmosphere until the wire <b>broke.</b> White <b>deposits</b> were observed on the substrate after the heating. The TEM observation revealed that the deposits consisted of cubic nanoparticles with the edge lengths of 2 ~ 200 nm. The size of the particle tended to decrease with decreasing voltage. The particles were covered with films of approximately 4 nm in thickness. After reducing in hydrogen at 250 °C for 30 min, the thickness of the films on the cubic particles decreased and the XRD peak intensity attributed to NiO decreased. Consequently the particles were found to be cubic Ni nanoparticles covered with NiO thin films...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the ultrastructural appearance of explanted opacified Hydroview H 60 M intraocular lenses. METHODS: 14 explanted lenses were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and their appearance {{compared with a}} non-implanted H 60 M lens from the same time period. Wavelength-dispersive x ray spectroscopy (WDX) was performed on two opacified lenses. RESULTS: Subsurface deposits were seen in all explanted opacified lenses. These <b>deposits</b> <b>broke</b> only {{onto the surface of}} more densely opacified lenses. WDX confirmed that the deposits contained both calcium and phosphorous, consistent with their being calcium apatite. CONCLUSION: These findings challenge the widely accepted opinion that H 60 M intraocular lens opacification begins {{on the surface of the}} optic...|$|R
60|$|London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor {{sitting in}} Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud {{in the streets}} as if the waters had but newly retired {{from the face of}} the earth, and it would not be {{wonderful}} to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day ever <b>broke),</b> adding new <b>deposits</b> to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.|$|R
5000|$|The Brigittenau {{district}} lies on {{the western}} edge of the Vienna Basin. The deeper background of the Vienna Basin is the Brigittenau from flysch rocks. With the demolition of the Vienna Basin, this is a layer on top Brigittenauer only 200 m in height, however, in Zwischenbrücken 2000 m in depth. During the medium Miocene (Badener layer) the pool <b>broke</b> and <b>deposited</b> in power less freshwater sediments (sands and conglomerates). From the East the sea stored clay marl, sand and algae, whose thickness increases to the east. In the Sarmatian (upper Miocene) by the performance of the oceans a brackish fauna emerged and clay marl was deposited. Also, this layer has increasing thickness from west to east. Today, this layer on the Brigittenauer Spitz lies 10 m below the surface, at Zwischenbrücken 360 m. In the Pannonium, the increasingly silting-up freshwater lake deposited tegel. The territory of Brigittenau is covered with quaternary deposits, the thickness from 10 to(-) 15 m. The bottom layers consist mostly of gravel with sand and layers of gravel. In the area between Heiligenstadt bridge, Franz-Josef railway station, Augarten and the freight station, these layers are covered with loam, fine sand and loess-like deposits. The rubble deposits stem from the erosion processes during the ice ages (in the Pleistocene) thad deposited large quantities. In this sections, the Danube cut wide terraces, where Brigittenau is in the [...] "zone of recent meanderings", which forms the postglacial part of the terrace of the Prater. Alternating floods and ongoing relocations of the Danube bed, together with the formation of new rubble banks led to a low thickness of only [...] Above the rubble deposits are gray and brown floodplain soils.|$|R
40|$|Extraction of {{drinking}} water from the dunes in North Kennemerland had caused a permanent fall in watertable in the dune area, impairing the suitability of originally valuable soils for horticulture. At {{the request of the}} provincial government of North Holland, this area and adjoining polders were investigated. The study of profiles and fossil gley horizons allowed assessment of former water tables and provided data for the plan to replenish the reserve of fresh water by surface water from the rivers in the central parts of the coastal dune area of the Netherlands. North Kennemerland consists of old dunes (beach barriers or ridges), young dunes, peat and marine deposits. After the formation of the old marine sand and beach ridges (4000 - 2000 B. C.) the sea <b>broke</b> in and <b>deposited</b> sandy inland deltas (300 B. C.) After reconsolidation of the shore banks, peat started to grow again, till a new transgression (4 th- 9 th century) caused the deposition of the 'knip' clay, which was superficially eroded two centuries later (shallow inland lake-formation). The properties of this clay were studied and yielded a theory on genesis. The absence of CACO 3, brackish water and high adsorption of Mg 2 + seemed to be responsible for the formation of this compact sticky and poorly structured soil. <p/...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2011. Earth SciencesIncludes bibliographical references. The Lyon Mountain granite (LMG) {{is exposed}} in the Adirondack Mountains of {{northern}} New York State {{and is the}} host to numerous magnetite-apatite (Kiruna type) deposits. The results in {{this study suggest that}} the LMG was emplaced in the middle to late Ottawan orogeny between 1065 and 1045 Ma, along extensional shear zones during the onset of orogenic collapse. The original protolith, perthitic granite, has been extensively altered by subsequent Na- and K-rich fluids. Early-formed, zircon-poor clinopyroxene-magnetite-apatite deposits related to granite emplacement were remobilized and chemically modified by Na- and F-bearing fluids to form new deposits that crystallized hydrothermal zircon. Age determinations using U-Th-Pb geochronology of these hydrothermal zircon indicate that Na alteration and second generation mineralization occurred between 1040 Ma and 1000 Ma, 20 to 60 million years after crystallization of the host granite. Hafnium isotopes in zircon suggest that Lu-rich apatite and clinopyroxene associated with early-formed ore <b>deposits</b> <b>broke</b> down during Na and F alteration releasing radiogenic Hf from apatite and Zr from clinopyroxene. Granitic dikes and pegmatites which crosscut the fabric of the LMG, are dated between 1040 Ma and 1015 Ma and are contemporaneous with zircon growth in the iron ore deposits. This implies that Na alteration and Fe-mineralization were the result of externally derived fluids that penetrated the Lyon Mountain granite along extensional shear zones during orogenic collapse or by fluids related to granitic dike and pegmatite emplacement. [...] The presence of U-Th-Pb zircon ages that are 20 to 60 m. y. younger than the host granites of the magnetite ores, and the highly variable mineralogy of the ore deposits, suggests that multiple fluid and mineralization processes were responsible for ore formation and periodic modification of preexisting ores. However, the presence of magnetite-apatite ore deposits almost exclusively within the LMG implies a "fertility” requirement of the host granite and hence that mineralization was in part related to magmatism...|$|R
