5|$|Brazil {{sugarcane}} ethanol fuel program {{success and}} sustainability {{is based on}} the most efficient agricultural technology for sugarcane cultivation in the world, uses modern equipment and cheap sugar cane as feedstock, the residual cane-waste (<b>bagasse)</b> is used to process heat and power, which results in a very competitive price and also in a high energy balance (output energy/input energy), which varies from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production.|$|E
25|$|A greener {{alternative}} to burning <b>bagasse</b> {{for the production}} of electricity is to convert <b>bagasse</b> into biogas. Technologies are being developed to use enzymes to transform <b>bagasse</b> into advanced biofuel and biogas.|$|E
25|$|Each ton of b yields 740 kg {{of juice}} (135 kg of sucrose and 605 kg of water) and 260 kg of moist <b>bagasse</b> (130 kg of dry <b>bagasse).</b> Since the {{lower heating value}} of sucrose is 16.5 MJ/kg, {{and that of the}} <b>bagasse</b> is 19.2 MJ/kg, the total heating value of a ton of b is 4.7 GJ of which 2.2 GJ come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the <b>bagasse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recent {{cogeneration}} technology {{plants are}} being designed to produce from 200 to over 300 kWh of electricity per tonne of <b>bagasse.</b> As sugarcane is a seasonal crop, shortly after harvest {{the supply of}} <b>bagasse</b> would peak, requiring power generation plants to strategically manage the storage of <b>bagasse.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>bagasse</b> and <b>bagasse</b> residue is as a fuel {{source for the}} boilers in the {{generation}} of process steam in sugar plants. Dried filtercake is used as an animal feed supplement, fertilizer, and source of sugarcane wax.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} countries, in {{particular}} those {{devoid of any}} fossil fuel, have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize energy used in cane processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid. <b>Bagasse</b> is usually burned to produce steam, which in turn creates electricity. Current technologies, {{such as those in}} use in Mauritius, produce over 100 kWh of electricity per tonne of <b>bagasse.</b> With a total world harvest of over 1 billion tonnes of sugar cane per year, the global energy potential from <b>bagasse</b> is over 100,000 GWh. Using Mauritius as a reference, an annual potential of 10,000 GWh of additional electricity could be produced throughout Africa. Electrical generation from <b>bagasse</b> could become quite important, particularly to the rural populations of sugarcane producing nations.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane <b>bagasse</b> is a {{potentially}} abundant {{source of energy}} for large producers of sugarcane, such as Brazil, India and China. According to one report, with use of latest technologies, <b>bagasse</b> produced annually in Brazil {{has the potential of}} meeting 20 percent of Brazil’s energy consumption by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane <b>bagasse</b> feeds 10% of {{electricity}} generation in thermal plants in Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane {{processing}} produces {{cane sugar}} (sucrose) from sugarcane. Other {{products of the}} processing include <b>bagasse,</b> molasses, and filtercake.|$|E
25|$|Sugarcane {{is a major}} crop in many countries. It is one of {{the plants}} with the highest {{bioconversion}} efficiency. Sugarcane crop is able to efficiently fix solar energy, yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually. After harvest, the crop produces sugar juice and <b>bagasse,</b> the fibrous dry matter. This dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production. <b>Bagasse</b> can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production.|$|E
25|$|Biomass {{can be used}} {{directly}} for electricity generation, for example by burning sugar cane waste (<b>bagasse)</b> as a fuel for thermal power generation in sugar mills. It {{can also be used}} to produce steam for industrial uses, cooking and heating. It can also be converted into a liquid or gaseous biofuel. In 2015 <b>Bagasse</b> accounted for 26.1% (90.2PJ) of Australia's renewable energy consumption, while wood and woodwaste for another 26.9% (92.9PJ). Biomass for energy production was the subject of a federal government report in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Furfural {{remained}} a relatively obscure chemical until 1922, when the Quaker Oats Company began mass-producing it from oat hulls. Today, furfural is still produced from agricultural byproducts like sugarcane <b>bagasse</b> and corn cobs. The main countries producing furfural today are the Dominican Republic, South Africa and China.|$|E
25|$|Sugars {{for ethanol}} {{fermentation}} {{can be obtained}} from cellulose. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as corncobs, straw, and sawdust, into renewable energy resources. Other agricultural residues such as sugar cane <b>bagasse</b> and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be a sources of fermentable sugars.|$|E
25|$|One hectare {{of sugar}} cane yields 4,000 litres of ethanol per year (without any {{additional}} energy input, because the <b>bagasse</b> produced exceeds the amount needed to distill the final product). This, however, {{does not include}} the energy used in tilling, transportation, and so on. Thus, the solar energy-to-ethanol conversion efficiency is 0.13%.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} from ethanol production is {{primarily in the}} fermentation of the feedstock and minor changes in distillation. The feedstocks {{are the same as}} for ethanol: energy crops such as sugar beets, sugar cane, corn grain, wheat and cassava, prospective non-food energy crops such as switchgrass and even guayule in North America, as well as agricultural byproducts such as <b>bagasse,</b> straw and corn stalks. According to DuPont, existing bioethanol plants can cost-effectively be retrofitted to biobutanol production.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{needs to}} add 6000 MW of {{capacity}} {{every year in}} order to satisfy growing demand from an increasing and more prosperous population. The Brazilian Ministry of Energy has decided to generate 50% of new supplies from hydropower, 30% from wind and biomass such as <b>bagasse,</b> and 20% from gas and other sources. Wind in the North-East is strongest during the dry season when hydropower plants produce less, so the two energy sources are seasonally complementary.|$|E
25|$|Green fodders {{are used}} widely for {{intensive}} milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, <b>bagasse,</b> and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% {{of the standard}} feed mixture.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palm/vegetable oils, particularly if cane <b>bagasse</b> {{is used to}} produce heat and power for the process. Furthermore, if biofuels are used for crop production and transport, the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low. EIA estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology, the well-to-wheels CO2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane <b>bagasse,</b> cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
25|$|Bio-ethanol {{is usually}} {{obtained}} from the conversion of carbon-based feedstock. Agricultural feedstocks are considered renewable because they get energy from the sun using photosynthesis, provided that all minerals required for growth (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) are returned to the land. Ethanol can be produced {{from a variety of}} feedstocks such as sugar cane, <b>bagasse,</b> miscanthus, sugar beet, sorghum, grain, switchgrass, barley, hemp, kenaf, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, sunflower, fruit, molasses, corn, stover, grain, wheat, straw, cotton, other biomass, as well as many types of cellulose waste and harvesting, whichever has the best well-to-wheel assessment.|$|E
25|$|The world {{demand for}} sugar {{is the primary}} driver of {{sugarcane}} agriculture. Cane accounts for 80% of sugar produced; {{most of the rest}} is made from sugar beets. Sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions (sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions). Other than sugar, products derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, cachaça (a traditional spirit from Brazil), <b>bagasse,</b> and ethanol. In some regions, people use sugarcane reeds to make pens, mats, screens, and thatch. The young, unexpanded inflorescence of tebu telor is eaten raw, steamed, or toasted, and prepared in various ways in certain island communities of Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1970s, Brazil {{has had an}} ethanol fuel {{program which}} has allowed the country to become the world's second largest {{producer}} of ethanol (after the United States) and the world's largest exporter. Brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock, and the residual cane-waste (<b>bagasse)</b> is used to produce heat and power. There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline. By the end of 2008 there were 35,000 filling stations throughout Brazil {{with at least one}} ethanol pump. Unfortunately, Operation Car Wash has seriously eroded public trust in oil companies and has implicated several high ranking Brazilian officials.|$|E
25|$|Producing ethanol from {{sugar is}} simpler than {{converting}} corn into ethanol. Converting sugar requires only a yeast fermentation process. Converting corn requires additional cooking {{and the application}} of enzymes. The energy requirement for sugar conversion is about half that for corn. Sugarcane produces more than enough energy to do the conversion with energy left over. A 2006 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report found that at market prices for ethanol, converting sugarcane, sugar beets and molasses to ethanol would be profitable. As of 2008 researchers were attempting to breed new varieties adapted to U.S. soil and weather conditions, as well as to take advantage of cellulosic ethanol technologies to also convert sugarcane <b>bagasse.</b>|$|E
25|$|World {{production}} of ethanol in 2006 was , with 69% {{of the world}} supply coming from Brazil and the United States. More than 20% of Brazilian cars are able to use 100% ethanol as fuel, which includes ethanol-only engines and flex-fuel engines. Flex-fuel engines in Brazil are {{able to work with}} all ethanol, all gasoline or any mixture of both. In the US flex-fuel vehicles can run on 0% to 85% ethanol (15% gasoline) since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient. Brazil supports this population of ethanol-burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugar cane. Sugar cane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn (by about 30%), but is also much easier to extract. The <b>bagasse</b> generated by the process is not wasted, but is used in power plants to produce electricity.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol fuel is {{the most}} common biofuel worldwide, {{particularly}} in Brazil. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat, corn, sugar beets, sugar cane, molasses and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are enzyme digestion (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, distillation and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable natural gas fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as <b>bagasse,</b> the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, {{is the most}} common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also waste heat are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.|$|E
25|$|The fuel used {{depended}} {{on what was}} economically available to the railway. In the UK {{and other parts of}} Europe, plentiful supplies of coal made this the obvious choice from the earliest days of the steam engine. Until 1870, the majority of locomotives in the United States burned wood, but as the Eastern forests were cleared, coal gradually became more widely used. Thereafter, coal became and remained the dominant fuel worldwide until the end of general use of steam locomotives. <b>Bagasse,</b> a waste by-product of the refining process, was burned in sugar cane farming operations. In the US, the ready availability of oil made it a popular steam locomotive fuel after 1900 for the southwestern railroads, particularly the Southern Pacific. In the Australian state of Victoria after World War II, many steam locomotives were converted to heavy oil firing. German, Russian, Australian and British railways experimented with using coal dust to fire locomotives.|$|E
25|$|The two {{additional}} scenarios for sugarcane ethanol were {{requested by the}} Board in order to account for improved harvesting practices and the export of electricity from sugarcane ethanol plants in Brazil using energy from <b>bagasse.</b> These two scenarios {{are not to be}} considered average for all of Brazilian ethanol but specific cases when such practices are adopted in Brazil. Scenario 1 considers mechanized harvesting of cane which is gradually replacing the traditional practice of burning straw before harvesting cane, and the sale of electricity (co-generated) from power plants that are capable of exporting additional energy beyond that required for processing in the plant (co-product credit). Scenario 2 only considers the export of electricity (co-product) from power plants capable of producing the additional electricity for export. The assumptions or values for the baseline pathway published in February 2009 are the same, including the estimates of indirect land use change for all Brazilian sugarcane scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the milky}} coconut juice, they {{prepared}} {{a variety of}} seafood based dishes, such as Ensopados, Moquecas and Escabeche. The sugar cane <b>bagasse</b> was mixed with molasses and Rapadura, {{in the creation of}} coconut desserts like Cocada Branca and Preta. The remaining of the Portuguese Stew sauce was mixed with manioc flour to make a mush, which is a traditional Indian dish. In the markets of Salvador, it is possible to find stands selling typical dishes of the colonial era. In the Sete Portas Market, customers eat Mocotó on Friday nights since the 1940s, when the market was inaugurated. In the restaurants of Mercado Modelo, Sarapatel, stews and several fried dishes are served regularly. In the São Joaquim, Santa Bárbara and São Miguel markets, there are stands selling typical food. They are also sold at stands located on the beaches, specially crab stews and oysters. The restaurants that sell typical dishes are located mostly along the coast and in Pelourinho. They prepare a wide variety of recipes that take palm tree oil.|$|E
500|$|Sugarcane {{refers to}} any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus Saccharum [...] in the family Poaceae. They have been {{cultivated}} in tropical climates in South Asia and Southeast Asia since ancient times for the sucrose that is found in their stems. A great expansion in sugarcane production {{took place in the}} 18th century with the establishment of slave plantations in the Americas. The use of slavery meant that {{this was the first time}} that sugar became cheap enough for most people, who previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. It requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant's great growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant (commonly known as a sugar mill). Here, it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is then clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed by evaporation in vacuum containers. The resulting supersaturated solution is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried. Molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as <b>bagasse,</b> is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by sulfur dioxide or can be treated in a carbonatation process to produce a whiter product. [...] About [...] of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced.|$|E
2500|$|TNPL {{promoted}} by the Government of Tamil Nadu with loan assistance from the World Bank, located near Karur, is the largest producer of <b>bagasse</b> (sugarcane waste from Sugar mills) based paper {{in the world and}} the second largest paper producer in Asia. The firm produces 230,000 tonnes of printing and writing paper and consumes 1 million tonnes of <b>bagasse</b> every year.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bagasse,</b> the {{residual}} dry fiber of the cane after cane juice has been extracted, {{is used for}} several purposes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Gross {{electricity}} generation was 3,140 GWh, of which 69% came from traditional thermal sources, 10% from <b>bagasse</b> thermal plants, 10% from hydroelectricity, and 10% from geothermal sources. The remaining 1% {{corresponds to the}} electricity generated in the “isolated” systems. The detailed breakdown of generation among the different sources is as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ethanol {{research}} {{focuses on}} alternative sources, novel catalysts and production processes. [...] INEOS produced ethanol from vegetative material and wood waste. The bacterium E.coli when genetically engineered with cow rumen genes and enzymes can produce ethanol from corn stover. Other potential feedstocks are municipal waste, recycled products, rice hulls, sugarcane <b>bagasse,</b> wood chips, switchgrass and carbon dioxide.|$|E
2500|$|A layout {{with more}} or less 120° crank setting (the final setting was to be empirically determined) with HP {{cylinder}} placed on the left-hand side was fully developed by the Argentinian engineer L.D. Porta [...] for new-built modern steam locomotives all of which would have used multiple expansion, some following this 3-cylinder compound system. These included locomotives of the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement, {{one of which was}} intended for fast freight work in the US, this being a high-pressure triple-expansion machine. Strange as this layout may seem, it had a number of advantages {{from the point of view}} of equalising piston thrusts and arrangement of steam passages. It was claimed that with proper maintenance and operating procedures, such locomotives could compete with modern forms of traction. Other projects were for small 2-cylinder compounds: notably a locomotive for sugar plantations in Cuba, burning <b>bagasse.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Australia deals with efforts {{that have been}} and {{continue}} to be made in Australia to quantify and expand the use of renewable energy in the generation of electricity, as fuel in transport and in thermal energy. Renewable energy is created through electricity generation using renewable sources, such as wind, hydro, landfill gas, geothermal, solar PV and solar thermal. Total renewable energy consumption in Australia in 2015 was [...] (PJ), 5.9% of Australia's total energy consumption; compared to consumption of 265PJ in 2011/12, 4.3% of Australia's total energy consumption. Of all renewable energy consumption in 2015 (in order of contribution) biomass (wood, woodwaste and <b>bagasse)</b> represented 53%, hydroelectricity 19.2%, wind 10.7%, solar PV 5.1%, biogas 4.7%, solar hot water 3.8% and biofuels 3.6%. Bioenergy (the sum of all energy derived from plant matter) represented 61.3% (211.9PJ) of Australia's total renewable energy consumption in 2015.|$|E
60|$|From Cairo to Baton Rouge, {{when the}} river is over its banks, you have no {{particular}} trouble in the night, for the thousand-mile wall of dense forest that guards the two banks all the way is only gapped with a farm or wood-yard opening at intervals, and so you can't 'get out of the river' much easier than you {{could get out of}} a fenced lane; but from Baton Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter. The river is more than a mile wide, and very deep--as much as two hundred feet, in places. Both banks, for a good deal over a hundred miles, are shorn of their timber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations, with only here and there a scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees. The timber is shorn off clear {{to the rear of the}} plantations, from two to four miles. When the first frost threatens to come, the planters snatch off their crops in a hurry. When they have finished grinding the cane, they form the refuse of the stalks (which they call <b>BAGASSE)</b> into great piles and set fire to them, though in other sugar countries the <b>bagasse</b> is used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills. Now the piles of damp <b>bagasse</b> burn slowly, and smoke like Satan's own kitchen.|$|E
