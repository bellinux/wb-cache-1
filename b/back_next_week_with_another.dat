5000|$|Matt Kenseth led {{the field}} to the green flag at 2:16 p.m. Erik Jones made contact with Kasey Kahne exiting Turn 2 on the first lap, leading to a left-front tire cut and {{slamming}} the wall on the seventh lap in Turn 3, bringing out the first caution of the race. Jones, after being released from the infield care center, said he and Kahne, were [...] "three-wide right on the start and then the 5 ran us up into the fence. I {{was trying not to}} wreck everybody and then a couple laps later the GameStop Prey Toyota Camry cut a left-front tire. It’s just really a heartbreaking day. It’s not what we wanted, but we’ll just have to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> fast race car and try to run up front again.” He went on to finish last.|$|E
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 42 laps to go. The seventh caution of {{the race}} flew with 41 laps {{to go for a}} multi-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Johnson made contact with the rear-end of Austin Dillon and sent him sliding into the wall. Dillon overcorrected and hit the outside wall with the right-front of his car. His car turned down the track, was clipped by Ricky Stenhouse Jr., slid down and tapped the inside wall. With a number of cars trying to avoid the spinning No. 3 car, an accordion-effect led to more cars being caught up in the melee. A total of 13 cars sustained damage in the wreck. Dillon said afterwards that being on older tires, he [...] "was trying to get all I could there. It’s part of trying to win a race. We put ourselves in a position to be out front, thinking that two laps wouldn’t mean much, but it did. That’s part of it. The good Lord kept me safe tonight and gave me a good race car. You have to be gracious in defeat. We’ll come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> fast car and hopefully we can do the same thing we did today, and that’s run up front." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 14 years we've {{been doing}} South Park {{we have never}} done a show that we couldn't stand behind. We {{delivered}} our version of the show to Comedy Central and they made a determination to alter the episode. It wasn't some meta-joke on our part. Comedy Central added the bleeps. In fact, Kyle's customary final speech was about intimidation and fear. It didn't mention Muhammad at all but it got bleeped too. We'll be <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> a whole new show about something completely different and we'll see what happens to it.|$|R
5000|$|When Gallardo {{returned}}, {{there was}} no news on the case, so she came <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> still no further news. Gallardo returned each week for 25 weeks until finally Aurora was released on October 18. [...] By that time, the case was famous; locals had followed updates to {{the story in the}} local newspaper. [...] A publisher donated 1000 cards funeral invitations and a funeral home donated a casket, hearse, and cross.|$|R
500|$|Melbourne bounced <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> a {{win over}} Carlton, but lost the week after at home to Geelong, despite leading by five goals to one at quarter time. This opened up a two-win {{advantage}} for Essendon {{at the top of}} the ladder. Reviewing the match, Markwell wrote that Wilson had played better games, but that he worked as hard as anyone on the ground and was [...] "singularly unselfish". Melbourne dropped more points with a round 17 draw against South Melbourne and when the Redlegs played another draw two weeks later, this time against St Kilda, The Argus declared the premiership race all but over. Wilson recovered from a form slump to kick both of Melbourne's goals in the St Kilda match, but it was not enough to get the Redlegs over the line. He was again in the best players in Melbourne's round 20 win over Carlton. The Reds closed out the season with two more wins, but it was not enough to catch Essendon who remained undefeated and Melbourne finished runners-up. In his appraisal of the season, Markwell named Wilson in his best dozen Melbourne players.|$|R
60|$|Just as I {{was most}} satisfyingly {{accounting}} for them, our late driver alarmed me by appearing {{at the door}} and beckoning me to the outside. The occasion was nothing worse than the presence of a man who, he said, was his brother, with a horse which, upon the same authority, was without moral blame or physical blemish. If anything, it preferred a mountain to a plain country, and could be warranted to balk at nothing. The man, who was almost as exemplary as the horse, would assume the unfulfilled contract of the other man and horse with a slight increase of pay; and yet I had my doubts. The day had clouded, and I meekly contended {{that it was going to}} rain; but the man explicitly and the horse tacitly scoffed at the notion, and I yielded. I shall always be glad that I did so, for in the keeping of those good creatures the rest of our day was an unalloyed delight. It appeared, upon further acquaintance, that the man paid a hundred dollars for the horse; his brother had paid a hundred and twenty-five for the balker; but it was the belief of our driver that it would be worth the difference when it had reconciled itself to the rising ground of Frascati; as yet it was truly a stranger there. His own horse was used to ups and downs everywhere; they had just come from a long trip, and he was going to drive to Siena and <b>back</b> the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> two ladies for passengers, who were to pay him five dollars a day for himself and horse and their joint keep. He said the ladies, whose names he gave, were from Boston; he balked at adding Massachusetts, but I am sure the horse would not; and, if I could have hired them both to carry me about Italy indefinitely, I would have gladly paid them five dollars a day as long as I had the money. The fact is, that driver was charming, a man of sense and intelligence, who reflected credit even upon his brother and his brother's horse: one of those perfect Italian temperaments which endear their possessors to the head and heart, so that you wonder, at parting, how you are going to live without them.|$|R

5000|$|Under Russert, {{the program}} was {{expanded}} to one hour and became less of a televised press conference, focusing more on Russert's questions and comments; Russert also engaged in longer in-depth interviews and hosted panels of experts to discuss the topics featured in that week's broadcast.

50|$|After {{the opening}} teaser was added, contestants {{who had only}} the Jackpot Clock left and said they could come back were {{suddenly}} absent the <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> Collyer explaining that after the show it seemed inconvenient {{to come back for}} just the Jackpot Clock, and that the couple had played the Jackpot Clock after the show went off the air. This generally avoided the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> starting <b>with</b> a Jackpot Clock (which would not work with the teaser).|$|R

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "This just {{might have been}} the best Once Upon a Time so far this season, despite “Labor of Love” largely {{focusing}} on two people we’ve only just met. This episode had the perfect balance of well-paced drama, strong character arcs, and a solid twist or two to compel us to come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> This essentially recaptured that adventurous, yet emotionally grounded feeling of the first two seasons. To say I loved this {{would be one of the}} big understatements of the TV season so far." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{my opinion}} this {{argument}} is about as logical as saying that if one had been told, on entering a casino, that the odds on No 7 coming up at roulette were only 1 in 37, one would have gone away and come <b>back</b> <b>next</b> <b>week</b> or gone to a different casino. The question is whether one would have taken the opportunity to avoid or reduce the risk, not whether one would have changed the scenario in some irrelevant detail.
