Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions.|$|E

Hawley and Augustus Post, set a {{distance}} and duration record of 1,173 miles in 44 hours and 25 minutes, but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the Aero Club of America, but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a hunting trip and happened to run into them. Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero's welcome upon their safe return.|$|E
500|$|The Texians {{established}} {{themselves in}} the presidio, {{under the command of}} Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. [...] Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. [...] After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. [...] The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. [...] After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.|$|E

500|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{to set up the}} Halloween party by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who wants {{to live up to the}} expectations set by Robert California (James Spader). Robert arrives with his son Bert (David Mazouz) and remarks that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. In response, Andy asks Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to take over and re-tailor the party, much to Erin's chagrin. Andy also tells her that he wishes to speak with her at the end of the day. Worried that he intends to fire her, she asks Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) to help her make the party more [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "sexy", and he gives her a tape to show everyone. Gabe explains to the camera crew that the video is a Cinema of the Unsettling movie, an avant garde film genre defined by its disturbing images and absence of plot. Disgusted by the video, the office staff demand an explanation from Erin. In desperation, she shows them her idea for making the party more [...] "sexy": a card game with photos of genitalia. This only makes them more outraged, and Andy and Robert talk with Erin in his office regarding the incident. Erin admits her fears about their planned talk at the end of the day. Andy tells her what he wanted to talk to her about: he has reached a point in his romantic relationship where his girlfriend should be able to call him at the office, and that he wanted to clear this with Erin first since she handles all calls. Erin had not even known that he was dating someone, and is shocked to hear they have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> 31 dates so far. Erin feels dejected and leaves.|$|E

Lieutenant Henry Theodosius Browne Collier took command on 30 June 1812, but he too was invalided home before the confirmation of his promotion to Commander on 24 October 1812. [...] Command then passed to Commander Joseph Prior. As a lieutenant he had transferred to Hesper in 1809.|$|E
2500|$|He repeats what he {{told the}} Church in Buenos Aires, that he prefers a Church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the streets, rather than a Church which is {{unhealthy}} from being confined and from clinging to its own security, ... {{caught up in a}} web of obsessions and procedures” (EG 49). He calls for a more welcoming atmosphere in our communities with less focus on administering the sacraments and on Church bureaucracy, which he finds alienating some of the baptized (EG 63), He describes this bureaucracy as self-referential with [...] "a kind of theological narcissism".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Marr said [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] is [...] "possibly [...] most {{enduring}} record. It's most people's favourite, I think." [...] Despite its prominent {{place in the}} Smiths' repertoire, it is not {{generally considered to be}} representative of the band's style. Although a club favourite, it did not chart as well as expected. Most commentators put this down {{to the fact that the}} song had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> vinyl in a number of forms before being released as a single in its own right. The original track runs for nearly seven minutes; however, the 7" [...] single edit cut the length down to under four minutes. The complete version is generally used on compilations.|$|E

2500|$|The longshoremen and seamen had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> strike {{for about}} three months without much success, few other unions had joined them in sympathy, but the strikers hung on. [...] The {{shipping}} companies were determined to bring the strikers to their knees and stop the strike. [...] They had hired armed guards as well as San Francisco police to do their dirty work. [...] For several days there had been fighting on Rincon Hill. [...] On July 5, just outside the strike kitchen at 113 Steuart, an unnamed policeman fired into a crowd of longshoremen and their sympathizers, shooting several of them. [...] Two died.

This infamous day in San Francisco labor history became known as “Bloody Thursday” and galvanized {{the rest of the}} unions to support the struggle.|$|E
2500|$|With {{his gang}} nearly annihilated, James trusted only the Ford {{brothers}}, Charley and Robert. Although Charley had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> raids with James, Bob Ford was an eager new recruit. For protection, James asked the Ford brothers {{to move in}} with him and his family. James had often stayed with their sister Martha Bolton and, according to rumor, he was [...] "smitten" [...] with her. By that time, Bob Ford had already conducted secret negotiations with Missouri Governor Thomas T. Crittenden, planning to bring in the famous outlaw. Crittenden had made capture of the James brothers his top priority; in his inaugural address he declared that no political motives could be allowed to keep them from justice. Barred by law from offering a large reward, he had turned to the railroad and express corporations to put up a $5,000 bounty for each of them.|$|E
2500|$|... "Ride" [...] is a ballad, {{composed}} in the blue-eyed soul genre. In the song, Del Rey sings over a string-drenched, piano-driven melody produced by Rick Rubin. Lyrically, {{the song was}} written by Del Rey and Justin Parker, who co-wrote almost every song on Del Rey's debut album, Born to Die. In the song, Del Rey sings lines such as, [...] "I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy" [...] and [...] "Been trying' hard not to get into trouble/But I, I've got a war in my mind... so I just ride". The song opens with an audible inhalation, before Del Rey gushes out, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> that open road". The recording features mild cursing, but is otherwise laced with nostalgic lyrics and husky vocals. To further solicit the single and album, an EP was released containing remixes of [...] "Ride". Contributing artists include Sohn, MJ Cole, Eli Escobar, 14th, Wes James, and James Lavelle. Two additional remixes of the song (the Penguin Prison and the Lindstrom remixes) were released as bonus tracks with the exclusive Target release.|$|E

George Lois, who worked at Doyle Dane Bernbach for a year, before starting his own ad agency in 1960, said [...] "Mad Men is nothing more than the fulfilment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters... is glamorous and vintage....nlike the TV 'Mad Men,' we worked full, exhausting, joyous days: pitching new business, creating ideas, [...] "comping" [...] them up, storyboarding them, selling them, photographing them, and directing commercials. And our only 'extracurricular activity' was chasing fly balls and dunking basketballs on our agency softball and basketball teams!" [...] Andrew Cracknell, author of The Real Mad Men: The Renegades of Madison Avenue and the Golden Age of Advertising, also thought the show lacked authenticity, stating, [...] "One thing of which they all are all equally contemptuous", in regards to the industry's elite, [...] "is the output of Sterling Cooper. But then they have every right. None of them would ever have wanted to work for Draper and none of his departments would have got a job at any of their agencies. Particularly Draper himself.
