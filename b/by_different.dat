5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the Moon, {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen <b>by</b> <b>different</b> cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E
5|$|A {{month and}} a half prior to the film's {{official}} soundtrack release, three songs from the soundtrack were leaked into the Internet. The songs, however, were only unofficial with low quality, where the official versions were composed slightly different and sung <b>by</b> <b>different</b> artists.|$|E
5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. These {{may be of}} the same species, as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited <b>by</b> <b>different</b> species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E

5|$|Another common {{adaptation}} is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) {{that fits}} into a common basketball court sized arena. This was quite popular when races {{were held at}} imperial distances, which gradually was phased out <b>by</b> <b>different</b> organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used <b>by</b> <b>different</b> types of Fc receptors, expressed on {{different parts of the}} immune system.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fare}} {{system has been}} {{integrated}} by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated <b>by</b> <b>different</b> companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.|$|E

5|$|Book of the Dead papyri {{were often}} {{the work of}} several {{different}} scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together. It is usually possible to identify the style {{of more than one}} scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one.

5|$|Camouflage can be {{achieved}} <b>by</b> <b>different</b> methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied {{on their own or}} in combination.|$|E
5|$|Carcinus maenas is {{a common}} {{littoral}} crab. It is known <b>by</b> <b>different</b> names around the world.

5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but <b>by</b> <b>different</b> mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} {{combine to}} form syllables, {{which in turn}} combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. Acoustically, these different segments are characterized <b>by</b> <b>different</b> formant structures, that are visible in a spectrogram of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.|$|E
5|$|Each {{regiment}} and corps has distinctive insignia, {{such as a}} cap badge, beret, tactical recognition flash or stable belt. Many units {{also call}} soldiers of different ranks <b>by</b> <b>different</b> names; a NATO OR-1 (private) is called a guardsman in Guards regiments, a gunner in artillery units and a sapper in engineer units. These names do not affect a soldier's pay or role.|$|E
