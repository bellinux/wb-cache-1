5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1927 and the {{building}} was opened on June 1, 1928. The building became premier office space {{in the center of}} the city, serving as the home of major law firms among other tenants. In 1953, steel and concrete pen houses were built at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to house air conditioning equipment.|$|E
5|$|Internally, however, it {{consisted}} of various spaces. On {{either side of the}} front entrance in Corn Street were a coffeehouse and tavern, each of four storeys. Above and below the main entrance were rooms designed as strongrooms. In the centre of the Exchange was an open court, surrounded by a colonnade. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was a two-storey range, consisting of an arcade on the ground floor and a long first-floor room. Facing All Saints Lane were two four-storey houses for business or trades persons, and on the frontage to Exchange Avenue were a further three houses. Below these various elements were cellars. Those below the five houses were each separate; the others were mostly interconnected.|$|E

Dake asking to be {{appointed}} deputy U.S. marshal with authority to select his own deputies. Dake granted the request in late January and provided the Earps with some funds he borrowed from Wells, Fargo & Co. on behalf of the Earps, variously reported as $500 to $3,000.|$|E

5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of the Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay at the very <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated {{from the outside world}} by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
5|$|The cottage was {{refurbished}} in 1800 and run as an inn. Further major work {{took place}} {{in the second half of}} the 19th century when rooms were added at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and the roof was raised. In 1893 a committee of Coleridge's admirers took a lease on the property for 15 years at £15 per annum, however by 1896 an appeal had been launched to try to raise more money for the lease or eventual purchase, with the threat that it could be removed to America. They installed the commemorative plaque on the wall which was unveiled on 9 June 1893. By 1908 the campaign, chaired by the Earl of Lytton, had gained public support including that of archbichops of Canterbury and York, and raised the funds needed to purchase the property.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non-structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a wall on the second storey, and {{could be used as}} an exhibition hall. A four-storey high waterfall was built at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> which has a new three-storey extension. A stained glass skylight was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres (39,800 to 49,500 square feet), with 4,650 square metres (50,000 square feet) of retail space created for use by the store.|$|E
5|$|Town Hall (set number 10224) was {{released}} in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builders 14 and over. It was the largest modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer. It contains many interior details, such as a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies {{to look to the}} floor below. Along with the interior details the set also has many exterior details, such as four pillars on the front step and windows at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and also a clock tower {{at the top of the}} building. The date on the building, 1891 represents the birth year of the founder of LEGO and when reversed, it's the birth year of the designer, Astrid (1981). The set was priced at £149.99, $199.99 or €179.99 as released by LEGO on February 16, 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set with a wedding couple. The set had a global discontinuation date of 31 December 2014 and had a much shorter lifespan than its predecessors.|$|E

25|$|Mill No.5, {{which had}} the smelter attached, was {{completed}} by 1822. The smelting house (shown here as it looks today) had two furnaces. There was a reverberatory furnace —the large squared block in the foreground was part of this; and an older-style blast furnace, similar in design to a blowing house, but with a unique flue running up the hillside behind to a short stack. The two large standing and three fallen granite blocks towards the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> are the remains of this furnace.|$|E
25|$|These former private {{quarters}} of the Lord Lieutenant were built as five interconnecting rooms running along the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> adjoining the spine corridor that separates them from the state drawing room. Completely rebuilt in the 1960s following fire in 1941, the rooms maintain the original courtly sequence and today are used as ancillary drawing and meeting rooms to the principal apartments. The last dignitary {{to stay in the}} royal bedrooms was Margaret Thatcher, who spent a night there with her husband Dennis during one of the European Council meetings held in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Kennedy-Warren {{when it opened in}} 1931 was its air-cooling system. Three {{enormous}} fans drew cool air from Klingle Park at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and forced it through the public corridors. Residents could then open metal louvers above their hallway doors to cool individual apartments. Cross-ventilation during temperate weather was so effective that doorstops were required to prevent doors from slamming closed if left ajar. Advertisements for the Kennedy-Warren showed that the air was at least ten degrees cooler than on Connecticut Avenue. The fans were removed during the 2009–11 renovation after central air conditioning was installed.|$|E

25|$|The building's {{original}} {{elevator shaft}} {{was determined to}} be too small for a modern elevator, so a new shaft was built onto the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> along with a new stairwell. As part of the restoration requirements, the exterior of the shaft had to be a different color than the building to easily distinguish it from the original structure. Its placement on the building's southwest corner was done under guidelines from the National Park Service. The original elevator shaft was used as a conduit for electrical wiring and plumbing. Additionally, one of the original entrance doors facing East Main Street had to be restored but unusable due to a ramp for the building to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Younger’s {{plan for}} the {{interior}} called for long corridors running through each floor. Hartman-Cox consulted with Robert M. Swedroe Architects and Planners of Miami, Florida, who are experts in apartment floor plans. They proposed replacing the long corridors with two widely spaced elevators, which in some cases open directly into the apartments. Eliminating the corridors saved space, increased privacy, and allowed for much larger apartments, {{some of which are}} unusual “pass-through” apartments. They have windows on both the front and the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Only the corridor on the ground floor connects to the 1931 building. The layout of the apartments is traditional, with enclosed kitchens and formal dining rooms. The largest, with two bedrooms, two baths, and a den, is 2300 square feet.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the museums}} {{are located in}} the {{historic}} city center, occupying the old buildings of colonial origin, such as with the National History Museum, which is located in the Palacio de la Real Audiencia. La Casa Colorada houses the Museum of Santiago, while the Colonial Museum is housed in a wing of the Church of San Francisco and the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art occupies part of the old Palacio de la Aduana. The Museum of Fine Arts, though it is located in the city center, was built in the early twentieth century, especially for housing the museum and in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was laid in 1947, the Museum of Contemporary Art, under the Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile.|$|E

Caroline flushed hot, bowed haughtily to him, turned away, and taking my father's arm violently, led him off before he had had time to use his own judgment.

25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} service for Holt was held on Friday, 22 December, at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. It was led by Tom Thomas, the Dean of Melbourne, with a single eulogy given by Philip Strong, the Anglican Primate of Australia. Due {{to the absence of}} a body, there were no prayers of committal. There were 2,000 attendees within the cathedral, and many thousands more lined the nearby streets and listened through a public address system. Thirty newspaper reporters were given seats, but only one official photographer was allowed, as well as a single video camera at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Notable attendees included Lyndon Johnson from the United States; Harold Wilson and Edward Heath from the United Kingdom; Keith Holyoake of New Zealand; and leaders of six Asian countries. After the service, there was a formal reception at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Pollokshields Burgh Hall was {{designed}} by H. E. Clifford during the Scottish Renaissance in the late 19th Century and is currently listed as a significant building of Pollokshields. Built in Ballochmyle Red Freestone it was opened in 1890 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell whose coat of arms is depicted in the entrance porch in the stone of the Hall and is recorded in marble in the floor. To {{the outside of the}} building there is very high tower, housing a turret stair and balcony. Throughout the building there are detailed stained glass windows, brought from the town of Pollokshields. The lodge house adjacent comprises two flats; the Sanitary Inspector and the Park Gardener used these facilities as living accommodation and they are currently privately let by the Burgh Hall trust. In 1891 the Burgh Hall passed into the hands of Glasgow Council when the city extended its boundaries. In 1938 the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was enlarged; however this meant that the last gallery in the spacious hall had to be sacrificed in order to permit the building of an extension.|$|E
