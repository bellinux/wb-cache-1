40|$|The {{buffering}} {{capacity of a}} milk diet {{is known to be}} involved in the control of a newborn's bifidobacterial flora. Other factors could modulate the bifidobacterial flora e. g. bifidus factors present in human milk, which are growth-promoting for Bi 3 dobacterium bi$durn. The aim of this study was to investigate in gnotobiotic mice the effects of human <b>milk</b> <b>bifidus</b> factors upon colonis-ation by bifidobacteria according to the dietary {{buffering capacity}}. A high buffering capacity diet encouraged the implantation of higher numbers of bifidobacteria in monoxenic mice than a low buffering capacity one. However, supplementary feeding with human milk oligosaccharides (gynolactose) did not support the proliferation of B. bijdum, although the gynolactose bifidus factors were not destroyed during digestion. Furthermore the addition of gynolactose to a high buffering capacity diet led to the breakdown of some of the intestinal glycoproteins detected in the bifidogenic extract of stools from germfree mice. In addition, although the human milk oligosaccharides stimulated the excretion of intestinal bifidus factors when supplementing a low buffering capacity diet, they failed to do so on a high buffering capacity diet. These results suggest that the ability of human milk oligosaccharides to encourage the proliferation of B. bijidum depends upon their capacity to stimulate intestinal bifidus factors. This capacity seemed to be related to the buffering capacity of the diet. KEY woms-Bifidobacterium bifidum; Gynolactose; Germ free mice: Intestinal mucus...|$|R
40|$|A Bacillus cereus strain {{isolated}} from commercial pasteurized milk {{was used to}} evaluate the carbonation of heat-treated skim milk as a method for inhibiting B. cereus growth during incubation at 37 °C and cold storage at 4 °C of fermented <b>bifidus</b> <b>milk</b> made with the strain Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15702. Carbonated (pH 6. 0) both uncontaminated and contaminated (10 cfu ml- 1) milks were compared with their respective non-carbonated controls. The population of Bif. infantis in milk was affected neither by CO 2 nor by the presence of B. cereus. The contaminating micro-organism multiplied actively during incubation at 37 °C although growth was reduced by approximately 2 log units at 12 h of incubation in carbonated samples (5. 80 ± 0. 57 log cfu ml- 1) with respect to the non-carbonated ones (7. 37 ± 0. 01 log cfu ml- 1). Through the refrigerated storage at 4 °C, CO 2 also prevented the proteolytic degradation of contaminated samples, inhibited the formation of organic acids by B. cereus and reduced acetic acid/lactic acid ratios in fermented milk. Finally, the use of milk acidified with carbon dioxide had no detrimental effects on the sensory properties of the product. Therefore, the carbonation of heat-treated milk prior to the bifidobacteria addition may contribute to reduce the contamination risk of <b>bifidus</b> <b>milk</b> by B. cereus. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to screen the ability of two of dates (hilwa and sukary) extracts to stimulate the growth of two selected strains of Bifdobacteria (B. infantis, B. angulatum) inoculated in three milk types (cow, goats and camel), to investigate their effects on the stability of the bacteria during cooled storage and to study the feasibility of production of acceptable healthy drinks based on milk. Dates extract were prepared by hot soaking of dried fruits at 70 C, then sterilized at 120 C and finally mixed with milk typeso o at three concentration levels (10, 15, 20 % v/v). The growth study was conducted by inoculation of milk types and their pasteurized products (90 C / 20 min) with Bifidobacterium infantis or B. angulatum to contain 10 o 6 cfu/ml and incubated at 37 C for 16 h. The bacterial counts were conducted at the beginning and every fouro hours for a period of 16 hr. The inoculated milk products were also stored at 4 C for 15 days during whicho the viability of the bacteria, hydrogen ion concentration was measured and the coagulation was monitored every three days for the same periods. No significant differences were found in the growth of the two starter cultures in most treatments, regardless of the type of milk and dates extract as well as concentration and incubation time.

40|$|International audienceFermented milks {{have been}} {{proposed}} to modulate gut transit time. Reduction of long transit times may be of importance in decreasing susceptibility to some large bowel diseases. Objective: to assess gut transit time in the elderly who regularly consume milk fermented by the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis DN- 173 010 (10 /sup 8 / CFU/g) and lactic acid bacteria cultures (10 /sup 8 / CFU/g). The test product is a commercial dairy product (BIO) termed in this study as <b>bifidus</b> <b>milk</b> (BM). Design: a randomized study was performed with 4 groups: 50 subjects with a stable transit time under 40 h (UTT: 24. 6 h, SD= 1. 7) and 50 subjects with a stable transit time over or equal to 40 h (OTT: 64. 1 h, SD= 13. 3) were included. People {{included in the study}} were selected from a group of volunteers in Trieste, Italy; they were of ages 60 - 75 years. Subjects from each transit group were randomly assigned to eat, either 2 or 3 servings per day of BM (2 or 3 BM), for 2 weeks. The oro-faecal transit time was measured before and after BM consumption using a coloured marker technique. Results: in the 4 groups, comparing values before and after BM consumption, the transit time reductions were statistically significant. Values were around 10 % in UTT and around 40 % in OTT (p< 0. 001). In UTT, as well as in OTT, 3 BM were more active than 2 BM (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: in the elderly, long gut transit times were shortened by a 2 -week regular consumption of milk fermented with the strain B. animalis DN- 173 010 and lactic acid bacteria cultures.
