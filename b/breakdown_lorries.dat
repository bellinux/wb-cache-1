50|$|The {{pressed steel}} (and {{occasional}} wooden) trains and pressed steel cranes were {{made during the}} same lifespan as the lorries, although up until the mid-1950s, most trains were made of wood. The steel buses were manufactured from 1957 up until around 1970. In the Pressed Steel Lorry range there were delivery vans, petrol tankers, <b>breakdown</b> <b>lorries,</b> different types of articulated lorries, rocket launchers, car transporters, circus lorries, mobile shops, Army, RAF and emergency vehicles. There was quite a vast range of these vehicles and the cab types tended to reflect the designs of those in real life {{at that particular time}} that they were being manufactured. All nine different ranges large roadvehicles Tri-ang produced you can find on the below link Triang NL.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} are the red-bonneted tipper lorry, the bonneted Shell tanker, <b>breakdown</b> <b>lorry</b> and the London Transport double decker bus, {{with a couple}} of cranes and a few Puff Puff railway engines.|$|R
50|$|A {{tow truck}} (also called a wrecker, a {{breakdown}} truck, recovery vehicle or a <b>breakdown</b> <b>lorry)</b> is a truck used to move disabled, improperly parked, impounded, or otherwise indisposed motor vehicles. This may involve recovering a vehicle damaged in an accident, returning {{one to a}} drivable surface in a mishap or inclement weather, or towing or transporting one via flatbed to a repair shop or other location.|$|R
5|$|On 18 April 1943, a Royal Air Force <b>breakdown</b> <b>lorry</b> {{heading to}} the {{airfield}} at Ta' Qali at night with no street light hit the arch and severely damaged its Santa Venera-facing fa√ßade. The central arch was dismantled by military personnel {{under the supervision of}} the Public Works Department about two months later. The arch was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, they were never retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the simplicity, {{some models}} and their liveries {{could be quite}} clever, and Morestone/Budgie's forte {{seemed to be in}} {{selecting}} unique subjects not manufactured by other companies (Rixon 2005, p. 38). Distinct cars and smaller vehicles were wheeled air compressors, a tandem bicycle with two metal 'riders' and sidecar, a 1953 Packard Clipper convertible, a 1957 Plymouth Belvedere convertible, and a 1967 Oldsmobile 98 'town sedan' (Ragan 2000, pp. 46, 79-80). In trucks and construction, notable were the Morris [...] "Budgie Service" [...] <b>breakdown</b> <b>lorry,</b> the ERF low loader with electrical cable spools on the trailer, the strangely shaped ERF-articulated, mobile traffic [...] "Jumbo" [...] control unit, the Leyland tanker truck labeled with the phrase [...] "You'll feel a lot better if you drink milk", or the R.E.A. Express Commer van with appropriate budgerigar illustrated on the van's sides (Ragan 2000, p. 71; Rixon 2005, p. 114, 143). One intriguing model was the Thornycroft Amazon salvage lorry with crane which raises and swivels - the model also features a separate auxiliary engine (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Another would be the early-1960s GMC delivery van with Hertz markings or the Bedford tipper truck with [...] "Ham River Grit" [...] written on the sides (Rixon 2005, p. 6).One assembly detail different on Morestone/Budgie models, compared to other manufacturers, is the painting of wheels after they have been attached to axles. The appearance of painted 'hubs' at times makes a buyer wonder if the model has been 'retouched' by a collector, but this is factory spec (Ragan 2000, p. 27; Rixon 2005, p. 39).|$|R
