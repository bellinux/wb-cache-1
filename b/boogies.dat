500|$|The Crickets {{released}} their {{cover of}} the song (based on Williams' version) in 1971 on the Philips label.

500|$|Conversely, Spins March Hogan wrote, [...] "'Some of us {{just like}} to read', she sings, and hey, that {{includes}} us. But it's easier to clap for something that moves or touches you, rather than serves as an advertisement for Gaga as incomprehensible high-end brand." [...] Consequence of Sound wrote in their review, [...] "Gaga's head appears on a black swan and she <b>boogies</b> down in a clam bikini. If this doesn't bump up her sales, I no longer believe in art." [...] Hilary Hughes of Esquire said that the video [...] "hits all the marks of Gaga-esque eccentricity: glitter, boob grabs, weird animals, space, severed limbs, devotional imagery, nudity, neon, etc. It just doesn't redefine those marks, as previous music videos of Gaga's— namely [...] "Bad Romance," [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and [...] "Judas"— have". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that Gaga was parodying herself with the video and suggested that her aim was [...] "to make a video both celebrating and poking fun at her career thus far." [...] However, he considered it forgettable when compared to Gaga's previous efforts.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these <b>boogies</b> and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E

50|$|You {{play music}} because there's {{something}} {{inside of you}} that {{says you have to}} play music. Now you get bands like Fall Out Boy that are basically created in the studio. The Warped Tour changed it. Fuck it. I just don't like that shit. All the guys in the bands remind me of the jocks I hated in high school. To me a punk gig is a small sweaty club with the audience right in your face knocking over the mic stand and <b>boogying</b> off the energy.|$|R

In the 17th century, there was feverish pace in the design of châteaux for introducing exotic styles; a notable structure of this period is the Pagode de Chanteloup at Amboise, which was built between 1773 and 1778.|$|R

[...] He observed that [...] "the picture had revived the careers of virtually all the musicians that appeared in it" [...] and concluded [...] "it still sounds great and looks as good as ever through Ray Bans".|$|R

50|$|Slik's {{previous}} {{and first}} released single <b>Boogiest</b> Band in Town was unsuccessful {{in the spring}} of 1975. The song Forever And Ever, originally recorded by Kenny and appearing on their 1975 debut LP, The Sound Of Super K, was recognized having hit potential if a more heavy arrangement would be added. The band to provide such was to be Slik, after the Bay City Rollers refused the song, wanting a more heavy and progressive image and instead choosing Money Honey as their potential UK's Christmas 1975 Number One single.Forever And Ever was Slik's one and only UK number-one 1 single, although lead singer and songwriter Midge Ure went on to have two more number ones in the UK as a member of Band Aid with Do They Know It's Christmas? in 1984 and as a solo artist in 1985 with If I Was.|$|R
50|$|In mid-1985 {{his band}} Muruga UFM {{recorded}} Terroristic Activities 1990 and Rock the Planet 1993. In 1990 he, his wife Shakti, and Prem Das recorded the long-selling Journey of the Drums, a pioneering drum album. That same year, Booker joined Merl Saunders and Jerry Garcia {{to record the}} Grammy-nominated album (and subsequent DVD) Blues From the Rainforest, and their live CDs Save the Planet So We'll Have Someplace to <b>Boogy</b> (1992) and Fiesta Amazonica (1998). He also joined Babatunde Olatunji and Sikiru Adepoju to record the CD Cosmic Rhythm Vibrations 1993, which was later remixed and distributed on Chesky Records as Circle of Drums in 2005. With his Detroit-based band Free Funk, he recorded the self-titled colored vinyl LP titled Free Funk in 2005 which was released by Qbico Records. This band released the album OrthoFunkOlogy in 2008.

50|$|The {{arrival of}} Dizzy Gillespie’s big band at Antwerp in 1948 made a lasting {{impression}} on Jack Sels {{and he decided to}} start his own big band for which he would also write the music. The band made an impressive debut with some of the best musicians of that time. On trumpet: Paul Heyndrickx, Charlie Knegtel, Theo Mertens, Herman and Nick Sandy Fissette; on trombone: Nat Peck, Frans Van Dijk, Jan Mertens and Christian Kellens; on Sax: Jay Cameron, Marcel Peeters, Gene Verstrepen, Bobby Jaspar and Roger Asselberghs plus Jean Warland on bass, Francis Coppieters on piano, John Ward on drums, Rudy Frankel on conga and Vilez Bill on bongo drum. But because of financial and other problems it was hard for him to hold such a big band together. In 1951, he formed a smaller band with 15 musicians, modelled after his idol Miles Davis, and later a still smaller group with which he toured in Germany. Back in Belgium, in 1954, he recorded six tracks in <b>boogy</b> style for Ronnex Records and performed on stage with Nat King Cole.|$|R
