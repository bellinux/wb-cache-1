On April 8, after missing 19 games with the knee injury, Durant returned to action and had 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in a 123–101 win over the Pelicans. The Warriors finished the regular season with a 67–15 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 1 seed. Over the 62 games in which he played, Durant averaged career highs in field goal percentage (.537), rebounds (8.3) and blocks per game (1.6), and a career low in turnovers per game (2.2).|$|E
5|$|With the {{graduation}} of Luis Guzmán, Fernández switched {{back to his}} natural position at point guard in his junior campaign. Fernandez was a preseason All-Atlantic 10 Second Team selection. He was on the watchlist for the Bob Cousy Award honoring the top point guard in college basketball. A shooting slump that lasted {{the majority of the}} season saw his field goal percentage drop to 35.5%, his three point percentage drop to 33.3%, and his scoring average drop to 11.2 points per game. He still led the team in assists, with 3.9 per game. Fernández did miss four games {{in the middle of the}} season due to a <b>bone</b> <b>bruise</b> in his knee, but the shooting slump was more devastating and caused him to consult a sports psychologist. One of the worst games of his career was in an Atlantic 10 Tournament loss to Richmond, in which he went 3-for-17 from the field and committed three turnovers. After the game Fran Dunphy convinced Fernández that he had to take less shots and get his teammates involved.|$|E
25|$|After West Indies tour, Malinga {{suffered}} by back injury and a knee injury. With this, {{he did not}} participate to both New Zealand tour and India tour, hoping that he will recover when 2016 ICC World Twenty20 begins. However, Malinga was appointed as the captain for 2016 Asia Cup, where he was only able to play against UAE, with a match-winning bowling performance. The knee injury backed up him in the next matches and Sri Lanka lost all matches due to absence of Malinga in the team. Sri Lanka announced his World T20 team with Malinga as the captain, but continuous injuries results Malinga to stepped down from captaincy and Angelo Mathews has been named as the captain in all formats. Even though Sri Lanka felt that Malinga will recover for the World cup matches, his injury results him to ruled out of the Twenty20 squad.

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} evaluated 109 {{magnetic resonance}} studies {{in patients with}} prior ankle sprains to investigate the frequency and pattern of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises.</b> Patterns of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> were then correlated with the ligaments injured. In addition, {{the age of the}} injury was determined from medical records to correlate the presence of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> with the temporal period from injury. <b>Bone</b> <b>bruises</b> occurred in 39 % of ankle sprains. Multiple <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> were seen in 40 % of those with bone bruises; they occurred more frequently in patients with multiple ligaments injured. The marrow changes may be second-ary to impaction, rotary instability of the ankle, and mi-croavulsion vectors. Bone bruise-like lesions were seen at an average of 8. 4 weeks in age but were seen {{more than a year after}} the injury. We conclude that <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> frequently occur in patients with ankle sprains, and the marrow changes may be caused by one of the three proposed mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the biomechanical significance of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> {{in patients with}} patella dislocation. Thirty-four patients with acute dislocation of the patella were studied. Redislocations were excluded. There were 11 men and 20 women {{with a mean age}} of 18 years at the time of injury. <b>Bone</b> <b>bruises</b> were noted at the periphery of the lateral femoral condyle in 22 patients (65 %) and in 10 cases (29 %) at the medial patellar facet. The sulcus angle in patients with <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> at the lateral femoral condyle was significantly greater and tibiofemoral rotation at the knee was significantly smaller than in patients without <b>bone</b> <b>bruises.</b> In knees with small tibiofemoral rotation, a large lateral displacement force applied into the knee joint is needed to displace the patella. The flat femoral trochlea groove, however, can not reduce the force, resulting in hard impaction between the medial patella facet and the lateral femoral condyle producing <b>bone</b> <b>bruises...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review is to analyse the current knowledge, incidence, relevance, and need for treatment of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> associated with acute ankle ligament injury. A search was made of PubMed, OVID/Medline, Cochrane databases using the keyword "bone bruises" in combination with "ankle", "sprain", "management", "surgery", and "conservative treatment". No randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies were found. Only case series were retrieved. A critical appraisal for validity and usefulness of the studies revealed that the best level of evidence on this topic is represented by retrospective comparative studies. Nine studies evaluating the management of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> associated with acute ankle ligament injuries were found. The clinical prognosis of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> is generally good, with a normalization of MRI appearance usually within 6 - 12 months after trauma.

25|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that amid a slower-than-anticipated recovery for left fielder Jayson Werth from a bruised foot suffered the previous month, Werth said on July 18 that scans had revealed a fracture {{of his first}} metatarsal bone {{as well as a}} <b>bone</b> <b>bruise.</b> The Nationals made a series of roster moves on July 18 as well: Turner was designated for assignment for the second time of the month, just a day after being re-added to the roster and without appearing in a game in that brief stint, while Adams and Gott were optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse. Those roster moves cleared room for the Nationals to activate Doolittle and Madson as well as select the contract of Edwin Jackson from Syracuse, tabbing Jackson to start the first of their two-game interleague series against the Angels. The changes to the pitching staff left the Nationals unusually heavy on left-handed relievers, with four in the bullpen (Doolittle, Grace, Pérez, and Enny Romero) to three right-handers (Albers, Joe Blanton, and Madson). Making his first start for the Nationals since the 2012 season, Jackson pitched seven innings and gave up two earned runs, both on solo home runs, to earn his first win of the season. Doolittle gave up his first hit of the year to a left-handed hitter, a double high off the wall by Kole Calhoun, but nailed down the save after allowing an earned run in his first appearance for Washington. Harper came a close call at second base away from hitting for the cycle in the July 18 contest, as he was called out trying to stretch a single into a double while going 4-for-4 overall with a home run and a triple.|$|E

40|$|Occult osseous {{subchondral}} lesions, {{often referred}} to as <b>bone</b> <b>bruises,</b> have recently become a topic of interest in the orthopaedic literature. These lesions are thought to represent an area of trabecular microfracture that occurs with traumatic injury about the knee. 17 They are detected by MRI, most commonly in association with a tear of the ACL. Several reports have documented <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> in more than 80 % of patients after acute rupture of the ACL. 7, 25, 28, 30, 31 MRI-detected osseous lesions have also been noted after acute medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury and in patients without ligamentous injury. 17, 35 Although these lesions have been documented after injury to the PCL, to our knowledge, no study specifically addressing the incidence and location of <b>bone</b> <b>bruises</b> after acute PCL injury has been performed. The natural history of the MRI-detected occult osteo-chondral lesion is unclear and is a topic of current study. It has been hypothesized that these lesions may lead to degeneration of the overlying articular cartilage. 1, 13, 25, 33 It is known that patients with chronic symptomatic deficiency of the ACL or PCL are at increased risk for the develop-ment of degenerative changes of the knee. 4, 9, 14, 21 The degree to which these changes are related to chronic instability is not well understood.

In Arkansas' season opener against the Jacksonville State Gamecocks, Gragg accumulated 110 {{yards and two touchdowns}} over 7 catches, a performance for which he earned the John Mackey Tight End of the Week award. On September 9, Gragg suffered a <b>bone</b> <b>bruise</b> in his knee against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights which caused him to miss the next three games; upon return, Gragg reaggravated the injury and missed the rest of the season's matches. He finished his final season at Arkansas with 22 receptions for 289 yards and three touchdowns, while the team ended with a 4–8 record; academically, he graduated with a degree in sports management. After his senior year, Gragg participated in the NFL Scouting Combine, where he ran the fastest 40-yard dash time, the third-fastest 3 cone drill, had the third-longest broad jump, and the second-highest vertical jump of all tight ends in attendance.
