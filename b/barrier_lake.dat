40|$|In {{the domain}} of earth system, temporal-spatial and {{functional}} direct or indirect interdependent relationships between geospatial objects provide the clue {{for the study of}} complex issues. The simulation and analysis of the direct and indirect dependent relationships between these geospatial objects are always the foundation to know complex systems and make geospatial decisions. For example, in some emergencies, such as earthquakes, floods, and fire disasters, the interrelated effect and dependency among particular infrastructures and departments are usually complicated and inharmonious. Then, the potential cascading effects may cause unexpected serious consequences. Therefore, how to know more about disaster effects, and forecast corresponding cascading effects becomes quite important and fundamental to increase the capability of disaster prevention and emergency response. Based on the study on geospatial complex structure among relative objects in disasters, this paper quantifies the interrelationships between these objects, and then applies fuzzy Petri net to simulate potential cascading effects between them. Finally, an example is included to illustrate geospatial complex structure of <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> coming from the Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan Province, China. The potential cascading effects among <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> are dynamically simulated, and then the vulnerable <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> can be found out, which provides one specific theory and technical method to efficiently prevent secondary disasters of earthquakes. In the same way, the proposed method and technique would be used to simulate and analyze other geoscientific complex system structures as well...|$|R
40|$|The Torrent Dragone valley (Province of Modena) is {{affected}} by a very high incidence of landslides, due essentially to the dominant presence of argillaceous and shaly soils. This characteristic has always favoured the formation of large-scale landslides along entire slopes, which in some cases have determined the obstruction of the riverbed. Although the persistence of <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> is limited, the risk connected with a sudden evacuation of the basins, where large amounts of water can be stored, should not be underestimated. The data resulting from geomorphological surveys and aerial photo interpretation {{have led to the}} identification of the slope portions where slope movements are still active or frequently recurrent and the riverbed more susceptible to the formation of new <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes.</b> The study is completed by investigations on the mineralogical composition of the clayey soils and their geomechanical properties, in order to better understand and assess the kinetic trends of the landslides...|$|R

30|$|Landslide {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe natural hazards in the world, causing {{thousands}} of death and great property loss per year. Earthquake is a dominant trigger of landslides in mountainous and tectonic-active areas. Landslides induced by an earthquake are usually large in number, huge in scale and wide in distribution. Earthquake-induced landslides can bring great damages to property and infrastructures in developed areas, leading to economic losses and fatalities sometimes. For example, more than 20, 000 people were killed by landslides induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake with a magnitude of Ms 8.0 and 34 large <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> were produced, which threatened the residents who lived downstream of these dams [Yin et al. 2009]. In the 2010 Yushu earthquake (Ms 7.1) about 60 million in damages and 8 deaths were directly caused by earthquake-induced landslides [YP Yin et al., 2010].|$|R
50|$|Pygmy {{cormorants}} like pools {{with plenty}} of vegetation, lakes and river deltas. They avoid mountainous and cold and dry areas. They love rice fields or other flooded areas where trees and shrubs can be found. During winter they also go to waters with higher salinity, in estuaries or on <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes.</b> These are birds who can live alone or in groups and they have adapted to human presence. They build nests from sticks and reeds in dense vegetation, in trees, shrubs, willows but occasionally in reeds on small floating islets. At the end of May, beginning of June, both parents incubate for 27-30 days, and nestlings become independent after 70 days. The young are fed by their parents with small fish and other aquatic animals. This bird frequently shares {{the same type of}} habitat with egrets, herons and spoonbills.|$|R

50|$|The {{region of}} Beskid Sądecki {{belongs to the}} Dunajec river basin which belongs to the {{drainage}} divide of the Baltic Sea. The only other large river which lies {{in the region is}} the Poprad, when the Dunajec flows from the West and South, forming the border of the mountain range. All of the streams flow {{from the top of the}} mountains which then flow down the valleys onto the sides of the ridges. They are all directly coming from the Dunajec or the Poprad which then link up to the smaller rivers outside of the region, such as the rivers of Grajcarek, Kamienica and Muszynka. In the Beskid Sądecki mountain range there are not many artificial water reservoirs, there are small <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> on the ridges, an example of is the Młaka which is located in the Baniska Natural Reserve.|$|R

40|$|The Wenchuan Earthquake of {{magnitude}} 8. 0 struck Sichuan Province in south-west China on 12 May 2008. This paper presents {{an overview of}} the use of multi-source satellite images in investigating the influence of this earthquake around the epicentral area. The results show the capability of remote sensing technique for damage detection in quake-hit areas. Optical satellite images (FORMOSAT- 2 and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)) provide useful information, although rain and cloud limit the availability of satellite data. However, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor provides information in all weather conditions. Combined optical satellite and SAR data have been used to assess the damage of earthquakes, including landslides, <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes</b> and collapsed buildings. From the interferogram of two phased array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) /Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) images, more than 100 cm of ground displacement was found in Beichuan County, one of the worst-affected earthquake areas. These examples show the use of satellite images in post-disaster damage assessment and planning during the rescue operation soon after a major event such as the 12 May 2008 earthquake...|$|R

40|$|Province, China, {{triggering}} {{thousands of}} landslides, debris flows, and <b>barrier</b> <b>lakes,</b> {{leading to a}} substantial loss of life and damage to the local environment and infrastructure. This study aimed to monitor the status of geologic hazards and vegetation recovery in a post-earthquake disaster area using high-resolution aerial photography from 2008 to 2011, acquired from the Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth (CEODE), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The distribution and range of hazards were identified in 15 large, representative geologic hazard areas triggered by the Wenchuan earthquake. After conducting an overlay analysis, the variations of these hazards between successive years were analyzed to reflect the geologic hazard development and vegetation recovery. The results showed {{that in the first}} year after the Wenchuan earthquake, debris flows occurred frequently with high intensity. Resultantly, with the source material becoming less available and the slope structure stabilizing, the intensity and frequency of debris flows gradually decreased with time. The development rate of debris flows between 2008 and 2011 was 3 % per year. The lithology played a dominant role in the formation of debris flows, and the topography and hazard size in the earthquake affected area also had a...|$|R
