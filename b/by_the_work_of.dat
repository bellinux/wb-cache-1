5|$|A {{subfield}} of {{the sociology}} of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study of}} death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as {{the sociology of}} death.

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the city of}} Tapiocapolis was visually based on the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil.

5|$|In 1983 Chatwin {{returned}} {{to the topic of}} nomads and decided to focus on Aboriginal Australians. He was influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Theodore Strehlow, author of Songs of Central Australia and a controversial figure. Strehlow had collected and recorded Aboriginal songs, and shortly before his death in 1978, he sold photographs of secret Aboriginal initiation ceremonies to a magazine.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright was influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just {{before his death in}} 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed for young adults. During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and The Ed Sullivan Show. Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references to substance abuse and sexual intercourse; The A.V. Club said Henson was probably influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Ralph Bakshi, who was also active during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Andrew Strominger {{published}} a similar result which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions {{might have an}} equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five-dimensional branes. Initially, physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons. On the one hand, the Montonen–Olive duality was still unproven, and so Strominger's conjecture was even more tenuous. On the other hand, there were many technical {{issues related to the}} quantum properties of five-dimensional branes. The first of these problems was solved in 1993 when Ashoke Sen established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both electric and magnetic charge which were predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Montonen and Olive.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E
5|$|In the 5th century CE, the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta {{estimated}} the angular size of Mars as 2arc-minutes (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000km (1,296,600yojana, where one yojana {{is equivalent to}} eightkm in the Surya Siddhanta). From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6,070km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The result may have been influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.|$|E

5|$|Intrigued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Frederick Winsor, who {{had been}} championing the {{introduction}} of gas lighting in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At {{the request of the}} Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks.|$|E
5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} are influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly in italic. An engraver {{with a long}} and wide-ranging career, Granjon’s work seems to have ranged much more widely than Garamond’s focus on roman and Greek type, cutting type in italic, civilité (a cursive blackletter), and for the Vatican type in exotic alphabets including Arabic, Armenian and Hebrew. His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve {{years of his life}} Rome, where he ended his career {{in the service of the}} Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Nuts have a {{rich history}} as food. For many {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas, {{a wide variety of}} nuts, including acorns, American beech, and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years. Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E

5|$|Obsessed is a 2009 American thriller film {{directed}} by Steve Shill. The Rainforest Films production stars Idris Elba, Beyoncé, and Ali Larter. Obsessed {{tells the story}} of Lisa, an office temp played by Larter, who develops romantic feelings for her boss, Derek Charles (Elba), and repeatedly attempts to seduce him. Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyoncé), learns of Lisa's obsessive behavior, and suspects an affair. Screen Gems president Clint Culpepper conceived the basic idea of Obsessed, which was then developed by writer David Loughery, allocated a production budget of $20 million, and filmed in the summer of 2008. Obsessed was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> directors Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock, and its score was written by James Dooley. Lisa and Sharon were dressed in contrasting styles to reinforce their conflicting characters. Obsessed opened in US theaters on April24,2009, and UK theaters on May29,2009, and was distributed by Screen Gems.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to writing}} the story, Hergé had read Balzac et son monde ("Balzac and His World"), a 1955 book written {{by his friend}} Félicien Marceau. Intrigued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Honoré de Balzac, Hergé was {{inspired}} by the way in which Balzac had introduced an array of characters from his earlier work into The Human Comedy, and he subsequently adopted this trait for The Red Sea Sharks, in which a wide range of characters from The Adventures of Tintin make a reappearance. Hergé also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later reappear in Flight 714 to Sydney.|$|E
5|$|The Cunard Building's {{architectural}} style can be generally {{described as a}} mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, {{with a degree of}} Beaux-Arts influence on the building's structural form. Willink and Caldwell's designs were heavily influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around the building itself and, as the building itself is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.|$|E
50|$|Dabiri's initial {{influence}} came <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. He studied under Hannibal Alkhas, Behjat Sadr, Parviz Tanavoli and Rouin Pakbaz.|$|R

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing {{the influence of}} local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which {{emphasized the importance of}} allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{closely resembles}} van der Weyden's c. 1430–32 Madonna Standing, and seems {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Robert Campin, under whom he served his apprenticeship. It is especially close to Campin's 1430 Virgin and Child before a Firescreen, now in London; {{one of the}} last works Campin completed before van der Weyden left his studio on 1 August 1432. In both, the Virgin has large, full, breasts, her fingers pressing as she nurses the Child. There are further similarities in her facial features and expression; the colour, style, and position of her hair; as well her pose. Lorne Campbell attributes the work to van der Weyden's workshop, while art historian John Ward credits it to Campin and gives a date of c. 1435.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing parents frequent visiting to hospitalised children became the norm {{and there was}} a move towards placing homeless children with foster carers, rather than in institutions, and a move towards the professionalisation of alternative carers. In hospitals, the change was given added impetus <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> social worker and psychoanalyst James Robertson who filmed the distressing effects of separation on children in hospital and collaborated with Bowlby in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital.|$|E
