5|$|Westland also {{manufactured}} SAR {{versions of}} the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> housed inside the aircraft's sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|By early July, {{the sick}} at Kermanshah had {{recovered}} and rejoined the expedition. Camels and water <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> purchased, and the parties left Isfahan separately on 3 July 1915 {{for the journey}} through the desert, hoping to rendezvous at Tebbes, halfway to the Afghan border. Von Hentig's group travelled with twelve pack horses, twenty-four mules, and a camel caravan. Throughout the march, {{efforts were made to}} throw off the British and Russian patrols. False dispatches spread disinformation on the group's numbers, destination, and intention. To avoid the extreme daytime heat, they travelled by night. Food was found or bought by Persian messengers sent ahead of the party. These scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water. The group crossed the Persian desert in forty nights. Dysentery and delirium plagued the party. Some Persian guides attempted to defect, and camel drivers had to be constantly vigilant for robbers. On 23 July, the group reached Tebbes– the first Europeans after Sven Hedin. They were soon followed by Niedermayer's party, which now included explorer Wilhelm Paschen and six Austrian and Hungarian soldiers who had escaped from Russian prisoner of war camps in Turkestan. The arrival was marked by a grand welcome by the town's mayor. However, the welcome meant the party had been spotted.|$|E
5000|$|Reusable {{shopping}} <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> increasingly used, e.g. in E.U. {{countries where}} use of single-use plastic shopping <b>bags</b> <b>is</b> in decline.

25|$|Chips sold {{in markets}} were usually sold in tins or scooped out of {{storefront}} glass bins and delivered by horse and wagon. Early potato chip <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> wax paper with the ends ironed or stapled together.

50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of Ziploc bags varies {{among different}} products. The Ziploc Evolve <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> made using 35% less plastic than traditional Ziploc <b>bags</b> and <b>is</b> manufactured using wind power, a cleaner renewable energy source.

25|$|The {{ammonium}} nitrate, needed {{either as}} fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa {{and shipped to}} Texas City by rail before being loaded on the Grandcamp. It was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was also packaged in paper sacks, then transported and stored at temperatures that increased its chemical activity. Longshoremen reported the <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> warm to the touch before loading.|$|E

50|$|A rod {{connecting}} to the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> {{powered by a}} motor. This provides motion to remove caked-on particles. The speed and motion of the shaking depends {{on the design of}} the bag and composition of the particulate matter. Generally shaking is horizontal. The top of the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> closed and the bottom is open. When shaken, the dust collected {{on the inside of the}} <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> freed. During the cleaning process, no dirty gas flows through a bag while the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> being cleaned. This redirection of air flow illustrates why baghouses must be compartmentalized.|$|R
25|$|A zipper {{storage bag}} is {{a plastic bag}} with a sealed or zipped opening that allows for {{transparent}} viewing of stored items inside the bag. Better known under the brand name and genericized trademark Ziploc, zipper storage bags are commonly used to hold perishable foods and snacks.

25|$|In 19th century Russia and Scandinavia, pigs {{were used}} as decoys and were transported in strong canvas sacks on horse-drawn sleighs. The pigs, kept in the canvas <b>bags,</b> <b>were</b> made to squeal {{in order to attract}} the wolves. Hunters would wait at a {{distance}} to shoot the wolves when they came out after the pig. Once the wolves arrived, the hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and canvas bag. In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring the wolves behind. The wolves would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that a bag had been routed onto PA103 via the interline baggage system at Frankfurt, from the station and approximate time at which <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> unloaded from flight KM180 from Malta. Although documentation for flight KM180 indicated that all bags on that flight were accounted for, the court inferred that the bag came from that flight and that it contained the bomb. In 2009, {{it was revealed that}} security guard Ray Manley had reported that Heathrow's Pan Am baggage area had been broken into 17 hours before flight 103 took off. Police lost the report and it was never investigated or brought up at trial.|$|E

A typical example of a valve <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> the cement sack.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{strapping}} and lashing {{is often}} used to secure odd-shaped cargo such as machinery, structures, and vehicles.
