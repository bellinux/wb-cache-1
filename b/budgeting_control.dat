40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the field of environmental management and management control literature as the study resolves the existing conflicts in the literature regarding environmental management practice {{and at the same time}} develops a theoretical foundation for the management control system in the framework of the environmental management perspective. This study also introduces the moderating and mediating framework to enhance the understanding of the contingent factor related to the practice-control relationship in the environmental management perspective. Previous studies such as Henri and Journeault (2006) and Baba (2004) examined environmental management practices within manufacturing firms, thus ignoring the significant impact of the service-based sector on environmental problems. Building from Simons's (1995) four levers of management control system, this study examines empirically the influence of environmental management control systems on environmental performance in the hotel sector. This study used questionnaires and phone interview surveys to collect the data. Linear regression analysis and hierarchical (moderated) multiple regression analysis are used to analyse the data. Environmental management practice and four elements of management control systems, i. e. interactive control systems, <b>budgeting</b> <b>control</b> systems, environmental information systems and cultural control systems, are considered to have a significant influenced on environmental performance. Size, structure and chain are also included in the model as control variables. The results indicate that management control systems are not necessarily applicable in assisting hotel management to enhance their environmental performance. The <b>budgeting</b> <b>control</b> system was the only management control element which directly influences environmental performance. Environmental management practice is found not to have a direct significant effect on environmental performance. However, the results reveal that the <b>budgeting</b> <b>control</b> system and interactive control system mediate the relationship between environmental management practice and envirom-nental performance, while the environmental information system and cultural control system moderate the relationship. The results of the study are expected to have implications on the awareness in the hotel sector of how important it is for hotels to practise environmental activities beyond-compliance and integrate them with management control systems to improve their environmental performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a Salmonella control program for Dutch dairy herds. Salmonella control strategies were evaluated using a computer-based model consisting of an epidemiological module and an economics module. The epidemiological module is a state transition model of the infectivity of a herd, with {{the unit of analysis}} being the individual farm. The probability of a herd going from one state in the model to another state was derived from biological characteristics of Salmonella infections in dairy herds, and {{the presence or absence of}} risk factors. The economics module was based on partial <b>budgeting.</b> <b>Control</b> measures were modeled as influencing the risk factors. Amongst the measures considered were the prohibition of transporting potentially infectious animals and manure to farms, the culling of chronically infected animals, and herd management measures such as separate housing of groups of animal that differ in age. Alternative strategies, both compulsory and obligatory, were defined and evaluated concerning the reduction of prevalence of infected herds, the cost of a strategy, and cost-effectiveness. Results of the model suggested that a compulsory control strategy which included culling chronically infected animals and prohibiting the transport of potentially infected animals reduces the prevalence of Salmonella positive herds considerably, and was most cost-effective. Adding hygienic measures and a ban on the transport of animal manure further reduces prevalence, but only slightly, and with substantially more costs...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 107 - 111) The material {{presented in}} this thesis examines the method by which the Department of Defense manages national security. This methodology is accomplished {{through the use of}} planning, programming, budgeting, and systems analysis. Each of these phases is examined in detail. Systems analysis applications to each of these phases is also examined in detail. Before 1960, the Department of Defense was characterized by a separation between budgeting and military planning. <b>Budgeting</b> <b>control</b> and fiscal guidance were exercised by the Secretary of Defense, and planning was left to the individual armed services. Although planning extended over several years, budgeting was based on a one year projection. Furthermore, while budgeting and accounting were based on fiscal considerations, planning was not. The major problem with the old approach was the difficulty in translating military requirements into financial terms for the budget submission. When the planning, programming, budgeting system was installed in the Department of Defense, it provided a bridge between planning and budgeting. Programming was conceived to be the key element in providing this bridge. One of the purposes of bringing the planning, programming, budgeting approach to the Department of Defense was to ensure strong civilian control over military affairs. This it accomplished. A secondary purpose was to bring rationality to defense decision-making by the systematic comparison of program alternatives in terms of costs and benefits. Program elements were identified as the basic building blocks of the planning, programming, budgeting system. These program elements were categorized into major ???force programs???, which form the core of the Five Year Defense Program, and which cut across organizational lines of the individual services. Through this program, the secretary of Defense evaluates alternative defense objectives. Analysis assists by increasing the rational quality of decisions. Its greatest contribution lies in illuminating a problem; unveiling its nature, providing insights, and if necessary, pointing out the need for more information. This very explicitness makes analysis an effective device that enables all participants to understand more fully the reasons for decisions...|$|E

The study engaged a qualitative in-depth {{research into the}} challenges school governing bodies experience regarding <b>budget</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring {{based on the fact}} that <b>budget</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring are dimensional tools of financial management aimed at ensuring proper financial management and accountability. The research, grounded on social constructivism and employing a phenomenological pragmatic approach for data collection was purposely and conveniently confined to town schools in the Ekurhuleni District. Data was collected using interviews with school principals, finance officers and a treasurer and Institutional Development and Support Officers. Findings from the data indicated that while there were areas where school governing bodies did well, they faced numerous challenges in <b>budget</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring. It was found that there were challenges regarding the budgeting process in so far as budget preparation, budget implementation, and <b>budget</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring. Miscellaneous challenges influencing the <b>budget</b> <b>control</b> and monitoring process found included poor financial reporting, the low level of parental literacy which seemed to influence the meaningfulness of and realistic nature of the budgeting processes and the generic, inadequate and poor training school governors were provided with. Recommendation from the study mainly concern the provision of customised, focussed and needs-based training in financial and budget management after determining the skills audit to determine training and capacity building needs of school governors, holding principal to account for financial management as ex officio members of governing bodies, reviewing the quintile classification of schools based on the poverty index and considering the backgrounds of learners at town schools, who mostly are from previously disadvantaged backgrounds and ensuring that schools report on finances in languages parents understand and linking budgeting process to schools’ educational goals.
