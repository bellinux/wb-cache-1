5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5000|$|For {{animals that}} eat silage, a bale wrapper {{may be used}} to seal a round bale {{completely}} and trigger the fermentation process. It is a technique used as a money-saving process by producers who {{do not have access to}} a silo, and for producing silage that is transported to other locations. However, a silo is still a preferred method for making silage. In very damp climates, it is a legitimate alternative to drying hay completely and when processed properly, the natural fermentation process prevents mold and rot. Round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> is also sometimes called [...] "haylage", and is seen more commonly in Europe than in either the United States or Australia.

40|$|Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida on the {{conservation}} of forages as round <b>bale</b> <b>silage.</b> Grasses and legumes have been harvested using conventional hay making equipment and ensiled as large, round bales of high moisture forage sealed in plastic. When compared to hay, round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> offers an alternative forage conservation system that decreases {{the amount of time}} spent drying the forage prior to storage. The benefits of this system include reduced rain damage and field losses, and increased flexibility in scheduling harvesting (allowing producers to harvest for optimum forage quality and yield). When compared with chopped silage, the benefits of round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> include excellent dry matter recovery, decreased energy costs and lowered initial capital investment. Main disadvantages are increased capital investment and costs for expendable supplies (when the system is compared to hay), and the susceptibility of plastic used to store round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> to rodent damage and deterioration under intense sunlight. Field wilting (to increase dry matter at time of storage to 40 to 50 %) improves the quality of round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> made under Florida conditions. Three to four hours usually is required to accomplish this degree of wilt with bermudagrass. Adding ammonia to round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> prevents external molding but may result in undesirable fermentation characteristics, especially when high moisture, tropical forages are ensiled. Microbial inoculation (to promote lactic acid production) temporarily improves the quality of direct-cut, high moisture (< 30 % dry matter) round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> made with bermudagrass, but pH of inoculated silage generally is not lowered enough to stabilize such silage in a high-quality state. The combination of cellulase-enzyme treatment and inoculation, however, has shown potential to improve the quality of bermudagrass round <b>bale</b> <b>silage...</b>|$|E

40|$|Some of {{the best}} quality silage ever made has come from round bales sealed in plastic. On the other hand, {{some of the worst}} silage that I have ever seen {{likewise}} came from round bales in plastic. These extremes in quality are related to procedural techniques for putting up round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> and problems that can occur during storage. If proper techniques are followed, excellent quality silage can be produced, especially from late summer and fall cuttings. But if bales are not managed properly, it can be a disaster resulting in total loss of the silage. It may be easier to preserve hay crop silage in upright, trench and bunker silos than in large bales sealed in plastic. Plastic is much more susceptible to air leaks and oxygen infiltration than concrete or steel, so the ease of maintaining an oxygen-free storage environment is much less for bales surrounded by plastic than for conventional silos. The round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> system, sometimes referred to as `balage', has a number of advantages over hay and conventional silage systems: 1.

The study used four different forage fields over a two year period. Three fields were harvested on each cutting date. We measured dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, lignin, acid detergent insoluble nitrogen, crude protein, and digestible energy. Fermentation analysis measured levels of lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids, ammonia and pH on LRBS.

40|$|The {{composition}} of <b>baled</b> <b>silage</b> on Irish farms frequently {{differs from that}} of comparable precision-chop silage. This paper concerns a field-scale study designed to investigate: (a) the effects of number of layers (2, 4, 6 or 8) of polyethylene stretch film and the duration of storage (7 vs. 18 months) on the conservation characteristics of <b>baled</b> <b>silage,</b> and (b) the conservation characteristics of baled (4 layers of stretch film) and precision-chop silages. All silages were made following three durations of wilting (0, 24 or 48 h). Wilting restricted silage fermentation, with silage pH being highest (P< 0. 001) and the concentration of fermentation products lowest (P< 0. 001) for the 48 h wilt treatment. Wrapping bales in only 2 layers of polyethylene stretch film resulted in extensive visible mould growth, but mould growth was practically eliminated by the application of 4 or more layers of film. Silage fermentation characteristics were generally improved by wilting, and by 4 compared to 2 layers of stretch film. Extending the storage duration of <b>baled</b> <b>silage</b> from 7 to 18 months reduced (P< 0. 001) the concentration of fermentation products and increased in-silo fresh weight losses (P< 0. 001) and visible mould growth.

40|$|Currently, we are {{experiencing}} biodiversity loss on different spatial scales. One {{of the best}} studied taxonomic groups in decline is the butterflies. Here, we review evidence for such declines using five systematic studies from southern Sweden that compare old butterfly surveys with the current situation. Additionally, we provide data on butterfly and burnet moth extinctions in the region’s counties. In some local areas, half of the butterfly fauna has been lost during the last 60 - 100 years. In terms of extinctions, counties have lost 2 - 10 butterfly and burnet moth species. Land use has changed markedly with key butterfly habitats such as hay meadows disappearing at alarming rates. Grazed, mixed open woodlands have been transformed into dense coniferous forests and clear-cuts and domestic grazers have been relocated from woodlands to arable fields and semi-natural grasslands. Ley has increased rapidly and is used for <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> repeatedly during the season. Overall, the changed and intensified land use has markedly reduced the availability of nectar resources in the landscape. Species that decline in Sweden are strongly decreasing or already extinct {{in other parts of}} Europe. Many typical grassland species that were numerous in former times have declined severely; among those Hesperia comma, Lycaena virgaureae, Lycaena hippothoe, Argynnis adippe, and Polyommatus semiargus. Also, species associated with open woodlands and wetlands such as, Colias palaeno, Boloria euphrosyne and the glade-inhabiting Leptidea sinapis have all decreased markedly. Current management practise and EU Common Agricultural Policy rules favour intensive grazing on the remaining semi-natural grasslands, with strong negative effects on butterfly diversity. Abandoned grasslands are very common in less productive areas of southern Sweden and these habitats may soon become forests. There is an urgent need for immediate action to preserve unfertilized, mown and lightly grazed grasslands. It is also crucial to encourage that management of abandoned grasslands resumes before it is too late. In order to mitigate risks of further species loss and to work towards recovery of threatened butterfly populations using best known practises, we recommend twelve types of management measures favourable for many butterflies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Round baled silage {{of mixed}} grasses was tested as {{emergency}} food for reindeer in winter. The silage {{was made of}} leaf rich regrowth of Phleum pratense, Agrostis tenuis and Poa spp. It contained 33 - 3 % dry matter (DM), and 14. 8 % crude protein, 24. 5 % cellulose and 26. 7 % hemicellulose on a DM basis. Palatability, food intake, digestion, rumen fermentation, body mass (BM), carcass weight and gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy were investigated. A group of adult female reindeer (n = 38), were taken from natural winter pasture and fed grass silage ad libitum. The majority (78 %) of the animals were eating silage after two days and 95 % of the animals ate silage after five days. Five reindeer calves were taken from natural winter pasture and fed lichens ad libitum for 14 days after which they were starved for two days befo-re being offered silage adlibitum. The median daily DM food intake was 370 g (range 250 - 610 g) {{on the first day}} incre-asing to 810 g (range 530 - 1100 g) at days 16 to 20. Median apparent digestibility coefficient (DC) of DM was 64. 3 % (range 62. 4 - 66. 2 %). The median in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) of the silage after 72 h of microbial digestion was 68. 3 % (range 66. 6 - 71. 3 %) (Ws= 30, n,= 5, n 2 = 4, P< 0. 01). Median ruminal VFA concentration and pH were 48. 2 mM (range 38. 4 - 52. 5 mM) and 7. 0 (range 6. 95 - 7. 17), respectively, in the reindeer calves (n= 5). BM initially increased when the reindeer calves were fed silage, but stabilised after 11 days. The increased BM may have been due to an incre-ased recticulo-rumen digesta load, which amounted to 19. 6 - 23. 7 % of BM (n= 3). The carcass weight of the reindeer calves was 42. 6 ^ 44. 2 % of the BM (n= 3) after 47 days of silage feeding. The results indicate that although the round <b>bale</b> <b>silage</b> of mixed grasses of medium quality was highly palatable to reindeer it was apparantly of only limited value as an emergency food for the reindeer calves, as indicated by low DC of DM and low ruminal VFA concentration...|$|E

Chopping the herbage prior to ensiling, {{in the absence of an}} additive treatment, improved the silage fermentation.

A prospective case-control study was conducted from 2000 to 2002. Data on herd management were obtained by questionnaire and field investigation from all the 62 identified off-flavour positive farms (cases) and 62 loosely matched (for data-collection convenience) off-flavour negative farms (controls). Forty-three of the 62 cases (69 %) of milk off-flavours identified during the study period were classified as 'transmitted' (feed) off-flavours, and 9 (15 %), 6 (10 %), and 4 (6 %) as 'rancid', 'oxidized' and 'malty' off-flavours, respectively. Given this evidence and the relatively low incidence of other flavour defects in milk, only transmitted-flavour cases were considered in the analyses of risk factors. Poor air quality in the lactating cows' barn (OR = 40. 8), using <b>baled</b> <b>silage</b> as the main forage (OR = 10. 6), as well as feeding roughage before milking (OR = 253. 3) or as a free choice (OR = 3. 2) all were significantly (P < 0. 05) associated with the incidence of transmitted flavours in bulk-tank milk. Clipping the hair on the cows' udder (OR = 0. 07) and changing the bedding material more than once a day (OR = 0. 12) were protective. The finding about feeding <b>baled</b> <b>silage</b> before milking has raised hypotheses about silage composition (in particular the off-flavour compounds or their precursors) and also about the process of silage making itself.

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by <b>silage,</b> particularly <b>baled</b> <b>silage</b> wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|R
50|$|These loaders are {{a popular}} {{addition}} to tractors from 50 to 200 hp. Its current 'drive-in' form was originally designed and developed in 1958 by a Swedish company named Ålö when they launched their Quicke loader. Tractor loaders {{were developed to}} perform a multitude of farming tasks, and are popular due to their relatively low cost (compared to Telehandler) and high versatility. Tractor loaders can be fitted with many attachments such as hydraulic grabs and spikes to assist with <b>bale</b> and <b>silage</b> handling, forks for pallet work, and buckets for more general farm activities.|$|R
40|$|Objective In {{order to}} improve {{fermentation}} quality of natural grasses, their silage preparation and fermentation quality in meadow steppe (MS) and typical steppe (TS) were studied. Methods The small-scale <b>silages</b> and round <b>bale</b> <b>silages</b> of mixed natural grasses in both steppes were prepared using the commercial lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants Chikuso- 1 (CH, Lactobacillus plantarum) and cellulase enzyme (AC, Acremonium cellulase) as additives. Results MS and TS contained 33 and 9 species of natural grasses, respectively. Stipa baicalensis in MS and Stipa grandi in TS were the dominant grasses with the highest dry matter (DM) yield. The crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber and water-soluble carbohydrate of the mixed natural grasses in both steppes were 8. 02 % to 9. 03 %, 66. 75 % to 69. 47 %, and 2. 02 % to 2. 20 % on a DM basis, respectively. All silages treated with LAB and cellulase were well preserved with lower pH, butyric acid and ammonia-N content, and higher lactic acid and CP content than those of control in four kinds of silages. Compared with CH- or AC-treated silages, the CH+ AC-treated silages had higher lactic acid content. Conclusion The results confirmed that combination with LAB and cellulase may result in beneficial effects by improving the natural grass silage fermentation in both grasslands...|$|R
40|$|In southeastern {{regions of}} the US, herbage systems are {{primarily}} based on grazing or hay feeding with low nutritive value warm-season perennial grasses. Nutritious herbage such as annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) may be more suitable for preserving as baleage for winter feeding even with more intensive production inputs. Emerging in-line wrapped baleage storage systems featuring rapid wrapping and low polyethylene film requirements need {{to be tested for}} consistency of storing nutritive value of a range of annual ryegrass herbage. A ryegrass storage trial was conducted with 24 -h wilted ‘Marshall’ annual ryegrass harvested at booting, heading and anthesis stages using three replicated in-line wrapped tubes containing ten round bales per tube. After a six-month storage period, nutritive value changes and fermentation end products differed significantly by harvest stage but not by bale location. Although wilted annual ryegrass exhibited a restricted fermentation across harvest stages characterized by high pH and low fermentation end product concentrations, butyric acid concentrations were less than 1 g/kg dry matter, and lactic acid was the major organic acid in the bales. Mold coverage and bale aroma did not differ substantially with harvest stage or bale location. Booting and heading stage-harvested ryegrass baleage were superior in nutritive value to anthesis stage-harvested herbage. Based on the investigated nutritive value and fermentation characteristics, individual bale location within in-line tubes did not significantly affect preservation quality of ryegrass round <b>bale</b> <b>silages...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model which describes the {{spatial and temporal}} variation in the extent of listerial contamination within a damaged <b>silage</b> <b>bale</b> is presented. The <b>silage</b> <b>bale</b> {{is assumed to be}} split into a number of distinct sites and these sites are represented by a two dimensional lattice structure. Each site is classified in relation to its listerial composition. This classification results in three states which are dormant, active and unpopulated. Sites change state {{as a result of the}} movement of oxygen through the bale. This movement is initiated when a hole is punched in the plastic covering of the bale. The model is stochastic in nature and at any time following damage, the proportion of the bale which is contaminated is calculated. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of contaminated sites is predicted. The models are a first attempt at introducing structure into the selection process for feeding silage. We highlight areas of future research which will be invaluable for validation and practical use of the model...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} biogenic amines and mycotoxins concentrations in <b>baled</b> <b>silage</b> (mainly Poaceae family grasses) prepared in organic and conventional farms and to relate these parameters to fermentative parameters. The mean dry matter (DM) content was 364. 10 ± 93. 31 and 424. 70 ± 95. 93 g/kg in the silage from organic and conventional farms respectively. The silage samples from organic farms had 17. 00 % higher (P≤ 0. 05) tyramine (TY) than the silage from conventional farms. Conventional farm samples were characterized by 46. 00 % higher histamine (HIS) (P≤ 0. 05), 9. 80 % higher putrescine (PUT) (P≤ 0. 05), 17. 30 % higher cadaverine (CAD) (P≤ 0. 05). Aflatoxins (AFL) (total) and zearalenone (ZEN), T- 2 /HT- 2 concentrations were higher respectively 16. 00 % (P≤ 0. 05) and 13. 40 % (P≤ 0. 05), 1. 80 % (P≤ 0. 05) in the silage prepared in organic farms. Deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration was higher 42. 40 % (P≤ 0. 05) in silage from conventional farms. Volatile fatty acids (VFA), lactic acid, ethanol, pH and ammonia nitrogen showed that the silage samples from organic and conventional farms were of good quality. Our study suggests differences in biogenic amine formation or mycotoxins content in silage from organic and conventional farming, but, overall, the measured values are too low to be relevant for animal health. Furthermore, these differences might as well be due to the difference in dry matter content and plant maturity between the organic and conventional silage samples...|$|R
