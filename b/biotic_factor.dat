50|$|A <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> is any living {{component}} {{that affects the}} population of another organism, or the environment. This includes animals that consume the organism, and the living food that the organism consumes. Biotic factors also include human influence, pathogens, and disease outbreaks. Each <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> needs energy to do work and food for proper growth.|$|E
50|$|The biotic {{characteristics}} are mainly {{determined by the}} organisms that occur. For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there. For example, many wetland plants must produce aerenchyma to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic {{characteristics are}} more subtle and difficult to measure, such as {{the relative importance of}} competition, mutualism or predation. There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant <b>biotic</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Biotic factors, such as predation, disease, and {{competition}} for {{resources such as}} food, water, and mates, can also affect how a species is distributed. A <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> is any behavior of an organism that affects another organism, such as a predator consuming its prey. For example, biotic factors in a quail’s environment would include their prey (insects and seeds), competition from other quail, and their predators, such as the coyote. An advantage of a herd, community, or other clumped distribution allows a population to detect predators earlier, at a greater distance, and potentially mount an effective defense. Due to limited resources, populations may be evenly distributed to minimize competition, as is found in forests, where competition for sunlight produces an even distribution of trees.|$|E

50|$|The mallee emu-wren is {{restricted}} to open mallee woodland with spinifex understory in northwestern Victoria and southeastern South Australia. This region is rich in Triodia or as it is commonly known spinifex. The spinifex grass often grows to 1 m in height and provides the optimal habitat for the mallee emu-wren (Howe 1933). 1 Formerly classified as a vulnerable species species by the IUCN3, recent research shows that its numbers are decreasing more and more rapidly. It is consequently uplisted to endangered status in 20084. The mallee emu-wren is listed as nationally endangered under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The current estimated total population size is approximately 4,000 birds. Although this species is widely dispersed throughout the Murray Sunset Reserve its home ranges are patchy throughout the 488 km2 reserve. (Brown 2008) Recent studies {{have concluded that the}} species is wider spread than thought before. However the species is much rarer in the southern regions of the preserve (Brown 2008). Their dispersion is heavily connected to the prevalence of Triodia. Triodia is a plant genus that is grass like and forms a hummock. This <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> is the most heavily influencing factor in the dispersion of mallee emu-wren (Brown 2008).|$|E
50|$|The burrows of Paleodictyon nodosum {{are one of}} the {{few things}} about them that {{scientists}} are actually able to study, and so this is possibly the area of which we know the most about Paleodictyon nodosum.The Top of the form is shaped like a shield, with the center raised, and a lip around the outside. The center is raised approximately 5mm above the low points. Each horizontal section consists of 3 equidistant rows of tiny holes (approximately 1mm in diameter) that connect at 120° angles. Each of these horizontal sections are connected by vertical shafts (approximately 2-3mm in diameter).When actively being inhabited, the surface of the burrow is made of red metalliferous sediment. When it becomes inactive, this becomes covered with a light gray Lutite and the top flattens out. The red sediment is only found under the surface sediment in this environment, so its presence at the surface hints at a <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> which brings up the sediment.The number of rows and the spacing of these rows increases in correlation with the size of the overall form. This indicates that these burrows are a result of organic growth.The raised parts of the burrow force water to flow through the burrow. As a result of this, scientists found large numbers of foraminifera tests within the burrows. These were trapped in certain areas suggesting that the burrows were engineered to catch food as prey. However the microbial counts didn't change from the inside of the burrows to the area surrounding it.The fossil record indicates that these burrows could be one of the earliest examples of complex structures being built by animals.|$|E

40|$|The species {{richness}} (number of vascular-plant species per unit area) of sclerophyll (heathy) plant communities is examined from south-east Queensland to south-west Western Australia. The {{species richness}} of communities of heathy open forest, heathy open scrub, dry heathland and wet heathland is consistently similar throughout southern Australia and decreases from dry heathland (on laterite, coastal and inland localities) to heathy open forest, heathy open scrub and wet heathland. Investigation of related microcommunities at Cooloola, Stradbroke Island, Ku-ring-gai Chase and Wilsons Promontory indicates that species richness decreases linearly as overstorey cover increases. In post-fire succession on Stradbroke Island heathy woodland and Dark Island heathland, species richness declines linearly as overstorey cover increases during the regeneration of the community. The application of limiting fertiliser to Stradbroke Island heathy woodland and Dark Island heathland increases {{the rate of}} development of overstorey cover, with a simultaneous decrease in species richness. Species richness of the understorey strata of plant communities appears to be inversely related to the rate of development of foliage projective cover in the overstorey. If an environmental or <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> inhibits or retards the development of overstorey cover, the understorey increases in species richness. Conversely, if any environmental or <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> accelerates the development of overstorey cover, the understorey species show a reduction in species richness...|$|E

40|$|<b>Biotic</b> and abiotic <b>factors</b> are {{increasingly}} acknowledged to synergistically shape broad-scale species distributions. However, {{the relative importance}} of <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>factors</b> in predicting species distributions is unclear. In particular, <b>biotic</b> <b>factors,</b> such as predation and vegetation, including those resulting from anthropogenic land-use change, are underrepresented in species distribution modeling, but could improve model predictions. Using generalized linear models and model selection techniques, we used 129 estimates of population density of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) from 5 continents to evaluate the relative importance, magnitude, and direction of <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>factors</b> in predicting population density of an invasive large mammal with a global distribution. Incorporating diverse <b>biotic</b> <b>factors,</b> including agriculture, vegetation cover, and large carnivore richness, into species distribution modeling substantially improved model fit and predictions. Abiotic factors, including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, were also important predictors. The predictive map of population density revealed wide-ranging potential for an invasive large mammal to expand its distribution globally. This information can be used to proactively create conservation/management plans to control future invasions. Our study demonstrates that the ongoing paradigm shift, which recognizes that both <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>factors</b> shape species distributions across broad scales, can be advanced by incorporating diverse <b>biotic</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R

30|$|In many regions, {{the type}} of {{vegetation}} is the major <b>biotic</b> <b>factor</b> which directly influences the distribution and diversity of earthworms in the soil (Ramanujam, Roy, & Jha, 2000).

The change in soil texture and characteristic can influence the population of earthworm. Thus, they can serve as best indicators of several changes/factors associated with soil. Management of soil conditions can thus influence soil properties by affecting aggregation directly or indirectly to earthworm abundance and their subsequent contribution to change in soil structure.|$|E
