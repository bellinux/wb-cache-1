25|$|The {{printing}} of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623. The printer originally {{expected to have}} the book ready early, since it was listed in the Frankfurt Book Fair catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622. The first impression had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> for 5 December 1623 of Edward Dering (who purchased two); the Bodleian Library, in Oxford, received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for £24 as a superseded edition when the Third Folio became available in 1663/1664).|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the genetic {{engineering}} story was developed {{with the help of}} the series' science adviser, Anne Simon. Carter visited a friend of Simon, a scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington, who had been able to genetically manipulate flies so that they grew legs from their eyes. After Carter had created the character of The Great Mutato, he discovered that cartoonist Matt Groening had already created a character with the same name—although with different pronunciation—for a comic <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> of The Simpsons. Carter contacted Groening, who gave Carter permission to use the name.

2500|$|Transfer agents {{provide a}} variety of {{services}} to issuing companies, including: maintaining a registry of all shareholders, paying dividends and conducting proxy campaigns. Most investments in US equities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds are now held in <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> form, rather than [...] certificates {{as was the case}} as recently as the early 1970s when Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) began operations. Thus with the general acceptance of stock immobilization at the central depository, most of the registry function has shifted to reconciling daily immobilized positions with DTCC's nominee firm, Cede & Co. For example, a company has issued 10 million shares. One hundred thousand have been issued in certificated form to {{a variety of}} investors. The transfer agent keeps detailed records of these, and verifies the legitimacy of any certificate presented to it. The other 9,900,000 have been purchased by investors who hold them in <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> form through accounts at broker-dealers (retail), custodians and prime brokers (institutional). The [...] "owner" [...] of those 9,900,000 shares on the transfer agent's registry would be Cede & Co., DTCCC's nominee company.|$|E
2500|$|In about 1941, Riding renounced poetry, but it {{was fifteen}} to twenty years before she felt able to begin {{explaining}} her reasons and exploring her unfolding findings. She withdrew from public literary life, working with Schuyler Jackson on a dictionary (published posthumously in 1997) that would lead them into {{an exploration of the}} foundations of meaning and language. In April 1962, she read [...] "Introduction for a Broadcast" [...] for the BBC Third Programme, her first formal statement of her reasons for renouncing poetry (there had been a brief reference <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> in 1955).

2500|$|A {{structural}} survey in 1776 {{indicated that the}} chancel was deteriorating but the nave was sound. [...] The first round of Victorian restoration came in 1856, when a gallery was inserted; the chancel was rebuilt and heightened between 1876 and 1877; and in 1883 the nave was altered, a vestry was added, the gallery was taken out and a wooden bell-turret was built at {{the west end of}} the building. [...] Nikolaus Pevsner stated that after this work, the church was [...] "too heavily restored to be attractive", and others have noted that the present appearance of the church is derived mostly from its 19th-century modifications. [...] Later work included the replacement of the Victorian vestry with a new equivalent in the 1920s, the replacement of some stained glass and internal fittings around the same time, and the provision of modern facilities including a [...] "welcome area" [...] near the entrance, toilets, kitchen facilities, new heating and better lighting in 2000. [...] A modern wooden sculpture of Saint George has also been provided, and a late-20th-century tapestry commemorates the history of Eastergate parish and the church. [...] It makes reference to the Domesday <b>Book</b> <b>entry</b> for the village, which uses its original name of Gate.|$|E
