5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the <b>Bible.</b> On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the <b>Bible,</b> used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the <b>Bible</b> their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the <b>Bible</b> used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, Reed {{introduced}} a bill to authorize scholastic teaching of the textbook The <b>Bible</b> and Its Influence by the non-partisan, ecumenical <b>Bible</b> Literacy Project. The <b>bible</b> curriculum bill, which came {{a few years after}} Democrats opposed Republican attempts to promote teaching a translation of the scriptures, was an attempt to preempt a Republican attempt to display the Ten Commandments in schools. Faith is an area where Georgia Democrats differ from the national party. The bill passed in the State Senate by a 50–1 margin on February 3, and it eventually became law.|$|E

5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's <b>Bible,</b> but was unable to convince <b>Bible</b> scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the <b>Bible</b> until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's <b>Bible,</b> and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the <b>Bible.</b> Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the <b>Bible,</b> and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} part of the media {{franchise}} Megami Tensei, but as Last <b>Bible</b> was developed for a wider audience, including children, the series is toned down compared to Shin Megami Tensei. For instance, players meet monsters rather than demons, and most of the Last <b>Bible</b> titles take place in a medieval fantasy world. The music for the first two games was composed by Hiroyuki Yanada and Iwao Mitsunaga, while Yanada composed the music for Last <b>Bible</b> III on his own, and Manami Matsumae composed the music for Another <b>Bible.</b> Critics have been mostly positive to the series, but the games' graphics have received mixed responses. The music, particularly the one in the first two games, has been positively received. Several music albums with the games' soundtracks have been released by Sweep Records.|$|E
