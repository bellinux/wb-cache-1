40|$|Background: Despite many {{strategies}} {{employed to}} improve hand hygiene, compliance remains low at around 50 %. Two reasons {{have been identified}} for this. First, implementation strategies are rarely tailored according to assessed <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers to best practice. Secondly {{there is a lack}} of explicit theoretical basis for the assessment of these <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers to practice. Aim: This paper reports <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers to hand hygiene and an evaluation of the use of theory in assessing <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers to hand hygiene. Methods: Identification of <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers occurred through interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. In each case two different question schedules were used, one based on psychological theory and the other with no explicit theoretical underpinning. Results: Although there was considerable overlap in the <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers identified using the two schedules there were also marked differences. Conclusions: Identification of further <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> levers may help us address lack of compliance with hand hygiene. Using a theoretical framework may prompt the identification of barriers that people may not ordinarily report but which have an important impact on behaviour, particularly emotion...|$|R

40|$|Title: <b>Barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators for {{implementing}} interventions for professionals providing long-term community mental healthcare {{to people with}} severe non-psychotic mental illness: a Grounded Theory approach. Background: A major challenge in mental healthcare is {{to bridge the gap}} between research and practice. Several studies have described that community mental healthcare for people with severe non-psychotic mental illness lacks a formal structure, and a solid basis that guides interventions. In order to successfully implement a new intervention, <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators have to be explored. However, not much is known about the <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators regarding the implementation of interventions within this field. Research question: What are the <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators for the implementation of interventions for professionals providing long-term community mental healthcare to people with severe non-psychotic mental illness? Method: A qualitative study using a Grounded Theory approach was conducted. Data were gathered through a combination of fourteen individual interviews and one focus group. The focus groups and interviews were recorded using audio recording and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was based on the Grounded Theory approach. Results: This study identified six categories of <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators. Professionals perceived most barriers at the intervention level, and facilitators at the level of the organizational context. These findings correspond with the findings of other studies. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators as perceived by professionals. The surplus value was found to be the core category that drives the whole implementation. <b>Barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators cannot simply be seen as separate factors because they interact with each other within the process of implementation. Recommendations: It is recommended to use tailored implementation strategies that take the <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators found within this study into account when implementing a new intervention...|$|R

We examined personal <b>and</b> built-environment <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators to walking and physical activity and their relationship with health-related {{quality of life in}} American Indian elders. MethodsWe used descriptive statistics to report <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> facilitators to walking and physical activity among a sample of 75 American Indians aged 50 to 74 years. Pearson correlation coefficients were used {{to examine the relationship between}} health-related quality of life <b>and</b> <b>barriers</b> to walking <b>and</b> physical activity after adjusting for caloric expenditure and total frequency of all exercise activities. ResultsLack of willpower was the most commonly reported barrier. Elders were more likely to report personal as opposed to built-environment reasons for physical inactivity. Better health and being closer to interesting places were common walking facilitators. Health-related quality of life was inversely related to physical activity <b>barriers,</b> <b>and</b> poor mental health quality of life was more strongly associated with total barriers than poor physical health.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the idea of individual learning in enabling organizational change and therefore to provide a framework of key <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> enablers of learning. This study aims to analyze how individual learning approaches are applied in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany <b>and</b> which <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> enablers result from this. As individual learning in organizations evolves into and contributes to group and organizational learning, this was considered while detecting factors that influence learning. This study is based on a qualitative research using semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted with employees of different hierarchical levels from SMEs in Germany to investigate their individual learning approaches as well as existing key <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> enablers of learning in their change processes. A framework of key <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> enablers adapted to the learning approaches of these SMEs was created. The findings indicate that these SMEs rather focus on facilitating enablers to learning than on eliminating barriers. Furthermore, they show how important it is for these SMEs in Germany to consider key <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> enablers of learning and provide indications whether their effect on the change success is positive or negative. Practical implications of the most important key <b>barriers</b> <b>and</b> enablers are provided. Finally, suggestions for future research regarding how learning facilitates organizational change and what SMEs are required to do for that are made...|$|R
