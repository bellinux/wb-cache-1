5000|$|The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> {{provides}} a stable, uniform and replaceable shut off surface. Seat are usually screwed in or torqued [...] This pushes the cage {{down on the}} lip of the seat and holds it firmly to the body of the valve. Seat may also be threaded and screwed into a thread cut in the same area of the body. However this method makes removal of the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> during maintenance difficult if not impossible. <b>Seat</b> <b>rings</b> are also typically beveled at the seating surface to allow for some guiding during the final stages of closing the valve.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{referred}} to as [...] "simulated beadlocks". Streetlocks are a decorative element in which the wheel manufacturer casts or machines the appearance of bolt heads into the rim of a wheel.

50|$|Some cyclists {{have avoided}} the price premium for a {{tubeless}} system by sealing the spoke holes {{with a special}} rim strip and then sealing the valve stem and <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> with a latex sealer.

5000|$|Modern {{passenger}} vehicles and tubeless tires typically use one-piece rims with a [...] "safety" [...] rim profile.

50|$|A {{tubeless}} {{bicycle tire}} system requires a compatible tire, an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire <b>bead</b> <b>seat.</b> The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|R
40|$|A {{control valve}} that can {{throttle}} high-pressure cryogenic fluid embodies several design features that distinguish it over conventional valves designed for similar applications. Field and design engineers {{worked together to}} create a valve that would simplify installation, trim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split body. The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> contracts more than the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the split body together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|R
50|$|A {{tubeless}} tire system requires an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> — and a compatible tire.Universal System Tubeless (UST), originally developed by Mavic, Michelin and Hutchinson for mountain bikes is the most common system of {{tubeless tire}}s/rims for bicycles. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|R
50|$|Most road {{bicycles}} use 700C bicycle wheels (622 mm <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> diameter) {{with matching}} 20-25 mm wide tires. The wheels greatly affect {{the performance of}} a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the tire. For hill climbs, however, energy losses due to the higher weight of most aerodynamic rims are greater than the aerodynamic drag reduction that they offer, so a traditional lighter box-sectioned rim is often used to make it go faster.|$|R
40|$|Intake and {{exhaust valves}} {{operating}} in diesel engines for naval propulsion suffer from several problems {{due to the}} combined and synergistic effects of mechanical stresses and a chemically harsh environment. Degradation mechanisms like wear and corrosion act on different sections of the valve, {{with the result that}} each part undergoes a different kind of damage. The present work particularly focuses on degradation phenomena such as low temperature corrosion and erosive wear on the stem; hot corrosion {{on the bottom of the}} head of the valve; wear on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring.</b> In order to prevent the valves from degrading, a possible solution is the application of protective coatings that may extend the service life of the components by preserving the mechanical properties of substrate materials, while improving the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the surface. The objective of this study is the development, testing and optimization of a system of corrosion and wear resistant coatings for the stem, bottom and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of the valves. The analysis of the degradation mechanisms occurring on each section of the valves led to the selection of materials that could be suitable for the protection of the substrate. Specifically, two different kinds of ceramic-metallic coatings were selected for the protection of the stem and the bottom of the valves, while a modification of the state-of-the art coating applied on the <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> was performed...|$|R
40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, nozzle needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> and nozzle needle seat tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21. 65 %, which was obtained at 90 ° needle <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> and 45 ° needle seat tip, and + 15 % bucket size and 92 ° angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the + 15 % bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water {{in the middle of the}} bucket, in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed. It is expected that the result on the appropriate size and angle attack of bucket at specific nozzle <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>seat</b> tip of this experiment can be manufactured commercially in the future for achieving maximum Pelton turbine efficiency...|$|R
50|$|The {{tire bead}} {{is the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The <b>bead</b> <b>seats</b> tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal rate. This process is used in achieving finer surfaces and closer fits, correction of minor imperfections, and maintaining close tolerances. During the process of lapping, the mechanisms of surface formation and removal rate are decisively influenced by the movement type of the individual grains within the lapping abrasive. A gate valve is used to start and {{stop the flow of}} fluid. So the wedge and <b>seat</b> <b>ring</b> of a valve are in continuous pressure of fluid flow and due to opening and closing of valve these component get wear and they need lapping during reconditioning. This paper will share the need, requirement and application of lapping during the reconditioning of valve. This paper will explore the current working condition of lapping machine in valve industry. It will elaborate the effect of abrasive particals, working speed, surface roughness and other related parameters. What are the difficulties they are facing during the valve reconditioning related to lapping, will be disscussed. Current set up and the changes required in this model are suggested with the proposed model. Key words: Lapping process, wedge, <b>seat</b> <b>ring,</b> abrasive particles. I...|$|R

50|$|Tires {{are complex}} {{composite}} structures made {{of many different}} components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV. These include variations in: tread extrusion thickness and symmetry, tread splice, body ply splices, inner liner splice, bead symmetry, turn-up symmetry, building drum alignment, transfer ring alignment, curing press <b>bead</b> <b>seating,</b> shaping bladder alignment and control, mold runout, and mold alignment. All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things.|$|R
40|$|UMTRI has {{completed}} an experimental program {{to determine the}} inflation pressure required to fail a sample of thirty individual 16 inch light truck tires when those tires are mounted on 16. 5 inch wheels.

When this is the case, the tire bead may make and air tight seal against the wheel, even though the bead is not properly seated. If inflation pressure is than elevated, the improper seating of the tire can generate excessive stresses in the bead wire, eventually resulting in failure of the wire and explosive deflation of the tire as {{the integrity of the}} <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> is lost.

40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly radial load and inflation pressure. The radial load is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four tires to balance the weight of a car. The radial load is applied to the rim at the <b>bead</b> <b>seats</b> with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the rim flange. This project studied the influence of the radial load and the tire inflation pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim. A computer aided design model of an aluminum alloy wheel rim is analyzed using ANSYS. The geometrical parameters of the rim is further optimized to reduce weight...|$|R
