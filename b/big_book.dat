5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the <b>big</b> <b>book</b> on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows that prayer helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the <b>Big</b> <b>Book</b> of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E

In the works since 2008, the book was to be published by Random House. After a conflict between Proyect and Joyce Brabner, Brabner announced that she would hold the book back indefinitely. As of April 2014, those four titles have not been released.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} proven {{the superiority of}} using mother tongue in {{improving}} the pupils‟ performance. Research results revealed that using a language familiar to the pupils facilitates reading, writing and learning new concepts. However, at present, teachers are confronted with the insufficiency of instructional materials written in the local dialect and accepted by the end-users as possessing the qualities that could produce the desired learning outcomes. This descriptive evaluative research was conducted to address this problem. It determined the level of acceptability of the six researcher-made <b>big</b> <b>books</b> as mother tongue-based reading materials in Bulusan dialect for Grade 1 pupils. The <b>big</b> <b>books</b> were utilized by 11 Grade 1 teachers of Bulusan District to their pupils and were evaluated along suitability and appropriateness of the materials, visual appeal {{and quality of the}} story using checklist and open-ended questionnaire. Same materials were assessed by eight expert jurors. Findings showed that the <b>big</b> <b>books</b> possessed the desired qualities that made them very much acceptable to the Grade 1 teachers and much acceptable to the expert jurors. The comments and suggestions of the respondents served as inputs in the enhancement and revision of the six <b>big</b> <b>books...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} of using stories for language and literacy development {{particularly in the}} areas of vocabulary(Cameron, 2001; Elley, 1989; Penno, Wilkinson & Moore 2002;Hargrave & Senechal, 2000) and reading comprehension. Yet, much is still unknown in second language (L 2) contexts. This paper investigates the use of <b>Big</b> <b>Books</b> in primary English in Malaysia where English is taught as an official second language. It draws on transcript data from one teacher from one primary school to illustrate how students’ active participation and interest in language learning emerged as the teacher introduced <b>Big</b> <b>Books</b> instead of the textbook. Our data shows that practice with <b>Big</b> <b>Books</b> changes the interaction patterns and learning opportunities. Students were actively involved and they contributed to the discussions and made spontaneous comments about the stories. Most importantly,the teacher’s elicitation skill is essential in enhancing students’ learning. The Ministry of Education’s hopes to provide more active engagement and to increase students’ interests and motivation through stories were achieved...|$|R
500|$|So far, {{there have}} been two {{occasions}} in which no award has been presented. Bent did not offer a prize in 1987 and 1991, as he felt there was no title that was odd enough to deserve the prize. The prize has become noteworthy enough that, in 2004, The Bookseller castigated publishers for choosing titles with a view to winning it, saying, [...] "There were too many self-consciously titled entries – presumably in a bid to emulate the 2003 champion, <b>Big</b> <b>Book</b> of Lesbian Horse Stories". Bent has also expressed his dislike of people voting for ruder titles, stating that he himself would not have voted for the 2007 winner If You Want Closure in Your Relationship, Start with Your Legs.|$|E
500|$|Life in Hell {{became popular}} almost immediately. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader, offered to publish [...] "Love is Hell", {{a series of}} relationship-themed Life in Hell strips, in book form. Released a month later, the book was an {{underground}} success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Work is Hell soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled merchandising for Life in Hell. Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated Life in Hell, Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates Life in Hell. At {{the end of its}} run, Life in Hell was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including School is Hell, Childhood is Hell, The <b>Big</b> <b>Book</b> of Hell, and The Huge Book of Hell. Although Groening has stated, [...] "I'll never give up the comic strip. It's my foundation," [...] he announced that the June 16, 2012 strip would mark Life in Hells conclusion. After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work. The poster contained tribute cartoons by 22 of Groening's cartoonist friends who were influenced by Life in Hell.|$|E
500|$|Tokyo Mew Mew was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who {{described it as}} cute and entertaining. Though AnimeFringe Patrick King notes {{that it is not}} a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points, he lauded it as engrossing [...] "brain candy" [...] and an [...] "endearing action-romance" [...] that has no [...] "delusions of grandeur". Critics praised the artwork in both Tokyo Mew Mew and the sequel Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode. Ikumi's [...] "free flowing" [...] style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers. Patrick King of Animefringe stated: [...] "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist." [...] According to Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, [...] "Mia Ikumi's artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other shōjo material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds." [...] Conversely, in writing for , Shaenon Garrity criticizes the series, calling it [...] "uninspired", [...] "insipid" [...] and [...] "creative bankrupt" [...] and feeling it was [...] "clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth: the creators' marginal notes are filled with references to <b>big</b> <b>book</b> signings, photo shoots, and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines." [...] She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme, while still having a [...] "preachy environmental theme".|$|E
