5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose.

Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks.

It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed.

The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson {{was born}} in Amherst, Massachusetts. Although part of a {{prominent}} family with strong ties to its community, Dickinson lived much {{of her life in}} reclusive isolation. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> others depended entirely upon correspondence. Dickinson was a recluse for the later years of her life.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Mint gained {{its first}} female Director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and despite initial mistrust <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> O'Reilly, {{they came to}} forge a strong bond. Although {{scheduled}} for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly {{was considered to be}} so indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of her attention to Catholic charitable work.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{a sophomore}} at Pennsylvania State University, Parker and his roommate and wrestling teammate, Jean McGianni Celestin, were accused of raping a fellow student. The unnamed accuser stated that Parker and Celestin raped her while she was {{intoxicated}} and unconscious, {{and that she was}} unsure of how many people had been involved. The woman later went to a doctor, who concluded that she had been sexually assaulted, and local authorities taped a phone conversation <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> Parker in which Parker confirmed that it was he and Celestin who had sex with her. She also stated that the two harassed her after she pressed charges, and that they hired a private investigator who showed her picture around campus, revealing her identity.|$|E

5|$|In November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was {{succeeded by}} her only {{surviving}} sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, Elizabeth was recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's {{last will and testament}} had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, {{in the eyes}} of many Catholics, Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England. Henry II of France proclaimed his eldest son and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary. Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> Elizabeth I.|$|E
5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by the Hermannsburg School, Jugadai's {{paintings}} reflect her Tjuukurrpa, {{the complex}} spiritual knowledge and relationships <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> her landscape.

Jugadai's works were selected for exhibition at the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards five times between 1993 and 2001, {{and she was a}} section winner in 2000.

5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 2014, member Jessica {{announced}} {{that she had been}} dismissed from the group. S.M.

Girls' Generation continued to promote as an eight-member group thereafter. The remaining eight members proceeded with the group's activities, holding The Best Live concert at Tokyo Dome on December 9, 2014. The concert was a sellout and attracted 50,000 spectators. The recorded show was released as a DVD in April 2015, which topped both Oricon's DVD and Blu-ray charts simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Patty Hearst guest {{stars in}} the episode, {{something}} that was planned since July 2006.

She was reluctant to appear as a character similar to herself, but she eventually agreed. In addition, Hearst's character was initially scheduled to have a lesbian kiss with Keri Lynn Pratt's character, but the scene was vetoed by the network for unknown reasons.|$|E
