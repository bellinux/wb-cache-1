To account for the variation in the ligand-binding pocket as it binds different ligands, we calculate “consensus ” enrichment by ranking each library compound by its best docking score against all available <b>comparative</b> <b>models</b> and/or modeling templates. For the majority of the targets, the consensus enrichment for multiple models was better than or comparable to that of the holo and apo X-ray structures.

40|$|Accurate {{high-resolution}} {{refinement of}} protein structure models {{is a formidable}} challenge because of the delicate balance of forces in the native state, the difficulty in sampling the {{very large number of}} alternative tightly packed conformations, and the inaccuracies in current force fields. Indeed, energy-based refinement of <b>comparative</b> <b>models</b> generally leads to degradation rather than improvement in model quality, and, hence, most current <b>comparative</b> <b>modeling</b> procedures omit physically based refinement. However, despite their inaccuracies, current force fields do contain information that is orthogonal to the evolutionary information on which <b>comparative</b> <b>models</b> are based, and, hence, refinement might be able to improve <b>comparative</b> <b>models</b> if the space that is sampled is restricted sufficiently so that false attractors are avoided. Here, we use the principal components of the variation of backbone structures within a homologous family to define a small number of evolutionarily favored sampling directions and show that model quality can be improved by energy-based optimization along these directions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{computational}} {{protein structure}} prediction {{is to provide}} three-dimensional (3 D) structures with resolution comparable to experimental results. <b>Comparative</b> <b>modeling,</b> which predicts the 3 D structure of a protein based on its sequence similarity to homologous structures, is the most accurate computational method for structure prediction. In the last two decades, significant {{progress has been made}} on <b>comparative</b> <b>modeling</b> methods. Using the large number of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (~ 65, 000), automatic prediction pipelines are generating a tremendous number of models (~ 1. 9 million) for sequences whose structures have not been experimentally determined. Accurate models are suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications, such as prediction of protein binding sites, prediction of the effect of protein mutations, and structure-guided virtual screening. In particular, <b>comparative</b> <b>modeling</b> has enabled structure-based drug design against protein targets with unknown structures. In this review, we describe the theoretical basis of <b>comparative</b> <b>modeling,</b> the available automatic methods and databases, and the algorithms to evaluate the accuracy of predicted structures. Finally, we discuss relevant applications in the prediction of important drug target proteins, focusing on the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and protein kinase families...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling</b> is {{routinely}} {{used to produce}} three-dimensional models of proteins, very few automated approaches are formulated {{in a way that}} allows inclusion of restraints derived from experimental data as well as those from the structures of homologues. Furthermore, proteins are usually described as a single conformer, rather than an ensemble that represents the heterogeneity and inaccuracy of experimentally determined protein structures. Here we address these issues by exploring the application of the restraint-based conformational space search engine, RAPPER, which has previously been developed for rebuilding experimentally defined protein structures and for fitting models to electron density derived from X-ray diffraction analyses. Results A new application of RAPPER for <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling</b> uses positional restraints and knowledge-based sampling to generate models with accuracies comparable to other leading modelling tools. Knowledge-based predictions are based on geometrical features of the homologous templates and rules concerning main-chain and side-chain conformations. By directly changing the restraints derived from available templates we estimate the accuracy limits of the method in <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling.</b> Conclusion The application of RAPPER to <b>comparative</b> <b>modelling</b> provides an effective means of exploring the conformational space available to a target sequence. Enhanced methods for generating positional restraints can greatly improve structure prediction. Generation of an ensemble of solutions that are consistent with both target sequence and knowledge derived from the template structures provides a more appropriate representation of a structural prediction than a single model. By formulating homologous structural information as sets of restraints we can begin to consider how <b>comparative</b> <b>models</b> might be used to inform conformer generation from sparse experimental data. </p...|$|R
