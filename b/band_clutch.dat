50|$|Known as {{an input}} speed sensor (ISS). This sensor sends a varying {{frequency}} {{signal to the}} TCU to determine the current rotational speed of the input shaft or torque converter. The TCU uses the input shaft speed to determine slippage across the torque converter and potentially to determine the rate of slippage across the <b>bands</b> and <b>clutches.</b> This information is vital to regulate {{the application of the}} torque converter lock-up clutch smoothly and effectively.|$|R

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) gearing controlled by brake <b>bands</b> and/or <b>clutch</b> packs to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no {{distinction between the two}} terms need be made.|$|R
50|$|The Pit {{broadcasts}} a {{large number}} of videos by metal and goth artists such as Amon Amarth, Poison The Well, Cannibal Corpse, and also broadcasts interviews and features with signed and unsigned <b>bands</b> such as <b>Clutch,</b> Benediction.

50|$|Due {{to these}} links, two <b>bands</b> and two <b>clutches</b> {{are all that}} is needed to command the gearsets and extract the {{different}} gears. As many as six forward gears can easily be developed from a Simpson box, just by adding a third gearset (underdrive or overdrive) which is operated independently, to create two ranges for each gear.|$|R

50|$|The FMX {{transmission}} is controlled through two clutches called the forward and rear <b>clutches,</b> and two <b>band</b> brakes, called the forward and rear <b>bands.</b> The <b>clutches</b> and <b>bands</b> are operated by hydraulic pressure. In this case, forward means {{closest to the}} engine. When applied, a clutch connects a rotational component to the engine, causing the component to turn, and a band holds the component, preventing it from turning. The forward clutch controls power to the primary sun gear. The rear clutch controls power to the secondary sun gear. Confusingly, the band that holds the rear clutch is called the front band. The rear band holds the planet carrier.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} control system consists of a valve arrangement and an engine driven pump. The automatic transmission contains a planetary gear set consisting of two sun gears, two sets of three planet pinions contained within a planetary carrier and ring gear. Various speed ratios are obtained by holding or clutching various combinations of elements of the planetary train. This is performed by two <b>bands,</b> two multi-disc <b>clutches</b> and a one-way clutch.|$|R

So many bands write literal lyrics that mean exactly what they say, whereas on something like ‘A Futuristic Dracula’ you wouldn’t really know what it’s about until you read it and work it out for yourself.". The band draw their influences from such <b>bands</b> as <b>Clutch,</b> Queens Of The Stone Age, Weezer, Jarcrew, Biffy Clyro, Radiohead and The Beach Boys.|$|R
