Two-ply laminations were produced using polyvinyl acetate emulsion (PVAc), urea formaldehyde (UF), resorcinol formaldehyde (RF), and water-based polymer isocyanate (API) adhesives. In order to determine the bonding performance, the block-shear test was applied according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for structural glued laminated timber under normal conditions and after accelerated-aging treatments. To support this study, the wettability of each wood species was also investigated through contact-angle measurement. The results showed that the bonding performance of low-density P. falcataria was better than that of medium-density P. merkusii and medium-density A. mangium, while the bonding performance of medium-density P. merkusii was better than that of medium-density A. mangium. Furthermore, compared with A. mangium, the small contact angle and good wettability in P. falcataria and P. merkusii result in better adhesion and more intimate contact between the wood surfaces and adhesive.|$|E

Besides transferring stresses, bondlines can also provide additional functionality, such as measuring deformations in structural timber applications by electrically conductive adhesives. This study investigates {{the influence of a}} thermal postcure treatment of polyurethane <b>bonded</b> <b>wood</b> joints. Bonded beech wooden samples were manufactured with three adhesives—a commercial one-component polyurethane for structural laminated timber and two modified ones, filled with electrically conductive particles. Adhesive bonds were subjected to a subsequent postcuring at 80 and 95  °C for 1 and 48  h, respectively. Mechanical properties of the bonds were studied on the macroscopic level by tensile shear tests and the properties of the cured adhesive on the microscopic level by nanoindentation. As a result, the tensile shear strength slightly dropped with addition of filler, while all specimens still fulfilled the requirement of EN 302 - 1 in dry condition. Nanoindentation revealed minor decreases in mechanical properties of the cured adhesive with postcuring time for two adhesives and a different reaction of carbon black filled polyurethane, as the creep factor decreases with the thermal postcure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The paper {{reports on}} the early steps in the {{development}} of cement bonded composite beams. The advantage of such products is that they are lighter than reinforced concrete, while more fire-resistant than solid wood or traditional composite beams. Experimental beams were produced to imitate the structure of organic bonded PSL and LSL, using poplar veneer strips and Scots pine strands. In this phase of the research, the aim was to verify that such products are feasible, compare different beam types, and determine the focus for the ongoing development of cement-bonded composite beams. The manufactured beams were found to be fairly lightweight, but their mechanical properties were lower than those of solid wood or composite beams. PSL type beams performed better than cement-bonded LSL. Problem areas that caused the relatively poor performance were identified. Further experimental work will be directed at improving the mechanical performance of the beams. cement <b>bonded</b> <b>wood</b> composites / composite beams / non-destructive testing Kivonat – A cement-kötésű kompozit gerendák kifejlesztésének kezdeti lépései.

Our experiments show that the addition of non-reducing carbohydrates and various polyols to phenol-formaldehyde resol-resins does not adversely affect the dry- or wet-shear strength of 2 -ply Douglas-fir panels bonded with the modified resins. Reducing carbohydrates, however, cannot be used as the modifier. In general, addition of about 0. 6 - 1. 0 mole of modifier per mole of phenol is optimal in the formulation of carbohydrate-or polyol-modified resin. results show that part but not all of the modifier is chemically bound into the resin, apparently through an ether linkage. The water prehydrolysate of southern red oak wood, when reduced with sodium borohydride to convert the reducing sugars to alditols, can be used to modify phenol-formaldehyde resins.
