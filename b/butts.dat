5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from <b>Butts</b> Hill.

5|$|Hunters of game {{have long}} {{made use of}} {{camouflage}} {{in the form of}} materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals.

40|$|Key words: under-matched <b>butt</b> joints；reinforcement；cold bending {{properties}} Abstract: In this paper, cold {{bending properties}} of Q 620 -CF steel <b>butt</b> joints were analyzed {{based on the}} finite element method. Finite element analysis (FEA) {{results indicate that the}} flush under-matched <b>butt</b> joints have lower bending properties than the flush equal-matched <b>butt</b> joints, but under-matched <b>butt</b> joints with definite reinforcement shape can get greater bending force and better cold bending angles than the flush equal-matched <b>butt</b> joints. It shows that shape design of the reinforcement can improve the bending load-carrying capacity of under-matched joints. The reliability of the FEA has been verified by the experiment...|$|R
5|$|Someone paints <b>butts</b> on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of <b>butts</b> was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take things {{into their own hands}} by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone.|$|E
