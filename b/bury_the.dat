5|$|Colonel John Gibbon, whose men {{arrived at}} the battle on Tuesday, June 27, and also helped <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead, said he found Kellogg's body in a ravine where a number of men from Company E died.

5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E
5|$|Expecting an {{imminent}} {{continuation of the}} battle, three Allied brigades arrived within twenty-four hours to reinforce the beachhead, but no subsequent attack materialised. Instead, on 20 and 24 May two truces were declared to collect the wounded and <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead in no man's land. The Turks never succeeded in capturing the bridgehead; instead the ANZACs evacuated the position {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{preceding}} {{another of the}} war's major turning points, the June 16 Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Stephenson helped Colonel Henry Dodge and his men <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Stephenson continued on to Galena after assisting in this task and did not accompany Dodge to Horseshoe Bend.|$|E

5|$|Learning of the {{annihilation}} of his patrol, Ichiki quickly sent forward {{a company to}} <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> bodies and followed {{with the rest of}} his troops, marching throughout the night of August 19 and finally halting at 04:30 on August 20 within a few miles of the U.S. Marine positions on the east side of Lunga Point. At this location, he prepared his troops to attack the Allied positions that night.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{differences}} between SDOs and JFCs, {{even though many}} of the Jupiter-family comets may have originated in the scattered disc. Although the centaurs share a reddish or neutral coloration with many SDOs, their nuclei are bluer, indicating a fundamental chemical or physical difference. One hypothesis is that comet nuclei are resurfaced as they approach the Sun by subsurface materials which subsequently <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> older material.|$|E

5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk War {{has been a}} source of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the Indians torched {{the house}} and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack. After staying at the {{settlement}} for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave had heard the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.|$|E
5|$|Gan {{was always}} {{among the first}} to respond to pleas for donations, giving {{thousands}} of dollars to local hospitals. He also helped to pay for coffins to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> poor. The 1892 annual report of Tan Tock Seng Hospital mentioned that Gan donated a freehold property at Rochor to the hospital. The hospital is still serving the public and came into the international spotlight when it was designated as the sole treatment centre for the SARS epidemic which struck Singapore in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, D.C., Chris Whitley (Kris Lemche) {{is ordered}} by the conspirators who fund Juma's militia to erase all {{information}} that would incriminate them. Instead, he calls his friend Roger Taylor (Eric Lively), the son of President Elect Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), for help. After Roger hears of the conspiracy, Whitley returns to his home to forward the files, only to be stopped by Hodges's men, Halcott and John Quinn (Sebastian Roche) who take the information, kill Whitley and <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> body in concrete.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead {{between the lines}} led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E

5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> matter, and the story died.|$|E
5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> gun {{on the beach and}} send a letter to Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
