Launceston Castle remained significant as a site of local government, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> fell into neglect. When Edmund died in 1300, he left no heirs and the property reverted to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Rudd {{initially}} {{said that}} he would challenge Gillard, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> became apparent {{that he did not have}} enough support within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E
5|$|The company {{initially}} had various factories for vehicle production around France (mainly at the Paris area) {{which came}} from its predecessors and Chausson, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> centred assembly on Blainville-sur-Orne (trucks) and Annonay (buses and coaches). Saviem formed partnerships with other manufacturers, leading to technology-sharing agreements.|$|E

5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton once more {{finished}} fastest, {{but this time}} it was Sebastian Vettel in second, 0.264s behind Hamilton's time of 1m24.544s. The session started on a slightly wet track caused by rain over the night, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> dried up. Ricciardo's session was marred by another technical problem, this time an engine failure to his newly equipped power unit. His teammate Daniil Kvyat did not have a productive session either as he spent most of the time in the garage, setting only seventeenth best time.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> {{became clear that the}} oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, {{at the end}} of the Peace of Amiens, Hope briefly took {{command of}} HMS Atlas, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> became clear that his health was failing and he could no longer {{maintain}} an active naval career. Retiring from the navy on half-pay, Hope was an invalid from 1804 until 1807, when a return to health permitted him to take a post as a Lord of the Admiralty. Hope changed positions several times in this role, but he held onto the position for twenty years as a political favourite, a status maintained by being almost totally politically inactive. In 1812, Hope was advanced to rear-admiral and in January 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on the reorganisation of the order, and was invested later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The I&R platoon {{members who}} were able to walk were sent to Germany. James was so seriously wounded he couldn't speak. He and Kalil, who was also seriously wounded, were loaded onto trucks and {{eventually}} put aboard trains. Bouck was jammed into a single railroad cattle car with 71 others POWs and traveled for days without food or water. By Christmas Day, seven men in Bouck's car had died and the rest were barely hanging on. The prisoners were transported to hospitals in Frankfurt and Hanover. McConnell, also wounded, ended up like James in Stalag XI-B near Bad Fallingbostel, the most primitive POW camp in Germany. Bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in Stalag XIII-D in Nuremberg and later in Stalag XIII-C in Hammelberg, where the non-commissioned and enlisted men were split, with the officers sent to Oflag XIII-B. Hammelberg was designed for 300 prisoners, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> housed more than 1500 POWs.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{documentation}} {{recording the}} construction of the third Auberge d'Italie, but work began in 1574 and the building was inaugurated in September 1579. When the first floor was completed, construction {{of the rest of the}} building was suspended, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> became clear that the building was too small. On 25 August 1582, the decision to built a second floor was taken. Master mason Gio Andrea Farrugia was responsible for the construction, but he died before the project was completed. Construction continued throughout the 1580s, and was completed in around 1595. Apart from Cassar and Farrugia, several other architects and master masons were responsible for {{the construction of}} the auberge, including the engineer Francesco Antrini.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years later}} in 1945, Zeller {{pointed out that the}} use of the name Longia was untenable, as it had already been used for a genus of rusts {{described}} by Hans Sydow in 1921, so he proposed the name Longula and introduced the new combination Longula texensis in addition to L.texensis var. major. The species was known by this name for about 60 years, until a 2004 phylogenetic study revealed the taxon's close evolutionary relationship with Agaricus, a possibility insinuated by Curtis Gates Lloyd a century before. This resulted in a new name in that genus, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> came to light that the name Agaricus texensis had already been used, ironically enough, by Berkeley and Curtis themselves in 1853, for a taxon now treated as a synonym of Flammulina velutipes. Since this made the new Agaricus texensis an unusable homonym, Gabriel Moreno and colleagues published the new name Agaricus deserticola in 2010. The mushroom is commonly known as the gasteroid Agaricus.|$|E
5|$|Westmoreland {{was unwilling}} to leave the Viet Cong with a {{position}} from which they could dominate Phước Long Province. So, on June 13, he {{made the decision to}} insert U.S. combat forces. Subsequently, 738 men of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, were flown out to the staging area in Phước Vinh. Elements of the 3rd Battalion (Airborne), 319th Artillery also followed later in the day. Upon arrival at Phước Vinh, the U.S. Army task force waited for five days, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> became apparent that the Viet Cong had withdrawn from the area and had no intention of holding territory. On June 18, the 1/503rd Infantry was ordered to return to base.|$|E
5|$|Becky confronts Kylie after a bad {{reference}} {{that she}} provided to an adoption agency. At first Kylie pretends {{that she has}} a privileged life in order to impress Becky <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> emerges that she is on the streets. She then moves into the Rovers Return Inn and instantaneously sparks a conflict with Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Becky and Steve soon discover {{that she has a}} four-year-old son called Max, whose custody she seeks. She sells Steve's motorbike and tries to sleep with him. After visiting Max at the foster parents' home, she takes him home. She sleeps with Gary Windass (Mikey North). Kylie is awarded custody of her son. Later she steals money from the till at Roy's Rolls, and jets off to Cyprus on holiday and leaves Max in Becky's care. She returns {{a couple of weeks later}} with a new boyfriend, Demetri. She tells Becky that she has come back to take Max to live in Cyprus, leaving Becky heartbroken. Kylie sees Becky's desperation as she cannot have children and offers to give Max to her in exchange for 20,000 pounds. Becky complies and Kylie leaves.|$|E

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
5|$|The first {{standard}} strips {{began to emerge}} in the 1870s, with many clubs opting for colours associated with the schools or other sporting organisations from which the clubs had emerged. Blackburn Rovers, for example, adopted shirts of a halved design based on those of the team for former pupils of Malvern College, one of the schools where the sport had developed. Their original colours of light blue and white were chosen to reflect an association with Cambridge University, where a number of the club's founders had been educated. Colours and designs often changed dramatically between matches, with Bolton Wanderers turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots within the same year. Rather than the modern shorts, players wore long knickerbockers or full-length trousers, often with a belt or even braces. Lord Kinnaird, an early star of the game, was noted for always being resplendent in long white trousers. There were no numbers printed on shirts to identify individual players, and the programme for an 1875 match between Queen's Park and Wanderers in Glasgow identifies the players by the colours of their caps or stockings. The first shin pads were worn in 1874 by the Nottingham Forest player Sam Weller Widdowson, who cut down a pair of cricket pads and wore them outside his stockings. Initially the concept was ridiculed <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> caught on with other players. By {{the turn of the century}} pads had become smaller and were being worn inside the stockings.|$|E
5|$|Mercy {{learns that}} she {{can stay in the}} UK but feels guilty about the deception, so decides to go back to Nigeria anyway. Fatboy loses his market stall but gets a job selling cars for Max Branning (Jake Wood). He discovers Mercy is leaving, so tries to stop her from leaving but is unable to, and they say an {{emotional}} goodbye. Fatboy is distraught over his loss, and eventually decides to move in with Dot. He helps Dot to track down her half sister Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins) and helps Whitney when her former pimp, Rob Grayson (Jody Latham) tracks her down. Fatboy feels put out when Rose and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) both move in with Dot. Mercy's sister Faith Olubunmi (Modupe Adeyeye) then arrives in Walford to tell Fatboy that Mercy has had their marriage annulled. Fatboy starts a relationship with Faith (as seen in series 3 of EastEnders: E20) <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>soon</b> ends. Following this, Fatboy develops feelings for his friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), though Whitney is involved with Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline). When Whitney and Tyler's relationship breaks down, Fatboy admits his feelings for Whitney and the pair start a relationship. Fatboy buys a car for Whitney, but she is initially angry, saying she doesn't want to be owned. However, Whitney relents and accepts the gift. Fatboy notices that Tyler continues to want Whitney, and so warns him off. However, after Whitney gets angry at Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) for dancing with Fatboy, Lucy convinces Tyler to talk to her. They accidentally get locked in a bathroom and Fatboy assumes Whitney has cheated on him, so ends the relationship. Fatboy later visits Tyler, who shows Fatboy that the bathroom door sticks, and Tyler says that he is happy for Fatboy and Whitney as a couple. However, Whitney soon feels smothered by Fatboy's affection, and when he is about to take Whitney away on holiday, she refuses, and when they kiss she says it is like kissing a friend. She admits that she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. He later punches Tyler. He then becomes a regular DJ at R, and gets a job at the local fast food restaurant, McKlunkies. However, he is sacked when he stands up to his manager, Nico Papadopoulos (Aykut Hilmi) after taking advice from Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie feels bad so offers Fatboy a job at The Queen Victoria public house, collecting glasses.|$|E
