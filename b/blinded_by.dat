5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E

5|$|John Calvin, a sixteenth-century French theologian and {{principal}} {{figure in the}} development of Calvinism, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be indicted for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin {{is the result of the}} fall of man, and argued that the human mind, will, and affections are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is predestined, divided into the elect and the reprobate: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{not born}} blind, though he was {{impaired}} with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted his stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905, {{or a combination of}} the two conjectures.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{recognizing}} Dr. Fell in {{the surveillance}} tape, Pazzi accesses the ViCAP database of wanted fugitives. He then learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. <b>Blinded</b> <b>by</b> greed, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings {{and attempts to}} capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket, mortally wounded by Lecter, manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio, ties him up, then disembowels and hangs him. Lecter then heads back to the United States.|$|E

5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E
