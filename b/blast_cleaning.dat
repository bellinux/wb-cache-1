50|$|Salt {{contamination}} {{beneath a}} coating, such as paint on steel, can cause adhesion and corrosion problems {{due to the}} hygroscopic nature of salt. Its tendency to attract water through a permeable coating creates a build-up of water molecules between substrate and coating.

40|$|Currently, {{conventional}} {{methods of}} decline development put enormous cost {{pressure on the}} profitability of mining operations. This {{is the case with}} narrow vein ore bodies where current methods and mine design of decline development may be too expensive to support economic extraction of the ore. According to studies, {{the time it takes to}} drill, clean and blast an end in conventional decline development can be up to 224 minutes. This is because once an end is <b>blasted,</b> <b>cleaning</b> should first be completed before drilling can commence, resulting in low advance rates per shift. Improvements in advance rates during decline development can be achieved by application of the Electric Monorail Transport System (EMTS) based drilling system. The system consists of the drilling and loading components that use monorail technology to drill and clean the face during decline development. The two systems work simultaneously at the face in such a way that as the top part of the face is being drilled the pneumatic loading system cleans the face. However, to improve the efficiency of the two systems, critical processes performed by the two systems during mining operations must be automated. Automation increases safety and productivity, reduces operator fatigue and also reduces the labour costs of the system. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to describe automation designs of the two processes performed by the monorail drilling and loading systems during operations. During automation design, critical processes performed by the two systems and control requirements necessary to allow the two systems execute such processes automatically have also been identified. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} {{research}} work are small gasifiers (SGF) to nitrous oxide(N 2 O) gas-dynamic resonance system (GRS) initiate the workflow. Subject of research - methods to improve {{the efficiency of the}} SGF. Relevance of the work is determined by what is currently on the SGF as nitrous oxidemonopropellant are widely used in aerospace engineering, in particular in various power plant and increasing the efficiency of decomposition of N 2 O is an important scientific and technical challenge. Duty cycle begins after the SGF through the nozzle GRS gas N 2 O. At a certain ratio geometrical and operational parameters of the SGF {{in the area of the}} nozzle is formed GRS unstable region gasdynamic flow consisting of "holes" and the Mach disk. In the case where the Mach disk is localized in the leading edge cavity, mounted coaxially with the nozzle GRS longitudinal oscillations occur supported kinetic energy of the feed gas. In this case, stagnant zone of the resonator is carried out intensive heating nitrous oxidegas. The heat release is due to the high frequency of the cyclic process of transmission and reflection from the end wall of the cavity shock waves (SW). The high temperature level in the resonant cavity causes the thermal decomposition of N 2 O with the evolution of heat and the spread of this upstream process and then run the SGF. The aim is to improve the methods of experimental study of the effectiveness of the SGF with the GRS, including the use of catalytic converters and original heating nitrous oxide. The objectives of the study is to determine the characteristics, comparative analysis and synthesis of the results obtained for the three variants of the GRS (without catalytic converters, with the end surface of the cavity of the catalytic material, the end surface of the cavity of the catalytic material and the catalyst unit IDI) when the initial temperature of N 2 O in the range of initial temperature 300 [...] . 600 K. The paper presents a diagram of the experimental facility and stand for research, as well as the method of determining the completeness of the decomposition of nitrous oxideand time- SGF nominal mode. The proposed technique is to identify performance indicators based on spectrogram analysis of pressure fluctuations, which can be obtained by Fourier transformation. Application spectrograms to analyze the characteristics of the workflow is advisable in cases where high levels of temperatures do not allow direct measurements or these measurements associated with certain technical difficulties caused by small dimensions and operating conditions of the SGF. In accordance with the results obtained, we can draw the following conclusions. Use of the catalyst of the end wall of the cavity is an effective method of intensifying the decomposition N 2 O, which reduces the time for the output mode is more than 35 %. Installing the pre- catalyst unit can further accelerate out SGF mode and increase by 5 [...] . 7 % completeness decomposition N 2 O. Increasing the initial temperature of nitrous oxidehas a positive effect on the efficiency of the SGF, helping to reduce time-to- nominal conditions, as well as increase the completeness of decomposition N 2 O. These methods of intensifying the process of decomposition of nitrous oxidetechnological, functional and can be used for various purposes in the SGF. In particular they can be used in industrial plants for gas-dynamic spraying, cutting and <b>blasting</b> abrasive <b>cleaning</b> materials, as well as devices to start propulsion energy and high power.

40|$|Preservation of {{cultural}} {{property in the}} form of historical artefacts for the future is an important interest in our society. The information which can be obtained from these materials is a valuable key to understand the past. One of the aims of any conservation procedure is to preserve both aesthetic and physical conditions of irreplaceable artefacts. Conservation involves a number of different steps. Cleaning is one of the critical steps needed to stabilise the material and to recover hidden details on the surface. It is therefore very important to choose suitable techniques and methods when cleaning to avoid damage to the artefact. Research and development to find more suitable conservation techniques are still going on. One of the new techniques under investigation is laser cleaning which has shown a good potential as a cleaning tool for many material categories met in conservation work. This thesis presents an investigation of the laser cleaning of metal artefacts using Nd:YAG and TEA CO 2 lasers. The first part is a general overview of the laser technique applied to metal conservation and an outline of the practical work. The thesis then continues with four papers. Paper A concerns the removal of adhesives and coatings from iron samples using pulsed TEA CO 2 - and Nd:YAG-lasers. Trial samples were treated with different kinds of adhesives and coatings typically used in metals conservation and then cleaned using the lasers. The results were compared with cleaning using a conventional technique, micro blasting. Comparison of the different laser-cleaned surfaces was also performed by optical microscopy and Raman-spectroscopy. The comparative study showed that the best cleaning result was achieved by the TEA CO 2 laser. The coatings were removed entirely without damage to the substrate. Paper B deals with cleaning of corroded iron samples using pulsed TEA CO 2 - and Nd:YAG-lasers. TEA CO 2 lasers were successfully used to remove organic materials and rust. The Nd:YAG laser was able to clean the corroded samples, however, the risk for surface damage was found to be higher than using the TEA CO 2 laser. Analysis of the surfaces cleaned by the two types of lasers was carried out by optical- and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectrometry and Raman-spectrometry. Paper C is a comparative study of the cleaning of iron samples using TEA CO 2 - and Nd:YAG lasers. In the first experiment a comparison of Nd:YAG laser and micro <b>blasting</b> for the <b>cleaning</b> of rust was made. The second experiment dealt with the removal of a wax coating from iron samples using a TEA CO 2 laser with different power densities. The first experiment shows that the samples cleaned by pulsed laser retain a better surface structure than those cleaned by micro blasting. The second experiment showed how different energy densities affect the same surface. Paper D is an investigation of the cleaning of silver threads in textile using Nd:YAG laser at wavelengths of 1064 nm, 532 nm and 266 nm. The goal of this work was to find a technique to clean the tarnished silver without damaging the underlying silk. This was necessary since the conventional chemical treatment for cleaning tarnished silver is problematic to apply in this specific instance. The laser wavelength of 266 nm was found to be most appropriate for cleaning the silver threads without causing any damages either the silver or the underlying silk. However, the 1064 nm wavelength caused damage such as melting and burning of both the silver and silk. Godkänd; 2002; 20070224 (ysko...|$|R
