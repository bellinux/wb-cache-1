40|$|Background: Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a {{dermatosis}} {{characterized by}} thickened, hyperpigmented plaques, typically on the intertriginous surfaces and neck. Common in some populations, its prevalence depends on race. Clinicians should recognize AN; it heralds disorders ranging from endocrinologic disturbances to malignancy. In this review, {{we discuss the}} pathogenesis of AN and its clinical implications and management. Materials and Methods: We selected 30 patients for the study. Diagnosis of associated disorders was established by history, physical examination, body mass index (BMI), hormone measurements by radioimmunoassays of thyroidnfunction tests, free testosterone, 17 (OH) progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol, gonadotropins, prolactin, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide levels. Results and Discussion: In our study, the flexural involvement (flexures of groins, knees and elbows) <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, lip involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients, and dorsal involvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 3. 3 % patients each. Increased serum testosterone levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 13. 3 % patients and increased DHEAS levels <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients. Regarding the types of AN, obesity induced AN or pseudo-AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> 70 % patients, syndromic AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 23. 35 % patients and malignant AN <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 6. 6 % patients. The commonest histopathological feature of patients with AN <b>was</b> hyperkeratosis, <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 100 % patients, papillomatosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 60 % patients, horn pseudocysts <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 30 % patients, and irregular acanthosis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 26. 6 % patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cicatrical {{alopecia}} {{occurs in}} otherwise healthy {{men and women}} of all ages and <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> worldwide Material and Methods: A study of 40 patients was conducted to study the clinical variants and histopathology of cicatricial alopecia. Results and Discussion: n our study, it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> that maximum number of cases of cicatrical alopecia were of LPP (27. 5 %) followed by 25 % of DLE, 20 % patients had pseudopelade of Brocq, SLE <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 5 % cases followed by Scleroderma, dermatomyositis, Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, aplasia cutis, kerion, follicular mucinosis, pemphigus, dissecting cellulitis of scalp/ pyogenic folliculitis and acne keloidalis nuchae in 2. 5 % cases each. Regarding the morphology of lesions,epidermal atrophy <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 90 % patients, erythema <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 55 % cases, follicular pluging <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 40 % patients, telangiectasias in 27. 5 % patients, diffuse scaling in 25 % patients and mottled hyperpigmentation <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> 20 % patients.

5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has not <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> humans, and {{the toxicity}} depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a {{median lethal dose}} (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal {{studies have shown that}} chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E

5|$|Arabians are {{involved}} {{in a wide variety of}} activities, including fairs, movies, parades, circuses and other places where horses are showcased.

5|$|Armstrong had {{recovered}} from severe heart {{problems in the}} late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> public for several months. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him {{in the event of}} his death. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.|$|E
5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality.

5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> recent years.|$|E
5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia {{will grow}} in clay, sand, acid and even {{alkaline}} soils, {{and it shows}} good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly regarded as a low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma.
