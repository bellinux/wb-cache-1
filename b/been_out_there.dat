Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E

Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it.
