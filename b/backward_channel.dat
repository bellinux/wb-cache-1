In the first phase, source transmits its signal to the multi-antenna relay. Then the relay manipulates the received signal with the general-rank complex beamforming matrix and retransmits it.

40|$|Digital {{image and}} video coding has {{witnessed}} rapid {{development in the}} past decades. Conventional hybrid motion-compensated-prediction (MCP) based video coding exploits both spatial and temporal redundancy at the encoder. Hence the encoder requires much more computational resources than the decoder. This poses a challenge for applications such as video surveillance systems and wireless sensor networks. Only limited memory and power {{are available at the}} encoder for these applications, while the decoder has access to more powerful computational resources. The Slepian-Wolf theorem and Wyner-Ziv theorem have proved that a distributed video coding scheme is achievable where sources are encoded separately and decoded jointly. The basic goal of our research is to analyze the performance of the low complexity video encoding theoretically, and to design new practical techniques to achieve a high video coding efficiency while maintaining low encoding complexity. ^ In this thesis, we propose a new <b>backward</b> <b>channel</b> aware Wyner-Ziv approach. The basic idea is to use <b>backward</b> <b>channel</b> aware motion estimation to code the key frames in Wyner-Ziv video coding, where motion estimation is done at the decoder and motion vectors are sent back to the encoder. We refer to these backward predictive coded frames as BP frames. A mode decision scheme through the feedback channel is studied. Compared to Wyner-Ziv video coding with INTRA coded key frames, our approach can significantly improve the coding efficiency. We further consider the scenario when there are transmission errors and delays over the <b>backward</b> <b>channel.</b> A hybrid scheme with selective coding is proposed to address the problem. Our results show that the coding performance can be improved by sending more motion vectors to the encoder. However, there is a tradeoff between complexity and rate-distortion performance in <b>backward</b> <b>channel</b> aware Wyner-Ziv video coding. We present a model to quantitatively analyze the complexity and rate-distortion tradeoff for BP frames. Three estimators, the minimum estimator, the median estimator and the average estimator, are proposed and the complexity-rate-distortion analysis is presented. ...|$|E

Therefore, it is important to protect the security of RFID systems and the privacy of RFID tag owners.

Charmonium dissociation with nucleons and formed mesons to open charm (D + ¯D pairs) is included dynamically. The comover dissociation cross sections are {{described by a}} simple phase-space model including a single free parameter, i. e. an interaction strength M 2 0, that is fitted to the J/ suppression data for Pb + Pb collisions at SPS energies. As a novel feature we implement the <b>backward</b> <b>channels</b> for char- monium reproduction by D ¯D channels employing detailed balance.

This leads to the final result that the total J/ suppression at ps = 200 GeV as a function of centrality is slightly less than the suppression seen at SPS energies by the NA 50 Collaboration, where the comover dissociation is substantial and the <b>backward</b> <b>channels</b> play no role. Furthermore, even in case that all di- rectly produced J/ mesons dissociate immediately (or are not formed as a mesonic state), a sizeable amount of charmonia is found asymptotically due to the D + !

We show {{that for a}} linear deterministic model {{the capacity of the}} diamond channel in each direction can be simultaneously achieved for all values of channel parameters, where the forward and <b>backward</b> <b>channel</b> parameters are not necessarily the same. We divide the achievability scheme into three cases, depending on the forward and <b>backward</b> <b>channel</b> parameters. For the first case, we use a reverse amplify-and-forward strategy in the relays. For the second case, we use four relay strategies based on the reverse amplify-and-forward with some modifications in terms of replacement and repetition of some stream levels. For the third case, we use two relay strategies based on performing two rounds of repetitions in a relay. The proposed schemes for deterministic channels are used to find the capacity regions within constant gaps for two special cases of the Gaussian two-way diamond channel. First, for the general Gaussian two-way relay channel with a simple coding scheme the smallest gap is achieved compared to the prior works. Then, a special symmetric Gaussian two-way diamond model is considered and the capacity region is achieved within four bits. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., Oct 201...|$|E
