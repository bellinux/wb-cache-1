40|$|The {{analysis}} effort {{during the}} first year of the Texas LoanSTAR Monitoring and Analysis Program has emphasized selection and development of <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques to cover the range of buildings expected in the program. PRISM has been adopted as the baseline technique for buildings which are appropriate for treatment with one-, three- and five- parameter segmented linear, change-point models. In addition to PRISM, two- and four- parameter linear, segmented change-point models are expected to be suitable for at least preliminary analysis of monthly and daily data for all buildings in the program. Regression analysis with hourly scheduling profiles will be used for <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis</b> of hourly data. Substantial effort has been devoted to exploratory analysis intended to refine the analysis performed with the baseline techniques.

40|$|The National Youth Justice Strategy was {{launched}} in 2008. Its first strategy covers the period 2008 – 2010 and has five high-level goals. One of these goals – to work to reduce offending by diverting young people from offending behaviour – {{has been the focus}} of a <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis</b> of practice undertaken by the Irish Youth Justice Service during 2008 / 2009.

The intended changes advanced in the analysis will aim to ensure that each local GYDP aligns its efforts to take account of data regarding youth crime patterns within its locality and develops a clear evidence-based rationale to articulate how its activities will contribute to reducing crime. The Irish Youth Justice Service intends to support improvement in effectiveness by investing in targeted training of core staff, developing a learning community to exploit the knowledge across the network of GYDPs, making better strategic use of local information and leading five trial sites to put these ideas into practice...|$|E

40|$|Background: There are {{discrepant}} {{findings regarding}} which {{subscales of the}} Cambridge Cognitive Examination(CAMCOG) are able to predict cognitive decline. The study aimed to identify the baseline CAMCOG subscales that can discriminate between patients and predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer"s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: This was a five-year case-control study of patients with cognitive impairment and a control group. Participants were grouped into AD (n = 121), MCI converted to dementia (MCI-Ad, n = 43), MCI-stable(MCI-St, n = 66), and controls (CTR, n = 112). Differences in the mean scores obtained by the four groupswere examined. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare subscale scores in the AD and MCI-Ad groups with those of controls. The influence of age, gender, schooling, and depression on baseline subscale scores was assessed. Results: Of the CAMCOG subscales, Orientation and Memory (learning and recent) (OR + MEM) showed the highest discriminant capacity in the <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis</b> of the four groups. This <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis</b> indicated that OR + MEM was {{the best predictor of}} conversion to AD in the MCI-Ad group (area under the curve, AUC = 0. 81), whereas the predictive capacity of the global MMSE and CAMCOG scores was poor (AUC = 0. 59 and 0. 53, respectively). Conclusions: In the <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis,</b> the Orientation and Memory (learning and recent) subscales showed the highest discriminant and predictive capacity as regards both cognitive decline in the AD group and conversion to AD among MCI-Ad patients. This was not affected by age, gender, schooling, or depression...|$|E
30|$|Booz et al. ([2010]) have envisaged {{a formal}} {{approach}} {{in the form of}} two complimentary and integrated service offerings, viz Enterprise 2.0 adoption framework and Enterprise 2.0 solutions architecture. Enterprise 2.0 adoption framework is comprised of four phases, viz <b>baseline</b> <b>analysis,</b> pilot planning, training and piloting, and institutionalizing. <b>Baseline</b> <b>analysis</b> brings to the fore the current collaborative efforts underway in the organization and accentuates the need for improvement. Pilot planning phase, after prioritizing the E 2.0 technologies for adoption, caters to the planning aspects in relation to training, pilot implementation, and institutionalization. The focus of training and piloting phase is on imparting new skills via training modules and pilot testing the induction of Web 2.0 technologies. The fourth and final phase, after analyzing the feedback from the previous stage, modifies the process as per the need and then integrates it in to standard work practices of the organization. Enterprise 2.0 solutions architecture, on the other hand, facilitates the culture of communication and collaboration by the means of social networking, blogs, wikis, and tagging.|$|E
