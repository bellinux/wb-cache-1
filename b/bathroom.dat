40|$|This work {{deals with}} the form <b>bathrooms</b> have taken in time and aims at {{exploring}} whether these {{can be regarded as}} cultural significant, but also how the estate-owner‘s knowledge is embodied. The work is limited to the <b>bathrooms</b> in Sweden. The investigation has been performed through studies of articles about <b>bathrooms</b> in old interior-magazines, old books and physical studies of old <b>bathrooms.</b> Within the investigation, a survey and an interview have also been applied. The introduction chapter explains the notions that are used in the scope of the present work. The following chapter describes the development of the <b>bathrooms</b> in the apartment blocks between the 1930 ’s and the 1970 ’s by actuating factors such as building codes and thorough investigations about <b>bathrooms.</b> Further, the <b>bathrooms</b> époques are described through their special features. The investigation´s last chapter presents the contemporary situation based on the demands and difficulties. This part of the work is mainly performed with the results from the survey and interview with municipal second-hand center for used building materials, called Återbruket. The investigation shows that old <b>bathrooms</b> do have cultural significance that is bound to the material components from the respective period of time {{and the fact that the}} estate-owners knowledge about these is limited. The second-hand market for old <b>bathrooms</b> is actually growing stronger and according to Återbruket, old <b>bathrooms</b> are requested by the young generation. In the discussion and conclusion chapter, it is established that the old <b>bathrooms</b> are complex from the conservation point of view, and an immersed knowledge is required to make a cautious renovation possibleUppsats för avläggande av filosofie kandidatexamen i Kulturvård, Bebyggelseantikvariskt program 15 hp Institutionen för kulturvård Göteborgs universitet 2013 : 2...|$|R

The library's plaster cornice and other {{architectural}} details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph.

5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their <b>bathroom.</b> The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the <b>bathroom</b> and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the <b>bathroom</b> under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his <b>bathroom.</b> That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E
50|$|A {{point of}} {{distinction}} of MS Lofoten is its old-fashioned style and construction. For example, {{unlike the other}} active ships in the Hurtigruten fleet, which use direct entry loading/offloading, MS Lofoten must load and unload cargo through a hatch on deck {{with the assistance of}} an on-board crane. Another period-specific difference is shared <b>bathrooms</b> (as opposed to in-room <b>bathrooms).</b> Some cabins have since been upgraded and <b>bathrooms</b> have been added.|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Construction Management and Economics [© Routledge (Taylor & Francis) ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] the benefits from using offsite technologies have been rehearsed, their uptake within the UK construction industry is slow. A critical barrier is the lack of cost data of using such technology. Another is the unsubstantiated perception that maintenance of offsite solutions is difficult and expensive. But, yet again, {{there appears to be no}} data publicly available on this topic. This knowledge gap is addressed by presenting the cost data of maintaining offsite and insitu <b>bathrooms</b> for student accommodation. The records of 732 maintenance jobs were investigated. These jobs span three years for 398 <b>bathrooms,</b> including precast concrete modules, Glass Reinforced Polyester (GRP) modules and insitu <b>bathrooms.</b> The results suggest that GRP modules required the lowest maintenance costs whilst insitu <b>bathrooms</b> were significantly more expensive to maintain. For offsite modules, drainage, toilets, vents and sink were identified as the main problematic areas for maintenance. The maintenance of insitu <b>bathrooms</b> was more complex and involved a wider range of problematic areas. The design imposed significant effects on the long-term cost of offsite <b>bathrooms.</b> Aspirations of clients need to be fully understood and integrated into design. The findings should facilitate the design decision-making of using offsite <b>bathrooms</b> for residential buildings...|$|R

5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a <b>bathroom,</b> and a man using another <b>bathroom</b> are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it.
