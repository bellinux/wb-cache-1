5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional <b>bilinear</b> operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E
5|$|Many theorems {{were first}} {{established}} for small matrices only, {{for example the}} Cayley–Hamilton theorem was proved for 2×2 matrices by Cayley in the aforementioned memoir, and by Hamilton for 4×4 matrices. Frobenius, working on <b>bilinear</b> forms, generalized the theorem to all dimensions (1898). Also {{at the end of}} the 19th century the Gauss–Jordan elimination (generalizing a special case now known as Gauss elimination) was established by Jordan. In the early 20th century, matrices attained a central role in linear algebra. partially due to their use in classification of the hypercomplex number systems of the previous century.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} geometric and supergravity Killing spinors and the spinor <b>bilinears</b> constructed out of them. The spinor <b>bilinears</b> of geometric Killing spinors {{correspond to}} the antisymmetric generalizations of Killing vector fields which are called Killing-Yano forms. They constitute a Lie superalgebra structure in constant curvature spacetimes. We show that the Dirac currents of geometric Killing spinors satisfy a Lie algebra structure up to a condition on 2 -form spinor <b>bilinears.</b> We propose that the spinor <b>bilinears</b> of supergravity Killing spinors give way to different generalizations of Killing vector fields to higher degree forms. It is also shown that those supergravity Killing forms constitute a Lie algebra structure in six and ten dimensional cases. For five and eleven dimensional cases, the Lie algebra structure depends on an extra condition on supergravity Killing forms. Comment: 17 pages, published versio...|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, {{orthogonality}} is {{the generalization}} {{of the notion}} of perpendicularity to the linear algebra of <b>bilinear</b> forms. Two elements u and v of a vector space with <b>bilinear</b> form B are orthogonal when B(u,v) = 0. When the <b>bilinear</b> form corresponds to a pseudo-Euclidean space, there are non-perpendicular vectors that are hyperbolic-orthogonal. In the case of function spaces, families of orthogonal functions are used to form a basis.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it is not}} positive-definite, this <b>bilinear</b> form is not {{an inner}} product; {{nevertheless}} the <b>bilinear</b> form is frequently referred to as an indefinite inner product. A similar abuse of language refers to the modulus as a norm.|$|E
25|$|A {{vector space}} with a <b>bilinear</b> form generalizes {{the case of an}} inner product. When the <b>bilinear</b> form applied to two vectors results in zero, then they are orthogonal. The case of a pseudo-Euclidean plane uses the term {{hyperbolic}} orthogonality. In the diagram, axes x′ and t′ are hyperbolic-orthogonal for any given ϕ.|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} probe to physics {{beyond the}} standard model {{is to look for}} scalar <b>bilinears,</b> which couple to two fermions of {{the standard model}}. We point out that the scalar <b>bilinears</b> allow new diagrams contributing to the neutrinoless double beta decay. The neutrinoless double beta decay lifetime would then give new constraints on the ratio of the masses of these scalars to their couplings to the fermions. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|We derive new {{explicit}} expressions for the Dirac <b>bilinears</b> {{based on}} a generic representation of the massive Dirac spinors with canonical polarization. These <b>bilinears</b> depend on a direction $n$ in Minkowski space which specifies the form of dynamics. We argue that such a dependence is unavoidable in a relativistic theory with spin, since it originates from Wigner rotation effects. Contrary {{to most of the}} expressions found in the literature, our ones are valid for all momenta and canonical polarizations of the spinors. As a by-product, we also obtain a generic explicit expression for the covariant spin vector. Comment: 9 pages, version accepted in PR...|$|R

40|$|Two sets of identities between unitary minimal Virasoro {{characters}} {{at levels}} m= 3, 4, 5 are presented and proven.

The second identity gives the tricritical Ising model characters as <b>bilinears</b> in the Ising model characters and the six combinations of m= 5 Virasoro characters which do not appear in the spectrum of the three state Potts model.

25|$|The singular-value {{decomposition}} {{was originally}} developed by differential geometers, {{who wished to}} determine whether a real <b>bilinear</b> form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on. Eugenio Beltrami and Camille Jordan discovered independently, in 1873 and 1874 respectively, that the singular values of the <b>bilinear</b> forms, represented as a matrix, form a complete set of invariants for <b>bilinear</b> forms under orthogonal substitutions. James Joseph Sylvester also arrived at the singular-value decomposition for real square matrices in 1889, apparently independently of both Beltrami and Jordan. Sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix A. The fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is Autonne in 1915, who arrived at it via the polar decomposition. The first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by Carl Eckart and Gale Young in 1936; they saw it as a generalization of the principal axis transformation for Hermitian matrices.|$|E

In recent years, simulations in lattice QCD have employed an ever increasing number of “improved ” actions for gluon and fermion fields. This practice is well motivated, since it leads to a reduction of O(a) effects (a: lattice size), thus resulting in a faster approach to continuum physics.
