5|$|Football resumed {{after the}} war for the 1919–20 season and Villa won their sixth FA Cup {{at the end of}} season, beating Huddersfield Town 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. In November 1923, Villa's centre-half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour, thus {{becoming}} the only active Football League player to have been murdered. In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923–24, Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 2–0 to Newcastle United. This Cup final was to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons. The Directors attempted to stop the slump with transfer dealings. In 1927, they bought both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton. In 1928, they bought {{in one of the most}} prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league. When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for £4,700, he was relatively unknown. Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930–31 season as Villa finished runners-up to Arsenal. One of the other purchases, Eric Houghton, scored 30 goals.|$|E

His first book The Rise of the Russian Empire, a historical study modelled upon Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, appeared in 1900, under his real name, but proved to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> false start.|$|E
25|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} the 2005 movie, Majesco Entertainment and developer Terminal Reality released a video game adaptation on Xbox and PlayStation 2. While primarily based on the film, elements from both the movie and the television series are included, as the game sets out to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> canonical link between the two—although the Æon character in the game is modeled only after Theron and is also voiced by her.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, a {{group of}} {{businessmen}} led by Joe Claudio formed the Perth Kangaroos IFC. The club competed in the 1994 Singapore Premier League along with the Darwin Cubs. At the time, there were visions of establishing an Asia-Pacific Super League which could become a sporting and financial empire in the east. It turned out to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> farce. The Kangaroos finished the league season undefeated and easily won the Singapore league title. However, with dwindling support and resources, the experiment {{proved to be a}} financial disaster and Perth Kangaroos IFC soon folded.|$|E
25|$|The {{announcement}} made top news {{all across}} the globe. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250million, the astronomical figure was soon revealed to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment). To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which {{in addition to his}} Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5million in total or $6.5million per year.|$|E

25|$|UVa {{entered this}} game with an 0-29 record against Clemson. The win was Virginia's first-ever victory over an {{opponent}} {{ranked in the}} top ten. Both goalposts came down when the fans stormed the field; the first actually fell with 48seconds still on the clock. The win proved to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> watershed in UVA football history in that it {{set the stage for the}} 1990 squad to begin the season 70, rising to #1 in the polls for the first time. In addition, in contrast to Virginia's historical futility against Clemson prior to the 1990 game, as of 2013 UVA has beaten Clemson eight times (and tied once) since that 1990 win, although since 2004 the schools no longer play every year due to the Atlantic Coast Conference's expansion.|$|E
25|$|Although E4 {{proteins}} {{are expressed}} at low levels {{during the early}} phase of viral infection, expression of E4 increases dramatically during the late phase of infection. In other words, its “E” appellation may <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misnomer. In the case of HPV-1, E4 can account for up to 30% of the total protein at {{the surface of a}} wart. The E4 protein of many papillomavirus types is thought to facilitate virion release into the environment by disrupting intermediate filaments of the keratinocyte cytoskeleton. Viral mutants incapable of expressing E4 do not support high-level replication of the viral DNA, but it is not yet clear how E4 facilitates DNA replication. E4 has also been shown to participate in arresting cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The victories, however, {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> false dawn as, over {{the space of}} five days in September, an injury-hit Ireland dropped five points from two games and saw their {{qualifying}} campaign effectively come to an end. Leading 2–1 away to Slovakia the team would emerge with just one point after an injury-time strike from Marek Cech cancelled their advantage. Staunton was disappointed by the performance but four days later, on 12 September, a 1–0 defeat to the Czech Republic in Prague crippled the qualifying campaign. A 0–0 draw with Germany on 13 October at Croke Park and a 1–1 draw at home to Cyprus in the same stadium four days later (during which a chorus of boos greeted the final whistle) secured qualification for both Germany and the Czech Republic. Ireland would not be competing in the 2008 European Championship.|$|E

25|$|The China Poblana was a {{real person}} who lived during the colonial period. Her real name was Mirra. She was an Indian who was brought over from Manila in the 1620s on the Manila Galleon as a child {{to work as a}} slave for the viceroy Marques de Gélves. She was soon sold to ship captain Miguel de Sosa who lived in Puebla. According to legend, Mirra was {{originally}} a princess in her home country but her family was displaced by the Portuguese and she was kidnapped by pirates who sold her. Mirra was considered to be beautiful and exotic. She had been converted to the Catholic faith. Later in her life, she began to have visions of the child Jesus and angels. Her fame grew and she was eventually considered to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prophet. When she died in 1688, people began to venerate her as a saint and many women copied her Asian/Mexican inspired dress.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of the press, the debate began to die down in late 1904. In December that year, after {{suffering}} from ailing eyesight for several years, Long went temporarily blind at the age of 47. Despite this setback, he continued to write; in early 1905 he began publishing a series of essays in Harper's Monthly under the pseudonym Peter Rabbit; told {{from the point of view}} of the [...] "author", the essays commented upon the human condition, animal intelligence, and the controversy first begun by Burroughs two years prior. The essays were published a year later in a collection titled Brier-Patch Philosophy.

They also described her as being bright, confident, having an outspoken nature and being [...] "full of contradictions". Holy Soap also described Sunny as having [...] "typical teenage insecurities", which included being self-conscious about her braces and her lack of experience with boys. This results in Sunny having an abrasive attitude. British television magazine, What's on TV described Sunny as being initially [...] "disappointed {{by the lack of}} excitement in Erinsborough", they also added [...] "Sunny appears snobby and unfriendly.

500|$|On September 21, 1922, Constable Steve Lawson of the Alberta Provincial Police {{was murdered}} at his Blairmore home by bootlegger Emil Picariello and his {{companion}} Florence Lassandra. [...] He {{was the third}} policeman killed in Alberta in liquor-related incidents in 1922. [...] The murder opened up a rift between Albertans of British descent, who saw bootlegging as an affront {{to the rule of}} law even if they did not support prohibition, and Albertans of southern and eastern European descent, who found prohibition to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> joke and accepted bootlegging. [...] Brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend Picariello and Lassandra. [...] Once they were arrested, he appeared personally at the prosecution's bench alongside A. A. McGillivray, reputedly Alberta's best courtroom lawyer, whose services he secured specifically for the case. [...] Picariello and Lassandra were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the {{previous}} season proved to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> false dawn though, with the team finishing 14th, seven points above relegation. After refusing to resign, Eric Houghton was sacked when relegation seemed imminent in 1958–59. His successor Joe Mercer was unable to prevent the club being relegated in 1959, {{for only the second}} time in its history. The fact that Villa reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup only served to highlight the complacency that had set in at the club that led to Villa being relegated. Villa only spent one season in the Second Division, returning as Champions in 1960. The 1960–61 season was a successful one; it saw Villa reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, finish ninth in the League, and win the inaugural League Cup. This was helped by the emergence of an exciting group of youth players, who became known as [...] "Mercer's Minors".|$|E
500|$|Groves summoned British help, in {{the form}} of Wallace Akers and fifteen members of the British gaseous {{diffusion}} project, who would review the progress made thus far.

On 16 January 1944, Groves ruled in favor of the Johnson barrier. Johnson built a pilot plant for the new process at the Nash Building. Taylor analyzed the sample barriers produced and pronounced only 5 percent of them to be of acceptable quality. Edward Mack Jr. created his own pilot plant at Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia, and Groves obtained [...] of nickel from the International Nickel Company. With plenty of nickel to work with, by April 1944, both pilot plants were producing barriers of acceptable quality 45 percent of the time.|$|E

500|$|As {{the fourth}} season {{was about to}} begin, almost {{two years after the}} {{previous}} season's end, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that The Wire [...] "has tackled the drug war in this country as it simultaneously explores race, poverty and 'the death of the American working class,' the failure of political systems to help the people they serve, and the tyranny of lost hope. Few series in the history of television have explored the plight of inner-city African Americans and none—not one—has done it as well." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety wrote at the time, [...] "When television history is written, little else will rival 'The Wire.'" [...] The New York Times called the fourth season of The Wire [...] "its best season yet." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times was more reserved in his praise, calling it the [...] "most ambitious" [...] show on television, but faulting it for its complexity and the slow development of the plotline. The Los Angeles Times took the rare step of devoting an editorial to the show, stating that [...] "even in what is generally acknowledged to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> golden era for thoughtful and entertaining dramas—both on cable channels and on network TV—The Wire stands out." [...] TIME magazine especially praised the fourth season, stating that [...] "no other TV show has ever loved a city so well, damned it so passionately, or sung it so searingly." [...] The website Metacritic, which gathers reviews from news sources and translates them into a percentage score, assigned The Wires fourth season a weighted average score of 98%, the second highest score for any television season in Metacritic history (with the fifth season of Breaking Bad being the first).|$|E
500|$|The {{arrival of}} Chrissie Watts was {{announced}} barely {{a month before}} she was set to first appear on-screen, and {{came at a time}} when EastEnders was undergoing immense media criticism and falling ratings. The rush of casting meant Oberman had little time to process the enormity of the part she had taken on, declaring: [...] "my feet haven't even touched the ground yet. [...] I haven't had time to think about what this role is going to do to my life! I'm very excited to be part of such a fantastic show and one I have been a fan of for many years." [...] She admitted, however, to being [...] "slightly intimidated" [...] by the high media profile and press interest surrounding the show at the time. Indeed, joining EastEnders [...] "proved to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> baptism of fire for Oberman", as she was playing opposite Leslie Grantham whose recent return to the show had been a highly publicised event. Twenty-four hours after Chrissie's first episode went to air a scandal surrounding Grantham hit the tabloid papers. According to Oberman, the atmosphere on set the next day [...] "was a bit tense" [...] but, she added, [...] "the Watts are pulling together and we're getting on with it and working". However Oberman was also reportedly finding things difficult, having walked into a highly complicated situation: [...] "Tracy-Ann is still really finding her feet on the show... she feels really left out because all the cast are blackballing Grantham and refusing to talk to him. Since most of her scenes are with Grantham, it's really hard for her." [...] Looking back on the incident after she had left EastEnders, Oberman remarked, [...] "I respect Leslie for fronting it out; he emerged from his dressing room and started working. No one mentioned the story. That's life in EastEnders; the machine never stops." ...|$|E
