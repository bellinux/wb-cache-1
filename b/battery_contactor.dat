50|$|Master Switch - Most often {{actually}} two separate switches, the Battery Master and the Alternator Master. The Battery Master activates a relay (sometimes called the <b>battery</b> <b>contactor)</b> which connects the battery to the aircraft's main electrical bus. The alternator master activates the alternator by applying {{power to the}} alternator field circuit. These two switches provide electrical power to all the systems in the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla {{described}} its July 2015 {{introduction of}} the 90kWh battery as a [...] "range upgrade" [...] of the 85kWh battery and explained that the 6% energy increase was due to [...] "improved cell chemistry" [...] {{and the introduction of}} silicon into the cell's graphite anode. Tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5%. Tesla also explained that apart from the P90D the Model S has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300A and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts. To reduce this uncertainty Tesla has for the P90D introduced Inconel <b>battery</b> <b>contactors</b> and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse, which monitors the current at the millisecond level, cuts the power with [...] "extreme precision and certainty" [...] and has a rating of 1,500A.|$|R
5000|$|Tesla Motors is {{now using}} Inconel, {{in place of}} steel, to upgrade the main <b>battery</b> pack <b>contactor</b> in its Model S so that it remains springy under the heat of heavy current. Tesla claims that this allows {{upgraded}} vehicles to safely increase the maximum pack output from 1300 to 1500 amps, allowing {{for an increase in}} power output (acceleration) Tesla refers to as [...] "Ludicrous Mode".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A grid {{energy storage}} system for photo voltaic (PV) {{applications}} contains three different power sources i. e., PV array, battery storage system and the grid. It is advisable to isolate these three different sources to ensure the equipment safety. The configuration proposed in this paper provides complete isolation between the three sources. A Power Balancing Control (PBC) method for this configuration is proposed to operate the system in three different modes of operation. Control of a dual active bridge (DAB) -based battery charger which provides a galvanic isolation between batteries and other sources is explained briefly. Various modes of operation of a grid {{energy storage system}} are also presented in this paper. Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is carried out to check {{the performance of the}} system and the PBC algorithm. A power circuit (comprised of the inverter, dual active bridge based battery charger, grid, PV cell, <b>batteries,</b> <b>contactors,</b> and switches) is simulated and the controller hardware and user interface panel are connected as HIL with the simulated power circuit through Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). HIL simulation results are presented to explain the control operation, steady-state performance in different modes of operation and the dynamic response of the system...|$|R
5000|$|A {{machinery}} compartment {{behind each}} cab housed auxiliary gear such as two motor generator sets, one of [...] {{and the other}} of , each coupled to a blower fan on its shaft for ventilating the main motors. In addition it contained a motor-driven rotary vacuum exhauster, air compressor, air reservoirs for the brakes, low-tension control contactors and resistances for the auxiliaries and <b>battery,</b> together with <b>contactor</b> gear for controlling the field of the larger motor generator.|$|R
