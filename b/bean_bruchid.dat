However, the {{distribution}} and relative. importance of these species have not been established in Tanzania. In this study, a bf!an bruchid survey was carried out {{to find out if}} the two <b>bean</b> <b>bruchid</b> species occurred in th ~ country. The survey was corzduded In 1993 and it was observed that both <b>bean</b> <b>bruchid</b> species were present in all regions surveyed. However, the speCies A. obte ctus was more dominant in all. regions except in Ruvuma and therefore ' appeared to be relatively more important than Z. subfasciatus. The occurrence of the two species in all surveyed regions indicates that both species are of economic importance in the country. There was no indication that the two species occur in well de-fined ecological zones...|$|E
40|$|Four isolectin {{forms of}} a seed lectin from mature seed of tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius) were {{isolated}} using solubility fractionation, affinity chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. The subunits are polypeptides with an apparent molecular mass of 30, 000 daltons. The 30 kilodalton subunits are produced starting approximately 13 days after flowering and subsequently comprise a major {{fraction of the}} proteins found in the mature seed. The amino terminus of each isolectin fraction {{was determined to be}} highly homologous with that of the subunits of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The tepary isolectin cross-reacts with both erythroagglutinating and leucoagglutinating subunits of PHA antibodies, although differential cross-reactivity was noted. A seed protein fraction enriched in tepary bean lectin was found to be toxic to <b>bean</b> <b>bruchid</b> beetles (Acanthoscelides obtectus), when incorporated into their diets at incremental concentrations from (1 - 5 % w/w) above that of PHA concentrations in mature seeds of the susceptible common bean variety “Red Kidney. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{tropical}} forage legume Clitoria ternatea (L.) {{has important}} agronomic traits such as adaptation {{to a wide}} range of soil conditions and resistance to drought. It is resistant to a number of pathogens and pests. These important traits gave us reasons to look more closely at the plant. A highly basic small protein was purified from seeds of C. ternatea to homogeneity by using ultrafiltration with Centricon- 3 membrane tubes and preparative granulated-bed isoelectric focusing (IEF). A single protein band was obtained on both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IEF gels. The protein, designated ‘finotin’, has broad and potent inhibitory effect on the growth of various important fungal pathogens of plants, namely Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pyricularia grisea, Bipolaris oryzae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. It also inhibits the common bean bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli. Moreover, finotin has powerful inhibitory properties against the <b>bean</b> <b>bruchids</b> Zabrotes subfasciatus and Acanthoscelides obtectus...|$|R
40|$|On-farm storages <b>bean</b> <b>bruchids</b> control {{experiments}} were conducted from March to August 2003 in Eastern DR Congo. Two farmers' associations {{were involved in}} the work. The effectiveness of two different approaches of bruchids management was evaluated. These two approaches were: farmers' practices and the improved approaches. Farmers' approach involve mixing plants leaves from 2 to 12 botanicals and forming layers that therefore were admixed to beans in sacks before storage. Plant leaves are applied by farmers at variable rates: 750 g to 1500 g/ 5 kg of bean grains to conserve. The improved approach involves mixing powders from several botanicals. Different doses were tested along aside the farmers' dosages: 0, 100, 200 g of powders / 5 kg of bean seeds. Plant materials were admixed to bean varieties (Kirundo, Ishikazi, Lwera, Haricot soja and VCB), and thereafter stored in farmers' stores. Bean seeds were infested with bruchids before storage in farmer' stores. Members of the two associations were involved, as well as extension staff and village chiefs. Experimental designs were set up in partnership with farmers association members. The storage period was of 6 months. The farmers, who accepted to cooperate in the experiments by offering their stores for the study, were also involved in monitoring of the trials. Overall, powders bean-treated were less damaged. Results show that addition of 200 g per 5 kg of bean seeds significantly reduced infestation and losses by bruchids in farmers' storages. The number of emerged bruchids, the percentage of weight loss and the percentage of seeds damaged were of 32 - 122 against 126 - 2920 (control), 1. 3 - 8. 6 % against 23. 4 - 71. 08 % (control), and 1. 8 - 29. 8 % against 19. 9 - 89. 9 % (control) respectively. Plant powders were rated by farmers as first compared to the plant leaves in the management of <b>bean</b> <b>bruchids.</b> Additional research is required to determine the environmental and human health implications of these powders. The replication of the trials at low rate of applications of the different doses, would be interesting to investigate, since the current effective dose seems to be high and not economic or rational...|$|R
40|$|Acanthoscelides Schilsky {{is a large}} genus of neotropical bruchid beetles, {{in which}} most species show host plant specialization. Acanthoscelides obtectus and Acanthoscelides obvelatus are two sibling species {{specialized}} on Phaseolus beans, and are therefore considered pests. Up to now, the status of these two taxa has remained unclear, the few studies conducted having failed to elucidate whether these are two differentiated species or a single morphologically variable species. In addition, A. obvelatus has not been {{taken into account in}} the great majority of studies of <b>bean</b> <b>bruchids.</b> In this morphological and genetic study, we show that A. obtectus and A. obvelatus are two true non-hybridizing species, which diverged about 22 Mya. Although the two species demonstrate only few morphological differences, we point out some diagnostic characters that enable their identification in the field. We also address a genetic method of differentiation of the two species, based on species-specific microsatellite loci. The strong morphological resemblance of these two species, despite their ancient divergence, {{may be the result of}} evolutionary stasis, which could be the consequence of stabilizing selection. Niche differentiation could enable the two species to coexist indefinitely. Key words: Sibling species – bruchids – coleoptera – phylogenetic studies – evolutionary stasi...|$|R
40|$|Acanthoscelides obtectus is {{a devastating}} storage insect pest capable of causing severe bean crop losses. In order to {{maintain}} their own development, insect pest larvae feed continuously, synthesizing efficient digestive enzymes. Among them, cysteine proteinases (CPs) are commonly produced as inactive precursors (procysteines), requiring a cleavage of the peptide proregion to become active. The proregion fits tightly into the active site of procysteines, efficiently preventing their activity. In this report, a CP cDNA (cpao) was isolated from A. obtectus midgut larvae. In silico studies indicated that the complete CP sequence contains a hydrophobic signal peptide, a prodomain and a conserved catalytic region. Moreover, the encoding cDNA contains 963 bp translating into a 321 residue protein, CPAo, which was expressed in E. coli, fused with thioredoxin. Enzymatic assays using the recombinant protein revealed that the enzyme was catalytically active, being able to cleave the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg- 7 -AMC. Additionally, this report also focuses the cpao propeptide (PCPAo) subcloning and expression. The expressed propeptide efficiently inhibited CPAo, as well as digestive CP of other <b>bean</b> <b>bruchids.</b> Little or no activity was found against proteolytic enzymes of two other coleopterans: Rhyzopertha dominica and Anthonomus grandis. The data reported here indicate the possibility of endogenous propeptides as a novel strategy on bruchids control, which could be applicable to bean improvement programs...|$|R

40|$|Bean {{production}} in Africa is very heterogeneous with much variation in environmental conditions, cropping systems, preferences and constraints. This working document contains {{information on the}} many bean producing areas in Africa. The data were gleaned from numerous sources but {{a major part of}} these are from the observations of CIAT and national bean program researchers over the last ten years. Thirteen bean producing environments are defined from consideration of altitude, latitude, soil pH and seasonal rainfall. Seventy bean producing areas, having estimated annual bean production of between 2, 000 and 220, 000 hectares, are described on the bases of environmental and socio-economic characteristics, cropping systems, farmer and consumer preferences, and biotic and abiotic constraints. The importance of the constraints was evaluated both on a pan-African and a regional basis. Angular leaf spot, anthracnose, <b>bean</b> stem maggot, <b>bruchids,</b> low soil nitrogen and low soil phosphorus were determined {{to be the most important}} constraints to greater productivity on a pan-African basis...|$|R

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 80 % of all seed used by farmers in the tropics is derived from stocks held on-farm from previous seasons. If yields are to be sustained and even increased {{it is essential that}} seed storage is of a consistently high standard. Good quality seed is central to productive agriculture. Poor planting material results in poor field establishment and ultimately poor yields, irrespective of subsequent inputs. Farmers choose to maintain their own seed stocks for a variety of reasons: the formal seed sector cannot, or does not, provide those varieties which farmers prize; the cost of buying fresh seed of 'improved' varieties on a regular basis is prohibitive; and because it appears that farmer selection of seed stocks often allows maintenance of yield levels under small-scale conditions. Because of the relatively small quantities involved and because sorting and planting are done by hand, farmers can select the largest seeds and those that are free of insect and mould attack, thereby ensuring plant-seeds with maximal vigour. Despite this preponderance of farmer-held material, very little attention has been directed towards assisting farmers in maintaining their seed stocks in the best possible condition. Grain stored for food and grain held as seed face many of the same problems, such as insect and rodent infestation and mould attack, and hence many lessons learnt from experience with grain storage {{can be applied to the}} seed situation. However, food grain seeds are only useful if they remain viable. Since seeds are more sensitive to the effects of temperature and humidity than food grain stocks, they need to be handled with additional care in order to maintain their germination potential. Agricultural development programmes that have a seed component often start with the premise that on-farm storage of seed must necessarily be inadequate and in need of improvement. These assumptions are rarely supported with survey or experimental data and their validity needs to be questioned. Indigenous knowledge With increasing appreciation of indigenous technical knowledge some studies have been undertaken to document farmer seed-saving practices. These studies show that farmers actively select planting material which they may then handle and treat in a different way to their food grain. In Zimbabwe detailed qualitative studies show clearly that farmers have an extensive understanding of techniques which maximize seed performance. Such documentation of farmer practices is extremely useful but it is also important that some quantitative measure of success can be attributed to the various techniques. The organization Seeds of Survival working in central Ethiopia has, from preliminary data, established that germination levels of farm saved seed, from a variety of crops, was above 70 % after six months storage in 85 % of their samples. These findings are supported by a more extensive survey undertaken by staff of the Natural Resources Institute, UK, with collaborating national institutes in Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania. A total of 1, 859 samples of five important crops were taken from farmers' seed stocks and assessed for germination potential just prior to planting. Maize, cowpeas and soya showed mean germination levels of above 75 % whilst beans and groundnut were less consistent, though still good. Until now, these quantitative studies have been carried out in countries or regions where the climate is conducive to successful seed storage, having significant dry seasons during which seeds can be conditioned before being placed in store. Whether or not farmer techniques are equally successful under hot humid conditions has yet to be established. In terms of volume, farmer seed requirements are often small. This means that farmers can invest more time, effort and care into the maintenance of seed quality than would be practicable for food grain stocks. Often this simply means using a sealable container to prevent insect attack. Alternatively, farmers apply traditional or insecticidal admixtures to control or prevent insect infestation. For example, some farmers in northern Ghana mix their cowpea seeds with shea nut oil, which appears to have an excellent repellent effect on <b>bean</b> <b>bruchids.</b> Other farmers, who store their maize seeds as suspended cobs, cover them with plastic sheeting or gourd shards as rat guards. These farmer initiatives are often very localized, despite being useful components of a seed storage strategy. Further studies would allow extension staff to decide which of these indigenous practices could usefully be more widely advertised. In addition, strategies that already have proven advantages but which are not universally adopted, should be promoted: for example, the selection of maize seed at harvest rather than just before the following planting season. Is change necessary? In the areas investigated it seems unlikely that at the farmer level, seed storage practices need to be drastically altered. Farmer techniques work sufficiently well and the only rationale for a radical change m storage practices would be if some major external change took place. This could include declining availability of traditional materials used as admixtures such as botanical insecticides because of over-cropping, unusual weather patterns, or the appearance of a novel pest against which traditional measures are ineffective (e. g. larger grain borer). It is clear that in zones that have a climate suited to seed storage, farmers are frequently very accomplished at E maintaining the viability of their own seed stocks. The techniques employed, which may have evolved over considerable periods of time, are usually well adapted to the farming. system in which they are used. However, there is room for improvement to many of the current practices through farmers learning from each other. Change can be brought about through awareness activities. This could take several forms, such as direct advice or through information exchanges, allowing farmers to become aware of techniques used successfully in other areas of the country. In this respect researchers and extension staff are most suited to act in the role of facilitators through the establishment of 'best practices' from among the range of techniques available, supporting farmer-based technologies and only offering totally new practices where the local systems can be shown to be failing. It {{is estimated}} that 80 % of all seed used by farmers in the tropics is derived from stocks held on-farm from previous seasons. If yields are to be sustained and even increased it is essential that seed storage is of a consistently high standard [...] . ...|$|R
