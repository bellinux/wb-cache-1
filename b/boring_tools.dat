Hammering tests of the developed tool clarified that appropriate anisotropic frequency response function is roughly attained by the proposed design. The developed tool was subsequently applied to turning experiments, and it was clarified that the stability limit in the radial depth of cut significantly increases by using the proposed <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> {{as compared to the}} ordinary <b>boring</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|R

50|$|Modern <b>boring</b> <b>tools</b> {{have three}} primary {{components}} although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (bar holder) is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the dial screw. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight distortion if {{the cutting tool}} is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called unbalanced gyroscope precession. Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the boring tool. <b>Boring</b> <b>tools</b> can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMachining is {{a complex}} process in which many {{variables}} can detrimental the desired results. Among them, tool vibration is the most critical phenomenon which affects {{the life of the}} cutting tool, quality of the components machined and functional behaviour of the machined tools. This familiar phenomenon is recognized in many operations including boring, milling and drilling. The causing factors are related to the machine tool itself, tool clamping, length and diameter of the tool holder and the cutting data to be used. One way to avoid vibration problem during boring process is the location of <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> holder in the relevant position for increasing the precision of the machining process.

The experiments designed four types of <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> rake angle and two types of coolant, and measured surface roughness and radial runout of workpiece with three acclivitous holes. The results showed that the surface integrity of workpiece obtained by 0. 16 mm/rev feed rate with rake angle of tool 25 o were superior to that obtained by the previous boring processes. Radial runout precision was highest when feed rate and rake angle were 0. 13 mm/rev and 23 o, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of vibrations on surface roughness generated during boring with {{the application of the}} conventional <b>boring</b> <b>tool</b> and one with the damper is presented. The experiments included the measurement of vibration accelerations carried out with the piezoelectric sensor, as well as the evaluation of surface roughness parameters after each machining pass. The obtained results reveal that in the investigated range, no stability loss was found. Furthermore, the growth of the rotational speed induces the increase of vibration level, as well as the growth {{of the differences between the}} vibration values generated during boring with the conventional tool and one equipped with damper. Vibrations have also the direct influence on the machined surface roughness. In case of the tool equipped with the damper, the tool’s overhang L had more intense influence than rotational speed n.

50|$|So {{that the}} entire {{locomotive}} cylinder block {{does not have to}} be changed when the valves are damaged, they are housed in special chests. The valve chest consists of two elements which are forced into the cylinder block from the front and rear. Using special <b>boring</b> <b>tools</b> this chest can be bored out several times during maintenance. In the last illustration the junction of the two halves of the chest and the right-angled ports can be seen towards the rear. These are steam admission ports. Steam is admitted to the pistons of the steam engine through the front diagonal slits. The front area, outside the valve chest, is called the exhaust chest and discharges, via the exhaust pipe, the riser (Standrohr) and the blast pipe cap (Blasrohrkopf) centrally, underneath the chimney of the locomotive. The motion of the valve heads alternately opens and closes the diagonal slits or steam ports, thus controlling the admission and exhausting of steam in the steam engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} deposits {{are of a}} Mesolithic (circa 10,000 BC) hunting camp excavated by Davey in Northbrooks in the 1970s (Unpublished) {{closely followed}} by the large and unexcavated deposits of Neolithic flint beside Gilden Way. These deposits are mostly known {{because of the large}} numbers of surface-bound, worked flint. Substantial amounts of worked flint suggest an organised working of flint in the area. Large amounts of debitage litter the area and tools found include axeheads, hammers, blades, dowels and other <b>boring</b> <b>tools</b> and multipurpose flints such as scrapers. An organised field walk in the late 1990s by Bartlett (Unpublished) indicates that most of the area, some 80 hectares, produced worked flint from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age with a smattering of Mesolithic. This indicates organised industry existed from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. The deposits are so large and dispersed that any major archaeological work in the area will have to take this into consideration before any ground work is started. Harlow was in Roman times the site of a small town (around Harlow Mill railway station) with a substantial stone built temple.|$|E
