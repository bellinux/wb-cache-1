25|$|The {{methods used}} in speech {{perception}} research can be roughly {{divided into three}} groups: behavioral, computational, and, more recently, neurophysiological methods. Behavioral experiments are based on an active role of a participant, i.e. subjects are presented with stimuli and asked to make conscious decisions about them. This can {{take the form of}} an identification test, a discrimination test, similarity rating, etc. These types of experiments help to provide a <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> of how listeners perceive and categorize speech sounds.|$|E
25|$|Art {{director}} James Robbins {{developed the}} design of the Ori and the Priors from scratch. At the beginning he knew a <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> of them and their powers, and that they would carry a staff weapon. The art department first looked at Japanese and Samurai from a costuming point of view. Inspired by remote jungle tribes for the mystical aspects, Robbins {{came up with the idea}} of scarification for the Priors and the Doci. The Priors have scarifications on the chin and the cheek, while the Doci also have them on their forehead. Scarification would therefore be a symbol of high establishment. Originally, it was also considered to have scarification on the hands, and to have the Priors have finger extensions, but this became too impracticable. When the Prime Jaffa Gerak became a Prior in , his golden Jaffa tattoo on his forehead was replaced with a Prior scarification, and his makeup was made to look like the gold had melted and become part of his Prior scarification.|$|E

500|$|The first Native American {{language}} Whorf studied was the Uto-Aztecan language Nahuatl {{which he}} studied first from colonial grammars and documents, {{and later became}} the subject of his first field work experience in 1930. Based on his studies of Classical Nahuatl Whorf argued that Nahuatl was an oligosynthetic language, a typological category that he invented. In Mexico working with native speakers, he studied the dialects of Milpa Alta and Tepoztlán. His grammar sketch of the Milpa Alta dialect of Nahuatl was not published during his lifetime, but it was published posthumously by Harry Hoijer and became quite influential and used as the <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> of [...] "Modern Nahuatl" [...] by many scholars. The description of the dialect is quite condensed and in some places difficult to understand because of Whorf's propensity of inventing his own unique terminology for grammatical concepts, but the work has generally been considered to be technically advanced. He also produced an analysis of the prosody of these dialects which he related to the history of the glottal stop and vowel length in Nahuan languages. This work was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen in 1993, who also considered it a valuable description of the two endangered dialects, and the only one of its kind to include detailed phonetic analysis of supra-segmental phenomena.|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with investors on 17 October (reported in a Morgan Stanley {{research}} note), Olympus Executive Vice-President Hisashi Mori said the company might sue Woodford for releasing internal information to news media. Olympus issued statements on 19 October defending the acquisitions of Altis, News Chef, and Humalabo, saying that they [...] "were determined to have great potential in the medical and health care industries." [...] Press reported that although the three companies had [...] "minuscule capital funds", their combined business value was estimated at between ¥96.9–124.6billion (US$1.3–1.6billion). Olympus denied that the acquisitions were unrelated to the core business. The description given of the companies on 19 October, and how they fit into the group's strategy, were contradicted by the later statement: initially, Altis was described as being engaged in [...] "environmental solutions business proposing resources recycling and CO2 reduction focused on petrochemical plants." [...] In a 27 October disclosure, the unit was [...] "mainly engaged in recycling business for medical waste." [...] Humalabo was described initially said to undertake [...] "research and development/sale of skin improving substances using [...] basidomycota", but in the later statement was said to be [...] "mainly engaged in development of [...] supplements with ingredients extracted from shiitake mushroom mycelium." [...] While the <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> of News Chef as a maker of cookware for microwave ovens was not changed, Olympus added that [...] "disease prevention and prognosis through foods" [...] was one of its objects.|$|E

2500|$|With {{more control}} over the film, Dante {{engineered}} a project that he later referred to as [...] "one of the more unconventional studio pictures, ever." [...] Dante included some material that he believed Warner Bros. would not have allowed had they not wanted a sequel to Gremlins. Allowed to break a number of rules in filmmaking, he also later claimed it was the film into which he had put the most of his personal influence. Dante imagined Gremlins 2 as a satire of Gremlins and sequels in general. Another <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> of Gremlins 2 was that, as Dante said, an hour into the film it becomes [...] "extremely cartoony." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was 1996 {{when three}} Russian {{biomedical}} engineers (Bobylev, Gromova, Toloknov) wrote, [...] "To date, the feedback principle of insulin therapy {{is not fully}} implemented {{because the number of}} monitored physiological parameters is insufficient ... In the early 1960's, Kadish used a system consisting of a glucose sensor, a processor, and a pump to control glycemia in patients with diabetes." [...] Later, this system was developed by Albisser. Today, nearly 50 years after Dr. Arnold Kadish's system, and after advancements as measured by Nobel prizes awarded in medicine, chemistry, and physics, and after more than 23 million people in the United States alone were diagnosed with diabetes in 2007, the industry continues to have the same <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> of a pump system in the marketplace, [...] "a glucose sensor, a processor, and a pump" [...] instead of [...] "sensors, processors, and pumps".|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} risk and resulting {{costs of a}} woman possibly leaving jobs {{for a period of}} time or indefinitely to nurse a baby is cited by many to be a reason why women are less common in the higher paying occupations such as CEO positions and upper management. [...] It is much easier for a man to be hired in these higher prestige jobs than to risk losing a female job holder. Thomas Sowell argued in his 1984 book Civil Rights that most of pay gap is based on marital status, not a [...] "glass ceiling" [...] discrimination. Earnings for men and women of the same <b>basic</b> <b>description</b> (education, jobs, hours worked, marital status) were essentially equal. That result would not be predicted under explanatory theories of [...] "sexism". However, it can be seen as a symptom of the unequal contributions made by each partner to child raising. Cathy Young cites men's and fathers' rights activists who contend that women do not allow men to take on paternal and domestic responsibilities. Many Western countries have some form of paternity leave to attempt to level the playing field in this regard. However, even in relatively gender-equal countries like Sweden, where parents are given 16 months of paid parental leave irrespective of gender, fathers take on average only 20% of the 16 months of paid parental and choose to transfer their days to their partner. In addition to maternity leave, Walter Block and Walter E. Williams have argued that marriage in and of itself, not maternity leave, in general will leave females with more household labor than the males. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that married women earn 75.5% as much as married men while women who have never married earn 94.2% of their unmarried male counterparts' earnings.|$|E
