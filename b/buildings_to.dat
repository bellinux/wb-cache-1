5|$|Fairlight House, {{built in}} 1914, was {{included}} within {{the site and}} later became the residence of the Commander of US Naval Activities, United Kingdom. RAF Records were also based at the site along with the Maintenance Unit. The Great Western Railway, now the Chiltern Main Line, ran through the site, separating the regimental <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> the north from the depot <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> the south.|$|E
5|$|Pei {{also drew}} {{inspiration}} from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples; he wanted the <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, {{he called for a}} rock-treatment process that could color the <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.|$|E

5|$|Kehoe {{murdered his}} wife Nellie {{sometime}} between May 16 {{and the morning}} of May 18, 1927; she had just been discharged from the hospital with an undefined illness.

5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury {{newspaper}} The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The main contractor for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E

5|$|Some of the cleaner energy {{facilities}} in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for <b>buildings</b> <b>to</b> be more environmentally conscious.|$|E

5|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} of local limestone. Stones were attached {{with the use}} of pozzolana. It was this successful feature that gave most praise to Bontadini.
