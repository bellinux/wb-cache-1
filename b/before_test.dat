500|$|Owing to {{the rush}} to {{complete}} the film, The Motion Picture was never screened <b>before</b> <b>test</b> audiences, something Wise later regretted. The director carried the fresh print of the film to the world premiere, held at the K-B MacArthur Theater in Washington, D.C. Roddenberry, Wise, and the principal cast attended the function, which also served as an invitational benefit for the scholarship and youth education fund of the National Space Club. While thousands of fans were expected to attend, rain reduced fan turnout to around 300. The premiere {{was followed by a}} black-tie reception at the National Air and Space Museum. More than 500 people—consisting of the cast and crew, working members of the space community, and the few [...] "hardcore Trekkies" [...] who could afford the $100 admission price—filled the museum. The film was the first major Hollywood adaptation of a television series that had been off the air for nearly a decade to retain its original principal cast.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} shock-induced aggression {{as a function}} of housing rats in single or communal cages for varying periods of time <b>before</b> <b>testing.</b> Rates of fighting were unaffected by housing conditions when rats spent seven or 14 days in either of these settings <b>before</b> <b>testing.</b> Placing rats in these settings for 21 or 28 days <b>before</b> <b>testing,</b> however, did affect rates of fighting. Communal caging of subjects for 28 days <b>before</b> <b>testing</b> was particularly deleterious to shock-induced aggression. How rats are housed outside the experimental chamber is a variable affecting shock-induced aggression and should be considered both in designing future studies and as a topic for future investigation...|$|R

2500|$|After 1739, [...] "England" [...] (or [...] "all-England") {{became a}} generic {{term used to}} denote {{numerous}} teams {{over the next two}} hundred years. They invariably have important match status, depending on the quality and/or status of their opponents. Sometimes, the all-England teams were given names like [...] "The Rest", which more accurately describes them vis-à-vis their opponents. CricketArchive (CA) lists 29 matches involving teams called England or The Rest between 1739 and 1778. These are all important matches but only one, England v Kent in 1744, has a scorecard. The earliest important match that has been designated [...] "first-class" [...] by CA (i.e., coded F1) was between a Hampshire county team and one called England on Broadhalfpenny Down at Hambledon in Hampshire on 24 June 1772. CA lists all matches involving teams called England without differentiating between international and non-international, so it seems they assume the [...] "England" [...] team of 1772 to be a direct predecessor of the modern England Test team. Not helpfully, CA also uses the term [...] "England XI" [...] and has another list, starting in 1872, of matches played by this team which is currently understood to be the England national team when playing non-international matches on tour. CA's list of England XI matches begins five years <b>before</b> <b>Test</b> cricket started and most of the early matches are between a university team and what is loosely termed an England XI.|$|E
