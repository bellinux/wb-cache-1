5|$|Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, {{most people}} were already {{residing}} at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year. Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed. Officials also ordered for cars to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, 2010, in a {{game against}} the Ottawa Senators, Phaneuf {{sustained}} an injury in the leg by having it cut open with a skate from Peter Regin while crashing into the boards. He was carried off the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ice for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

25|$|Mullion sailed Kingsmill to the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands. From {{there she}} took her slaves to Martinique.

By 16 April she was at Martinique with destination Liverpool.

25|$|In {{spite of}} the success, the design also {{demonstrated}} several serious problems. In particular, the gyroscopic platform had to be leveled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy. Worse, the gyros had a limited degree of movement, and if the plane banked far enough the gyro would reach its limit {{and have to be}} re-set from scratch - something that could happen even due to strong turbulence. If the gyros were found to <b>be</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> leveling procedure took as long as eight and a half minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But in spite of all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} {{as a result of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for an entire year; the producers were exploring ways to get back on the air earlier. Ideas included airing webisodes or mobisodes. According to the President of Entertainment at Fox, [...] "We were going to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air for a while and how do you bridge that gap. We thought about doing something online and after talking with [...] Howard Gordon we decided to do it on air." [...] The working title for the film was 24: Exile, until the change to 24: Redemption.|$|E
500|$|Baseball writer Josh Pahigian {{writes that}} {{membership}} in the club has been [...] "long considered the greatest measure of superior bat handling." [...] Reaching 3,000 hits {{is often described as}} a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. All eligible club members, with the exception of Palmeiro, have been elected to the Hall, and since 1962 all club members who have been inducted were elected on the first ballot, except for Biggio. Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame because he was permanently banned from baseball in 1989. [...] After four years on the ballot, Palmeiro failed to be named on 5% of ballots in 2014, and his name will <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ballot for future elections. Twenty-one different teams have had a player reach 3,000 hits.|$|E

500|$|From {{atop the}} ridge {{on the eastern}} side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the {{accuracy}} of the reports of land to the east by Charles Wilkes during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition. By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, [...] "We now appear to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> real continent edge." [...] Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days. On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed neuralgia on the left side of his face and a whitlow on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger.|$|E
500|$|The two-hour premiere episode {{cost up to}} $10 {{million to}} produce, and Cameron {{reportedly}} [...] "brought the pilot in on time and on budget". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and guerilla marketing. Cameron took a [...] "very basic view" [...] of the show's chance of success, saying: [...] "If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air. It's that simple." [...] Eglee admitted the series had been [...] "routinely overbudget" [...] in the first season, and feared {{that this would be}} a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Enterprise had been cancelled. This news was passed to the cast and crew during the sixth day of production on [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly". The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that [...] "After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over. Which is a good thing. It needs a rest". He added that he wasn't sure how long Star Trek would <b>be</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air, but called it a [...] "gestation" [...] instead of a [...] "cancellation".|$|E

The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May. With all of the additional coal and other supplies loaded for the lengthy voyage, the ship was [...] overweight; most of which was stored high in the ship and reduced her stability.
