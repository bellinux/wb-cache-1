5|$|During some Christmases of {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the <b>Baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in Jönköping in Sweden, once thrown into the nearby lake of Vättern.

5|$|The festive {{kindling}} of the badnjak commemorates {{the fire}} that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of Bethlehem {{built in the}} cave where Jesus Christ was born, to warm the <b>Baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> and his mother throughout the night. The badnjak may {{also be seen as}} a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which, in the Christian belief, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other South Slavic peoples have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.|$|E

500|$|Starting in 2005, Pitt's {{relationship}} with Angelina Jolie {{became one of}} the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. After confirming that Jolie was pregnant in early 2006, the significant media hype surrounding the couple reached what Reuters, in a story titled [...] "The Brangelina fever," [...] called [...] "the point of insanity". To avoid media attention, the couple flew to Namibia for the birth of their daughter Shiloh, which was described by a paparazzi blog as [...] "the most anticipated <b>baby</b> since <b>Jesus</b> Christ." [...] Similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement two years later of Jolie's second pregnancy; for the two weeks Jolie spent in a seaside hospital in Nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.|$|R
5000|$|The Children of God practiced flirty {{fishing and}} escort {{servicing}} from 1974 until 1987, {{when it was}} officially abandoned, {{in part because of}} the AIDS epidemic.

25|$|A pulpit {{from the}} conventual church of São Francisco was {{transferred}} to Santa Cruz on 9 October 1782, but by 1794 it was already replaced by a black cedar pulpit, painted and gilded.

25|$|A boastful donkey {{refuses to}} behave or obey {{the orders of}} its masters. Having {{a mind of its}} own, it leaves {{whatever}} master it has and manages to wander through Judea. Sheltering in the stable in Bethlehem, it witnesses the birth of Jesus, the shepherds, the three wise men and the visitation of an angel. Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the <b>baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed. It becomes the donkey that takes Joseph, Mary and Jesus into Egypt, once knowing by instinct when Herod's soldiers are near and hiding them.|$|E
25|$|An {{image of}} Mary holding the Christ child is the carving that {{separates}} The Adoration {{from the next}} panel containing the Presentation and then the Flight. The temple sits in the upper left hand corner presiding over the Toga cloaked figures below. The Style of the building is yet again Gothic which is juxtaposed with the Roman style characters of the panel. On {{the bottom of the}} left side there is the narrative of Mary and Joseph with <b>baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> meeting Simeon outside the temple. Then immediately to the right of these figures there is the carving of the Holy family fleeing to Egypt {{on the back of a}} mule.|$|E
25|$|The story {{continues}} with King Herod asking his advisers about ancient prophesies describing {{the birth of}} such a child. As {{a result of their}} advice, he sends soldiers to kill every boy child under the age of two in the city of Bethlehem. But Joseph has been warned in a dream, and flees to Egypt with Mary and the <b>baby,</b> <b>Jesus.</b> The gruesome scene of the Massacre of the Innocents, as the murder of the babies is generally referred, was particularly depicted by Early Renaissance and Baroque painters. The Flight into Egypt was another popular subject, showing Mary with the baby on a donkey, led by Joseph (borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine Journey to Bethlehem).|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is flanked by}} two large sculptures of Saint Christopher carrying <b>baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> and a skeleton (grim reaper with a cloak and a large scythe) standing on crowns and other symbols of power. Saint Christopher is a protector, but death is still awaits everyone equally and Christians should prepare for it. The vestibule also has a scene of Last Judgment with various monsters and demons. The {{left side of the}} vestibule has a small room used as baptistery, while the right has a room for wakes. The latter has a scene of Pilate's court that thematically starts the Stations of the Cross. The colorful stations hang in the central nave and lead to the Altar of the Five Wounds of Christ.|$|E
25|$|In Spain {{and some}} Latin American countries, Epiphany day is called El Día de los Reyes i.e., {{the day when}} a group of Kings or Magi, as related in the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, arrived to worship and bring three gifts to the <b>baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> after {{following}} a star in the heavens. This day is sometimes known as the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) or La Pascua de los Negros (Holy Day of the Black men) in Chile, although the latter is rarely heard. In Spanish tradition on January 6, three of the Kings: Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, representing Arabia, the Orient, and Africa, arrived on horse, camel and elephant, bringing respectively gold, frankincense and myrrh to the <b>baby</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Before going to bed on the eve of January 6, children polish their shoes and leave them ready for the Kings' presents to be put in them. The next morning presents will appear under their shoes, or if the children are deemed to have misbehaved during the year, coal (usually a lump of hard sugar candy dyed black, called Carbón Dulce). Most towns in Spain arrange colorful parades representing the arrival of the Reyes Magos to town so children can see them in their camels or carriages before they go to bed. The oldest of this parades is held in Alcoi, Alacant – Alicante (Valencian Community) which has hosted an annual parade since 1885. Sweet wine, nibbles, fruit and milk are left for the Kings and their camels. In Spain, children typically receive presents on this day, rather than on Christmas, though this tradition has changed lately, and children now receive presents on both days. The Epiphany bread/cake is known as Roscón, Tortell de Reis in Catalan, and in Mexico as Rosca de reyes.|$|E
25|$|Two Spanish friars, Brothers Gabriel de Fontaned and Guillermo de Rigosa {{traveled}} to Rome {{to meet the}} Pope for the approval of their order (The Order of Minims for the Service of the Sick or The Order of Saint Francis of Paola). As they were passing through the town of Traigueras (under the jurisdiction of Tortosa in the Principate of Catalonia), a furious storm descended upon them. The brothers prayed for God's guidance and help. Immediately they saw a mysterious light coming from a cave in a cliff. Climbing up, they entered and found a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary holding the <b>Baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> in her arms. They reported being surrounded by shimmering lights and fragrant scents. As no one claimed the statue, the two carried it with them, hoping that the Blessed Mother would help in getting approval for their order.|$|E
25|$|The main chapel, {{elevated}} {{another three}} steps, is {{integrated into a}} large boulder, with two small retabular structures, dedicated to the Menino Jesus (<b>Baby</b> <b>Jesus)</b> and Senhora da Boa Morte (Our Lady of Good Death), protected by iron grades, an oratory and nativity. Over the boulder is an oratory dedicated to Nossa Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows). To the left is a doorway access to the Chapel of the Holy Sacrement, surmounted by a relief coat-of-arms, while flanked by pilasters topped by sculptures of lions is the arcosolium and grave of Pedro do Soveral. Immediately opposite, is the small door to the sacristy, with a staircase access to the belltower. The nativity, inset in the boulder, is protected by glass doors. The small cove with the Sagrada Família and Adoration of the Shepards and central to the diorama, with Glória de Anjos and Deus Pai above, while to the left, is the Fuga para o Egipto (Flight to Egypt), while in the upper right is the cortege of the Wise Men, descending.|$|E
25|$|In 1610, a visitor, Father João Álvares, {{recommended}} {{the construction of}} an actual sanctuary, which was begun, and would actually be the center of the devotion to Nossa Senhora da Lapa in Portugal, India and Brazil, through missionaries who travelled from this location. The ordered construction included iron grades, a portable altar to the north, remodelling of the dependencies and construction of a house for the treasurer, while expanding the religious buildings, courtyard and purchasing guesthouses for visitors. In addition, there was the authorization to cover the altar in a wood structure, and construct a gilded altar dedicated to the <b>Baby</b> <b>Jesus,</b> flanked by images of Saints Ignatius and Francis Xavier. A triumphal arch and extension to the church body also progressed, with the respective axial and transversal porticos in the south, along with a third doorway to access the sacristy and guesthouse. To the north, the Casa dos Pesos was constructed, with collateral retables, as well as a pulpit in front of the Chaepl of Santo Cristo.|$|E
25|$|Mary {{is alone}} in the stable in Bethlehem with the <b>baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> when she {{receives}} a visitation from an angel. He tells the virgin {{that she has been}} permitted a glimpse of the future and shows Jesus alone and afraid in the Garden of Gethsemane as He prays before his arrest, then a vision of Jesus carrying His cross on the way to His crucifixion, and then finally on the cross as He is declared by the High Priest as a blasphemer. The angel offers Mary the choice of giving the baby back to God to avoid these agonies of the future and tells her that she should regard the choice as hers alone with no compunction from God himself. Mary suddenly remembers the smile on her son's face as He looked on His sleeping disciples in Gethsemane and a similar look on the face of one of the criminals also on a cross at Golgotha. She refuses the offer that the angel makes to her. He vanishes as Joseph comes into the stable. The angel is then revealed to be Satan in disguised form who vows to come back one day and tempt Jesus himself. As he flashes through the sky towards hell, his passage is mistaken for a star by the Three Wise Men.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} late Gothic {{rebuilding}} of the temple the wing altars were furnished. The dominant of the interior furnishings of the Cathedral of St. Nicholas is the main altar, which was established in 1490-1506. It is a monumental gothic building {{and there is still}} original Gothic cabinet with three niches which have gold wall and there are three sculptures in its center. It is decorated with Baroque canopies and drapery on its side. The authorship is attributed to the Prešov craftsman John Weiss. The other two late Gothic sculptures worshiping angels. They are placed on the main ledge of the altar shield. They are made by the stonemason Paul of Levoča in the early 16th century. Other sculptures of worshiping angels are {{on the sides of the}} tabernacle. There is the Virgin Mary with <b>Baby</b> <b>Jesus</b> in her arms in the middle of the altar, on her right there is a sculpture of St. Nicholas and to the left a statue of st. Adalbert (sv. Vojtech in slovak), the second Bishop of Prague. After a fire in 1673 only a cabinet of main altar of St. Nicholas with polychrome sculpture of the Madonna, st. Nicholas, st. Adalbert in lifesize and three of the four Evangelists sculptures on consoles with a canopy has been preserved. The authorship of the altar is attributed to the Prešov carver John Weiss, who lived there back in 1509. Some of the remains of a Gothic altar has been put in the wooden Baroque high altar architecture from 1696. The altar is just behind the canteen. It is richly decorated. It has both smooth and twisted colummns. There are sculptures of St. Stephen, Ladislaus, Ignatius and Francis Xavier by woodcarver J. Hartman on the altar stone. Above the altar there is a relief showing turned curtain, with a crown on top and below its peak there is a monogram of the Virgin Mary with rays and heads of angels. The biggest statue of the main altar is a statue of st. Sebastian, a Roman soldier and martyr with the arrows in his body. On the right side of the sculpture of st. Sebastian there is a sculpture of st. Peter with keys in his hand. On the other side there is the apostle Paul with a sword. Both are dressed in Roman togas. There is a sculpture of the Holy Trinity on the top of the altar, under it is placed the medallion with a painted blazon of the town which was used since 1558. The center is decorated with sculptures of angels in late Gothic style by Paul of Levoca from the early 16th century. The stone table comes from the middle of the 18th century. It is richly decorated with rococo ornamentation. On it there is a baroque throne for exposure of the Eucharist with rotating tabernacle and there is a cross inside.|$|E
