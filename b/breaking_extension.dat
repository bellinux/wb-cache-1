In this paper, the effect of fiber dimensional irregularities on the dynamic tensile behavior of irregular fibers is examined, using the finite element method (FEM).

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of fibre {{irregularities}} on the mechanical behaviour of the irregular fibres using the finite element method (FEM). The {{first part of this}} work examines that {{the effect of}} fibre dimensional irregularities on the linear and non-linear tensile behaviour of the fibres, using a two-dimensional (2 D) finite element models. In the linear simulation, a concept of method Young’s modulus is introduced. The method Young’s modulus, breaking load and <b>breaking</b> <b>extension</b> are affected by the magnitude and frequency of diameter variation in the fibre specimen. Fibre dimensional variation and the gauge length effect are also simulated. In the non-linear analysis, some additional information is obtained on changes in the yield and post-yield regions, which are clearly shown in the load-extension curves. Further investigation is focused on the flexural buckling behaviour of fibres with dimensional irregularities. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model is used to simulate the buckling deformation of dimensionally irregular fibres, and the critical buckling load of the simulated fibre is calculated. Two parameters, the effective length and the average diameter within the effective length of an irregular fibre, are considered to be the key factors that influence the buckling behaviour of the fibre. An important aspect of this work is the calculation of the effective length of an irregular fibre specimen during buckling. This method has not been reported before. The third part of this work is on the combined tensile and torsional behaviour of fibres with dimensional irregularities, using a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model. Two types of fibres, polyester and wool, are simulated with sine waves of different level (magnitude) and frequency at different twist levels. For the polyester fibre, experiment verification of the simulation results has been carried out, and the results indicate the FE model is well acceptable for the simulation. The final part of this work examines the combined effect of dimensional and structural irregularities on the fibre tensile behaviour. Three-dimensional (3 D) finite element models are used to simulate the cracks (transverse, longitudinal, combined transverse and longitudinal cracks) and cavities distributed in uniform fibres and fibres with 30 % level of diameter variation, respectively. One of important conclusions is that under the simulated conditions, the dimensional irregularity of fibre influences the tensile behaviour of fibres more than the fibre structural irregularity. The fibre dimensional irregularity affects not only the values of the breaking load and <b>breaking</b> <b>extension,</b> but also the shape of load-extension curves. However, the fibre structural irregularity simulated in the study appears to have little effect on the shape of the load-extension curves. In addition, the effect of crack or cavity size, type and distribution on fibre tensile properties is also investigated...|$|E

Dynamic tensile stress–strain curves of uniaxial strip specimens and force–extension curves of thin sheets were obtained from a Charpy tensile impact apparatus. Results from the uniaxial tension tests indicated that although the rubber became stiffer with increasing strain rates, the stress–strain curves remained virtually the same above 280 s− 1.

The contribution presents a study of the influence of quality characteristics of cotton fibres and constructional parameters of a yarn on the most important properties of cotton yarn. The achieved results have been used for determination of optimised cotton fibre blends regarding the quality and price of a cotton yarn. A complex procedure of cotton fibre blend determination significantly depends on suitable models for prediction of properties of resulting cotton yarns, in-depth knowledge of characteristics of cotton fibres and consideration of parameters of a production process. The results of a theoretical part of the research have been summed up in a model of cotton yarn engineering, which main components are regression model for prediction of properties of cotton ring and rotor yarns, and model for optimisation of cotton fibre blends regarding the quality and price.

However, there is currently little information about the fabric mechanical properties, and there is a demand from compression garment manufacturers to better understand the fabric properties and their serviceability. This paper studied the physical and mechanical properties of 4 Nylon/Spandex knitted fabrics for commercial medical compression garments. In particular, fabric elasticity and bursting strength were examined to demonstrate the applicability of the fabrics for providing satisfactory compression. It was observed that the compression garment fabrics had an open knitted structure with stable dimensions, and Spandex was only present in the wale direction.

The evolution of order parameter can cause change in representation of the system Hamiltonian, different phases will realize different representations. Physically, it turns out that phase transition originates from the automatic interference among matter waves as temperature is cooled down.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Dyeing has an {{influence}} on the characteristic properties of wool fibres. This can result in changes in the final properties of the fibre including fibre elasticity, fibre strength and breaking elongation of the wool fibres, {{especially in the case of}} dark colours. Damage that occurs to the fibre surface due to the action of acid, alkali, dyestuff, water, heat, and mechanical stress during the dyeing process can thus have an affect on the fibre breaking elongation and the fibre strength. The aim of this project was to assess the effect of dyeing with different colours (ranging from light to dark) on the surface of wool fibres using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that four different types of surface damage can be discerned: scale raising, scale chipping, fluting and pitting. The findings also indicate that the surface damage to the fibres was greater and more noticeable (especially the scale raising) on fibres dyed with dark colours than to fibres dyed with light colours. The same applied to the fibre strength and elongation, where generally the fibre <b>breaking</b> <b>extension</b> and the breaking load was smaller in the case of darker colours. The effect of dyeing with different colour shades on the fibre surface was observed with AFM. Several characteristic scale parameters of a statistical significant number of dyed and undyed fibres were measured in order to determine the surface damage caused by dyeing. The correlation between the surface damage, observed by AFM, and the loss in tensile strength and fibre elongation, determined by tensile tests, were investigated. This was done in order to determine the effect of the cuticle damage on the tensile stress/strain behaviour. The results show that AFM is a viable tool to study the effects of different dyes on the fibre surface and for detecting surface modifications with great accuracy. It was found that dyeing with dark colours caused greater damage to the surface than light colours, and it was possible to distinguish different lightness areas, which could be regarded as light and dark colours...|$|E

40|$|Shallow dip angles (⩽ 45 °) {{suggested}} by field observations of continental extensional faults are not predicted by classical isotropic Mohr-Coulomb-Anderson theory. Earthquake {{data indicate that}} normal faults exist in the upper crust with dip angles commonly as shallow as 30 °. Some structural evidence suggests brittle-normal faulting with dip angles as shallow as 10 °. One explanation of the apparent conflict between theory and structural/seismic observations is that intrinsically weak, shallow-dipping pre-existing faults are preferentially reactivated. Any reduction in frictional strength of the pre-existing structure below that of surrounding rock {{increases the likelihood that}} such structures will be first <b>breaking</b> when <b>extension</b> is initiated. Enhanced fluid pore pressure on the pre-existing fault reduces the effective strength and can further enhance shallow fault reactivation. An analytical treatment clarifies the roles of geometry, intact/pre-existing fault strengths and fluid pore pressures. Frictional strength ratios of 3 or greater could account for extremely shallow normal faults (dips 10 – 20 °) without consideration of pore pressures in excess of the least principal stress or of principal stress systems rotated away from the gravity vector. Moderate reduction in friction (34) with respect to wall rock can reduce the dip to 30 ° and can account for shallow normal-slip earthquakes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} method to solve some {{polynomial}} systems whose equations are invariant {{by the action of}} a finite matrix multiplicative group G. It consists of expressing the polynomial equations in terms of some primary invariantsΠ 1,…,Πn (e. g., the elementary symmetric polynomials), and one single “primitive” secondary invariant. The primary invariants are a transcendence basis of the algebra of invariants of the group G over the ground field k, and the powers of the primitive invariant give a basis of the field of invariants considered as a vector space over k(Π 1,h.,Πn). The solutions of the system are given as roots of polynomials whose coefficients themselves are given as roots of some other polynomials: the representation of the solutions (x 1,…,xn) <b>breaks</b> the field <b>extension</b> k(x 1,…,xn) : k in two parts (or more) ...|$|R
