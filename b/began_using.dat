5|$|When {{the show}} <b>began</b> <b>using</b> computers, the {{cardboard}} cutouts were scanned and re-drawn with CorelDRAW, then imported into PowerAnimator, {{which was used}} with SGI workstations to animate the characters. The workstations were linked to a 54-processor render farm that could render 10 to 15 shots an hour. Beginning with season five, the animators <b>began</b> <b>using</b> Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render farm that can produce 30 or more shots an hour.|$|E

Staley's condition prompted the other band members to cancel all scheduled dates one day {{before the start of the}} tour, putting the band on hiatus. Alice in Chains was replaced by Candlebox on the tour.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans <b>began</b> <b>using</b> the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others <b>began</b> <b>using</b> plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also <b>began</b> <b>using</b> tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E

Some of this period of his career was documented in the Discovery Channel program Inside Pro Wrestling School. He held the UPW Heavyweight Championship for 27 days in April 2000. Cena wrestled for the UPW until March 2001. Cena returned to UPW for one night in 2003, losing to Frankie Kazarian by disqualification.|$|E

He <b>began</b> <b>using</b> performance-enhancing drugs in 2002 and he was later stripped of the 100m European title and record he achieved that year.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin <b>began</b> <b>using</b> a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E

He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E
5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese <b>began</b> <b>using</b> coke made from bituminous coal as fuel for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
