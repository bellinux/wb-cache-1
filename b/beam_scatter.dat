40|$|Using {{scanning}} gate microscopy (SGM), we {{probe the}} scattering between {{a beam of}} electrons and a two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) {{as a function of}} the beam's injection energy, and distance from the injection point. At low injection energies, we find electrons in the <b>beam</b> <b>scatter</b> by small-angles, as has been previously observed. At high injection energies, we find a surprising result: placing the SGM tip where it back-scatters electrons increases the differential conductance through the system. This effect is explained by a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in a localized region of 2 DEG near the injection point. Our data indicate that the spatial extent of this highly non-equilibrium distribution is within ~ 1 micrometer of the injection point. We approximate the non-equilibrium region as having an effective temperature that depends linearly upon injection energy. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

This {{is the fundamental}} reason that all superconducting RF cavities in circular {{machines are}} equipped with HOM dampers. This raises the question if HOM damping would not be imperative also in high current proton linacs where a mechanism akin to CBI might exist. To clarify this question we have simulated the longitudinal bunched beam dynamics in linacs, allowing bunch-to-bunch variations in time-of-arrival. Simulations were executed for a generic proton linac with properties close to SNS or the planned SPL at CERN.

The question arises if for similar reasons HOM damping would not be imperative also in high current superconducting rf proton linacs.

Because of this, {{it is important}} to determine the dynamic characteristics of the servo valve (i. e. flow rate as a function of input command signal) more precisely. Previous techniques for this evaluation depended on monitoring spool position using linear transducers, since flow measurement techniques capable of following fast transients and oscillating (or pulsating) flows were not easily applied. The introduction of the laser Doppler anemometer changes this. Steady state flow measurement, using the dual <b>beam</b> <b>scatter</b> system, is now common but since it needs a spectrum analyser to measure the Doppler frequency it is not suitable for unsteady flow. Since hydraulic systems are relatively particle free, the Doppler signals are received intermittently. Because of this, a signal processing system has been developed which measures the period of one or more oscillations in the frequency burst caused by a scattering particle passing through the control volume. Using this technique steady and unsteady laminar flow profiles have been measured in order to assess its effectiveness in the performance testing of hydraulic servo systems...|$|E

It was necessary to include all of the additives in the specimens to achieve good quantitative accuracy.

We tested the use of total reflection x-ray fluorescence (TXRF) for trace element analysis of whisky and application of the data as a potential tool {{in the identification of}} counterfeit samples. Twenty five whiskies that were produced in different regions of Scotland or were blends, 5 counterfeit whiskies, 1 unmatured grain whisky, and 1 matured grain whisky were analysed for 11 elements (P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br and Rb). The effect of cold plasma ashing with oxygen on whisky residues evaporated on the TXRF reflector on the instrument performance was investigated. Cold plasma ashing with oxygen reduced <b>beam</b> <b>scatter</b> and improved the limits of detection but was ultimately deemed unnecessary. The element concentration data for whisky obtained by TXRF (after log transformation) was compared with the values obtained by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and showed correlation values (R 2) - 0. 942 for K, Mn and Cu: - 0. 800 for Ca, Fe and Rb; and - 0. 535 for P, S and Zn. The range of concentration values for individual elements was variable and principal components analysis of the elemental concentrations partially differentiated the whiskies by region but showed clear separation of the counterfeit samples from the other samples.

40|$|Energy spectra from a thyroid {{fluorescence}} scanner demon-strate inherent {{background radiation}} (excitation <b>beam</b> <b>scatter),</b> which {{interferes with the}} detection of characteristic iodine x-rays and influences imaging and iodine quantitation. The amount of scattering material within the beam field is one factor that varies the counting rate detected in the iodine peak region. The technique of constant background subtraction, which is found in conventional radionuclide scanners, is sub-optimal because a variable correction is required. A fluores-cence scanning system that continuously monitors and sub-tracts background from the iodine peak region (dynamic back-ground subtractor) was evaluated and found to make appro-priate background corrections while scanning. Radionuclides administered before a fluorescence scan produce image arti-facts and erroneous quantitation of iodine results, using either background subtraction technique. Thyroid fluorescence scanning is a technique for imag-ing and quantitation of stable iodine in vivo, introduced by Hoffer eta!. in 1968 (I). Presently, several commercial instruments are available for this purpose. We describe the problems {{that are related to}} the interference of back-ground radiation with characteristic iodine x-ray peaks and the effect that change in background has on the final measurements. To measure the specific radiation of iodine fluorescence, semiconductor detectors, which possess good energy resolution, are used to separate energy peaks of fluorescent x-rays from those of the ex-citation source and background. Combination of a fo-cused excitation beam and a semiconductor detector with a scanning instrument enables the simultaneous recording of positional and quantitative measurements of stable iodine.

30|$|In {{order to}} further {{optimize}} the diffuse reflectance of the pure spheroidal assembly coating, {{the sizes of}} nanocrystals and spheroidal assemblies were increased through adjusting the dosage of precursor. The measured diffuse reflectance spectra corresponding to the optimized nanosphere coatings with enlarged unit cell size and for the different thicknesses (8, 10, and 12  μm) are shown in Fig. 2 b. For 8  μm thickness of nanosphere coating, the average reflectance increases above 40 % and remains high throughout the whole wavelength range. But as observed in Fig. 2 b, the reflectance of nanosphere coating strongly depends on the thickness or, in other words, on the packing fraction of the unit cell. When {{the thickness of the}} coating is thin, the packing fraction of ellipsoidal nanocrystals in a spheroidal assembly decreases. Even if the size of the spherical component has been optimized, the hybrid spheroidal structures of thin coatings could not shield the scattering lights properly. And a major portion of the incident light is directly transmitted by the coating. On the other hand, there tend to be more lobes in the scattering diagram near the directions toward which the particle presents a large width than near the directions for which the projected width is smaller [25]. Note that ellipsoidal TiO 2 nanocrystals oriented with their symmetry axes oblique to the incident <b>beam</b> <b>scatter</b> asymmetrically about the forward direction in Fig. 2 b. It means that incident light will be scattered randomly by spheroidal assemblies composed of multi-oriented ellipsoidal TiO 2 nanocrystals. Thus, it is possible to get a higher diffuse reflectance from the thicker nanosphere coating, because in which the forward scattering may be suppressed by the multi-oriented ellipsoidal TiO 2 nanocrystals.|$|E
40|$|Recent in vivo {{modulation}} of region-specific {{brain activity}} suggests that Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) {{may be a}} non-invasive alternative therapy for drug-delivery applications and the treatment of neurological diseases, including epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Despite these recent successes, failure to reproduce published results continues to plague the field due to the limited understanding of cellular mechanisms that underlie neuromodulation {{and the impact of}} skull on targeting accuracy. The objective of this thesis is to help bridge these knowledge gaps and better understand non-invasive transcranial focused ultrasound modulation. While hypotheses exist explaining the mechanism underlying ultrasound modulation, they largely remain untested. It has been suggested that mechanical perturbation of cellular membranes with embedded protein channels using ultrasound has an impact on ion channel kinetics, resulting in depolarization, and ultimately, increased neural activity. In particular, this thesis investigates the hypothesis explaining the mechanical perturbation as a result of pure acoustic radiation forces using simplified in vitro models, including Large-Conductance Mechanosensitive Channels (MscL) and non-mechanically stimulated channels. The outcome revealed an increase in efflux through proteoliposomes regardless of the channel type except at the highest concentration of mechanosensitive channel (MS) model where a lowering efflux trend was noticed. These unexpected results suggest that focused ultrasound does not modulate the gating of ion channels, but instead effects the permeability of the membrane itself or protein-membrane interface. Also a dual effect of membrane stretch enhancement and pore formation is observed only at high MS channel concentration. In addition, to prepare for in vivo efficacy studies, the present dissertation characterizes the ultrasonic <b>beam</b> <b>scatter</b> and focal shifts that occur as ultrasound passes through a rat skull for a specific set of parameters. The results have shown significant beam shape deformation and target shift due to the skull. This suite of studies improved our understanding of the mechanism associated with LIFU-based stimulation at the molecular level, while also exploring how LIFU can be applied with greater accuracy and precision in vivo. In addition, insights gleaned from this approach are expected to promote new avenues of clinical applications for the treatment of drug delivery, gene therapy and neurological illnesses...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In canine eyelids surgery, {{intraoperative}} bleeding may {{obscure the}} surgical field {{and lead to}} increased swelling, bruising and pain. Therapies for the canine lids and nictitating membrane tumors include surgical excision, cryosurgery, or carbon dioxide laser ablation (Stades and Van der Woerdt, 2013). Potential disadvantages of cryosurgery are severe postoperative swelling, depigmentation and the unwanted loss of normal tissue. Laser requires safety precautions, including wavelength-specific eye wear and the hazard of <b>beam</b> <b>scatter</b> and or reflection. OBJECTIVE:to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency radiowave surgery in treating tumors of eyelids and third eyelid in dogs. MATERIALS & METHODS: Seven dogs (7 eyes) referred with eyelids tumors and 3 dogs with third eyelid tumors {{were enrolled in the}} study over a 12 -month period. Ablation was performed using high-frequency radiowave surgical unit (Ellman Surgitron FFPF) at a power setting on 2. 5 (4 cases) or 5. 0 (6 cases) with “needle electrode” (TA 2 B, TA 3 B, TA 8 B) or “empire microincision electrode (TEE 305) in the Cut/Coag mode (5 cases: 2 eyelid papilloma and 3 third eyelid tumors) or cut mode (5 eyelid tumors). RESULTS: In all cases surgery was performed {{in a very short time}} with the advantage of an excellent haemostasis and minimum onset of oedema using both modes (cut or cut/coag). Surgical incisions were extremely precise and accurate. Two dogs with papilloma on the upper eyelid, treated with a needle electrode and a power setting on 3. 0 2, 5 showed dehiscence of the surgical wound one week postoperatively. One dog with melanocitoma of the third eyelid showed transient depigmentation of the inferior eyelid which resolved after two months. In all other cases (2 meibomian gland carcinomas, 2 adenomas and 3 2 epitheliomas) no notable complications were observed and the results of the scar was judged as good by surgeons and dog's owners. Follow-up (up to 1 year) showed no recurrence in any case. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: To the authors’ knowledge, treatment of eyelid and third eyelid tumors with high-frequency radiowave surgery is not wide described in dogs and there are not published clinical studies. Results of this study demonstrated that it may be a simple, safe and effective surgical treatment for eyelids and third eyelids tumors in dogs. Dehiscence of surgical wound after the excision of an eyelid papilloma in two cases could be due to the use of low power setting in cut/coag mode. At this setting, a less precise incision and a slower passage through the tissue were achieved, increasing tissue damage and delaying healing. In the same way, needle electrodes with cut/coag mode, used for third eyelid excision in a dog, could have caused a minimal amounts of lateral heat, responsible of depigmentation of the inferior eyelid margin. The “empire microincision electrodes” produce a high concentration of energy with the least amount of thermal damage to adjacent tissue. Therefore, they are the optimal electrodes for eyelid surgery. This technique offers potential advantages over some others in use, like CO 2 laser, including minimal safety precautions, self cleansing and relatively low cost. Choosing optimal power settings and the correct electrode will prevent increased tissue damage...|$|E
