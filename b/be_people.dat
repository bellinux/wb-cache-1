5|$|When {{applied to}} human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may <b>be</b> <b>people</b> with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), or they may <b>be</b> <b>people</b> with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant {{is said to be}} associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.|$|E
