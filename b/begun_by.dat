5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, had <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> 1801 to {{the east}} of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was {{completed}} in time to exploit the economic boom in the cotton trade that followed the brief peace in the war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E

Instead, criminals were exiled to small island of Îles Maria. Teuruarii and his mother also presided over the opening of the Protestant church of Moerai. The construction of the church had been <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> his father and the work was completed by a foreign carpenter named Quittaine Chapman.|$|E
5|$|List's Armanist {{ideas have}} been cited as an {{inspiration}} for the American Odinist militant David Lane, with Wotansvolk, a group that List was involved in establishing, viewing their own activism as a continuation of that <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> List.

The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death {{and did not}} cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary {{to the spirit of}} aikido.|$|E

5|$|The results {{obtained}} by the Morea scientific expedition underscored the {{need to create a}} permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, it was possible to “systematically and permanently continue the work so gloriously and so happily <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> the Morea scientific expedition” due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, of a French scientific institution, {{in the form of the}} French School at Athens.|$|E

5|$|This project, {{based on}} the village of Shapwick, was <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> Mick Aston of Bristol University to {{investigate}} {{the evolution of a}} typical English village. A preliminary study of the village's history was carried out using maps and documents, then surveys of the buildings were made together with botanical surveys. Field walking was carried out and key sites excavated. A report on the project, which ran from 1989 to 1999, was published in eight volumes.|$|E

He also was the one bishop that published ecclesiastical legislation during Edward the Confessor's reign, attempting to discipline and reform the clergy. He held a synod of his clergy shortly before 1066.|$|E

5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} publication, the Cantiones {{appeared}} {{as part of}} a complete edition of the composer's works by Breitkopf & Härtel, <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> Philipp Spitta, who published a first volume in 1885, and completed by Arnold Schering and Heinrich Spitta in 1927. This edition was faithful to keys and clefs, a problem for modern performers. In 1960, Gottfried Grote published the collection in the Neue Ausgabe, transposing and with modern meter signs. A critical edition was published in 2004 by Bärenreiter, edited by Heide Volckmar-Waschk, who uses modern clefs, but shows the original clefs and retains the keys and note values.|$|E
5|$|Although supernovae are {{relatively}} rare events, occurring on average about once every 50 {{years in the}} Milky Way, observations of distant galaxies allowed supernovae to be discovered and examined more frequently. The first supernova detection patrol was <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> Zwicky in 1933. He was joined by Josef J. Johnson from Caltech in 1936. Using a 45-cm Schmidt telescope at Palomar observatory, they discovered twelve new supernovae within three years by comparing new photographic plates to reference images of extragalactic regions.|$|E

5|$|Another epic film, On My Honor, was {{conceived}} and <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> Cecil B. DeMille. It was {{to document the}} founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959. The screenplay, by Jesse Lasky, Jr., focused on Baden-Powell, Burnham and other pioneers who were to have a major influence on Scouting. After DeMille's death, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon continued to work on the film until 1962, hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script. Starting in 2001, producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Russia in 1902, Suslov {{became a member}} of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied {{economics}} for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression <b>begun</b> <b>by</b> Joseph Stalin's regime. Suslov impressed the Soviet leadership to such an extent in the pre-Eastern Front Soviet Union that he was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He {{became a member of}} the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946 and, four years later, was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the All-Union Communist Party.|$|E
