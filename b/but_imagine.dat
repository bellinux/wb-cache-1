[...] in 2015, the reviewer for Digital Journal wrote: [...] "The control she displays over her voice is tremendous, and she tackles the high notes ... effortlessly, showcasing her angelic vocals and piercing pipes." [...] Robin Leach wrote of Evancho's 2015 concert in Las Vegas: [...] "She’s still got the voice of an angel. It’s remarkable, and her power is growing as she grows up. [...] had the audience on its feet with wild applause {{at the end of}} every song". Some reviewers, beginning in 2015, noticed a lack of connection with the text; a review in The Washington Post called her voice a [...] "bell-like instrument, devoid of any messy human emotions [...] an ethereally floating tone. ... <b>But</b> <b>imagine</b> what Evancho can achieve once she stops obsessing over just sounding pretty, and actually listens to the words she’s singing." [...] Reviewing one of Evancho's 2016 concerts, Steve Barnes similarly wrote for the Times Union that her voice is [...] "an instrument of pristine beauty. It peals with the purity of bells and lofts tones that shimmer with celestial iridescence" [...] but that her performance lacks [...] "an apparent interpretive style or emotional connection to the material".|$|E

6000|$|Do {{you think}} it was wrong to make eternity feminine? I knew that the Greek word was not feminine; <b>but</b> <b>imagined</b> that the English {{personification}} should be so. Am I wrong in this? Will you consider the subject again? ...|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Cartwright {{gave him}} a {{grateful}} smile. She had long known that when she asked her husband's help difficulties were removed. Now he had removed Shillito, and she was satisfied <b>but</b> <b>imagined</b> he was not. Cartwright knitted his white brows and drew hard at his cigar.|$|R
60|$|For some {{minutes they}} {{scarcely}} held the craft against the stream.

6000|$|He had {{certainly}} chosen {{the most delicate}} way of praising Mirah, and the Meyrick girls had now given him all their esteem. <b>But</b> <b>imagine</b> Mab's feeling when suddenly fixing his eyes on her, he said decisively, [...] "That young lady is musical, I see!"

50|$|The {{narrative}} of Kristo {{is based on}} the combined Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, <b>but</b> <b>imagined</b> as occurring in Classical Filipino society with ethnic elements and some aspects of Ancient Rome and first-century Judaea.

50|$|The {{appearance}} of hippocampi in both freshwater and saltwater is counter-intuitive {{to a modern}} audience, though not to an ancient one.

60|$|After supper Jerry {{determined}} {{to take a}} walk uptown, to get the outdoor exercise and also in hope of seeing something of the tramp who had taken the packet.
