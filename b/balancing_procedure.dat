40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Based on the {{determination}} of the zero-flux plane, a water <b>balance</b> <b>procedure</b> for large-scale experimental databases was automated to estimate the soil water balance based on soil water content distribution with depth through time. The automated procedure was verified using data from the BOREAS project obtained in three Intensive Field Campaigns during {{the spring and summer of}} 1994. The data used correspond to four tower sites measuring atmospheric fluxes above the forest canopy from the Northern and Southern Study Areas and are designated according to the predominant vegetation in the area as Old Jack Pine and Young Jack Pine. The total hydraulic head through time at these sites is determined to identify the position of the zero-flux plane, which separates that part of the soil profile in which water flow is upward from the region in which the water flow is downward. In conjunction with precipitation and soil water content data, the procedure allows estimation of the actual soil water balance, the water used from the region above the zero-flux plane being evapotranspiration, and the change in soil water content below the mean zero-flux plane being drainage. Prior to this study, no published attempt had been made to automate a water <b>balance</b> <b>procedure</b> for large-scale experimental databases based on the position of the zero-flux plane and soil water content distribution through time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new scheme {{to balance the}} DC bus voltages of a cascaded H-bridge converter which {{is used as a}} Distribution Static Synchronous Series Compensator (D-SSSC) in electrical distribution network. The aim of D-SSSC is to control the power flow between two feeders from different substations. As a result of different cell losses and capacitors tolerance the cells DC bus voltage can deviate from their reference values. In the proposed scheme, by individually modifying the reference PWM signal for each cell, an effective <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> is derived. The new <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> needs only the line current sign and is independent of the main control strategy, which controls the total DC bus voltages of cascaded H-bridge. The effect of modulation index variation on the capacitor voltage is analytically derived for the proposed strategy. The proposed method takes advantages of phase shift carrier based modulation and can be applied for a cascaded H-bridge with any number of cells. Also the system is immune to loss of one cell and the presented procedure can keep balancing between the remaining cells. Simulation studies and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the balancing of DC bus voltages...|$|E
