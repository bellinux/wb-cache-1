5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American <b>barred</b> <b>owl,</b> S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E

The peregrine falcon was reintroduced into the park in the mid-1990s and by the end of the 20th century there were numerous nesting pairs in the park.

25|$|The {{specificity}} of bird calls {{has been used}} extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams. Common terms in English include words such as quack, chirp and chirrup. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the white-throated sparrow's song, given in Canada as O sweet Canada Canada Canada and in New England as Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody (also Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> produces a motif which some bird guides describe as Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all? with the emphasis placed on you.|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} four diagnostic microsatellite loci {{that distinguish}} spotted <b>owls</b> (Strix occidentalis), <b>barred</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix varia), F 1 hybrids and backcrosses. Thirty-four out of 52 loci tested (65. 4 %) successfully amplified, {{and four of}} these loci (11. 8 %) had allele sizes that did not overlap between spotted and <b>barred</b> <b>owls.</b> The probability of correctly identifying a backcross with these four loci is 0. 875. Genotyping potential hybrid owls with these markers revealed that field identifications were often wrong. Given the difficulty of identifying hybrids in the field, these markers will be useful for hybrid identification, law enforcement and spotted owl conservation...|$|R

60|$|In {{the deepest}} snows, the path which I used {{from the highway}} to my house, {{about half a mile}} long, might have been {{represented}} by a meandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots. For a week of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of the same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks--to such routine the winter reduces us--yet often they were filled with heaven's own blue. But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree, or a yellow birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had changed the pines into fir trees; wading to the tops of the highest hills when the show was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking down another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had gone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix nebulosa) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with my feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would stretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes wide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus with his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There was only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from the land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote that interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my nearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings to unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them. Thus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way, as it were, with his sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace await the dawning of his day.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s {{the logging}} of old-growth forests accelerated, {{and the numbers}} of the {{northern}} spotted owl began to decline. Beginning in 1912 the <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> began expanding its range westward and northward. Once considered an East Coast resident, the <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> moved into the Rocky Mountains and southern Canada, into the spotted owl's territory. The <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> is extremely adaptable, whereas the northern spotted owl is much more stagnate. The <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> can live in virtually any forest and eat almost anything. The northern owl is adapted to best survive in old growth forest and relies mainly on the flying squirrel as a food resource. Much like human counterparts, as the <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> expanded westward these larger more adaptable birds forced native owls, such as the northern owl, off their territory. The <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> is about 20% larger and will feast on flying squirrels out of convenience. Biologists have noted a severe decline in the breeding population of northern owls, whereas the <b>barred</b> <b>owl</b> populations thrive (Levy, 2004).|$|E
