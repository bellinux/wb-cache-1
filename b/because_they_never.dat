The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. They blew the emergency whistle, and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam up, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> knew when a ship might arrive.)

25|$|With geographic, social, political, and {{economic}} connections {{to both the}} North and the South, the border states were critical to {{the outcome of the}} war. They are considered still to delineate the cultural border that separates the North from the South. Reconstruction, as directed by Congress, did not apply to the border states <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> seceded from the Union. They did undergo their own process of readjustment and political realignment after passage of amendments abolishing slavery and granting citizenship and the right to vote to freedmen. After 1880 most of these jurisdictions were dominated by white Democrats, who passed laws to impose the Jim Crow system of legal segregation and second-class citizenship for blacks. However, in contrast to the Confederate States, where almost all blacks were disenfranchised during the first half to two-thirds of the twentieth century, for varying reasons blacks remained enfranchised in the border states despite movements for disfranchisement during the 1900s.|$|E

One advertisement in this series showed a Pepsi vending machine to mock the brand, which author Mark Pendergrast called [...] "unthinkable". Another said Pepsi Challenge commercials were misleading <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> showed anyone choosing Coke. John Bergin, who directed the series of commercials, personally disliked Cosby but said his presence in Coca-Cola advertising ended the first Pepsi Challenge campaign in 1983.|$|E

By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind, so he telephoned producer Stanley Kramer {{from the airport to}} signal his acceptance, and [...] "popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part" [...] the same day. He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set, later commenting that [...] "I was the only non-American, and I found it exhausting and embarrassing <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> relaxed. They were always 'on'." [...] One of the American stars was Spencer Tracy, whom Terry-Thomas considered [...] "an extra-special man"; Tracy and Buster Keaton—who also appeared in the film—were described by Terry-Thomas as [...] "the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness".|$|E

Silvertail is the most forgetful of squirrels in the wood, and, while trying to find his nuts, digs up another squirrel's hoard. A commotion erupts among the nutting squirrels, and, as ill luck would have it, a flock of birds fly by singing [...] "Who's bin [...] digging-up my nuts?" [...] and [...] "Little bit-a-bread and-no-cheese!" [...] One bird finds a perch in the bush where Timmy is working and continues to sing about digging up nuts. The other squirrels take notice, suspect Timmy of robbing others of their hoards, rush upon him, scratch and cuff him, chase him up a tree, and stuff him with great difficulty through the woodpecker's hole. Silvertail suggests they leave him there until he confesses.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1980s, the orchestra's ambitions {{had grown}} beyond {{the point where}} it could be {{sustained}} by the small town of Evergreen. The increasingly peripatetic performances at Evergreen led to the Denver Post calling them [...] "the guerilla orchestra" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> knew where they would be playing next. According to Richard Zellner who served as the orchestra's Executive Director from 1982 until 2000, [...] "we were a festival {{looking for a place to}} happen." [...] In 1986, the orchestra changed its name to the National Repertory Orchestra, drew up new articles of incorporation, and accepted an offer by Keystone Resort, in Keystone, Colorado to take up residency there. The orchestra provided an entertainment draw for the resort and the resort provided room and board for the musicians, a performing tent, and marketing services, all of which allowed the orchestra to halve its expenses. In 1988, the NRO was the only American orchestra invited to perform at the Seoul Olympics and then extended its tour to Taiwan and Japan.|$|E

You {{do something that}} you've never done, {{and it makes you}} feel like a bigger band." [...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc was an opportunity to use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight or nine years, but never put on albums <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} dateable and unambiguous {{reference to}} the iconic cult of Anahita is from the Babylonian scholar-priest Berosus, who – although writing over 70 years after the reign of Artaxerxes II Mnemon – records that the emperor {{had been the first}} to make cult statues of Aphrodite Anaitis and place them in the temples of many of the empire's major cities, including Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, Damascus and Sardis. Also according to Berosus, the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images. This is substantiated by Herodotus, whose mid-5th-century-BCE general remarks on the usages of the Perses, Herodotus notes that [...] "it is not their custom to make and set up statues and images and altars, and those that make such they deem foolish, as I suppose, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> believed the gods, as do the Greeks, to be the likeness of men." ...|$|E

2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world.

2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a right to rescind the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older line of authority which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>never</b> had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, {{and it turns out that}} that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire good title and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and most of the rest of the world.|$|E
