40|$|International audienceBrushless DC (<b>BLDC)</b> <b>motors</b> {{have been}} widely used in industry. However, one of the main {{drawbacks}} of using <b>BLDC</b> <b>motors</b> is the undesirable torque ripple. The torque ripple can cause mechanical vibration, acoustic noise and bearing damage that reduces the lifetime of the machine. This paper proposes a simple repetitive control scheme to attenuate torque ripple of <b>BLDC</b> <b>motors.</b> In this method, the ripple is considered as an undesirable repeated signal that will be minimized by the repetitive control scheme. The control input used in the proposed method is controlled transistors switching using space vector pulse width modulation technique.

50|$|Controllers for {{brushless}} motors: E-bikes require high {{initial torque}} and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have Hall sensor commutation for speed and angle measurement. An electronic controller provides assistance {{as a function}} of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the crank shaft featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a Hall sensor giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses pulse width modulation to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for regenerative braking but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy.
