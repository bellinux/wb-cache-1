40|$|Abstract In {{the past}} decade, the medical {{effective}} dose per caput {{has increased in}} most European countries because of CT; it now ranges between 0. 4 and 2 mSv/year. The biological impact of diagnostic imaging exposure is dominated by stochastic effects: based on the linear-nothreshold hypothesis, the risk of cancer induction is estimated to increase proportionally to organ dose, reaching around 0. 5 % at an effective dose of 100 mSv. The risk is higher the younger the age {{at the time of}} exposure, it is different for different organs, and women are more susceptible than men. Fluoroscopy-based imaging, above all intervention, may reach the dose threshold for deterministic effects, observed most often at the skin above around 3 Gy, and it is also the major source of occupational exposure in radiology. This white paper discusses the role of justification, evidence-based referral guidelines, optimization, diagnostic reference levels, clinical audits and quality assurance programs.

Based on these test systems and the experience gained during their validation procedures, we propose a 3 -step fish testing strategy: 1) Weight-of-evidence approach for identifying potential sexual endocrine-disrupting chemicals; even after advanced specification of systematic criteria, this step of establishing initial suspicion will still require expert judgment; 2) in vivo evaluation of sexual endocrinedisrupting activity in fish by applying in vivo fish screening assays; sufficient data are available to diagnose the aromataseinhibition and estrogen-receptor agonist mechanisms of action by indicative endpoints (biomarkers), whereas {{the ability of the}} respective biomarkers in the screening assay to identify the estrogen-receptor antagonists and androgen-receptor agonists and antagonists requires further validation; 3) characterization of sexual endocrine-mediated adverse effects including threshold concentrations; in cases when the most sensitive population-relevant endpoints and the most sensitive time window for exposure are known for the mechanisms of action, the fish full life-cycle or 2 -generation test, which are the normal definitive tests, might be abbreviated to, e. g., the fish sexual development test.

Functional MuLV/visna virus pseudotypes were obtained when the cytoplasmic tail of the visna virus envelope TM protein was truncated to 3, 7, or 11 amino acids in length.

40|$|Complex {{alterations}} in brain function and neurochemistry underlie pathology and treatment in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, yet remain incompletely characterised. This thesis outlines possibilities for human neuroimaging techniques sensitive to spontaneous fluctuations in large-scale neurobiological signalling, or ‘resting-state network (RSN) functional connectivity’, to address such knowledge gaps. Novel RSN-sensitive analysis approaches to functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} data are introduced. These techniques are then evaluated experimentally, in contexts relevant for maladaptive cognitive and motivational processing, for their utility to identify and characterise systems-level signatures of individual differences in neurochemistry and psychopharmacological responsiveness. Firstly, RSN functional connectivity measures are investigated in the context of pharmacological intervention with nicotine replacement therapy in habitual smokers. Results identify connectivity between executive control and ‘default mode’ RSNs as a neural signature of pharmacotherapeutic efficacy in treating cognitive symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Secondly, RSN connectivity is investigated alongside specific neuroreceptor-sensitive measures to investigate the extent to which network connectivity patterns reflect fundamental neurobiology in healthy subjects. Individual differences in dopamine D 3 receptor availability - a possible marker for reward-related behaviours -are associated with topographic connectivity signatures within RSNs implicated in cognitive and motivational control. Thirdly, the ability of RSN metrics to characterise distinct neurochemical manipulations is tested in healthy subjects. Dopamine agnostic and antagonistic neuromodulations display differential effects on signalling in cortico-cubcortical and cortico-cortical reward circuitry and interact selectively with subject impulsivity. Finally, RSN cortico-subcortical connectivity metrics are investigated for their sensitivity to clinical-pharmacological effects in Parkinson’s disease. Results reveal evidence for both compensatory large-scale network mechanisms and ‘non-normalising’ dopaminergic medication effects in patients. Overall, findings indicate novel systems-level neuroimaging methodology probing interactions within and between RSNs to provide <b>sensitive,</b> <b>biologically</b> plausible markers for behavioural and neuropharamacological characteristics of neuropsychiatric disorders. Continued developments of functional network analysis approaches may facilitate their direct application to clinical and drug development domains. Imperial Users onl...|$|R

This approach enables classification {{of the potential for}} irritation, discriminating between mildly irritant and non-irritant ocular substances. Methods: The exposure protocol included two time periods, ie, 24 hours (acute application) and 72 hours (repeated applications twice daily). This approach allows assessment of not only the acute reaction but also possible recovery, as well as mimicking the potential cumulative effects associated with long-term application. Using benzalkonium chloride (BAK) 0. 01 % as a positive control, the following parameters were quantified: cellular viability by MTT test, histological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining, passive release of interleukin- 1 a by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and OCLN gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Cell viability was reduced to under the 50 % cutoff value after acute exposure (24 hours) to BAK 0. 01 %, and after repeated application (72 hours) of Timoptol and Nyogel. Histological analysis after acute exposure showed signs of superficial damage with all formulations, and severe changes after repeated applications of Timoptol, BAK 0. 01 %, and Nyogel. Timolabak and Timogel did not significantly alter the morphology of the human corneal epithelial cells after the different exposure times. Interleukin- 1 &alpha; release was greater than that for the negative control (&gt; 20 pg/mL) and the positive control (BAK 0. 01 %), Nyogel, and Timoptol treatments and not different after treatment with Timolabak and Timogel. Expression of OCLN, a sign of epithelial barrier impairment, was only significantly upregulated at 24 hours by BAK 0. 01 %, suggesting a toxic reaction at the ocular surface. OCLN was also overexpressed after repeated application of Nyogel and Timogel. Conclusion: Overall, the multiple endpoint analysis approach allows classification of these products according to decreasing order of irritation potential as follows: BAK 0. 01 %, Timoptol, Nyogel, Timogel, and Timolabak.

40|$|An {{inorganic}} geochemical {{study of}} the Late Paleocene organic matter-rich Waipawa and Tartan formations was undertaken in order to investigate the depositional environment. The formation varies in thickness between 2 and 50 metres and is distributed across many of New Zealand’s Cenozoic basins, where it forms an important potential hydrocarbon source rock. This study measured major and trace elements which can be loosely grouped into redox <b>sensitive,</b> <b>biologically</b> influenced, terrestrially sourced, and rare earth elements (REE). The study focused on three sections through the Waipawa and Tartan formations: Angora Quarry in the East Coast Basin, and the Great South Basin hydrocarbon exploration wells Kawau- 1 A and Pakaha- 1. At Angora Quarry, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) {{was used to measure}} the major constituents Na₂O, MgO, Al₂O₃, SiO₂, P₂O₅, SO₃, K₂O, CaO, TiO₂, MnO and Fe₂O₃. inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure Li, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, REE, Hf, Tl, Pb, Th and U. For Pakaha- 1 and Kawau- 1 A side wall core samples, ICP-MS was used to measure Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th and U. Insufficient sample was available for XRF on these samples. No major changes in oxygen concentration during deposition were recorded by redox-sensitive elements from Angora Quarry and Pakaha- 1 sediments; however samples from Kawau- 1 A and from a section 1 km upstream from Angora Quarry were deposited under somewhat oxygen-depleted conditions. As the anoxic and suboxic indicators show significantly lower variations than under present day anoxic environments, and in Angora Quarry CaO and SO₃ are significantly depleted with higher aluminosilicates a rapid deposition is required to explain the preservation of the organic matter. In the Great South Basin wells, the clay content correlates directly with increased gamma ray levels measured by well logs. Increased influx of terrestrial clays has been linked to marine transgressions in many New Zealand sediments and is been taken to mean the same for the Waipawa and Tartan formations. The oxygen depletion indicates that water depths during deposition exceeded 50 metres. The depositional model proposed here, therefore, is that of a major marine transgression that flooded and eroded near-shore swamps, re-depositing the terrestrial organic matter offshore. The increased nutrients released by this would have stimulated bioproductivity and locally, where conditions were suitable, depleted the oxygen content of the water column. This study also suggests ternary diagrams are valuable for calculating the enrichment of elements affected by two processes, such as Sr, which is related to both detrital Al and related to biological Ca. Ga, Ba and Al content are also related on a ternary diagram indicating the similar terrestrial and biological relationships for Ba and Ga. W was found to behave in a similar way to Bi. Enrichment factors proved less useful than absolute enrichment for Kawau- 1 A, where detrital input varied greatly and was found to be significantly different in composition to average shale as defined by Wedephol (1971) ...|$|R

The technique for solving the multi-scale problem used here is the derivation of interface conditions for the Poisson equation that include the effects of the quasi-periodic biofunction-alized boundary layer.
