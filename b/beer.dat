5|$|In many societies, <b>beer</b> is {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with <b>beer</b> drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending <b>beer</b> festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating <b>beer.</b> Drinking games, such as <b>beer</b> pong, are also popular. A relatively new profession is that of the <b>beer</b> sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.|$|E

50|$|The Alaskan Brewing Company brews eight year-round <b>beers,</b> four {{seasonal}} <b>beers,</b> and two {{limited edition}} <b>beers.</b> The year-round <b>beers</b> are: Alaskan Amber, Freeride APA, Icy Bay IPA, Kicker Session IPA, Alaskan White, Hopothermia, Imperial Red Ale, and Alaskan Stout. The seasonal <b>beers</b> consist of: Alaskan Summer Ale, Alaskan Winter Ale, and annual {{spring and fall}} releases. The limited edition <b>beers</b> are: Alaskan Smoked Porter and the Alaskan Pilot Series, which consists of <b>beers</b> that go through a rotation of three to four a year. Available <b>beers</b> have changed through the years with several like Alaska Pale being discontinued for reasons including lack of available specialty hops.|$|R
5|$|<b>Beer</b> is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a <b>beer</b> stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a <b>beer</b> bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which <b>beer</b> {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the <b>beer</b> and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beer</b> {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality <b>beer</b> production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of <b>beer</b> for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of <b>beer,</b> did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. <b>Beer</b> was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small <b>beer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Draught <b>beer</b> from a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style dispenser and a spout is {{the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the <b>beer</b> to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of <b>beer</b> can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called <b>beer</b> balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major <b>beer</b> brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E

5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled <b>beer</b> due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one <b>beer</b> brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew <b>beer</b> is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew <b>beer</b> {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught <b>beer</b> from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled <b>beer,</b> can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of <b>beer</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the <b>beer</b> is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the <b>beer</b> requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the <b>beer</b> has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of <b>beer.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and the <b>beer</b> {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The <b>beer</b> was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the <b>beer</b> would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured <b>beer.</b> The Runcorn <b>beer</b> had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the <b>beer.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Guinness {{introduced}} the <b>beer</b> widget, a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to <b>beer</b> served from a nitrogen system. The words draft and draught {{can be used}} as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers containing a <b>beer</b> widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a <b>beer</b> belly, rather than <b>beer</b> consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a <b>beer</b> belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote <b>beer</b> as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in <b>beer</b> undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that <b>beer</b> consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} <b>beer,</b> which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the <b>beer</b> along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product.
