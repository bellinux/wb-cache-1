5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for <b>bone</b> <b>health,</b> and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports <b>bone</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E

25|$|Calcium {{is needed}} to {{maintain}} <b>bone</b> <b>health</b> and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.|$|E
25|$|This form {{of therapy}} {{has been shown}} to prevent loss of bone mineral density (BMD) {{as a result of a}} {{reduction}} in bone turnover. However, <b>bone</b> <b>health</b> entails quite a bit more than just BMD. There are many other factors to consider.|$|E
25|$|Mounting {{evidence}} indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on <b>bone</b> <b>health.</b> Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies. The data from one study indicated that bone mineral density is negatively associated with saturated fat intake, and that men may be particularly vulnerable.|$|E
40|$|Regular {{exercise}} and adequate nutrition, particularly dietary calcium, vitamin D, and protein, are prescribed as strategies to optimize peak bone mass and maintain <b>bone</b> and muscle <b>health</b> throughout life. Although {{the mechanism of}} action of {{exercise and}} nutrition on <b>bone</b> and muscle <b>health</b> are different-exercise has a site-specific modifying effect, whereas nutrition has a permissive generalized effect-there is evidence that combining calcium (or calcium rich dairy foods) or dietary protein with exercise can have a synergetic effect on bone mass and muscle health, respectively. However, many questions still remain as to {{whether there is a}} threshold level for these nutrients to optimize the exercise-induced gains. Further studies are also needed to investigate whether other dietary factors, such as vitamin D, soy isoflavones or omega- 3 fatty acids, or a multinutrient supplement, can enhance the effects of exercise on <b>bone</b> and muscle <b>health...</b>|$|R

25|$|Tobacco smoking: Many {{studies have}} {{associated}} smoking with decreased <b>bone</b> <b>health,</b> but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking {{has been proposed}} to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. Smoking also results in increased breakdown of exogenous estrogen, lower body weight and earlier menopause, all of which contribute to lower bone mineral density.|$|E
25|$|Both estrogens and androgens are {{necessary}} in all humans for <b>bone</b> <b>health.</b> Young, healthy women produce about 10nbsp&mg of testosterone monthly, and higher bone mineral density in males {{is associated with}} higher serum estrogen. Both estrogen and testosterone help to stimulate bone formation, especially during puberty. Estrogen is the predominant sex hormone that slows bone loss, even in men.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{specifically}} {{is essential}} for <b>bone</b> <b>health</b> and {{seems to have a}} role in skin elasticity and nervous system function. Other effects seen with progesterone include reducing spasms and relaxing smooth muscle tone; reducing gallbladder activity; widening bronchi, which helps respiration; reducing inflammation and immune response; and normalizing blood clotting and vascular tone, zinc and copper levels, cell oxygen levels, and use of fat stores for energy. Progesterone also assists in thyroid function and bone building by osteoblasts.|$|E

25|$|High dietary protein {{from animal}} sources: Research has found an {{association}} between diets high in animal protein and increased urinary calcium, and {{have been linked to}} an increase in fractures. However, the relevance of this observation to bone density is unclear, since higher protein diets tend to increase absorption of calcium from the diet and are associated with higher bone density. Indeed, it has recently been argued that low protein diets cause poor <b>bone</b> <b>health.</b> No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.|$|E

25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for <b>bone</b> <b>health,</b> may displace other foods which do, and that the real issue is that people who drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E

25|$|Regular, brisk {{exercise}} {{of any kind}} can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduce stress. It can also {{reduce the risk of}} coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves <b>bone</b> <b>health,</b> especially strengthening the hip bone, and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.|$|E
500|$|Long-term {{use of the}} {{ketogenic}} diet {{in children}} {{increases the risk of}} slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures and kidney stones. The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on <b>bone</b> <b>health.</b> Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About 1 in 20 children on the ketogenic diet will develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, zonisamide) are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral potassium citrate supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in a sevenfold decrease in the incidence of kidney stones. However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial. Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between vegetarian diet and <b>bone</b> <b>health</b> remains unclear.

[...] Other studies, exploring animal protein's negative effects on <b>bone</b> <b>health,</b> suggest that vegetarians may be less prone to osteoporosis than omnivores, as vegetarian subjects had greater bone mineral density and more bone formation.|$|E
