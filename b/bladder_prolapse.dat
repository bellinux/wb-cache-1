50|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} can {{be diagnosed}} by history and physical exam, {{though it is}} more accurately graded by imaging. Historically, fluoroscopy with defecography and cystography were used, though modern imaging allows the usage of MRI to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder, allowing for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Instead of contrast, ultrasound gel is used during the procedure with MRI. Both methods assess the pelvic floor at rest and maximum strain using coronal and sagittal views. When grading individual organ prolapse, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed, with prolapse of the rectum {{referred to as a}} rectocele, <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse</b> through the anterior vaginal wall a cystocele, and small bowel an enterocele.|$|E
5000|$|Constance {{sought help}} from two doctors. One {{of them was}} a [...] "nerve doctor" [...] from Heidelberg, Germany, who resorted to dubious remedies. The second doctor—Luigi Maria Bossi—conducted two {{operations}} (for uterine fibroid) in 1895 and 1898, the latter of which ultimately led to her death. [...] According to The Lancet, [...] "the surgery Bossi performed in December 1895 was probably an anterior vaginal wall repair to correct urinary difficulties from a presumed <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse.</b> In retrospect, the actual problem was probably neurogenic and not structural in origin." [...] During the second surgery in April 1898 Bossi probably [...] "did not attempt a hysterectomy but merely excised the tumour in a myomectomy". However, shortly after the surgery Constance developed uncontrollable vomiting, which led to dehydration and death. The immediate cause of death was likely severe paralytic ileus, which developed either {{as a result of the}} surgery itself or of intra-abdominal sepsis.|$|E
40|$|A 7 -year-old {{castrated}} {{male rabbit}} {{was presented with}} a red oedematous mass at the prepuce. The tissue was identified as the urinary bladder, and the condition was diagnosed as complete transurethral urinary bladder eversion.

Diagnosis of an allantoic cyst with a patent urachus was established during {{the first or second}} trimester of pregnancy. In two cases, rupture of prenatal cysts occurred and in one case, we described a prenatal vesicourethral abnormality. Surgery was performed with good results and no complications. A literature review collected 12 studies (15 fetuses) with a sex ratio of 3 boys/ 1 girl. The cysts ruptured in 2 / 3 of the cases, and in half of the cases, urinary abnormalities were found before birth (enlarged bladder, <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse).</b> At birth, one boy had posterior urethral valve (PUV) and 4 boys had a <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse.</b> The postoperative course was uneventful.

40|$|Background: Role of pelvic {{osteotomy}} in surgical {{management of}} bladder exstrophy is controversial But pelvic rim closure importantly. Bulking agents {{have been used}} for perineal and pelvic dysfunction in adults. In this study, bladder extrophy repair was performed without pubic closure And bulking agent injections were used as the strut of anterior pelvis for prevention of Organ prolapse and other functions in this series. Patients and Methods: During the period 2008 - 2012, twenty-five exstrophy-epispadias complex patients {{with a mean age of}} 14 months underwent surgical reconstruction. Rectus abdominis Muscle was detached from the superior pubis and sutured to each other in the midline and Re-anchored at the pubis and 8 - 9 month later urethra was constructed and placed between prineal muscles. Bladder neck repair and intersyphyseal reconstruction was done With bulking agents one year after primary bladder closure when in our series <b>bladder</b> <b>Prolapse</b> mainly occurred. One to 4 mL of bulking agents polyacrylate (vantris/promedon) was injected at the level of the intersymphyseal area and opening on either sides of the urethra. Results: Mean urinary continence score, before, 3 and 6 months after injection Were (2. 65 ± 074),(1. 95 ± 082),(1. 75 ± 0. 78), respectively. (p < 0. 001). The correlation factor Between before injection, 3 and 6 months were % 82, % 74 spectively. Meancapacity of bladder before, 3, 6 months after injection were (31 ± 14. 01), (41 ± 12. 81), (56 ± 11. 98) mml, respectively. The correlation factor before and after injection were 59 %.

40|$|Withagen MIJ. Function and {{dysfunction}} of the pelvic floor. Huisarts Wet 2015; 58 (11) : 600 - 3. Pelvic floor {{disorders are}} common. The muscles and ligaments of the pelvic floor support the pelvic organs and span {{the bottom of}} the pelvis. Additional contraction of the muscles maintains continence, whereas relaxation at the appropriate moment allows urination, defaecation, intercourse, and birth. Underactive pelvic floor muscles that provide too little support can give rise to urinary and faecal incontinence and vaginal, rectal, or <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse.</b> In contrast, overactive pelvic floor muscles can give rise to dyspareunia, constipation, overactive bladder, recurrent urinary tract infections, and chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. Although patients often experience several symptoms at the same time, one is usually more pronounced.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} whether climacteric symptoms {{are related to}} pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in postmenopausal women. Study design A cross-sectional investigation was performed on 1382 postmenopausal women attending an outpatient service for menopause at a university hospital. Main outcome measures Data regarding climacteric symptoms, as captured by the Greene Climacteric Scale, and objective POP were retrieved from an electronic database. Additional data retrieved were age, anthropometric measures, personal and reproductive history, use of medication or drugs, coffee, smoking, state of anxiety (STAI scale score) and depression (Zung scale score). Results The score of Greene Climacteric Scale was higher (p = 0. 02) in women with (n = 538) than in those without (n = 844) POP (29. 6 ± 13. 6 vs. 27. 8 ± 13.; p = 0. 02). In multiple logistic regression models, the score was independently related to POP as a whole (OR 1. 012; 95 %CI 1. 003, 1. 022; p = 0. 009), and to <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse</b> (OR 1. 011; 95 %CI 1. 007, 1. 07; p = 0. 02) or to uterus prolapse (OR 1. 003; 95 %CI 0. 99, 1. 016; p = 0. 63) or rectum prolapse (rectocele) (OR 1. 004; 95 %CI 0. 988, 1. 02; p = 0. 62).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether vaginal descent changes {{are associated with}} pelvic floor symptoms in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This 4 -year prospective study included 260 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus enrolled at one Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial site. All completed at least two annual pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) examinations and symptom questionnaires (30 bladder, bowel, and prolapse symptom items, modified from the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory). Symptoms were grouped, and group scores categorized into two or three evenly distributed levels. Year 4 data collection was incomplete because the overall WHI study halted. Generalized logistic linear models and generalized estimating equation methods were used to measure associations between vaginal descent and a symptom or symptom score, controlling for time, age, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Mean age was 68 +/- 5 years, BMI 30 +/- 6 kg/m(2), and median parity 4. Ninety-five percent of women had POP-Q stages I-II prolapse. Increasing maximal vaginal descent was associated with 2 ̆ 2 see/feel a bulge 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 sensation of protrusion or bulging, 2 ̆ 2 and with obstructive <b>bladder,</b> <b>prolapse,</b> and obstructive bowel scores. Increasing apical descent (POP-Q point C) was associated with 2 ̆ 2 see/feel a bulge, 2 ̆ 2 increasing anterior descent (POP-Q point Ba) with bladder pain and obstructive bladder scores, and increasing posterior descent (POP-Q point Bp) with the bowel incontinence score. CONCLUSION: Although previous work showed that most pelvic floor symptoms correlated poorly with levels of early prolapse, longitudinal analysis suggests that vaginal descent progression over time is positively associated with various bladder, bowel, and prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women with stages I-II prolapse.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether climacteric symptoms are related to urinary incontinence (UI) in postmenopausal women. METHODS:: A cross-sectional investigation was performed on 1, 502 postmenopausal women attending the outpatient service for menopause at a University Hospital. Data regarding climacteric symptoms, evaluated by the Greene Climacteric Scale, objective pelvic floor defects, and UI of any type, were retrieved from an electronic database. Additional information retrieved were age, anthropometric measures, personal and reproductive history, use of medication or drugs, smoking, state of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale score), and depression (Zungʼs scale score). RESULTS:: The score of the Greene Climacteric Scale was higher (P?=? 0. 0001) in women with (n?=? 534) than without (n?=? 902) UI (32. 3 ?±? 13. 1 vs 26. 5 ?±? 12. 5; P?<? 0. 0011). The same was true when considering stress (n?=? 370) (31. 4 ?±? 13. 4; P?=?? 0. 0007), urge (n?=? 84) (34. 5 ?±? 13. 5; P?=?? 0. 005), or mixed (n?=? 89) (34. 3 ?±? 11. 4; P?=?? 0. 006) UI. In multiple logistic regression models, the Greene climacteric score was independently related to UI (odds ratio [OR] 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 07), along with the presence of a <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse</b> (OR 3. 72; 95 % CI, 2. 59 - 5. 34), age at menopause (OR 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 09), and previous hysterectomy (OR 1. 80; 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 3. 01).

40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} the cytological criteria {{to identify the}} urothelial cells in cervical smears {{in order to avoid}} mistakes in the cytological diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Cervical smears from 34 post menopausal women with vesicovaginal fistulas, advanced <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse</b> and genital erosive lichen planes (vulvar kraurosis) (Group 1) and transitional cell metaplasia of the cervix (TCM, Group 2) were stained with Papanicolaou technique. The cervical samples were taken during the routine annual examination for prevention of the uterine cancer. Results: The smears of cervix from Group 1 showed urothelial cells from the three layers of the transitional epithelium. The umbrella cells are the bigger ones with relatively large nuclei. Frequently, they are multinucleated with single or multiple nucleoli and a typical "frothy" cytoplasm (cytoplasmic vacuoles). The cells of the Group 2 showed nuclei with oval to spindled shapes, some tapered ends, less cytoplasm than squamous metaplastic cells, powdery chromatin, small nucleoli and nuclear grooves. Conclusions: The umbrella cells may be mistaken for dysplastic cells originating in low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions lesions (LSILs) due to their nuclear and cytoplasm sizes. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the possibility of their appearance in the cervical smears, especially in post menopausal patients in order to avoid a false diagnosis of an intraepithelial lesion. It is unlikely that deeper cells of urothelium would be confused with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cells. However, their presence might be a reason of mistake in the diagnosis. TCM is an under-recognized metaplastic phenomenon of the cervix and vagina, which is a mimicker of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. The differential characteristic between umbrella cells, cells from TCM and the deeper urothelial cells, and LSIL and HSIL are detailed in the present paper...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Symptoms of {{urogenital}} dysfunction {{are known}} to negatively affect health-related {{quality of life in}} women. To assess effectiveness of treatment, it is currently recommended to include measurements of quality of life in outcome analysis. One of the questionnaires that is commonly used is the combination of the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ). Unfortunately, the validity of the UDI and IIQ has only been tested in highly selected subgroups of female patients. Therefore, it is unclear whether this questionnaire is suitable for use in populations with different characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed the scale construction and validity of the UDI and IIQ in a random sample of 2, 042 women, aged 20 - 70 years old and a clinical sample of 196 women. RESULTS: Our results show that the UDI can be divided into five subscales, namely discomfort/pain, urinary incontinence, overactive <b>bladder,</b> genital <b>prolapse,</b> and obstructive micturition. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) ranged between 0. 74 and 0. 82. In addition to the original four subscales of the IIQ (mobility, physical, social, and emotional functioning), we identified a fifth subscale with four items about embarrassment. Internal consistency of these subscales ranged between 0. 83 and 0. 93. In addition to the internal consistency, we tested the criterion and construct validity of these new subscale division. CONCLUSIONS: We found these subscales to be reliable and of clinical use. It is recommended to use the revised UDI and IIQ in outcome analysis of treatments for urogenital symptoms in wome...|$|R

40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} with pelvic organ prolapse may suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), especially {{stress urinary incontinence}} (SUI) named de novo SUI after pelvic floor reconstruction. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of de novo SUI. Methods: This is a nested case-control study of 533 patients who underwent pelvic floor reconstruction due to pelvic organ prolapse (POP) at the Department of Gynecology in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2011 to March 2013. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 401 patients {{were enrolled in the}} study with the follow-up rate of 74. 8 % (101 patients lost to follow-up). There were 75 {{patients with}} de novo SUI postoperatively. According to the ratio of 1 : 3, we ensured the number of control group (n = 225). The preoperative urinary dynamics, POP-quantification scores, and LUTS were compared between the two groups by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to investigate the risk factors of de novo SUI. Results: The incidence of de novo SUI was 25 % (75 / 300). Univariate analysis showed that the ratio of lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) before surgery in de novo SUI group was significantly higher than the control group (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] [1. 1 – 4. 0], P = 0. 022). The interaction test of LUTO and other factors displayed that Aa value was an interaction factor. With the increasing score of Aa, the incidence of de novo SUI become higher (OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI [1. 0 – 3. 7], P = 0. 045). After multivariable adjustment, multiple regression analysis showed that LUTO was independently associated with a greater risk of de novo SUI after pelvic floor surgery (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI [1. 2 – 4. 6], P = 0. 013).

40|$|A 3. 5 {{year old}} male {{castrated}} ferret was initially seen at Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) 15 months prior for urethral obstruction due to cystine urolithiasis which was surgically corrected with a cystotomy and urethrostomy. He twice returned to CUHA 2 months and 9 months post-operatively for additional episodes of urinary obstruction at which times diagnostic testing ruled out urolithiasis and infection, but no definitive diagnosis was made. His clinical signs resolved with medical management {{and he has}} been maintained for the last six months on prazosin, meloxicam, diazepam and acepromazine. He presented most recently to the CUHA Emergency service for a 24 hour history of stranguria that could not be pharmacologically resolved. On presentation he was bright, alert and euhydrated with normal vital parameters. Physical examination revealed moderate abdominal distension due to the presence of a painful, turgid bladder that could not be manually expressed. His bladder was emptied of 40 ml of urine via catheterization under sedation and he was maintained overnight on subcutaneous fluids and buprenorphine. A urinalysis and sediment exam showed no abnormalities, thus ruling down urolithiasis or infection as causes of his obstruction. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a normal prostate, ruling out prostatomegaly (secondary to hyperandrogenism from adrenal disease) as a cause of obstruction. The ultrasound also revealed a very large bladder with a focal narrowing in the region of the pelvic inlet and a caudal enlargement continuing to the perineal region immediately deep to the anus. This was highly suggestive of a perineal hernia with <b>bladder</b> <b>prolapse.</b> The patient was taken to surgery that day to free the entrapped bladder and prevent reherniation with a cystopexy. After surgery, his urethra was patent, but by the following morning he developed stranguria again. A repeat ultrasound confirmed an intact pexy site, but the same caudal dilation of the bladder. A contrast cystogram revealed that the perineal “bladder” was actually severely distended pelvic urethra secondary to a penile urethral stricture. He was fitted with an indwelling urinary catheter and closed collection system for 48 hours in preparation for a microscopic perineal urethrostomy to bypass the stricture. Surgery was a success and the patient continued to void urine normally from the stoma on his caudal abdomen. He was allowed to recover for two subsequent days, and was discharged with a full body wrap to prevent access to his incision. He continues to do well at home. The goal of this presentation is to review ferret anatomy, discuss causes of urinary obstruction and treatment options in male ferrets, outline anesthetic and surgical considerations in the ferret and touch on the pitfalls of over reliance on a single diagnostic test for surgical planning...|$|E
40|$|Traumatic rupture of {{the bladder}} with {{eversion}} and protrusion via the perineum {{is a rare}} complication of pelvic injury. We present a 36 -year-old lady who sustained severe pelvic injury with a bleeding right-sided deep perineal laceration. She had closed reduction of pelvic fracture with pelvic banding and primary closure of perineal laceration at a private hospital. She subsequently had dehiscence of repaired perineal laceration with protrusion of fleshy mass from vulva and leakage of urine per perineum five weeks later. Examination revealed a fleshy mucosa-like mass protruding anteriorly with a bridge of tissue between it and right anterolateral vaginal wall. Upward pressure on this mass revealed the bladder neck and ureteric orifices. She had perineal and pelvic exploration with findings of <b>prolapsed,</b> completely everted <b>bladder</b> wall through a transverse anterior bladder wall rent via the perineum, and an unstable B 1 pelvic disruption. She had repair of the ruptured, everted, and <b>prolapsed</b> <b>bladder,</b> double-plate and screw fixation of disrupted pelvis and repair of the pelvic/perineal defect. She commenced physiotherapy and ambulation a week after surgery. Patient now walks normally and is continent of urine. We conclude that the intrinsic urethral continent mechanism {{plays a significant role}} in maintaining continence in females...|$|R
40|$|Tension-free vaginal mesh (TVM) {{surgery is}} a common and {{minimally}} invasive procedure for female pelvic organ prolapse. In 2004, this procedure was developed by a French group, and standardized surgical kits are now commercially available in many countries. Although it is less invasive, one of the shortcomings of this procedure is that it involves a single surgeon groping around with their fingers without any intraoperative monitoring. Therefore, using Intraoperative fluoroscopic monitoring during TVM surgery makes it safer, even for beginners. In this case, we performed TVM for the anterior vaginal wall. First, we used the c-arm of a fluoroscope to insert bilateral ureteral stents. A urethral catheter was then used for both urine drainage and contrast medium injection. In all procedures, we were able use fluoroscopic imaging whenever necessary. We were able to easily confirm {{the positions of the}} <b>prolapsed</b> <b>bladder</b> and the bilateral ureteral stents with fluoroscopic imaging, and the ischial spine was easy to locate before the procedure. We were also able to confirm the position of the top of the needle with fluoroscopic imaging whenever necessary. If a surgeon is worried about the risk of bladder injury during TVM surgery, they should inject contrast medium into the bladder {{at the start of the}} procedure. Intraoperative fluoroscopic monitoring during TVM surgery is easy and makes the procedure safer, even for beginners. Moreover, fluoroscopic imaging also allows intraoperative training. To avoid exposing the body to excess radiation, we must minimize the total length of the fluoroscopic examination...|$|R
40|$|Vaginal {{evisceration}} in premenopausal women after trans-abdominal hysterectomy {{is extremely}} rare in occurrence and only few {{cases have been}} documented in worldwide literature. Here we report a premenopausal woman with coitus induced trans-vaginal evisceration who had undergone trans-abdominal hysterectomy two years ago. This article highlights coitus as a trigger event for inducing vaginal evisceration and that vaginal evisceration caused by sexual intercourse {{should be considered in}} the field of surgery when a pre-menopausal woman presents with acute abdominal pain with no history of any other traumatic episode. Background Hysterectomy is an extremely common procedure performed routinely on a global basis with recognized complications which include infection, bleeding, <b>bladder</b> injury and <b>prolapse</b> of the vaginal vault [1]. Vaginal evisceration after transabdominal hysterectomy in a pre-menopausal patient with vault rupture and prolapse of small bowel during sexual intercourse is an extremely rare event, and when it occurs, it is a surgical emergency [2, 3]. Since the first report in 1864 by Hyernaux, 113 cases have been reported in medical literature [4]. Joy et al. identified 12 cases of vaginal cuff evisceration resulting from coitus and 9 of these cases were post-vaginal hysterectomy [3]. In premenopausal cases, evisceration appears to be rarer and tend to be associated with either sexual or obstetric trauma, while in post menopausal women, it is usually associated with atrophic vaginal wall which have an increased risk of rupture [1]. Here we report a case of coitus-induced vaginal evisceration in a pre-menopausal female patient, with prolapse of around 1 meter of small bowel through the vagina; who had undergone abdominal hysterectomy two years back for dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionWhatever {{the method}} {{and timing of}} surgery, a high {{proportion}} of children with bladder exstrophy will continue to suffer from urinary incontinence. They face the options of urinary diversion to an external stoma or construction of a neobladder from bowel. This study describes a modified Duhamel's rectal pouch with a ureterorectostomy was carried out on 11 children who had a failed repair of bladder exstrophy. Materials and methodsTen boys and one girl, aged from 4 to 7 years (mean 5. 5), had several unsuccessful operations for bladder exstrophy. All selected to have good renal function and no other anomalies, but were incontinent of urine and had a small contracted or <b>prolapsed</b> <b>bladder.</b> They underwent urinary diversion to the rectum using the Duhamel pullthrough technique, where the sigmoid colon was opened {{into the back of the}} anal canal above the dentate line, creating a rectal bladder and making use of the anal sphincter to control urine and stool. All were followed up for 24 months (18 – 27 months). ResultsIn this selected group of patients there were no major operative or postoperative complications. Follow-up for 2 years revealed no deterioration in renal function, or electrolytes disturbance. They can hold up to 300 ml of urine and all patients are continent during the daytime with an emptying frequency of 3 – 5 times. Nocturnal wetting occur some 4 – 8 times per month with significant decrease with time. Two cases developed pyelonephritis but this was controlled with medical treatment. ConclusionEleven children achieved effective urinary continence by ureteric diversion to the rectum using a modified Duhamel pullthrough technique. Two years follow up showed no complications, except bed wetting, but long term assessment is warranted...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundTo {{explore the}} morphologic {{association}} of female lower urinary tract symptoms with anterior vaginal wall relaxation {{in women with}} primary urodynamic stress incontinence. Patients and MethodsThe records of 782 women who were diagnosed with primary urodynamic stress incontinence and also had ultrasonographic evaluation of the lower urinary tract were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data recorded in the database {{at the time of}} evaluation included demographic data, a symptom questionnaire, and results of a pelvic examination, urodynamic study and ultrasound cystourethrography. The symptom questionnaire addressed six categories of lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency, urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and voiding difficulty. Bothersome severity of stress incontinence was assessed using a 6 -point Likert scale. Morphologic characteristics of the lower urinary tract were evaluated at rest and during maximal Valsalva maneuver by introital ultrasonography. ResultsOf the 782 study subjects, 363 (46. 4 %) had urinary symptoms other than stress incontinence, and 82 (10. 5 %) did not report symptomatic stress incontinence. A significantly lower Ba point, determined by the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system, was found in subjects who did not report stress incontinence when compared with those who did (p = 0. 017). The symptom of stress incontinence was related to a greater straining bladder neck angle, whereas urgency was related to a smaller angle. Subjects who had urge incontinence had a significantly higher incidence of bladder neck funneling during stress {{than those who did not}} have urge incontinence (p = 0. 033). Subjects with stress incontinence had a significantly lower incidence of <b>prolapsing</b> <b>bladder</b> base than those without stress incontinence (p = 0. 012). ConclusionIn subjects with primary urodynamic stress incontinence, the symptoms of urinary frequency, nocturia, and voiding difficulty were not associated with any morphologic characteristic, whereas urgency, urge incontinence, and stress incontinence were associated with specific morphologic features on ultrasonography...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Role of Vitamin D is {{very well}} known for the {{functioning}} of many body organs. However, {{its role in the}} postmenopausal women in relation to various genitourinary disorders has been recognized recently. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate role of Vitamin D in vaginal health, <b>prolapse,</b> <b>bladder</b> and bowel function, and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Materials and Methods: This was a randomized controlled study in which 200 geriatric female patients of 65 – 78 years of age divided into two groups comprising study and control group with 100 participants in each. Detailed obstetrical, gynecological, and clinical history was elicited. Detailed examination regarding the prolapse, urinary and bowel functions, and bacterial infections was done followed by follow-up of 3 and 6 months each. Chi-square and independent t-test used for data analysis. Results: Mean modified vaginal health index (MVHI) among patients with pelvic floor diseases was statistically significant with P = 0. 0472. There was a visible increasing trend in Vitamin D deficiency with increase in time since menopause (P = 0. 1193). Patients with pelvic floor disease had mean Vitamin D statistically significant with P = 0. 0462. With increase in Vitamin D levels, MVHI was found to be better. The association of mean Vitamin D levels among patients with urinary incontinence as compared to controls was significant with P = 0. 0460. Association of mean Vitamin D levels in patients with fecal incontinence and BV as compared to controls was not statistically significant with P = 0. 6304 and 0. 79, respectively. Low Vitamin D levels were associated with high mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels statistically significant with P = 0. 034. MVHI was found to increase significantly with Vitamin D supplementation at 3 and 6 months' follow-up. There was increase in Vitamin D and calcium levels and fall in serum PTH levels at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions: Vitamin D levels were associated with a decreased risk of pelvic floor disorders, improved MVHI in women in geriatric age group...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{causes and}} {{management}} of acute urine retention (AUR) and chronic urine retention (CUR) are different and varied in both gender and age. Urine retention has been well studied among males worldwide, while data on urine retention among women are sparse. This study aimed at determining the causes {{and management of}} AUR and CUR among adults at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Kumasi, Ghana. Subjects and methods: A prospective study was conducted during 8 months period. The study was carried out at the Urology and Accident and Emergency Units of KATH. A complete work-up to establish the cause of urine retention preceded data collection. The subject's demographic data, causes and management of urine retention with outcomes were recorded on data sheet. Data was analyzed using Stata version 12. 0. Results: Two hundred and six subjects {{were enrolled in the}} study. There were 198 men and 8 women with mean ages of 62. 8  ±  16. 8 and 55. 4  ±  18. 4 years respectively. The prevalence of AUR and CUR in the population were 172 (83. 5 %) and 34 (16. 5 %) respectively. Among the males 169 (85. 4 %) presented with AUR while 29 (14. 6 %) presented with CUR. The causes of AUR or CUR in men were: benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) 115 (58. 1 %), urethral stricture 29 (14. 7 %), carcinoma of the prostate 26 (13. 1 %), traumatic urethral injury 26 (13. 1 %) and others 1 %. AUR was found in 3 (37. 5 %) and CUR in 5 (62. 5 %) of the women studied. Two women each had bladder carcinoma and neurogenic bladder respectively. One each of utero-vaginal <b>prolapse,</b> <b>bladder</b> stones, urethral tumour and urethral trauma respectively were also found. Urinary tract infection occurred in 20 (9. 7 %) and renal insufficiency in 32 (16. 5. 0 %) of respondents. The mean volume of urine drained on catheterization was 800. 0  ±  161. 7  ml. The immediate treatment was by urethral catheterization in 146 (70. 9 %) and suprapubic cystostomy in 60 (29. 1 %). The definitive treatment for the underlying causes of urine retention was varied. Conclusions: Acute and chronic urine retention is not uncommon, but credible baseline data on this condition is nonexistent at KATH, Kumasi. Urine retention found among the participants was mainly AUR. Men were the most affected with benign prostatic enlargement, being the leading cause. Among women, acute or chronic urine retention was caused mainly by bladder cancer and neurogenic bladder. Initial and definitive management were varied between causes, gender and age...|$|R
