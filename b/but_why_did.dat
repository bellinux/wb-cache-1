2500|$|Porfirio Díaz was enticed by {{the lure}} of power. His indigenismo only lasted until he took the presidential seat {{the second time around}} in 1884. What changed? What made Díaz go from the victor against a reelectionist {{government}} to the very embodiment of it? His early military career proved his loyalty to his people—the Mixtecs. Prior to his presidency, Díaz provided education and military training for the Indians, which indicated that he did not view them as an obstacle. During his four-year hiatus from the presidency (1880-1884), he was the governor of his native Oaxaca and there, too, he succeeded in implementing public services, with a focus on the Indians. Díaz’s rise to power is undoubtedly impressive and it is not surprising why many, then and now, still consider him the hero of Mexico—the one who brought Mexico out of its backwardness and into the world stage. <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> Díaz, or how did he, become his own antithesis? ...|$|E
