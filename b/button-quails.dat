5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), <b>button-quails</b> (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} order Gruiformes {{was established}} by the influential German avian comparative anatomist Max Fürbringer (1888). Over the decades, many ornithologists suggested {{that members of the}} order were in fact more closely related to other groups (reviewed by Olson 1985, Sibley and Ahlquist 1990). For example, it was thought that sunbittern might be related to herons and that seriemas might be related to cuckoos. Olson and Steadman (1981) were first to correctly disband any of the traditional Gruiformes. They recognized that the Australian plains-wanderer (family Pedionomidae) was actually a member of the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) based on skeletal characters. This was confirmed by Sibley and Ahlquist (1990) based on DNA-DNA hybridization and subsequently by Paton et al. (2003), Paton and Baker (2006) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006). Sibley and Ahlquist furthermore removed <b>button-quails</b> (Turnicidae) from the Gruifomes based on large DNA-DNA hybridization distances to other supposed Gruiformes. However, {{it was not until the}} work of Paton et al. (2004) and Fain and Houde (2004, 2006) that the correct placement of buttonquails within the shorebirds (order Charadriiformes) was documented on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of multiple genetic loci. Using 12S ribosomal DNA sequences, Houde et al. (1997) were the first to present molecular genetic evidence of gruiform polyphyly, although apparently they were not convinced by it. However, on the basis of numerous additional sequence data, it has been shown decisively that the traditionally recognized Gruiformes consist of five to seven unrelated clades (Fain and Houde 2004, Ericson et al. 2006, Hackett et al. 2008).|$|E

40|$|The Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster) {{is listed}} as ‘vulnerable’ under the Regulations of the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992 and the Federal Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Historically, Black-breasted Button Quails {{occupied}} a range from Marlborough in the north, south to northern NSW and approximately 300 km inland including the Dawson and Fitzroy valleys in central Queensland (Bennett 1985; Garnett et al. 2011; Hamley et al. 1997; Marchant and Higgins 1993); corresponding to the South-east Queensland and Brigalow Belt Bioregions (Sattler and Williams 1999). However, {{as recently as the}} mid 1990 s, this species was thought to be no longer present in the Fitzroy River basin with its northern limit at Inskip Point near Fraser Island (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Pizzey and Knight 1997). In the previous stage of this project, several new sites supporting Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> were found showing that Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> may be more common in the Fitzroy Basin than previously thought (Houston et al. 2011) ...|$|R
40|$|Apex {{predator}} extirpation {{has been}} identified as a key driver of biodiversity losses. The mesopredator release hypothesis (MRH) predicts that reduced abundance of apex predators results in an increase in the abundance and predatory impact of mesopredators. Here we test predictions made according to the MRH that an apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo), benefits a small ground-nesting bird, the little button-quail (Turnix velox), by reducing the abundance of introduced mesopredators, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cat (Felis catus). We also examined an alternative hypothesis that herbivore grazing negatively affects little button-quail abundance by reducing ground cover. To test our predictions we compared dingo, mesopredator, quail, herbivore and ground cover abundances and predator diets over a 25 month period and across a 10, 000 km 2 region encompassing areas where dingoes were common and rare, pastoral properties, and conservation reserves. Little <b>button-quails</b> were primarily observed where dingoes were common and foxes rare. Cats were detected at low numbers throughout the sample area irrespective of the index abundance of little <b>button-quails,</b> dingoes or foxes. Birds occurred less frequently in dingo than fox or cat scats. Ground cover and herbivore grazing activity were poor correlates of little button-quail abundance. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that apex predators¿ mesopredator-suppressive effects translate to population-level benefits for a ground-nesting bird. Positive associations between the abundances of dingoes and small-prey species suggests that positive management of dingoes could be incorporated into broad-scale biodiversity conservation programs as a strategy to alleviate the predatory impacts of foxes...|$|E
40|$|Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster) {{is listed}} as {{vulnerable}} under the Regulations of the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992 and the Federal Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Historically, Black-breasted Button Quails occupied a range from Marlborough in the north, south to northern NSW and about 300 km inland including the Dawson and Fitzroy valleys in central Queensland. Its inland distribution broadly corresponds to the western extent of drier rainforests in eastern Australia, where these habitats typically occur as small isolated patches surrounded by extensive eucalypt woodlands. Known habitat includes microphyll vine forest, notophyll vine forest, semi-evergreen vine thicket, littoral vine forest, Brigalow vine scrub or Brigalow-Belah closed forest, as well as regrowth Acacia thickets associated with beach ridges. Important attributes of Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> habitat are a closed canopy and a dense cover of leaf litter, both characteristic of rainforest associations with a pronounced seasonal dry period such as dry rainforests. Much Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> habitat in the Brigalow Belt has been substantially reduced by clearing of Bottletree scrubs and other closed canopy Brigalow associations. However, recent surveys indicate that they may still be relatively widespread in the region. Eight new sites {{were found in the}} Fitzroy Basin and adjoining south-east Queensland regions between 2004 and 2009. Thus {{there is a need to}} identify valuable remnants so that protection and management can be improved. Black-breasted <b>Button-quail</b> is a cryptic species and identification of their presence relies mainly on the presence of platelets; small depressions formed in the leaf litter when feeding...|$|R
50|$|A {{biological}} {{survey was}} conducted {{in the area in}} 1982 and researchers found 189 plant species, 53 species of bird, 19 reptile species and 9 species of mammal.

50|$|Previous logging of {{rainforest}} and woodland in the Noosa {{region has}} led to habitat loss and fragmentation for many bird species, particularly for the black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster), Coxen’s fig-parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus), and the swift parrot (Lathamus discolor). Previous clearing of eucalypt forests has also affected the primary food source and habitat of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).|$|R
5000|$|Some 1620 km2 of the Conondale Range is {{classified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports an isolated, and the northernmost, {{population of the}} endangered eastern bristlebird, which was only discovered in the 1980s.

50|$|Some 11,246 km2 of Kakadu's savanna {{habitats}} {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the endangered Gouldian finch, the vulnerable red goshawk, the near threatened partridge pigeon and chestnut-backed <b>button-quail,</b> and the restricted-range hooded parrot and rainbow pitta. The Kakadu Savanna IBA also supports varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, silver-crowned friarbirds, white-gaped, yellow-tinted, white-lined, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, sandstone shrike-thrushes, white-browed robins, canary white-eyes, and masked and long-tailed finches.|$|R
50|$|The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) is {{a nationally}} {{endangered}} migratory bird which breeds only in Tasmania but migrates to mainland Australia for wintering. Its habitat requirements {{are similar to}} the glossy black-cockatoo in that it requires shelter in a woodland tree hollow, albeit a smaller size. The habitat requirements of the black breasted <b>button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster), and the eastern ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus wallicus) are somewhat different in that they forage and live in the rainforest vine thickets and heathland floors respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> Turnix melanogaster {{is a small}} ground {{dwelling}} bird which inhabits notophyll vine forest or ‘dry rainforests’ [...] with up to 90% of its habitat {{has been}} cleared with less than 2,500 individuals estimated remaining in the wild. [...] The species is listed as vulnerable nationally and in Queensland [...] and is considered near threatened on the IUCN red list. The Conondale populations is considered an important population due to the size and location being within a national park.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} park borders areas of state forest and hoop pine plantations which {{are subject to}} on-going harvesting activities, these pose potential environmental threats to black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> which inhabits areas adjacent to the hoop pine plantations. The plumed frogmouth is sensitive to disturbance and has specialised habitat requirements of pristine forests, there are potential impacts from forest harvesting of native timber in the Conondale region. Additional impacts from forestry operations include increased siltation and erosion from disused roads and tracks may impact water quality.|$|R

50|$|The Noosa Biosphere Reserve {{is a vital}} {{element of}} the BirdLife International {{designated}} Endemic Bird Area (EBA) Eastern Australia zone. The reserve houses over 300 bird species, with a dynamic and diverse population encompassing 44% of documented Australian resident bird species population, as well as migratory bird species. Significant species in the area include the square-tailed kite (Lophoictinia isura), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiates), black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster), glossy black cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus), Coxen’s fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), eastern ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus wallicus), and the regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus).|$|R
50|$|The {{woodlands}} in the Noosa Biosphere Reserve {{provide an}} ideal habitat {{for many of}} the bird species mentioned.

This particular species is currently listed as vulnerable in Queensland, as is the black breasted <b>button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster), and the eastern ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus wallicus). Species with significantly small populations and recognised as endangered by Queensland Government are the red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiates), Coxen’s fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), and the swift parrot (Lathamus discolor).|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports {{a large proportion of}} the population of the endangered golden-shouldered parrot, and possibly of the buff-breasted <b>button-quail.</b> It also contains significant populations of black-throated and masked finches, bush stone-curlews, silver-crowned friarbirds, and yellow-tinted, yellow, banded, white-gaped and bar-breasted honeyeaters. [...] During the wet season azure kingfishers occur along the streams with rainforest birds such as fairy gerygones and pied imperial-pigeons. The wet grasslands are used by Latham's snipes on migration and by brolgas for nesting. Black-breasted buzzards sometimes nest in the IBA and red goshawks have been recorded there.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{has been}} {{identified}} as having impacts on species within the park, studies of the eastern bristlebird indicates it responds well to planned mosaic burning which allows the bird to move into areas of unburnt habitat after fire. Feral animal baiting after fire is also needed as reduced vegetation cover leaves the birds more susceptible to predation from feral cat’s and foxes. Species like the black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> and glossy black-cockatoos are also fire sensitive, the Eucalyptus montivaga community is reliant on fire for maintenance of a healthy understorey. A fire management strategy has been prepared for Conondale National Park with the Eucalyptus montivaga vegetation community currently being studied for its response to fire.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mountains}} {{are part of}} the Bunya Mountains and Yarraman Important Bird Area which contains what is thought to be the largest population of the black-breasted <b>button-quail.</b> In the park, 120 species of bird have been recorded. Significant species include the wedge-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, grey goshawk, brown cuckoo-dove, rose robin, eastern yellow robin, large-billed gerygone, and Australian golden whistler. [...] The Bunya Mountains support the most westerly populations of many rainforest dwelling species, including green catbirds, regent bowerbirds, paradise riflebirds, eastern whipbirds, noisy pittas and the Australian logrunner.

5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, <b>button-quail</b> and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|R
50|$|Conservation for the Biosphere Reserve {{is mostly}} aimed at {{protecting}} and preserving the different land cover types {{present in the}} area. This results in flora protection which directly benefits the fauna within. Specifically, the main projects coordinated for conservation of the area include: designated conservation areas, weed management programs, promotion of fire protection, regeneration and revegetation, specific planning controls, visitor management, captive breeding programs, control programs for beach erosion prevention, use management, transfer of transition land into buffer zone and buffer land into core zone, and education and awareness. In addition to this, specific recovery plans and conservation guidelines mandated by the either state or federal government are enforced via Noosa Biosphere Limited for the Noosa Biosphere Reserve. This includes plans such as the ‘National Recovery Plan for the black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> Turnix melanogaster’ and ‘Commonwealth Conservation Advice on Triunia robusta’.|$|R
40|$|Reviews of nest {{predation}} {{call for}} the identification of nest predators. The identity of nest predators is perhaps most poorly known for ground-nesting birds. Marsupials are not generally regarded as potential nest-predators of these birds, partly because the biology of rare Australian marsupials is not fully understood due to their rarity. This study identified three marsupials - boodie (Bettongia lesueur), woylie (Bettongia penicillata) and brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) - taking eggs from artificial nests modelled on that of the threatened painted <b>button-quail</b> (Turnix varius). Approximately one-third of the eggs were taken by the two bettongs and another third by the brushtail possum. I present dietary evidence of bettongs consuming vertebrate items including taking live prey to provide external validation for {{the notion that they}} may depredate natural nests. I suggest that more research is required on the impacts of reintroductions to avoid deleterious effects on resident species...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{foraging}} habitat {{of the endangered}} black-breasted <b>button-quail</b> (Turnix melanogaster) in 13 rainforest patches of an agricultural landscape (23. 4 km(2)) in eastern Australia to assess its use of fragmented habitats outside conservation reserves. The species foraged only in the three largest patches (17. 4, 40. 0, 63. 8 ha in size), {{all of which were}} connected to open eucalypt forest, and in intact rainforest. Occurrence of birds was greatest in the largest patch. The maximum number of individuals within the study area was estimated to be 22. Radio-tracking of nine birds revealed that three were resident in the largest patch for periods of over 100 days; no movements between patches were detected. Three radio-tagged birds were taken by avian and mammalian predators. Our results indicated that the long-term future of the species in agricultural landscapes is bleak and that management action is urgently needed to arrest its decline in these ecosystems, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|The brown quail is also {{a member}} of the family Phasianidae that looks similar to the stubble quail, however the brown quail appears darker in colour. The white streaks that are obvious on the back of the stubble quail are thinner and less obvious on the brown quail. The brown quail does not have white streaks {{underneath}} its body like the stubble quail, but has black horizontal bars instead. This makes the brown quail look much darker than the stubble quail in flight. The brown quail's wings produce a whistling noise when flushed which is different from the whirring sound produced by the stubble quail's wings. The plains-wanderer is a highly endangered native species that looks very similar to the stubble quail but can be distinguished by their long yellow legs that can be observed during flight. The little buttonquail is a member of the Turnicidae family but is another species that is sometimes confused with the stubble quail. The little <b>button-quail</b> is a smaller bird with short, round wings and often makes a call of alarm when flushed, whereas stubble quail are vocally silent.|$|R
50|$|Vine scrub {{along the}} trail hosts many animals. Green catbirds, paradise riflebirds and noisy pitta are species of {{significance}} locally. Patches of grass adjacent to rainforest are visited at night by red-necked pademelons. Rufous bettongs also emerge from their grassy nests to feed on tubers and fungi at night. Dense vine scrub and thickets of lantana make some sections of the trail an important habitat for the shy and vulnerable black-breasted <b>button-quail.</b> Dish-shaped scrapes in the dirt are tell-tale signs that these secretive birds have been searching for food on the forest floor. Ducks, darters and other waterbirds may visit the Brisbane River that runs adjacent to the trail between Moore and Linville.

Glossy black cockatoos, brush, regent bowerbirds and the sulphur-crested cockatoos. On the hills adjacent to Blackbutt Creek and in the Benarkin State Forest, you may see the ancestors of deer given to the region in 1873 by Queen Victoria as a gift after Queensland was named in her honour. Pretty faced or whip tail wallabies are often seen at dusk in and around Blackbutt and Benarkin.Numerous frogs, skinks and lizards live in the area, including the vulnerable and secretive collared delma (a small legless lizard).
