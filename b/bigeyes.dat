40|$|Pacific <b>bigeye</b> tuna {{are subject}} to {{overfishing}} Pacific-wide and this document sets out alternatives that {{might be used to}} end overfishing. <b>Bigeye</b> tuna, like other highly migratory species (HMS) are nomadic in behavior, thus do not recognize boundaries that management, policy, or science have established. <b>Bigeye</b> tuna are fished by many nations in addition the United States, thus future efforts to reduce fishing mortality on <b>bigeye</b> tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) will require coordination and communication among all relevant regional fisheries stakeholders. The capacity for unilateral action by the United States to prevent overfishing, as required under National Standard 1 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U. S. C. 1851 (a) (1), is limited, as is the capacity of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), which is required to develop a plan to end overfishing, under 50 CFR 600. 310 (e) (4) (i)). Pacific-wide, the U. S. annually lands approximately 200, 000 metric tons (mt), or about five percent of the total <b>bigeye</b> catch. The Pacific-wide catch for <b>bigeye</b> tuna in the EPO between years 1999 and 2003 was between 88, 000 mt and 142, 000 mt. The U. S. West Coast commercial catch for this period was less than one percent, thus any unilateral action by U. S. fisheries to end overfishing would have little effect on the stock. Multilateral management action is essential to ensure that overfishing on <b>bigeye</b> tuna in the Pacific Ocean ends. The current resolution that places conservation and management measures on fishing nations in the EPO for <b>bigeye</b> tuna is set to expire in 2006, thus this document provides future management options that would address overfishing of Pacific <b>bigeye</b> tuna in the EPO.

40|$|The annual {{catches of}} big eye are {{exceeded}} {{by those of}} only two other species of tuna, skipjack, Katsuwonus pelamis, and yellowfin, Thunnus albacares. However, {{because most of the}} <b>bigeye</b> caught are consumed fresh, whereas most of the skipjack and yellowfin caught are canned, the economic value of big eye exceeds that of any other species of tuna. Despite its importance, less is known of the biology of <b>bigeye</b> than of the biology of any of the other principal market species of tunas. Historically, <b>bigeye</b> have been harvested mostly by longlines, which take only medium to large fish. During recent years, however, greater amounts of small <b>bigeye</b> have been caught by purse seines and other surface gear. This is a matter of concern for several reasons. First, long line fishermen are concerned that the harvesting of small <b>bigeye</b> will decrease the amounts of medium to large <b>bigeye</b> available to them. Second, since small <b>bigeye</b> are canned, rather than eaten fresh, consumers are concerned about the possible decrease in the supply of high-quality fresh fish. Third, economists are concerned about the possible economic loss associated with harvesting fish at less than their maximum economic value. Fourth, biologists are concerned about the possibility that harvesting of small <b>bigeye</b> could decrease the overall catches of that species. These concerns cannot be properly addressed until more knowledge of the biology of big eye is available.

5000|$|BIGEYE (an {{acronym for}} Binary Internally Generated {{chemical}} weapon within the [...] "EYE" [...] series of 500 pound canister weapons) was the common {{name for the}} BLU-80/B, a concept conceived during the 1950s. During the 1970s at Pine Bluff Arsenal around 200 test articles were produced. Initial production contracts for the BIGEYE were awarded in June, 1988, to The Marquardt Company of Van Nuys, CA, the project's prime contractor {{for most of the}} program. The original timeline for the U.S. binary chemical weapons program called for the BIGEYE to be deployed by September 1988. President Reagan authorized the spending of more than $59 million in 1986 to revive the binary chemical weapons program. Under the original timeline, the BIGEYE was to be the second binary chemical weapon to be produced (the first being a binary artillery shell) with binary chemical agent rockets to follow. After a General Accounting Office (GAO) report pointed out numerous flaws in the program the U.S. Senate moved to effectively kill the binary chemical weapons program, including the BIGEYE bomb. In 1989 President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. would retain the option to produce such binary weapons. At the time of his announcement, 1992 was the earliest date <b>BIGEYES</b> were expected to be deployed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bigeyes</b> are {{the second}} most {{abundant}} among demersal fishes in the region, usually accounting for 10 to 20 % of total catch of trawl, and are consisted of five species, among which Priacanthus tayenus and P. macracanthus are commercially important. P. tayenus predominated over P. macracanthus and no other species occurred {{in areas where the}} catch per hour of <b>bigeyes</b> was high, while in areas of the poor catch P. macracanthus predominated and the species composition was diverse. As a whole, P. macracanthus was bigger in size than P. tayenus. The recruitment of P. tayenus into trawl grounds seems to take place in June-August season when young fish is about 80 - 90 mm in standard length, and the fish is considered to grow by 50 mm in the following six months and another 50 mm in the subsequent one year. キントキダイ科魚類は表記海域におけるトロール漁業の主要漁獲物のひとつで,多くの漁場においてフエダイ科魚類に次いで多獲順位の第 2 位を占める。イトヒキキントキとキントキダイが主要種であり,他にホウセキキントキ,チカメキントキ,クルマダイも出現するが量的には少ない。単位曳網時間当りキントキダイ類漁獲高の高い水域(マレイ半島南部東岸沖,マラッカ海峡) ではイトヒキキントキの優占度が高く,種組成は単純である。逆に上記漁獲高の低い水域(ベトナム南岸沖) ではキントキダイが優占し,同時に種組成が複雑である。底曳網の漁獲物ではホウセキキントキが最も大きく,次いでキントキダイ,イトヒキキントキの順である。標準体長 80 ～ 90 mmにモードをもつイトヒキキントキの補給群がマレイ半島沖のトロール漁場に出現するのは主に 6 ～ 8 月で,その後半年でほぼ 50 mm大きくなり,更にその後 1 年で更に 50 mm生長するようだ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the failure}} of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission to adopt conservation and management measures that are sufficient to ensure the conservation and long term sustainability of <b>bigeye</b> tuna. The analysis focuses on the inter-related fisheries for skipjack, yellowfin and <b>bigeye,</b> and identifies critical challenges to the adoption of sufficient measures. Analysis of these fisheries shows that overfishing of <b>bigeye</b> is occurring and that the migratory, multi-species and multi-gear characteristics of these fisheries create substantial management challenges. The thesis studies the framework for managing these fisheries, the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. This study determines that the Convention is generally consistent with modern principles and standards of international fisheries governance. Although the Convention is weakened by ambiguities in key provisions, the thesis argues that it is generally sufficient to provide an effective framework for the conservation and management of the Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries. Despite this framework, the thesis demonstrates that the Commission has failed to adopt conservation and management measures that are sufficient to address overfishing of <b>bigeye.</b> The thesis analyses the interests {{of the participants in the}} Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries and demonstrates that the nature and influence of these interests are a key challenge to the negotiation of a measure that is sufficient to end overfishing of <b>bigeye.</b> The thesis argues that there is no clear interest among a dominant group of members to resolve current overfishing of <b>bigeye.</b> While some of these members have significant <b>bigeye</b> interests, they all have more significant skipjack interests that conflict with their lesser <b>bigeye</b> interests. The thesis concludes that the Commission has failed to adopt a sufficient response to overfishing of <b>bigeye</b> due to the combination of the migratory, multi-species and multi-gear characteristics of the fishery, with the nature of the participants‟ interests and influences...|$|R
