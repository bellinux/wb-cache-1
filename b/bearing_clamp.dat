40|$|Megasporia is a newly {{established}} polypore genus characterized by resupinate fruiting bodies with big pores, a dimitic hyphal structure with generative hyphae <b>bearing</b> <b>clamp</b> connections, {{more or less}} dextrinoid and cyanophilous skeletal hyphae, cylindrical, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth basidiospores, and growth mostly on fallen angiosperm branches. Species number is extremely rich in subtropical and tropical Asia. Three new species, namely M. rimosa, M. tropica and M. yunnanensis are described from China, and their illustrated descriptions are given. Differences between these new species and phylogenetically related and morphologically similar species are discussed. A key to the known species of Megasporia is provided...|$|E

40|$|The ectomycorrhizae {{are dark}} brown to black, monopodial-pyramidal to coralloid. The outer mantle layers are pseudoparenchymatous with angular, star-like {{arranged}} cells bearing a hyphal net of angular cells, whereas the inner layers are plectenchymatous with hyphae arranged ring-like. Mantle cell walls often thickened and darkened {{at the intersection}} of cells, especially in outer layers. Abundant emanating hyphae <b>bearing</b> <b>clamps,</b> with some highly refractive amyloid zones appearing gelatinized, i. e., as if there were no cell lumen. This ectomycorrhiza probably belongs to the genus Tomentella...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{introduces}} a rotating clamping device, using with the disassemblage machine of monomer hydraulic prop. It {{was used for}} clamping hydraulic prop, which was mainly comprised by the coupling mechanism, clamping mechanism and compressing mechanism. The coupling mechanism sleeve was bolted to the spindle. Clamping mechanism located {{at the end of}} sleeve, working with the spindle rotation. Compressing mechanism hang around the sleeve, not working with the spindle rotation. Compressing mechanism passed the clamping force through the thrust <b>bearing,</b> <b>clamping</b> the hydraulic prop. It was easy to operate. Clamping force is decentralized, the stress in cylinder was even, so the cylinders seldom distort, which reduced the impact, extending the life of the equipment...|$|R

Hydrostatic <b>bearing</b> ring <b>clamped</b> in radially flexing support by side plates clamped against radial surfaces by spring-loaded bolts. Plates provide friction against radial motions of shaft...|$|R
40|$|At the Fraunhofer IWU was {{developed}} a condition monitoring system, which allows monitoring the major {{components of a}} machine tool. This are - Main spindle (<b>bearings,</b> tool <b>clamping,</b> rotary [URL] feedthrough [URL] - Drives (Ball screw, guides), - Hydraulics (Pumps, oil condition) and - Pneumatics (valves, air consumption). The presentation describes the approach to the monitoring of main spindles and shows some diagnostic results...|$|R
40|$|A low friction, object guidance, and {{gripping}} finger {{device for}} a robotic end effector on a robotic arm is disclosed, having {{a pair of}} robotic fingers each having a finger shaft slideably located on a gripper housing attached to the end effector. Each of the robotic fingers has a roller housing attached to the finger shaft. The roller housing has a ball bearing mounted centering roller located at the center, {{and a pair of}} ball <b>bearing</b> mounted <b>clamping</b> rollers located {{on either side of the}} centering roller. The object has a recess to engage the centering roller and a number of seating ramps for engaging the clamping rollers. The centering roller acts to position and hold the object symmetrically about the centering roller with respect to the X axis and the clamping rollers act to position and hold the object with respect to the Y and Z axis...|$|R
50|$|The {{theodolite}} is {{an instrument}} for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate circles, protractors or alidades to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (<b>bearing),</b> and <b>clamps</b> the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.|$|R
