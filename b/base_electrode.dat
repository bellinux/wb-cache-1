The emphasis of the present dissertation is on the design of a new class of electrodes, namely mono crystalline diamond paste <b>based</b> <b>electrodes,</b> to be used in differential pulse voltammetry for trace analysis of inorganic compounds. Monocrystalline diamond and boron doped polycrystalline diamond <b>based</b> <b>electrodes</b> exhibit several superior electrochemical properties that are significantly different from those of other carbon allotropes <b>based</b> <b>electrodes,</b> e. g., glassy carbon electrodes, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite <b>based</b> <b>electrodes,</b> which have been widely used for many years. The advantages are: (a) lower background currents and noise signals, which lead to improve SIB and SIN ratios, and lower detection limits; (b) good electrochemical activity (pre-treatment is not necessary); (c) wide electrochemical potential window in aqueous media; (d) very low capacitance; (e) extreme electrochemical stability; and (f) high reproducibility of analytical information. Furthermore, later studies shown the superiority of the mono crystalline diamond as electrode material due to high mobilities measured for electrons and holes. The design selected for the electrodes is simple, fast and reproducible. The diamond powder was mixed with paraffine oil to give the diamond paste used as electroactive material in the electrodes. The results obtained by employing the diamond paste <b>based</b> <b>electrodes</b> proved a high sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy and high reliability. These characteristics made them suitable to be used for the analysis of different cations (e. g., Fe(ll), Fe(Ill), Cr(Ill), Cr(VI), Pb(ll), Ag(I)) as well as of anions (e. g., iodide) in pharmaceutical, food and environmental matricies.

40|$|The {{fast growing}} {{interest}} in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles has stimulated extensive research in high performance energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors. Nanostructured electrodes can achieve high electrochemical performances in supercapacitors owing to their high surface atom ratio, tuneable texture and unique size-dependent properties that can afford effective electrolyte diffusion and improved charge transportation and storage during charging–discharging. This review reports on the recent progress in designing and fabricating different kinds of nanostructured electrodes, including electrical double layer <b>based</b> <b>electrodes</b> such as porous carbons and graphene, and Faradic reaction <b>based</b> <b>electrodes</b> such as metal oxides/hydroxides and conductive polymers. Furthermore, the review also summarizes the advances of hybrid electrodes, which store charges by both mechanisms, such as porous carbons–metal oxides/hydroxides, porous carbons–conductive polymers, graphene–metal oxides/hydroxides, and graphene–conductive polymers. Finally, we provide some perspectives as to the future directions of this intriguing field. Sheng Chen, Wei Xing, Jingjing Duan, Xijun Hu and Shi Zhang Qia...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between two plant peroxidases, cationic horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and anionic tobacco peroxidase (TOP), {{combined with a}} highly cationic osmium polymer [Os(4, 4 '-dimethyl- 2, 2 '-bipyridine) 2 poly(N-vinylimidazole) 10 Cl]+ 2 /+ ([Os(dmp) PVI]+/ 2 +) to develop highly sensitive, stable and selective hydrogen peroxide biosensors. The two different plant peroxidases were individually immobilized onto graphite rod (G) electrodes by a three steps drop-casting procedure consisting of the subsequent deposition of an aqueous solution of ([Os(dmp) PVI]+/ 2 +), followed by a solution of poly(ethyleneglycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE), used as a cross linking agent and finally an aliquot of a solution of cationic HRP or anionic TOP to make HRP/PEGDGE/[Os(dmp) PVI]+/ 2 +/G and TOP/PEGDGE/[Os(dmp) PVI]+/ 2 +/G <b>based</b> <b>electrodes,</b> respectively. Electrochemical experiments were carried out to investigate {{the influence of the}} surface charge of the enzyme and the charge of the polymer on the efficiency of the electron transfer (ET) between the enzyme and the wiring redox polymer and the efficiency for electrocatalytic reduction of H 2 O 2. In the case of HRP a decrease in the ET rate was observed due to the repulsion between this enzyme and the polymer, both positively charged, whereas with TOP there was an enhanced ET rate due to the attraction between the anionic enzyme and the cationic polymer. The effects of enzyme loading and pH were investigated. Both peroxidase modified electrodes exhibited a wide dynamic response range (1 - 500 μM H 2 O 2) and a low detection limit (0. 3 μM H 2 O 2). The TOP <b>based</b> <b>electrode</b> showed a higher sensitivity (470 nAμM- 1 cm- 2) compared to that of the HRP <b>based</b> <b>electrode</b> (300 nAμM- 1 cm- 2) and an improved long-term stability (decrease in 17. 3 % upon 30 days compared with 50 % for HRP). Both enzyme electrodes showed a response time of 3 s. The HRP based sensor was more sensitive to the presence of phenolic compounds acting as alternative electron donors, whereas the TOP based sensor was virtually interference free. Both HRP and TOP <b>based</b> <b>electrodes</b> were successfully tested in contact lens cleaning samples and real "spiked" samples from different sources such as tap water, milk and dairy products...|$|R
