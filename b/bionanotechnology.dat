The EuroNanoForum 2009 focused on the “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy” exploring environmental as well as societal impact of the industrial applications of nanotechnology. This issue involves not only very broad and diverse areas of nanotechnology R&D such as nanomaterials, nanoelectronics and photonics, and <b>bionanotechnologies</b> but also energetics, environmental engineering, toxicology and even climatology.

30|$|Both {{mechanisms}} {{depend on}} particle size, whereas only the Brownian contribution {{depends on the}} viscosity, η, of the carrier solvent. However, although the size dependence of the heating power has been already investigated and indicates {{the existence of an}} optimal particle size in which the heating power is maximum [14], there are no systematic data on the influence of particle concentration or solvent properties in the same magnetic system and in a simultaneous way. As deduced from the Rosensweig equation and under certain experimental conditions, both Néel and Brownian relaxation times are comparable for SPM nanoparticles around 10 nm; therefore, changes in the particle concentration, solvent viscosity or particle surface modification could lead to important differences in the SAR observed. To our best knowledge, no heating properties of PAA-modified high quality magnetite MNPs have been previously reported. Such combination of the chemical features described above makes colloidal PAA-magnetite a promising system in advanced <b>bionanotechnologies.</b> For this reason, data about its heating properties under specific experimental conditions, which could reproduce physiological conditions in an in-vivo experiment, are highly desired.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with cysteine and its derivatives {{is the basis}} of a number of <b>bionanotechnologies,</b> and for these, the most important process is aggregation (or antiaggregation), which enables an array of colorimetric detection methods. When AuNPs were functionalized with cysteine, its dimer cystine, or the cysteine-derived tripeptide, glutathione, three different mechanisms of aggregation were observed. Both cysteine and glutathione induced aggregation of AuNPs without further pH modification: the first by interparticle zwitterionic interaction and the second by interparticle hydrogen bonding. Cystine, however, did not induce aggregation, although it dissociated into two cysteinate moieties upon adsorption on the AuNPs, which appear to be chemically identical to cysteinate produced from cysteine adsorption. We show that the difference is due to the lower coverage of cysteinate from cystine and differences in charge states of the adsorbates. On modifying the pH to 1. 5, the surface species become cationic (neutral COOH and protonated NH 3 +), and aggregation of cystine/AuNPs occurs immediately by interparticle hydrogen bonding. Thus, cysteine may induce aggregation by neutral hydrogen bonding or zwitterionic interaction between nanoparticles, but the mechanism depends sensitively on a number of parameters...|$|R
30|$|Chemical {{functionalization}} {{of carbon}} nanotubes (CNT) is {{perhaps one of}} the most important challenges in organic chemistry and chemical nanotechnology in present time. Not only does functionalization of carbon nanotubes play a critical role for achieving new variants of these organic nanomaterials for state-of-the-art nanotechnologies and <b>bionanotechnologies</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. It can also pave the way for achievements in functionalizing similar nanomaterials such as nanocones, bucky-balls, graphene sheets and other nanomaterials composed entirely of carbon and expand the knowledge in organic chemistry and chemical nanotechnology. Modification of carbon nanotubes can furthermore be a critical part of tailoring their properties for other applications as well, such as environmental remediation [8], catalysis [9, 10, 11], battery components [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], or also as fuel sources [17]. Functionalization and modification of the carbon nanotube is essential also because it gives completely new nanomaterials as starting base for developing new components in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics [5, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] and can provide unique spintronic properties for particularly photonic applications and in bionanosensors [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39], as well as function as nanoswitches [18] and nanoresistors [33, 40].|$|R

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) {{recombination}} {{can result}} in chimeric capsid protein subunits whose ability to assemble into an oligomeric capsid, package a genome, and transduce cells depends on the inheritance of sequence from different AAV parents. To develop quantitative design principles for guiding site-directed recombination of AAV capsids, we have examined how capsid structural perturbations predicted by the SCHEMA algorithm correlate with experimental measurements of disruption in seventeen chimeric capsid proteins. In our small chimera population, created by recombining AAV serotypes 2 and 4, we found that protection of viral genomes and cellular transduction {{were inversely related to}} calculated disruption of the capsid structure. Interestingly, however, we did not observe a correlation between genome packaging and calculated structural disruption; a majority of the chimeric capsid proteins formed at least partially assembled capsids and more than half packaged genomes, including those with the highest SCHEMA disruption. These results suggest that the sequence space accessed by recombination of divergent AAV serotypes is rich in capsid chimeras that assemble into 60 -mer capsids and package viral genomes. Overall, the SCHEMA algorithm may be useful for delineating quantitative design principles to guide the creation of libraries enriched in genome-protecting virus nanoparticles that can effectively transduce cells. Such improvements to the virus design process may help advance not only gene therapy applications but also other <b>bionanotechnologies</b> dependent upon the development of viruses with new sequences and functions...|$|R
40|$|Biology is Technology”, {{this title}} of a book {{authored}} by bioengineer Rob Carlson captures the essence of synthetic biology. This novel research field {{is in the hands}} of engineers, who are in charge of redesigning life or designing new forms of life for specific purposes. In the aftermath of “the century of the gene” (Evelyn Fox Keller, Cambridge Mass, Harvard University Press, 2002) he comes the century of “life by design”. As the emergence of molecular biology allowed reading the code of life, it seems quite natural to rewrite it with the alphabet. “From reading to writing the genetic code”, this is how Craig Venter, a genetic engineer who designed the first bacteria with a synthetic genome in 2010, explains and legitimizes his research programme. It seems to be a logical inference based on a chronological sequence. The prospect of designing organisms triggers the promise of manufacture of all sorts of organisms to meet societal demands or human desires and fantasies: From bacteria-workers to the creation of new forms of life or even…immortal life. Just as in nanotechnology, synthetic biology develops an “economy of promises”. However synthetic biology seems to go one step further. While nanotechnology has been advertised with the slogan “shaping the world atom by atom” in the 2000 US National NanoInitiative, synthetic biology opens up the more challenging perspective of designing organisms that will remake the world for us. Re-engineered yeasts or bacteria will serve as pharmaceutical plants producing drugs. Synthetic algae will provide renewable fuel for our daily consumption of energy. Synthetic bacteria will decontaminate the soils polluted by chemicals and nuclear waste. This paper outlines a number of distinctive features of this emerging field in the constellation of <b>bionanotechnologies.</b> It then insists on the variety of research agendas and strategies gathered under the umbrella “synthetic biology”. While redesigning life is the central goal, synthetic biologists do not develop a uniform view of living organisms...|$|R
