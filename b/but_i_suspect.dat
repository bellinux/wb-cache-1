500|$|Martin {{offered the}} {{following}} hint {{as to how}} the series would conclude during a Q at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. [...] "I'm {{not going to tell you}} how I'm going to end my book, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan found [...] "so much is {{happening}} {{you feel the}} immediate need of a sequel just {{as a reward for}} absorbing it all. While X-Men doesn't take your breath away wire-to-wire the way The Matrix did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it." [...] ReelReviews.net's James Berardinelli, an X-Men comic book fan, believed, [...] "the film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects-enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X-Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented, [...] "he movie's enjoyable on the surface, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> many people, even die-hards, will be less enthusiastic about what lies, or doesn't, underneath".|$|E
500|$|Philip Sherburne of Spin {{magazine}} wrote [...] "hile we're getting hyperbolic, 'Jealous' is {{the most}} uplifting take on invidiousness" [...] since the song [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] (1968). Jon Pareles, a New York Times writer called it an [...] "accusatory anthem". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani described [...] "Jealous" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] ballad while Rolling Stones Jon Dolan hailed it as a [...] "monster" [...] ballad. Nick McCormick of The Daily Telegraph wrote that despite the song lacked a lift off, [...] "there is something impressively dramatic about the restraint she maintains in a song of emotional tension". Jody Rosen of Vulture, lauded the line [...] "freakum dress out my closet", but noted, [...] "I want more of a melody from a wronged-woman's-revenge anthem, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> it's a grower". Philadelphia Media Network writer Dan DeLuca gave a more mixed review for the song writing that {{it was part of}} the slower material of the album which showed Beyoncé was not flawless.|$|E

6000|$|She {{looked at}} me for a moment, and then her eyes again fell. [...] "Do not speak in that way," [...] she said; [...] "it is not right. Of course I was not sure that you loved me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> it, and this was the very reason why I took my vow." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I had {{no doubts}} that the horse {{could get a}} mile and an eighth", he said later. [...] "I didn't know about the last eighth of a mile, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> it with Lord at War as his broodmare sire. There is good stamina on the dam side. And the way he trained - he's so relaxed now - that I wasactually quite {{confident}} {{that he would get}} it well and he certainly did." ...|$|R
500|$|Stephen King {{called the}} series [...] "a feat of which only a {{superior}} imagination is capable", and declared [...] "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" [...] to be [...] "remarkable". However, {{he wrote that}} despite the story being [...] "a good one", he is [...] "a little tired of discovering Harry {{at home with his}} horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books. King has also joked that [...] "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" [...] He does however predict that Harry Potter [...] "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages". Sameer Rahim of The Daily Telegraph disagreed, saying [...] "It depresses me to see 16 and 17 year-olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as Oliver Twist or A House for Mr Biswas. What that says about the adults who are fanatical fans I’m not sure – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> in years to come people will make a link between our plump, comfortable, infantilising society and the popularity of Potter." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It's a quite literal {{translation}} from Boberg, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> {{that he had}} the Hine work at hand because he uses the phrase 'how great Thou art.' Also, the music by Josephine Carradine Dixon is similar to Hine's. He added two verses of his own." ...|$|E
2500|$|While often {{described}} as a black conservative, he prefers not to be labeled, having stated, [...] "I prefer not to have labels, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that 'libertarian' would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement {{on a number of}} things". He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought perhaps}} one of them might try to take revenge on Mikail, sir. One {{or two of them}} were very sullen and surly, and would, I thought, do him harm if they had the chance; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> this man more than the others because he seemed so unnaturally pleasant, and as I had heard him boasting about the things for which he is here, I thought he was more {{dangerous}} than those who grumbled and threatened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No! {{except that}} he seemed a little depressed. But there's {{something}} else about Barney that <b>I</b> always <b>suspected,</b> that I've never heard mentioned yet. Mind you, {{it may be true}} or it may not, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> always <b>suspected</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was depressingly still, and miserably cold. Now {{this whole}} thing was a {{practical}} joke, and the robbers were personal friends of ours in disguise, and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the whole operation, listening. Mike knew all this, and was in the joke, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> nothing of it. To me it was most uncomfortably genuine. When we had stood {{there in the middle of}} the road five minutes, like a couple of idiots, with our hands aloft, freezing to death by inches, Mike's interest in the joke began to wane. He said: ...|$|R
2500|$|Other {{positive}} reviews included Charles Spencer of The Telegraph, who raved, [...] "this is Lloyd Webber's finest show {{since the}} original Phantom, {{with a score}} blessed with superbly haunting melodies and a yearning romanticism that sent shivers racing down my spine." [...] He gave the show four stars out of five, but cautioned that [...] "The show may ultimately prove too strange, too dark, too tormented to become a massive popular hit, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> its creepy allure will linger potently in the memory when frothier shows have been long forgotten". Paul Callan of the Daily Express also gave the show four stars, writing that Love Never Dies [...] "is an elegant and clever sequel to Phantom and deserves to have the old Adelphi Theatre filled every night with Lloyd Webber's core, usually middle-class, audiences. It is a great night out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emmert himself told ESPN's Bob Ley {{that the}} death penalty was [...] "unequivocally on the table" [...] as one of the {{possible}} sanctions. [...] However, he said, Penn State's swift corrective measures after the scandal broke out in full—including forcing out Spanier and Paterno—were significant factors in ultimately taking the death penalty off the table. [...] "Had Penn State not been as decisive as they were," [...] Emmert said, [...] "I don't know what the outcome would have been, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> it would have been significantly worse." [...] Emmert also repeated Ray's denial that Penn State had been threatened with a multi-year suspension had it not agreed to the penalties, saying there had been [...] "some confusion" [...] about those circumstances. [...] He did say, however, that if Erickson and Penn State had not signed the consent decree, the NCAA would have launched a full-blown infractions investigation that would have had [...] "an unknown outcome." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mayor Dinkins {{was criticized}} {{in the press}} for his administration's {{handling}} of the affair. In his memoir Mayor Dinkins writes, [...] "I was criticized for not crossing the picket line and ending the boycott by example. I was prepared to mediate the dispute, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> my presence would not have helped at that juncture....In this instance I believed that my participation would {{do more harm than}} good." [...] In his memoir Dinkins writes, “It may well be that I waited an overly long time to take this step, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> had faith in the court system and in the rational ability of people to come to satisfactory conclusions among themselves. I may have been wrong on both counts.” ...|$|R
60|$|Whether {{this was}} a real change of {{sentiment}} or only artifice, on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, <b>I</b> know not; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> the latter, resented it, and went no more. Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition, and would have drawn me on again; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> declared absolutely my resolution to have nothing {{more to do with}} that family. This was resented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed, leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.|$|R
60|$|Non. He did indeed, Mr Failer. <b>But</b> {{why should}} <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> him? his {{carriage}} is fair, and his means great; {{he could never}} live after this rate, if it were not.|$|R

6000|$|Osmond {{took a sip}} of a {{glass of}} wine; he looked {{perfectly}} good-humoured. [...] "My dear Amy," [...] he answered, smiling as if he were uttering a piece of gallantry, [...] "I don't know anything about your convictions, <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that they interfere with mine it would be much simpler to banish YOU." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must wear it," [...] {{they told}} me; [...] "why, {{just think of}} going to Washington without a plug-hat!" [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> said no; I would wear a derby or nothing. Why, I believe I could walk along the streets of New York--I never do--but still I think I could--and I should never see a well-dressed man wearing a plug-hat. If I did <b>I</b> should <b>suspect</b> him of something. I don't know just what, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> would <b>suspect</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes! that is {{the usual}} sentiment; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> half <b>suspect</b> {{that it is a}} commonplace, invented to cover our embarrassment under such circumstances; for, after all, [...] "an old friend" [...] so {{situated}} is a person whom we have not seen for many years, and most probably not cared to see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, indeed, {{might have}} been useful," [...] said Jack, {{examining}} it, [...] "if we had any powder; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> the bow and the sling will prove more serviceable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> {{that in his}} meek way Conrad {{would say}} what he {{believed}} to anybody. I suppose we must regard him {{as a kind of}} crank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{hope the}} eating-house keeper will want but little {{and that he}} may not want that little long,' {{returned}} his companion; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> you've no means of paying for this!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's strange, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>suspected</b> this," [...] the {{surveyor}} rejoined. [...] "Well, I'd {{like you}} to put the contract over. You have done good work up-to-date and I'll risk giving you an order on the pay office. If you'll wait while I get a form, I'll do it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{mischief}} {{was beyond}} all present remedy, when I received {{the news of}} it. Whatever had happened, whatever might happen, I {{made up my mind}} to persist in my resolution of seeing Norah before I did anything else. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> you of being concerned in the disaster which had overtaken me--because I felt positively certain at Aldborough that you and Mrs. Lecount had written to each other. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> Norah. If <b>I</b> lay on my death-bed at this moment I could say with a safe conscience <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> Norah.|$|R
6000|$|... "Christian dog!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You {{thought to}} lead {{me into a}} trap, but you have fallen into one yourself. You {{reckoned}} that I should come alone; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> there was something hidden behind the story of that black, and so brought two of my crew with me. Upon him, men! Cut him down!" [...] So saying, he drew his scimitar, and sprang furiously upon Gervaise. The latter {{stepped back into the}} centre of the gateway, so as to prevent the men, who had also drawn their swords, passing to attack him from behind. He had undone the clasp of his bernouse, and allowed it to fall to the ground as he addressed Hassan, and his long sword flashed in the moonlight as the corsair sprang forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, I {{think they}} are here still," [...] said Bernard. [...] "My friend Wright has gone away {{for a week or}} two, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> the ladies are simply staying at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Patience, masters!" [...] said Frank. [...] "That Jack's is {{somewhat}} of a gnathonic and parasitic soul, or stomach, all Bideford apple-women know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> more than Deus Venter has brought him hither." ...|$|E
60|$|One of its minor tenets {{seemed to}} be that the one thing more sinful than giving an order was obeying it. At least, that was what McGoggin said; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> he had misread his primers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat" [...] [whom God {{wishes to}} destroy, He first makes mad], quoted I to myself beneath my breath.

5000|$|A 1945 {{comment in}} American Notes and Queries offers a {{different}} point of view:Peoria (Ill.) has been an old stand-by with comedians for years—but {{not only because of the}} [...] "O" [...] sound.
