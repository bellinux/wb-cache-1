25|$|As Proto-Norse {{evolved into}} Old Norse, in the 8th century, {{the effects of}} the umlauts seem to have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same over the whole Old Norse area. But in later dialects of the {{language}} a split occurred mainly between west and east as the use of umlauts began to vary. The typical umlauts (for example fylla from *fullijan) were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of the 16th, the I Corps (Zieten's) {{occupied}} that portion of the position which was circumscribed by the villages of Brye, Saint-Amand-la-Haye, Saint-Amand, and Ligny. The four brigades of this corps had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> mixed up together when occupying these villages during the night, which will account in some measure for the promiscuous manner in which their several battalions appear to have been distributed during the battle. The main body of the I Corps was drawn up on the height between Brye and Ligny, and upon which stands the farm and windmill of Bussy (often referred to as the Windmill of Brye), the highest point of the whole position.|$|E

25|$|Dutch is the {{official}} language of the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region (merged to Flanders) and, along with French, an official language of the Brussels-Capital Region. The main Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are Brabantian, West Flemish, East Flemish and Limburgish. All these are spoken {{across the border in}} the Netherlands as well, and West Flemish is also spoken in French Flanders. Some sub-dialects may be quite distant from standard Dutch and not be readily intelligible for other Dutch-speakers. Words which are unique to Belgian Dutch are called belgicisms (as are words used primarily in Belgian French). The original Brabantian dialect of Brussels has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> influenced by French. It is now spoken by a minority in the Capital region since the language of most inhabitants shifted during the Frenchification of Brussels.|$|E
25|$|As {{the island}} {{has always been}} sparsely {{populated}} and there has never <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> logging, much of the original wildlife is intact, including species that have been devastated on the larger islands to the north since their habitation by humans. However, although habitats and wildlife were not threatened by invasive species historically, now there are populations of cats, rats and brushtail possums on the island, {{as well as a}} large population of white-tailed deer, which are hunted for meat and sport, introduced to coastal areas. There is also a small population of red deer confined to the inland areas. Almost all the island is owned by the New Zealand government and over 80 per cent of the island is set aside as the Rakiura National Park, New Zealand's newest national park. Many of the small offshore islands, including the Snares, are also protected.|$|E
500|$|Critics gave The Heart of a Woman {{positive}} reviews, praising its professional qualities. The American Library Association's [...] magazine {{says that}} although Caged Bird {{was the best of}} Angelou's autobiographies, [...] "every book since has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> worth the reading and pondering". Janet B. Blundell writes that the book was [...] "lively, revealing, and worth the reading", but also found it [...] "too chatty and anecdotal". Hagen responded to this criticism by stating that all of Angelou's books consist of episodes connected by theme and character. Sheree Crute, writing for Ms., appreciated the episodic nature of Angelou's writing and praised her for her [...] "wonderfully unaffected story telling skills". Cudjoe called it [...] "the most political segment of Angelou's autobiographical statement".|$|E

It was, {{however, the}} most commonly used and imitated for the 150 years between its first publication and the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary in 1928. Other dictionaries, such as Nathan Bailey's Dictionarium Britannicum, included more words, and in the 150 years preceding Johnson's dictionary about twenty other general-purpose monolingual [...] "English" [...] dictionaries had been produced. However, there was open dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period. In 1741, David Hume claimed: [...] "The Elegance and Propriety of Stile have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> neglected among us. We have no Dictionary of our Language, and scarce a tolerable Grammar." [...] Johnson's Dictionary offers insights into the 18th century and [...] "a faithful record of the language people used".

Mulcahy stated that around 540 pro-Treaty troops were killed between the Treaty's signing and the war's end; the government referred to 800 army deaths between January 1922 and April 1924.

[...] The Evening Transcript wrote that Sexton was [...] "considered one of the most efficient in the country" [...] and opined that he [...] "has been a good coach for Harvard and has developed some excellent teams from very ordinary material."

The change comes following {{the arrival of}} Guy Self (John Michie) and {{it becomes clear that}} the [...] "driven nature" [...] is a family trait. Guy's arrival also makes Zosia's life unstable. Harper explained that [...] "So far she's <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in control and is very alpha for a junior doctor, but we're going to learn that there's more complexity and vulnerability behind the polished exterior." [...] Michie labeled the relationship between Zosia and Guy [...] "strange and dyfunctional". Following the death of Zosia's mother, Guy began drinking and had affairs. This distanced the pair and Guy chose to come to Holby City not only to help his career. Michie said [...] "he wants to retrieve the love of his daughter". This task is made extremely difficult because [...] "she blames him for everything thats wrong in her life." [...] When Guy tries to make amends with Zosia she rejects him and makes it clear she only wants a professional relationship with him. But her animosity towards Guy begins to affect her career progression.|$|E
2500|$|Since its release, The Social Network {{has been}} cited as inspiring {{involvement}} in start-ups and social media. Bob Lefsetz has stated that: “watching this movie {{makes you want to}} run from the theatre, grab your laptop and build your own empire,” noting that The Social Network has helped fuel an emerging perception that “techies have become the new rock stars.” This has led Dave Knox to comment that: “fifteen years from now we might just look back and realize this movie inspired our next great generation of entrepreneurs.” After seeing the movie, Zuckerberg was quoted as saying he is [...] "interested to see what effect The Social Network has on entrepreneurship", noting that he gets [...] "lots of messages from people who claim that they have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> inspired... to start their own company." [...] Saverin echoed these sentiments, stating that the film may inspire [...] "countless others to create and take that leap to start a new business." [...] In one such instance, the co-founders of Wall Street Magnate confirmed that they were inspired to create the fantasy trading community after watching The Social Network.|$|E

Churchill, believing {{them to be}} serious, denounced the idea of [...] "the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country" [...] {{and that he would}} rather be [...] "taken out in the courtyard and shot" [...] himself than partake in any such action. However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions [...] "for political purposes." [...] According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the Livadia Palace, President Roosevelt [...] "said that he had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> struck by the extent of German destruction in the Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago, and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German Army." ...|$|E
