5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen <b>boom</b> <b>operator</b> named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

25|$|The flying boom is a rigid, {{telescoping}} {{tube with}} movable {{flight control surfaces}} that a <b>boom</b> <b>operator</b> on the tanker aircraft extends and inserts into a receptacle on the receiving aircraft. All boom-equipped tankers (e.g. KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender) have a single boom, and can refuel one aircraft at a time with this mechanism.|$|E

500|$|Before {{cementing}} {{his creative}} partnership with Anderson, Hoffman appeared {{in one of}} the year's biggest blockbusters, Twister, playing a grubby, hyperactive storm chaser alongside Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. According to a People [...] survey of Twitter and Facebook users, Twister is the film with which [...] Hoffman is most popularly associated. He then reunited with Anderson for the director's second feature, Boogie Nights, about the Golden Age of Pornography. The ensemble-piece starred Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds; Hoffman played a <b>boom</b> <b>operator,</b> described by David Fear of Rolling Stone as a [...] "complete, unabashed loser", who attempts to seduce Wahlberg's character. Warmly received by critics, the film grew into a cult classic, and it has been cited as the role in which Hoffman first showed his full ability. Fear commended the [...] "naked emotional neediness" [...] of the performance, adding that it made for compulsive viewing. Hoffman later expressed his appreciation for Anderson when he called the director [...] "incomparable".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} the first of the series to {{actively}} feature a member of the documentary crew interacting with the characters on screen; before the episode was aired, showrunner Greg Daniels stated that this episode would begin to reveal who was behind the documentary. Originally, the idea to have a sound man named Brian comfort Pam when she was crying was proposed by former series actress and writer Mindy Kaling. According to an interview with B. J. Novak, she had proposed it during the show's third season. The episode guest stars Chris Diamantopoulos as Brian the <b>boom</b> <b>operator.</b> Brian's character is named after the series' actual boom mic operator, Brian Wittle. Wittle played the part of one of the annoyed parents at Cece's recital. Ben Silverman also appears as Issac, one of Jim's coworkers at Athlead. This marks Silverman's third appearance, after cameoing in the episodes [...] "Here Comes Treble" [...] and [...] "Suit Warehouse".|$|E
500|$|Howard Stern {{played the}} sound {{on his radio}} show several times, {{including}} when Shatner appeared on the show to promote his upcoming television series Iron Chef USA on November 13, 2001. When Stern asked about the sound, Shatner said it had been produced by the <b>boom</b> <b>operator.</b> A similar claim was made on Shatner's website, where the noise was attributed to a squeaky jib. On Conan O'Brien's Late Night program on November 14, Shatner called it [...] "outrageous" [...] that Buckman should assume {{him to be the}} source of the sound rather than Nimoy. O'Brien responded, [...] "You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!" [...] Pressed further by O'Brien on the sound's provenance, Shatner suggested that {{it may have been a}} dog bark or a bird call. According to Jaysen, the sound did not emanate from Shatner, and was most likely caused by cables rubbing against each other while a camera moved. [...] "It was probably some machine that nobody heard", Shatner said in a September 2002 interview. [...] "The controversy is over." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "flying" [...] boom is {{so named}} because flight control surfaces, small movable {{airfoils}} that are often in a V-tail configuration, are used to move the boom by creating aerodynamic forces. They are actuated hydraulically and controlled by the <b>boom</b> <b>operator</b> using a control stick. The <b>boom</b> <b>operator</b> also telescopes the boom to make the connection with the receiver's receptacle.|$|E
2500|$|From 24 October 2006, weekly {{magazine}} New Idea featured {{articles on}} Byrne's autobiography, Not Quite Ripe, which alleged {{that from the}} age of 12 she was introduced to sex, drugs and alcohol on Young Talent Time. The claims were vigorously denied by Young, he stated that Byrne was already 14 when she started and that drugs were not available on set, [...] "Any drug-taking Debra did, she certainly didn't do it on our show." [...] He said no-one on the show was aware of her affair with [...] "Michael", a <b>boom</b> <b>operator</b> ten years her senior.

2500|$|Aerial refueling, [...] also {{referred}} to as air refueling, in-flight refueling (IFR), air-to-air refueling (AAR), and tanking, is the process of transferring aviation fuel from one military aircraft (the tanker) to another (the receiver) during flight.

2500|$|While in contact, the {{receiver}} pilot {{must continue to}} fly within the [...] "air refueling envelope," [...] {{the area in which}} contact with the boom is safe. Moving outside of this envelope can damage the boom or lead to mid-air collision, for example the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash. If the receiving aircraft approaches the outer limits of the envelope, the <b>boom</b> <b>operator</b> will command {{the receiver}} pilot to correct his position and disconnect the boom if necessary.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 January 2007, the KC-767 {{flight test}} {{aircraft}} set a program milestone by making its first hookup with a receiver aircraft, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The [...] "dry contact" [...] transferred no fuel, but {{was intended to}} test the tanker's fifth-generation fly-by-wire telescoping boom. Unlike the KC-135 <b>boom</b> <b>operator,</b> who is prone, the KC-767 operator uses a remote station with a video display. The testing was being done at Edwards Air Force Base, and the test aircraft was destined for Italy once testing was complete.|$|E
