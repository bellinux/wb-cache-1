40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} several topics. First part {{is aimed at}} the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> occurrence in the Karlsbad region and in districts of Sokolov and Cheb in particular. Mapping of the owl occurrences is based on detailed survey of the presumed habitats, e. g. on the investigation of various activity indicators in a studied area. This bird has not been observed in the Sokolov and Cheb districts since 1998. My research demonstrates that <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> is occurring in the Sokolov and Cheb districts again. Next part of the thesis deals with {{the analysis of the}} <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellets found at the roosting places. In another part, analysis of the diet spectrum of the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> is submitted. Yet another part presents results of the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> diet composition based on the pellet analysis. The species of small mammals in <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellets were determined according to their skeletal remnants. Analysis of the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> pellets in the studied area shows that the dominat species in the <b>Barn</b> <b>Owl</b> diet is Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) and subdominant species are the species of the family Shrews (Sorex sp., Crocidura sp., Neomys sp) ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

5|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> {{living in}} {{tropical}} regions can breed {{at any time}} of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals. In temperate climates, nesting seasons become more distinct and there are some seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the rodent abundance cycle. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range, two broods are often raised in a good year.|$|E
5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has a wider {{distribution}} {{than any other}} species of owl. Many subspecies have been proposed over the years but several are {{generally considered to be}} intergrades between more distinct populations. Twenty to thirty are usually recognised, varying mainly in body proportions, size and colour. Island forms are mostly smaller than mainland ones, and those inhabiting forests have darker plumage and shorter wings than those occurring in open grasslands. <b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> range in colour from the almost beige-and-white nominate subspecies, erlangeri and niveicauda, to the nearly black-and-brown contempta.|$|E

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the <b>barn</b> <b>owls.</b> Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The common endemic Fiji goshawk is a {{specialist}} predator {{of small and}} medium-sized birds, and the swamp harrier is also a widespread predator, often taking fledglings. The local subspecies of the peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus nesiotes will hunt finches, but is itself rare and declining. <b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> eat mainly rats, but sometimes take small birds. Rats and mice use Fiji parrotfinch nests, and may be significant predators of the species, and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground. The fan-tailed cuckoo, which has an endemic Fijian subspecies, is a brood parasite, but the parrotfinch {{does not appear to}} be a host of this large cuckoo.|$|E
5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E

50|$|The Minahassa masked owl (Tyto inexspectata), {{also known}} as the Minahassa <b>barn</b> <b>owl,</b> Sulawesi owl or Sulawesi golden owl, is an endemic <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> living on Sulawesi, Indonesia. The name is derived from the Minahassa Peninsula, where it was first {{described}} as a breeding bird; however, it is also known to live in north-central Sulawesi.|$|R
5|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and {{externally}} the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke Strigea strigis, the tape worm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursae of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E
5|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae. <b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E
50|$|Tyto pollens, {{also known}} as the Andros Island <b>barn</b> <b>owl,</b> Bahamian <b>barn</b> <b>owl,</b> Bahamian great owl, or Chickcharney, is an extinct, 1 m tall, burrow-nesting, flightless <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> that lived in the old-growth pineyards (Caribbean Pine forests) of Andros Island in the Bahamas. When the island was colonised by Europeans and their slaves in the 16th century, the owls coexisted with them until the forests were felled.

5|$|The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba) is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of owl {{and one of the}} most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common <b>barn</b> <b>owl,</b> to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical <b>owls</b> (Strigidae). The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.|$|R
40|$|Absolute {{thresholds}} {{and critical}} masking ratios were determined behaviorally for the European <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba guttata). It shows an excellent sensitivity throughout its hearing range {{with a minimum}} threshold of − 14. 2 [*]dB sound pressure level at 6. 3 [*]kHz, {{which is similar to}} the sensitivity found in the American <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba pratincola) and some other owls. Both the European and the American <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> have a high upper-frequency limit of hearing exceeding that in other bird species. Critical masking ratios, that can provide an estimate for the frequency selectivity in the <b>barn</b> <b>owl's</b> hearing system, were determined with a noise of about 0 [*]dB spectrum level. They increased from 19. 1 [*]dB at 2 [*]kHz to 29. 2 [*]dB at 8 [*]kHz at a rate of 5. 1 [*]dB per octave. The corresponding critical ratio bandwidths were 81, 218, 562 and 831 [*]Hz for test-tone frequencies of 2, 4, 6. 3 and 8 [*]kHz, respectively. These values indicate, contrary to expectations based on the spatial representation of frequencies on the basilar papilla, increasing bandwidths of auditory filters in the region of the <b>barn</b> <b>owl's</b> auditory fovea. This increase, however, correlates with the increase in the bandwidths of tuning curves in the <b>barn</b> <b>owl's</b> auditory fovea...|$|R
5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
5|$|Feathers become abraded {{over time}} and all birds need to replace them at intervals. <b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> are {{particularly}} dependent {{on their ability to}} fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{quality in}} <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> eyes was {{measured}} with a standard Tscherning-type wavefront aberrometer. The results revealed that <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> eyes have excellent optical quality. Higher-order aberrations were about 3 -fold lower than {{has been reported in}} human eyes with similar methods and under comparable conditions. The spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF) of the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> was measured in several psychophysical experiments with an orientation discrimination task. As in humans and virtually any other animal, the CSF of the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> rendered the typical band-limited inverted u-shaped function, with attenuated sensitivities for high and low spatial frequencies. Maximal sensitivity of about 20 was at a spatial frequency of about 1 cyc/deg. With a similar discrimination task, rating acuity was measured in a separate behavioral experiment. The results, 3. 7 cyc/deg, are in good agreement with the high-frequency cut-off of the CSF, and put the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> on the very low end of the acuity spectrum compared to other owls and birds. The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> displays discrimination thresholds in psychophysical vernier acuity experiments that are substantially lower than the resolution limit derived from the high-frequency cut-off of the behavioral and electrophysiological CSF. Moreover, the thresholds were also lower than the behaviorally measured grating acuity, and than theoretical values derived from an anatomical study of the bird’s retina. It is concluded, that vernier acuity is a hyperacute percept in the <b>barn</b> <b>owl.</b> Vernier acuity thresholds of the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> seem to be similarly influenced by the choice of stimulus configuration and viewing conditions as it is the case in human observers. Specifically, vernier thresholds were worse in a crowded stimulus situation, and better under binocular viewing conditions. The latter is referred to as binocular summation in human subjects...|$|R
40|$|The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> is a nocturnal hunter, {{capable of}} {{capturing}} prey using auditory information alone [1].
