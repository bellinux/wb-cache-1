50|$|The antenna {{includes}} two conductive spirals or arms, {{extending from the}} center outwards. The antenna may be a flat disc, with conductors resembling a pair of loosely nested clock springs, or the spirals may extend in a three-dimensional shape like a screw thread. The direction of rotation of the spiral defines the direction of antenna polarization. Additional spirals may be included as well, to form a multi-spiral structure. Usually the spiral is cavity-backed, that {{is there is a}} cavity of air or non-conductive material or vacuum, surrounded by conductive walls; the cavity changes the antenna pattern to a unidirectional shape. The output of the antenna is a <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> If one <b>input</b> or output <b>line</b> is desired, for example a coaxial line, then a balun or other device is added to so transform the signals.|$|R
50|$|A {{balanced}} circuit is circuitry {{for use with}} a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> itself. <b>Balanced</b> <b>lines</b> are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two points on two wires. In a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> the two signal lines are of a matched impedance to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced.|$|R
50|$|A <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> is a {{transmission}} line {{consisting of two}} conductors of the same type, and equal impedance to ground and other circuits. There are many formats of <b>balanced</b> <b>lines,</b> amongst the most common are twisted pair, star quad and twin-lead.|$|R

Many researches have proposed various designs of assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> to solve this problem. This research compared straight <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> and u-shaped <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> which both had the same target to minimize the workstations. The result showed that u-shaped <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> provided a better solution than the straight <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> did in number of workstation. Straight <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> utilized rank positional weight (RPW) whereas u-shaped <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> utilized Critical Task Method (CTM).

50|$|Delay {{lines are}} made of lumped {{elements}} of L and C. The parasitic L and the C from the transistors are used for this and usually some L is added to raise the line impedance. Because of the Miller effect in the common source amplifier the input and the output transmission line are coupled. For example, for voltage inverting and current amplifying the input and the output form a shielded <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> The current is increasing in the output transmission line with every subsequent transistor, and therefore less and less L is added to keep the voltage constant {{and more and more}} extra C is added to keep the velocity constant. This C can come from parasitics of a second stage. These delay lines do not have a flat dispersion near their cut off, so it is important to use the same L-C periodicity in the input and the output. If inserting transmission <b>lines,</b> <b>input</b> and output will disperse away from each other.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 50). Much academic {{energy has}} been {{invested in the}} study of optimizing assembly or production lines. The Assembly <b>Line</b> <b>Balancing</b> Problem design problem is an artifact of that work. Theory of Constraints purports that an assembly line that is purposely and strategically unbalanced provides superior performance in terms of predictability and throughput over the traditional <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> This study articulates a custom production line model based on Theory of Constraints and compares its performance to the traditional operations management paradigm, a <b>balanced</b> <b>line.</b> Results show that a purposely unbalanced line provides superior flow of material and greater throughput than the traditional <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> configuration. Additionally the simplified model and approach may be more appealing with respect to the design, development, and computational costs than those required of the conventional <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a stuffing box pressure equalization <b>line</b> (<b>balance</b> <b>line)</b> to lower stuffing box pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump. While this was an acceptable compromise in the 1950 s, {{it is now a}} true waste of very expensive electrical power. The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump. This paper serves to show that, with careful consideration of the effects of <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> removal, pump life can be maintained and efficiency gained...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{intended}} by designers {{that the line}} out of one device {{be connected to the}} <b>line</b> <b>input</b> of another. <b>Line</b> <b>inputs</b> are designed to accept voltage levels in the range provided by line outputs. Impedances, on the other hand, are deliberately not matched from output to input. The impedance of a <b>line</b> <b>input</b> is typically around 10 kΩ. When driven by a line output's usual low impedance of 100 to 600 ohms, this forms a [...] "bridging" [...] connection in which most of the voltage generated by the source (the output) is dropped across the load (the input), and minimal current flows due to the load's relatively high impedance.|$|R

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and professional audio, a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or <b>balanced</b> signal pair is a transmission line {{consisting of two}} conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. The chief advantage of the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a differential amplifier. Common forms of <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> are twin-lead, used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair, used for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to unbalanced lines, such as coaxial cable, {{which is designed to}} have its return conductor connected to ground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground. Balanced and unbalanced circuits can be interconnected using a transformer called a balun.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{explanations}} of <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> assume symmetric (antiphase) signals {{but this is}} an unfortunate confusion—signal symmetry and <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> are quite independent of each other. Essential in a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> is matched impedances in the driver, line and receiver. These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the differential line equally and thus appears as a common mode signal that is removed by the receiver. There are balanced drive circuits that have excellent common-mode impedance matching between [...] "legs" [...] but do not provide symmetric signals. [...] Symmetric differential signals exist to prevent interference to other circuits - the electromagnetic fields are canceled out by the equal and opposite currents. But they are not necessary for interference rejection from other circuits.|$|R
