25|$|The {{stereotype}} {{among most}} Chinese in Canton that all Tanka women were prostitutes was common, leading the government during the Republican era to accidentally inflate {{the number of}} prostitutes when counting, due to all Tanka women being included. The Tanka women were viewed as such that their prostitution activities were {{considered part of the}} normal <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> a commercial trading city. Sometimes the lowly regarded Tanka prostitutes managed to elevate themselves into higher forms of prostitution.|$|E

50|$|Courtly garments, then, {{can be seen}} {{reflecting}} {{something of}} the contemporary fashions of high society, from the expansive skirts and crinolines of the 1850-60s, through the posterior <b>bustles</b> <b>of</b> the 1870s & 80s, right through to the straight gowns of the 1920s.|$|R

Como also hosts a prestigious clay-court tennis tournament every year, the Città di Como Challenger, which attracts many of the world's top players who {{are not involved in}} the concurrent US Open (tennis). Many players have testified that they much prefer playing in the relaxed and friendly Como environs than the hustle and <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. Previous champions include Pablo Carreño Busta, Viktor Troicki and the 2016 champion Kenny de Schepper who once again will be eschewing the US Open to defend his crown.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} Upper Hutt was a rural service town {{supporting}} the surrounding rural farming and forestry community. Serious urbanisation {{of the upper}} Hutt Valley only started around the 1920s but from the late 1940s onwards Upper Hutt's population exploded as people moved from the crowded hustle and <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> inner city Wellington into a more secluded yet sprawling Hutt Valley. In 1950 Trentham Memorial Park was created with an area of almost 50 hectares. In July 1955, the electrification of the railway line from Wellington to Upper Hutt was completed, allowing fast electric multiple unit trains to replace steam- and diesel-electric-hauled carriage trains. Later in November, the 8.8km Rimutaka Tunnel opened, bypassing the Rimutaka Incline {{and most of the}} existing line between Upper Hutt and Featherston, and reducing the time between the two from 2.5 hours to just 40 minutes.|$|E

The multimedia installation, {{which ran}} from November 4, 2009, to March 28, 2010, filled {{a dark and}} empty museum gallery with recorded voices and explosions, along with flashes of light, simulating {{the experience of a}} mortar attack in Iraq. On three walls of the gallery, projectors cast two horizontal rows of windows, creating the illusion that viewers were inside a darkened warehouse. The eight-minute audio track started with the <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> traffic and citizens in an Iraqi city, brought in children’s laughter, and subtly overlapped an excerpt from an Al Jazeera broadcast of President Obama speaking about the need to endure in Iraq. Listeners also noted an Islamic call to prayer, forebodingly drowned out by the approach of a helicopter. Without much warning, soldiers began yelling and shooting. When the gunfire ceased, a mother was heard wailing, and the episode ended in ominous silence (voices recorded for Out of Here belonged to a mixture of Iraqi-Americans, United States soldiers, and actors).|$|E

Preferring solitude to the <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> the dormitories, Amir boarded at a privately-owned home of a Surakartan resident. Later he met several future writers, including Armijn Pane and Achdiat Karta Mihardja; they soon {{found him to be}} a friendly and diligent student with complete notes and a spotless bedroom (sheets folded so well, Mihardja later recalled, that a [...] "lost fly could have easily slid over them"), but also a romantic prone to thinking wistfully beneath the lamplight and isolating himself from his classmates.|$|E

In 1886, her first year in charge, she added Tristan und Isolde to the canon. Amid the <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> the festival Cosima refused to be distracted by the illness of her father, Liszt, who collapsed after attending a performance of Tristan and died several days later. Cosima supervised her father's funeral service and burial arrangements, but refused a memorial concert or any overt display of remembrance. According to Liszt's pupil Felix Weingartner, [...] "Liszt's passing was not of sufficient importance to dim the glory of the Festival, even for a moment".|$|E
500|$|In most households, cooking {{was done}} on an open hearth {{in the middle of}} the main living area, to make {{efficient}} use of the heat. This was the most common arrangement, even in wealthy households, for most of the Middle Ages, where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall. Towards the Late Middle Ages a separate kitchen area began to evolve. The first step was to move the fireplaces towards the walls of the main hall, and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area, often separated from the main building by a covered arcade. This way, the smoke, odors and <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests, and the fire risk lessened. Few medieval kitchens survive as they were [...] "notoriously ephemeral structures".|$|E
500|$|The Times {{said it was}} [...] "a very Sparksian {{undertaking}} – painstaking {{and slightly}} ludicrous – to make a musical about an art-house film director, with a very complicated plot, for the radio (even Rick Wakeman's King Arthur on Ice had something to look at)." [...] It said the orchestral arrangements by Ron Mael were [...] "great, actually, recalling the skyscraper <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> Bernstein and the triumphant fanfares of Michael Nyman", and stated that [...] "the central concept – pursue your own idea of art, regardless of whether anyone will buy it – seems to be their rule of thumb, too. And you can't knock that." [...] The review by Stephen Dalton, also in The Times, found the [...] "modernist musical backdrop" [...] dominated by [...] "electro-orchestral fragments" [...] "less seductive" [...] and, [...] "despite plenty of arch and witty lyrics", regretted the scarcity of [...] "memorable melodies or fully realised songs". Dalton concluded that the work was [...] "not wholly successful, perhaps, but still an alluringly barmy and glamorous affair", and a [...] "fascinating folly from two enduringly inventive oddballs".|$|E

[...] The LRT-1 is aligned in a general north–south direction along over 17.2kilometers (10.7mi) of fully elevated track. [...] From Monumento it runs south above the hustle and <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> Rizal and Taft Avenues along grade-separated concrete viaducts allowing exclusive right-of-way before ending in Baclaran.

[...] Including the extension's two recently opened stations, Balintawak and Roosevelt, the LRT-1 has twenty stations.

500|$|Louise's {{father-in-law}} King Frederick William II {{gave the}} couple Charlottenburg Palace, but {{the crown prince}} and his new wife preferred to live at Paretz Palace, just outside Potsdam, where Louise kept herself busy with household affairs. Paretz {{was far from the}} <b>bustle</b> <b>of</b> court, as the couple were most content in the [...] "rural retirement" [...] of a country life. The marriage was happy, and Louise was well-beloved by the king, who called her [...] "the princess of princesses" [...] and gave her a palace in Oranienburg. The crown princess saw it as her duty to support her husband in all his pursuits, and the couple enjoyed singing together and reading from Shakespeare and Goethe. Louise soon became pregnant, disappointingly giving birth to a stillborn girl on 1 October 1794 at the age of eighteen. Nine healthy children would follow in quick succession, though two died in childhood: Crown Prince Frederick William (1795), Prince William (1797), Princess Charlotte (1798), Princess Frederica (1799), Prince Charles (1801), Princess Alexandrine (1803), Prince Ferdinand (1804), Princess Louise (1808), and Prince Albert (1809). The couple also used the Crown Prince's Palace in the capital.|$|E
