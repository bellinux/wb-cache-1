5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the uprising; at least initially, they simply {{did not have the}} motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> {{his junior}} season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of}} the all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s, Parker {{continued}} {{both his}} {{legal and political}} careers. In 1864, he formally split from the Democratic Party over conflicting opinions on slavery. He ran as a Republican for county prosecutor of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1864, he was serving {{as a member of}} the Electoral College and voted for Abraham Lincoln. In 1868, Parker won a six-year term as judge of the Twelfth Missouri Circuit.|$|E
5|$|Oueddei {{captured}} about 2,500 {{prisoners in}} 1977 and 1978; as a result, the Chadian Armed Forces lost at least 20% of its manpower. In particular, the National and Nomadic Guard (GNN) was decimated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Fada and Faya. Oueddei used these victories to strengthen {{his position in}} the FROLINAT: during a Libyan-sponsored congress held in March in Faya-Largeau, the insurgency's main factions reunited themselves and nominated Oueddei as the secretary-general.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} the fall of Fort Washington, the Patriots {{abandoned}} Fort Lee. Washington and the army retreated through New Jersey and crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania northwest of Trenton, pursued as far as New Brunswick, New Jersey by British forces. After about one month, on the night of December25–26, 1776, Washington crossed the Delaware and defeated the Hessian garrison under the command of Rall at Trenton. Washington went on to defeat the British next at Princeton, which revived the morale of the American army and the colonies affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Fort Washington.|$|E
5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E
60|$|So it was agreed, and Shep and Giant {{hurried off}} without delay, making a wide detour {{through the woods}} and over the rocks.

5000|$|The early church, {{commonly}} called St Bartholomew's, {{adjacent to the}} old village of Boteleigh, was mentioned in the Domesday Book. This church was largely destroyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> a large poplar tree onto the nave resulting in the original capacity of 500 being reduced to {{what had been the}} chancel.|$|R
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1844, Thayer {{left the}} {{lithography}} business {{and was replaced}} by John Bufford, a lithographer who worked for Thayer in Boston from 1939 through 1844. Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own firm in New York under the title Bufford Lithographer. By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford Lithographer so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of the fall of 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of Happiness is the only Ives' game to list Bufford Lithographer. Green was again used on one of the litho stones but the end space was a green circle. The other litho stone printed black.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} February 1962 and cost NOK3.2 million. The runway was {{completed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> that year, but {{other parts of}} the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first a shed was used as terminal.|$|E
5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1976 {{the project was}} building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; {{the first draft of}} the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E
60|$|The {{dispersion}} of the idlers {{on the pavement}} was accelerated, and the footman's imaginary description of the proceedings then in progress at Mr. Thorpe's was cut short, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> a heavy shower. The frost, after breaking up, had been succeeded that year by prematurely mild spring weather--April seemed to have come a month before its time.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Halladale was <b>the</b> seventh vessel in {{a series}} of eight similar iron-hulled sailing ships, all built by Russell & Co and all named after waterfalls in Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Halladale was preceded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Clyde (1878), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Bruar (1879), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Dee (1882), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Afton (1882), <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Foyers (1883) and <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Earn (1884). <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Halladale was {{followed}} by a sister ship, <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Garry (1886). <b>The</b> <b>Falls</b> <b>of</b> Clyde is afloat today and is a major attraction at the Hawaii Maritime Center in Honolulu.|$|R

5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front {{temporarily}} stabilised, Napoleon committed {{his last}} reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard infantry. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, {{was intended to}} break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although {{it is one of}} the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the Old Guard. Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the allied line.|$|E
50|$|II.13, Ille et nefasto te posuit die... - A Narrow Escape -This ode {{owes its}} origin to Horace's narrow escape from sudden death <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> a tree on his Sabine estate. (This same event is also alluded to in Odes, II.17 line 28 and III.4 line 27.) After expressing his indignation against {{the person who}} planted the tree, he passes to a general {{reflection}} on the uncertainty {{of life and the}} realms of dark Proserpine.|$|R
60|$|As they {{advanced}} it {{soon became}} evident that the scene of volcanic activity was not so far distant as the island of Java, for the air was frequently darkened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> volcanic dust which covered the land with a greyish powder. As, however, at least sixteen volcanoes have been registered in the island of Sumatra, and there are probably many others, {{it was impossible to}} decide where the scene of eruption was, that caused those signs.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{carried away}} the {{striking}} {{of the great}} multitude of city church clocks, for those lay to leeward of them; but there were bells to windward that told them of its being One--Two--Three.

5|$|Other {{actions taken}} at the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela {{had helped}} create, {{called for the}} {{nationalisation}} of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela {{would have preferred to}} develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing was done <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations {{of a handful of}} new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
50|$|Tree {{competition}}: In FORMIND, {{the competition}} between individual trees is threefold. First, tree growth is mainly driven by light. Large trees in a patch receive most of the incoming radiation and gradually shade smaller trees, causing asymmetric light competition. Second, trees compete symmetrically for space. Trees in crowded patches are thinned by increasing mortality. Third, between neighboring patches, <b>the</b> gap created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> large trees increases the local mortality rates. Furthermore, seed dispersal from mother trees leads to interactions among patches.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{there was a}} crash like the loudest thunder, and a {{momentary}} glare as of the brightest noon-light, which was followed by intense darkness, while the garden was shaken as if by an earthquake.
