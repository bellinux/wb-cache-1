Ethenzamide was found to possess a specific suppressive effect on the gastric damage induced by aspirin. Such effect could not be demonstrated in analgesic agents such as salicylamide, <b>bucetin,</b> acetaminophen and phenacetin. The combination of aspirin with ethenzamide had a potentiating effect on analgesic activity and reduced motor incoordination and loss of righting reflex. We calculated the safety margins of various ratios of combinations and concluded that the best was aspirin and ethenzamide at a ratio of 2 : 3. The general principle in considering drug combinations containing two or more in gredients is to evaluate not only the enhancement of the main effect and/or the magnification of the pharmacological spectrum of each ingredient but also the usefulness of the combi nation from the standpoint of total effect. We further propose that this principle should include increasing the safety margin so that drug combinations have greater safety margins than do the ingredients as single entities (1, 2, 3). Aspirin although in wide use does induce gastrointestinal damage. As such an untoward effect often limits extensive clinical application, we searched for a compound which would enhance the usefulness of aspirin when used in combination with other agents.
