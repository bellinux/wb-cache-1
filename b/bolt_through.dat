The lightning bolt skull {{can be found}} on the cover of the album Steal Your Face (1976), and the image is sometimes known by that name. It was designed by Owsley Stanley and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band's equipment.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} about exactly how Jones died. [...] Massena Jones, (former postmaster of Vaughan {{and director of the}} now-closed museum there), said [...] "When they found Jones, according to Uncle Will Madison (a section hand who helped remove Jones' body from the wreckage), he had a splinter of wood driven through his head. Now this is contrary to most of the stories, some of which say he had a <b>bolt</b> <b>through</b> his neck, some say he was crushed, some say he was scalded to death." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Model 620A began {{production}} in 1940. [...] The main {{difference between the}} 620 and the 620A was how the stock attaches. [...] The 620A used a long draw <b>bolt</b> <b>through</b> {{the end of the}} stock and did away with the receiver and trigger plate tangs used on the 620. [...] Without the trigger tang, a flat main spring had no place to attach and the 620A had a shortened trigger housing using a coil main spring. [...] Civilian production of the Model 620A halted during World War II but continued afterwards until 1955.|$|E

2500|$|Kirby {{moved on}} to comic-book {{publisher}} and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of Blue <b>Bolt</b> <b>through...</b> about 25 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Next Day {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream critics, the album {{has received a}} metascore of 81, based on 44 reviews. Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, gave the album a five-star review, calling it a [...] "bold, beautiful and baffling electric <b>bolt</b> <b>through</b> its own mythos". Andy Gill, in another five-star review for The Independent, praised the album as [...] "the greatest comeback album in rock'n'roll history", adding that the work is [...] "as good as anything he's made". The Guardian awarded the album four stars, deeming it [...] "thought-provoking, strange and filled with great songs". Time Out London gave the album a positive notice, praising it as an [...] "intelligent, memorable and even a little provocative" [...] addition to Bowie's discography. In a review for BBC Music, Jude Clarke wrote that The Next Day [...] "is a triumphant, almost defiant, return. Innovative, dark, bold and creative, it's an album only David Bowie could make". In a review rated 8 out of 10, NME said that [...] "rather than reinventing Bowie, [...] absorbs his past and moves it on". The Quietus wrote a positive review and concluded: [...] "so {{more than half the}} album is fantastic, and the rest is very, very strong." [...] At Q, Andrew Harrison evoked that the release [...] "feels like a dam bursting", and this is because the album [...] "is a loud, thrilling, steamrollingly confident rock and roll album full of noise, energy, and words that [...] if as cryptic as ever they were [...] sound like they desperately need to be sung." [...] One of the few negative reviews to emerge from the United Kingdom was in The Wire. Mark Fisher called The Next Day an album of [...] "quotidian mediocrity", saying it was entirely undeserving of its wide acclaim and that the [...] "wave of hyperbole it generated point to a wider malaise in contemporary music" [...] because it proved that anything of low artistic merit could achieve success via [...] "artfully timed PR".|$|E

I dropped the sack on the sofa with a gasp, drew back the yellow curtains of the bed, looked out of the porthole at the lights of Naples, and sighed with relief.

While she watched, the herd spread, grew less dense, and stragglers appeared to be about to <b>bolt</b> <b>through</b> the line of mounted cowboys.|$|E

It has only taken us a day's work to make the shed; and though we laughed at your idea at first, I think now that the day has been well spent in getting them up such a good shelter. Jerry has got the big pail boiling over his fire, and we will put in a few handfuls of the flour we brought down.
