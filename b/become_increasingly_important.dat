5|$|Since {{then the}} role that {{telecommunications}} has played in social relations has <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important.</b> In recent years, the popularity of social networking sites has increased dramatically. These sites allow users {{to communicate with each}} other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to courtship.|$|E

5|$|The men's hammer throw {{became an}} Olympic event in 1900 but the women's event – using a 4kg (8.82lb) weight – was not widely competed until much later, finally {{featuring}} on the women's Olympic programme in 2000. The distances thrown by male athletes became greater from the 1950s onwards {{as a result}} of improved equipment using the denser metals, a switch to concrete throwing areas, and more advanced training techniques. Professional hammer throwers as historically large, strong, sturdy athletes. However, qualities such as refined technique, speed and flexibility have <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> in the modern era as the legal throwing area has been reduced from 90 to 34.92 degrees and throwing technique involves three to four controlled rotations.|$|E

5|$|Dorset has {{a varied}} {{landscape}} featuring broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone ridges and low-lying clay valleys. Over half {{the county is}} designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline {{is part of the}} Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to one of Europe's largest outdoor shows. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.|$|E

25|$|Economically, {{the area}} has grown around {{resource}} extraction, specifically farming, logging and gravel mining. Much of the Fraser Valley's land base is within the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). The balance, not privately owned is in Crown Lands.

Kuwaiti islands are important breeding areas for four species of tern and the socotra cormorant.|$|E
25|$|Vaccine {{production}} techniques are evolving.

Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century saw {{much change}} in Alderney, from the {{building}} of the airport in the late 1930s to the death of the last speakers of the island's Auregnais language, a dialect of the Norman language. The economy has gone from depending largely on agriculture to earning money from the tourism and finance industries. E-commerce has <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important,</b> and the island hosts the domain name registry for both Bailiwicks and dozens of gambling website operators. Alderney has a full regulatory authority in operation.|$|E
25|$|In {{domestic}} affairs King strengthened the Liberal policy {{of increasing the}} powers of the provincial governments by transferring to the governments of Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan the ownership of the crown lands within those provinces, as well as the subsoil rights; these in particular would <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important,</b> as petroleum and other natural resources proved very abundant. In collaboration with the provincial governments, he inaugurated a system of old-age pensions based on need. In February 1930, he appointed Cairine Wilson as the first female senator in Canadian history.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Gerngross {{became one of}} the first vocal critics of {{biobased}} processes. By using life cycle assessment tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important,</b> but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1818, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was {{appointed}} Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at Bencoolen. Raffles {{believed that the}} British should {{find a way to}} challenge the dominance of the Dutch in the area. The trade route between China and British India passed through the Malacca Strait, and with the growing trade with China, that route would <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important.</b> However, the Dutch had tight control over the trade in the region and intended to enforce the exclusive rights of its company ships to trade, and that trade should be conducted at its entrepot Batavia. British trading ships were heavily taxed at Dutch ports, stifling British trade in the region.|$|E
25|$|Fisher saw {{the need}} to improve the range, {{accuracy}} and rate of fire of naval gunnery, and was an early proponent of the use of the torpedo, which he believed would supersede big guns for use against ships. As Controller, he introduced torpedo boat destroyers as a class of ship intended for defence against attack from torpedo boats or submarines. As First Sea Lord, he was responsible for the construction of , the first all-big-gun battleship, but he also believed that submarines would <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> and urged their development. He was involved with the introduction of turbine engines to replace reciprocating engines, and the introduction of oil fuelling to replace coal. He introduced daily baked bread on board ships, whereas when he entered the service it was customary to eat hard biscuits, frequently infested by biscuit weevils.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, Mindfulness and mindfulness-based {{programs}} have <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> <b>important</b> to Westerners {{and in the}} Western medical and psychological community {{as a means of}} helping people, whether they be clinically sick or healthy. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who founded the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program in 1979, has defined mindfulness as 'moment to moment non-judgmental awareness.' Several methods are used during time set aside specifically for mindfulness meditation, such as body scan techniques or letting thought arise and pass, and also during our daily lives, such as being aware of the taste and texture of the food that we eat. Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.|$|E
