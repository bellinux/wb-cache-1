BARC and DBARC technology minimize the reflection of light from the substrate when developing the photomask. Light that is used to develop the photomask can reflect back from the substrate and compromise feature contrast. Controlling interference from reflected light results in the etching of a sharper line with less variability. DBARC uses anti-reflective coatings on the substrate that can be removed from the substrate as the novolak resin is dissolved off after photoimaging.|$|E

First, a material compatible with IC processing was chosen. Second, simulation was performed to determine the optimum optical properties of the material, where the materials extinction coefficient, and film thickness were varied to produce zero substrate reflectivity. Third, the stochiometry of the material was varied through experimentation to produce a film with the index of refraction and extinction coefficient {{as close as possible to}} the simulation results. Fourth, the results of step three were used in simulation to re-determine the film thickness required to produce zero reflectivity at the substrate. The methodology was implemented and a SixNy BARC was designed for RIT’s G-Line (436 nm) process. The applicability of the design method to any exposure wavelength is demonstrated by designing an I-Line BARC concurrently. The film conformality of organic and inorganic BARCs were compared...|$|E

40|$|Double {{patterning}} {{is regarded}} as a potential candidate to achieve the 32 nm node in semiconductor manufacturing. A key problem for a standard litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE) double patterning process is to evaluate and tackle the impact of the wafer topography resulting from the hardmask pattern on the second lithography step. In this paper, we apply rigorous electromagnetic field (EMF) solvers to investigate the wafer topography effects. At first, the studied 3 D mask is split into two masks. The topography resulting from the exposure with the first split mask is described by a patterned hardmask. Based on that, the <b>bottom</b> <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating</b> (BARC) thickness of the second wafer stack is optimized. Alternatively, a two beam interference and the full diffraction spectrum of the second mask are used as the illumination of the wafer stacks, respectively.

40|$|Standing wave {{effects have}} been seen {{throughout}} the history of microlithography. Due to standing wave effects, the line width control of imaged lines in photoresist is compromised. A technology that has emerged as strong solution for the reduction of standing wave effects is a <b>Bottom</b> <b>Antireflective</b> <b>Coating</b> (BARC) that is deposited onto the wafer before the photoresist deposition. By reducing the substrate reflectivity, the standing wave effects can also be reduced dramatically. The 193 nm photoresist and the bi-layer BARC films were characterized and then optimized to reduce standing wave effects within the 193 nm photoresist. A bi-layer BARC film configuration that reduces the reflectivity to less than 1 % for both of the experimental numerical aperture settings of 1. 05 NA and 1. 3 NA is the goal of this project and was achieved in the RIT SMFL cleanroom. Also, a single-layer BARC system was designed to reduce substrate reflectivity to less than 1 % at a setting of 1. 05 NA. This single-layer design was used as the control experiment or baseline to prove that a bi-layer BARC design is much more efficient than a single-layer BARC system. Simulations were conducted for the design of the multi-layer lithography systems using ILSim 1. 0, an interferometric lithography simulation software as well as a simulation program on the JA Woolam Co., Inc. Variable Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometer (VASE), which was also used to characterize the 193 nm DUV resist. The simulations are run by utilizing the refractive indexes (n) and the extinction coefficients (k) of the films being used, which are the optical characteristics of the films. Imaged lines and spaces were then exposed for each of the two designed film stacks and at the two NA settings as stated above. Imaged lines of 45 nm and 35 nm were obtained at 1. 05 NA and 1. 3 NA, respectively, for the bi-layer system, while only 45 nm lines could be obtained with the single-layer BARC system. Since the project objectives and goals were reached, a brief proposal to push the limits of the bi-layer BARC system to 1. 5 NA is suggested...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} of {{optoelectronics}} a common barrier has been integrating logic and device circuits on a single substrate, as it was generally only possible to optimize the device for the logic, or the optoelectronic device at hand. However, a new approach that uses metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) enables the growth of Ill-V semiconductors on silicon substrates. The fact that 111 -V semiconductors can now be integrated within the current silicon CMOS processes may allow new possibilities. An approach to investigate the feasibility of this process has been investigated. The enabler to integrate HI-V is an innovative approach called aspect ratio trapping (ART) developed by Amberwave. This method {{involves the use of}} oxide trenches to trap defects in a buffer region during crystal growth (Figure 1). The growth process is a selective growth that only occurs on silicon and this process. ART on Ill-V’s only works well with a ratio greater than 2 : 1 for oxide thickness to patterned oxide opening. The objective of this project is to develop a process to build these structures at HIT, perform a growth in Amberwave’s reactor, and then characterize the film. In the future, HIT may also become involved in the Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process for these structures. A mask was designed with four different pitches to characterize different density of features (fig. 5). Text labels were also added on the mask so that one could optically determine the pitch and in addition the reticle had labels that describe the relative field position to be used for CMP characterization. In {{order to be able to}} pattern the submicron features with a positive tone resist, a <b>bottom</b> <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating</b> (BARC) donated by Brewer Science was used to increase the process window in which a useable image was present. The thickness of this layer was tuned specifically to minimize the substrate reflection. By optimizing film thickness parameters and setting the focus near the bottom of the resist, this yielded much greater process latitude. After this the patterns were etched using the P 5000 ’s magnetically enhanced etch chamber, the etched features were imaged a new Zeiss SEM at University of Rochester and the 3 : 1 etched features yielded acceptable profiles (fig. 10). In order to prepare patterned wafers here at HIT, the level of contamination in the process and toolset at HIT must to be characterized. The main concern is to not contaminate the growth chamber that Amberwave will be using to perform the growth of the semiconductor materials. A method of metals analysis called vapor phase decomposition-inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (VPD ICP MS) was utilized as a surface contamination metric. After sending the samples to ChemTrace, it was determined that an RCA would dramatically reduce the surface contaminates present on the wafer to acceptable levels for the MOCVD reactor (fig. 6). Interesting future projects include building and characterizing a GaAs laser. Another appealing project involves building silicon drive transistors connecting them to GaAs tunneling or memory devices. It was shown that the pattern transfer portion is indeed possible at HIT and this project has set the stage for future projects regarding aspect ratio trapping...|$|E

Polymeric-like carbon (PLC) and hydrogenated diamond-like carbon films were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) was deposited by the filtered cathodic vacuum arc technique. Those three different amorphous carbon structures were individually applied as single antireflective coatings on conventional (polished and texturized) p-n junction crystalline silicon solar cells. Due to their optical properties, good results were also obtained for double-layer antireflective coatings based on PLC or ta-C films combined with different materials. The results are compared with a conventional tin dioxide (SnO(2)) single-layer <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating</b> and zinc sulfide/magnesium fluoride (ZnS/MgF(2)) double-layer antireflective coatings. An increase of 23. 7 % in the short-circuit current density, J(sc), was obtained using PLC as an <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating</b> and 31. 7 % was achieved using a double-layer of PLC with a layer of magnesium fluoride (MgF(2)).

40|$|Soft X-ray imager mirrors {{have been}} designed, {{calibrated}} and fabricated at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and characterized at the Advanced Light Source for their performance between 200 and 1300 eV. The mirrors are {{coated with a}} multilayer coating consisting of 70 bilayers of W/ SiC. The mirrors are to reflect at 22. 5 deg from grazing angle at 1. 50 nm wavelength and {{the width of the}} reflectivity peak should be at least 1. 3 %. Also, the mirrors should be non-reflective elsewhere. Our multilayer design was optimized to satisfy these requirements. The coating is very challenging since the individual layer thicknesses need to be less than 1 nm thick and reproducibility from layer to layer is crucial. To minimize the second harmonic peak we designed a multilayer with {Gamma} = 0. 5 (W and SiC layer thicknesses are the same). This way we end up with a mirror that has only the 1 st and 3 rd harmonic peak as shown in Figure 1. To suppress reflectivity outside the first peak we used our novel approach, an <b>antireflective</b> <b>coating.</b> Modeling predicted substantial reduction in reflectivity, especially for lower energies as shown in Figure 1. The experimental results of the soft x-ray imager mirror as measured at the ALS are shown in Figure 2 (log and linear scale). The energy range over which we measured the reflectivity is limited by the beamline hardware. This plot is a compilation of about six scans over different energy ranges using different gratings, filters and order sorter positions. The measured reflectivity of the peak at 1. 505 nm is 4. 3 % with the peak width of 0. 028 nm or 1. 8 %, satisfying the specs on the peak width.
