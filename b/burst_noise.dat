Both forms of degradation follow the 11 year solar cycle and are a maximum at sunspot maximum although they can occur at any time.

Scintillation occurs most frequently at tropical latitudes where it is a night time phenomenon. It occurs less frequently at high latitudes or mid-latitudes where magnetic storms can lead to scintillation. In addition to producing scintillation, magnetic storms can produce strong ionospheric gradients that degrade the accuracy of SBAS systems.|$|E

An interleaved line has a depth, usually 8 to 64, which describes how many Reed-Solomon codewords are accumulated before they are sent.

Interleaving adds latency as all the packets have to first be gathered (or replaced by empty packets) and they, of course, all take time to transmit. 8 frame interleaving adds 5 ms round-trip-time, while 64 deep interleaving adds 25 ms.

40|$|The {{computational}} role of cortical layers within auditory cortex {{has proven}} difficult to establish. One {{hypothesis is that}} interlaminar cortical processing might be dedicated to analyzing temporal properties of sounds; if so, then there should be systematic depthdependent changes in cortical sensitivity to the temporal context in which a stimulus occurs. We recorded neural responses simultaneously across cortical depth in primary auditory cortex and anterior auditory field of CBA/Ca mice, and found systematic depth dependencies in responses to second-and-later <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> in slow (1 – 10 bursts/s) trains of <b>noise</b> <b>bursts.</b> At all depths, responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> within a train usually decreased with increasing train rate; however, the rolloff with increasing train rate occurred at faster rates in more superficial layers. Moreover, in some recordings from mid-to-superficial layers, responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> within a 3 – 4 bursts/s train were stronger than responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> in slower trains. This non-monotonicity with train rate was especially pronounced in more superficial layers of the anterior auditory field, where responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> {{within the context of}} a slow train were sometimes even stronger than responses to the <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> at train onset. These findings may reflect depth dependence in suppression and recovery of cortical activity following a stimulus, which we suggest could arise from laminar differences in synaptic depression at feedforward and recurrent synapses...|$|R

The sources of actual noise may be not only a con-tinuous noise but also a <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> and a mixture of them. We present both noise robust techniques against continuous noise and <b>burst</b> <b>noise.</b> The algo-rithm for compensating continuous noise influences is based on RSF (Running Spectrum Filtering) and DRA (Dynamic Range Adjustment). RSF focuses on modulation spectrum and extracts speech compo-nents with FIR filtering. DRA normalizes maximum amplitudes of cepstrum. The compensation for <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> influences is performed by <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> skipping algorithm. It skips <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> periods and links speeches before and after those periods.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> {{cancellation}} scheme for single carrier block transmission with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) systems. In the proposed scheme, we simply force the received signals which are collapsed by the <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> to be zeros. Since this processing introduces an inter-symbol interference (ISI), which cannot be effectively equalized with a conventional frequency domain equalizer (FDE), we also propose an ISI cancellation scheme. We firstly generate a replica signal of the ISI using tentative decisions {{in order to}} make the defective channel matrix to be circulant, and then the conventional frequency domain equalization is performed to compensate the ISI. Also, we have utilized newly derived minimum mean–square–error (MMSE) based FDE weights for the replica signals generation. Computer simulation results show that the proposed <b>burst</b> <b>noise</b> cancellation scheme with the ISI cancellation can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance even when almost 10 % of the received signals are collapsed by the <b>burst</b> <b>noise.</b> I...|$|E

40|$|In {{adaptive}} filtering, undetected <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> often {{disturb the}} adaptation and {{may lead to}} instabilities and divergence of the adaptive filter. The sensitivity against <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> increases with the convergence speed of the adaptive filter and limits the performance of signal processing methods where fast convergence is required. Typical applications which are sensitive against <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> are adaptive beamforming for audio signal acquisition or acoustic echo cancellation, where <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> are frequent due to undetected double-talk. In this paper, we apply double-talk resistant adaptive filtering [2] using a non-linear optimization criterion to adaptive beamforming in the discrete Fourier transform domain for bin-wise adaptation controls. We show the efficiency of double-talk resilient adaptive filtering for a generalized sidelobe canceller for speech and audio signal acquisition. The improved robustness leads to faster convergence, to higher noise-reduction, and to a better output signal quality in turn...|$|R

At tropical latitudes, the principal source of interference in the frequency range from 0. 1 to 10 MHz is the burst form of atmospheric radio noise. The structure of a burst shows several approximately rectangular pulses of random amplitude, duration and frequency of recurrence. The influence of the noise on data communication can only be examined when {{the value of the}} number of pulses crossing a certain amplitude threshold per unit time of the <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> is known.

40|$|The {{perception}} of modulation of a tone {{interrupted by a}} <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> was investigated. The tone and its modulation were perceived as continuing through the noise. In experiment 1, subjects rated the similarity of an uninterrupted tone and a tone interrupted by noise, {{in terms of the}} perceived level and modulation depth of the sinusoidal carrier. The values of these parameters in the central portion of the uninterrupted tone were systematically varied. Both amplitude and frequency modulation (AM and FM) were used. The results indicated that the perceived level and modulation depth of the carrier did not change greatly during the <b>noise</b> <b>burst.</b> When the modulation rate differed before and after the <b>noise</b> <b>burst,</b> the modulation-rate transition was perceived to occur {{near the end of the}} <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> for the FM stimuli. Hence, for these stimuli, the continuity illusion appears to be dominated by the portion of the tone before, rather than after, the interruption. Results for the AM stimuli showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. Experiment 2 used forced-choice tasks to evaluate the ability to detect a change in the ongoing phase of AM and FM following interruption by a <b>noise</b> <b>burst.</b> The results confirmed earlier findings for FM tones, and extended them to AM tones, showing that listeners lost track of the phase of the modulation, even though the modulation was perceived as continuous. © 2005 Elsevier B.
