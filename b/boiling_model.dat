40|$|In {{order to}} enhance the {{prediction}} capability of subcooled boiling flows, an advanced wall <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> and mechanistic bubbles size model were examined using a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code. The advanced wall <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> consists of a mechanistic bubble departure size model (Klausner et al., 1993), Hibiki et al. ’s (2009) active nucleate site density model and Cole’s (1960) bubble departure frequency model. To ensure a wide range applicability of the advanced wall <b>boiling</b> <b>model,</b> each sub-model was evaluated separately {{over a wide range}} of flow conditions in pressure, temperature and flow rate. Finally, the advanced wall <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> was implemented into the commercial CFD code STAR-CD via user FORTRAN files. For an accurate prediction of bubble size which governs interfacial transfer terms between the two phases, the Sγ model (Lo et al., 2009) was also applied. The benchmark calculation against the DEBORA subcooled boiling data confirms that the new mechanistic wall boiling and bubble size models follow well the tendency on the change of flow conditions and are applicable to the wide range of flow conditions that are expected in the nominal and postulated accidental conditions of a nuclear power plant. 1...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} actual CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) {{approaches to}} subcooled boiling and investigates their capability {{to contribute to}} fuel assembly design. In a prototype version of the CFD code CFX a wall <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> is implemented based on a wall heat flux partition algorithm. It can be shown, that the wall <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> is able to calculate the cross sectional averaged vapour volume fraction of vertical heated tubes tests with good agreement to published experimental data. The most sensitive parameters of the model are identified. Needs for more detailed experiments are established which are necessary to support further model development. The model is applied for investigation of the phenomena inside a hot channel of a fuel assembly. Here the essential phenomenon is the critical heat flux. Although subcooled boiling represents only a preliminary state towards the critical heat flux occurrence, essential parameters like swirl, cross flow between adjacent channels and concentration regions of bubbles can be determined. By calculating {{the temperature of the}} rod surface the critical regions can be identified which may later on lead to departure from nucleate boiling and possible damage of the fuel pin. The application of up-to-date CFD with a subcooled <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> for the simulation of a hot channel enables the comparison and the evaluation of different geometrical designs of the spacer grids of a fuel rod bundle. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{a fusion}} reactor during plasma operation, the heat loads on plasma facing {{components}} {{can be as}} high as 5 MW/m 2 [1], which should be removed by a proper mechanism to prevent the damage of reactor components. In order to handle such high heat fluxes a suitable heat sink with proper thermal hydraulics is required. In the recent past several heat sinks have been proposed; among which the Hypervapotron heat sink, operating in the highly subcooled boiling regime, is considered as one of the potential candidates. In order to accurately predict the performance of the system, a thermal hydraulic analysis is required. This thesis employs a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approach to do the thermal hydraulic analysis of the subcooled flow boiling inside the Hypervapotron channel. For this purpose four boiling models are tested using two commercial CFD codes. The four boiling models tested are Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> [2] available in ANSYS-FLUENT 13, Bergles-Rohsenow (BR) model [3] implemented as an external User Defined Function (UDF) in the FLUENT code, the Rohsenow <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> [4] extended with the capability of transition to film boiling for high heat fluxes available in STAR-CCM+ 7. 02, and finally Transition <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> [4] available in STAR-CCM+ 7. 02. These models are used to test the thermal performance of Hypervapotron using the experimental data (showing the variation of temperature with heat flux) obtained from the experiments conducted at Efremov Institute Russia and Joint European Torus United Kingdom. Simulations were conducted using the above mentioned boiling models, the obtained results were compared against the experimental data and also different boiling models are compared with each other whenever possible to test their applicability. From the simulations conducted on the Hypervapotron geometries it is found that the Transition <b>boiling</b> <b>model</b> can capture the thermal performance (in terms of tracing the experimental data) better than any other model both quantitatively and qualitatively, covering the different boiling regimes shown by the experiments (that is no boiling, nucleate boiling and hard boiling regimes), than the other model...|$|E

40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{video and}} infrared thermography based technique {{has been used}} to obtain detailed and fundamental time- and space-resolved information on pool boiling heat transfer. The work is enabled by recent advances in heat transfer diagnostics and motivated by increased interest in the enhancement of heat transfer for applications such as micro-electronics, space heat-transfer systems, and advanced nuclear reactors. This study critically examined the fundamental processes occurring during nucleate boiling, critical heat flux, and rewetting on thin-film heating elements. A significant focus of the work was to investigate and explain the modification of these heat transfer phenomena through the addition of silica and diamond nanoparticles to the working fluid. Bubble departure diameter and frequency, growth and wait times, and nucleation site density were measured for every nucleation site during nucleate pool boiling at multiple superheats. The data were compared with decades-old and poorly-validated models and correlations, and were used to evaluate the relative contribution of the superheated liquid layer and microlayer evaporation to bubble growth. Deterioration in nucleate boiling heat transfer of water-based nanofluids was observed. It was determined that a reduction in the static contact angle, caused by nanoparticle deposition on the surface during boiling, created a larger energy barrier for nucleation, which in turn reduced bubble departure frequency and nucleation density, thus resulting in a reduced heat transfer coefficient. (cont.) Critical heat flux enhancement in nanofluids of up to 100 % was experimentally observed. The cause of this enhancement was determined to be the decreased static contact angle of nanofluid boiled surfaces. The increased wettability modified the growth of bubbles prior to CHF and promoted rewetting of hotspots at CHF. In parallel quenching tests, rewetting temperatures and velocities were simultaneously measured for the first time. Surfaces that had been pre-boiled in nanofluids were found to have significantly higher rewetting temperatures and velocities than clean surfaces. Interpretation of the experimental data was conducted with consideration of the governing surface parameters and existing models.

In addition to macroscopic parameters like the average heat transfer coefficient and critical heat flux [CHF] value, more fundamental parameters such as the bubble departure diameter and frequency, growth and wait times, and nucleation site density [NSD] were directly measured for a thin, resistively heated, indium-tin-oxide surface deposited onto a sapphire substrate. Consistent with other nanofluid studies, the nanoparticles caused deterioration in the nucleate boiling heat transfer (by as much as 50 %) {{and an increase in}} the CHF (by as much as 100 %).

The retention times of these compounds were correlatedwith its LSER descriptors by multi-linear regression analysis (MLRA). The best one and five parameter multilinearregression models showed good predictive ability. The five parameters model showed more acceptablepredictive ability than one parameter model {{particularly with the}} aromatics. The predictive ability of the obtainedmodels was tested towards some unknown substituted benzenes. The previous published <b>boiling</b> point <b>model</b> wasused as confirmed model for more accurate retention time's prediction...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews recent {{experimental}} work on intube flow boiling {{of carbon dioxide}} and describes the updated flow <b>boiling</b> heat transfer <b>model</b> and flow pattern map proposed by Cheng, Ribatski, Wojtan and Thome [1] for evaporation of carbon dioxide in small diameter horizontal tubes. This new flow <b>boiling</b> heat transfer <b>model</b> predicted 76 % of the CO 2 database taken from the literature within ± 30 %. The new model and map are applicable to: tube diameters from 0. 8 to 10 mm, mass velocities from 170 to 570 kg/m 2 s, heat fluxes from 5 to 32 kW/m 2 and saturation temperatures from- 28 °C to 25 °C (reduced pressures from 0. 21 to 0. 87). Simulations of the flow pattern map and heat transfer model are also shown...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe examine two {{distributed}} parameter {{models for}} strings of generators {{connected to a}} wind farm. We show that these <b>models</b> <b>boil</b> down to delay systems either with or without continuous dynamics, {{depending on the type}} of the chosen boundary conditions. We then investigate the differential flatness of the systems...|$|R
