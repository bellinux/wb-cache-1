40|$|This article aims at {{gaining a}} better {{understanding}} of how, in a market environment, categorized actors construct their identity in relation to the category to which they are assigned. Drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted at eBay, we consider how the newly categorized ‘business sellers’ connected eBay’s framing of the category (categorical framing) to their subjective interpretations of it (categorical self). We find that <b>business</b> <b>sellers</b> perceived varying levels of discrepancy between categorical framing and categorical self, which led them to engage in processes of identification, identity work and disidentification. Based on our findings, we present a framework relating the level of perceived discrepancies to distinctive paths of identification and we draw implications for understanding the interaction of categorization and identification. The framework highlights how feelings of self-enhancement, injustice and alienation intervene in orienting individuals’ paths of identification. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{information}} technology in business-to-business transactions (commonly referred to as B 2 B E-Commerce) has gained {{a lot of attention}} throughout the last years. Even though the euphoria about the possibilities of using electronic media has subsided, IT has subtly altered the way companies do transactions. B 2 B E-Commerce can take many different forms (EDI, E-Shops, etc.). In this research, we focus on Electronic B 2 B Marketplaces. Electronic B 2 B Marketplaces are information systems that bring together several business buyers and <b>business</b> <b>sellers</b> and facilitate their transactions by using electronic communication. Electronic markets have for some time been the object of study of research. Drawing on New Institutionalism, scholars like Thomas Malone argued that electronic markets would encourage a shift towards more market-like coordination of transactions (cf. Malone/Yates/Benjamin 1987). Following their line of arguments would imply concluding that closeness in existing buyer-supplier-relationships should be reduced. Empirical verification of these hypotheses has been limited so far. The question whether the use o...|$|E

40|$|The {{scenario}} of established <b>business</b> <b>sellers</b> utilizing online auction markets to reach consumers and sell new products {{is becoming increasingly}} common. We propose a class of risk management tools, loosely based {{on the concept of}} financial options that can be employed by such sellers. While conceptually similar to options in financial markets, we empirically demonstrate that option instruments within auction markets cannot be developed employing similar methodologies, because the fundamental tenets of extant option pricing models do not hold within online auction markets. We provide a framework to analyze the value proposition of options to potential sellers, option-holder behavior implications on auction processes, and seller strategies to write and price options that maximize potential revenues. We then develop an approach that enables a seller to assess the demand for options under different option price and volume scenarios. We compare option prices derived from our approach with those derived from the Black-Scholes model (Black & Scholes, 1973) and discuss the implications of the price differences. Experiments based on actual auction data suggest that options can provide significan...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} and analytical study which comprises of {{an analysis of}} the rules of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods of four legal systems; Korean law, English law, the U. N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and the E. C. Directive on Certain Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees. The {{purpose of this study is}} to ask whether there is any need to introduce a unified liability system into Korean law and how to achieve the system under the existing law in order to overcome all the complexities caused by the separate existence of the general liability for non-performance and the seller's guarantee liability. A further purpose is to investigate how effectively the rules of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods protect the reasonable expectations of the parties; in particular, the interests of consumers and private sellers which are distinguished from those of commercial buyers and <b>business</b> <b>sellers,</b> respectively, and where the issue is not directly related to the particular interests of consumers or private sellers, the common interests of all the parties. The study is conducted by an internal evaluation within the boundaries of law in a legal context and an external evaluation in light of 'efficiency' as used by economists. It shows, first, that Korean law needs a unified liability system which is based on a contract to resolve the problems originating in the distinction between the general liability as a contractual liability and the seller's guarantee liability as a legal liability. Second, achieving a genuine unified liability system require one's interpretation that rescission and damages in the seller's guarantee liability should be as they are in the general liability. This would settle other problems inherent in the casuistic distinction between the general liability as a fault liability and the seller's guarantee liability as no-fault liability and its consequences in interpreting damages under the seller's guarantee liability. Finally, in what aspects of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods each jurisdiction fails to reflect the interests of consumers and private sellers, and the common interests of all the parties...|$|E

50|$|Similar {{to travel}} agents, wire service affiliates' main {{functions}} are {{to act as}} agents and sell products and services on behalf of local florist suppliers. Unlike other retail <b>businesses,</b> <b>sellers</b> {{are not required to}} keep stock on hand. A flower arrangement or other floral gift is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests the item. The flowers or other floral gift are supplied to them at a discount. The profit is therefore the difference between the advertised price which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it is charged to the agent. This is known as the commission. A wire service affiliate selling agent typically earns 20% of the product and local delivery price, plus services charges. Additionally, many florist wire services pay performance rebates to affiliate resellers.|$|R

First, the issue of ‘services’ is described; next, the enhancement of ‘services’ via value creation is described, along with the progression from supply and demand chains, to value chains, to service value chains, and finally to service value networks. This progression pathway has developed over time, and has enabled ‘service’ and ‘e-service’ businesses to deliver and further develop competitive business solutions. The combinations of integrated, highly competitive, e-supply chains delivering the final ‘services’ suite to the frontline <b>business</b> <b>seller</b> moves the e-supply chain model to a more advanced level. Today, the recent concept of utilizing service value networks offers a key to future competitive solutions. Service value networks house fully integrated e-demand and e-supply chains working in harmony to the deliver both services and e-services. They are also highly agile and offer customer-induced flexible business solutions to customer requests. This chapter highlights the progression to service value networks. In addition it also offers the manager a balanced scorecard structural mechanism via which management controls over e-services and service value networks may be developed and maintained...|$|R
