25|$|The {{courtesy}} campaign {{conducted by}} the STPB was meant to teach Singaporeans to be polite only to tourists {{for the benefit of}} the tourist industry. Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's had followed the courtesy campaigns by the STPB with 'interest and amusement: interest <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> were responsive to the campaign; amusement because no one protested that it was absurd to teach Singaporeans to be polite to tourists’.|$|E

Our intuition says that the particular [...] "labels" [...] actually carry some information about the problem. A simple argument could be used to make this more formal mathematically (e.g. the physics of the problem make it difficult for a flipped coin to land on its side) - perhaps the symmetry would then lie in comparing a [...] "big" [...] coin with a [...] "small" [...] coin.

25|$|A Mediterranean diet {{lowers the}} risk of cancer as does the {{stopping}} of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating H. pylori decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% five-year survival rate globally. This is largely <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> with the condition present with advanced disease.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have argued}} that self-verification {{processes}} are relatively rare, manifesting themselves only among people with terribly negative self views. In support of this viewpoint, critics cite hundreds of studies indicating that people prefer, seek and value positive evaluations more than negative ones. Such skeptical assessments overlook three important points. First, <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> have relatively positive self-views, evidence of a preference for positive evaluations in unselected samples may in reality reflect a preference for evaluations that are self-verifying, because for such individuals self-verification and positivity strivings are indistinguishable. No number of studies of participants with positive self-views can determine whether self-verification or self-enhancement strivings are more common. Second, self-verification strivings {{are not limited to}} people with globally negative self-views; even people with high self-esteem seek negative evaluations about their flaws. Finally, even people with positive self-views appear to be uncomfortable with overly positive evaluations. For example, people with moderately positive self-views withdraw from spouses who evaluate them in an exceptionally positive manner.|$|E
25|$|Anterograde amnesia {{can also}} be caused by alcohol intoxication, a {{phenomenon}} commonly known as a blackout. Studies show rapid rises in blood alcohol concentration over {{a short period of}} time severely impair or in some cases completely block the brain's ability to transfer short-term memories created during the period of intoxication to long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. Such rapid rises are caused by drinking large amounts of alcohol in short periods of time, especially on an empty stomach, as the dilution of alcohol by food slows the absorption of alcohol. Alcohol-related anterograde amnesia is directly related to the rate of consumption of alcohol (and is often associated with binge drinking), and not just the total amount of alcohol consumed in a drinking episode. Test subjects have been found not to experience amnesia when drinking slowly, despite being heavily intoxicated by the end of the experiment. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers. The exact duration of these blackout periods is hard to determine, <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> fall asleep before they end. Upon reaching sobriety, usually after waking, long-term memory creation is completely restored.|$|E

500|$|Some of Douglas' {{stories were}} {{collected}} by University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections: Nine Florida Stories in 1990 and A River In Flood in 1998. McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas' short stories <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> in the 1990s {{were well aware of}} her fame as an environmentalist, but many did not know about her career as a freelance writer. [...] "Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove", McCarthy wrote in the introduction of A River in Flood.|$|E

He said he was fascinated with the industry, the models and their lives outside the ramp walks, saying [...] "I was amazed at the overwhelming attention given to the fashion Industry by the media and the public. I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world was very interesting and intriguing."

Anarky's the hero I want to be if I was smart enough and physically fit enough." [...] Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes {{is a result of}} their political divisions: [...] "In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, they see him as a villain. That is <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live. Anarky certainly does that, and more." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyons once {{stated that}} being a {{politician}} in New York City was like being in business, and New York was like a corporation. He ran his office like a tight ship, but was known to have a humorous side. It was his ability to combine the responsibilities of being in charge with being humorous that made him able to never lose an election in his life. He was annoyed that the comedians of the time only had to mention the Bronx to get a laugh. This was <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> only thought the Bronx was good for its famous Bronx Cheer. He devised a plan to call the Bronx the [...] "Borough of Universities" [...] and to play up that the Bronx Cheer came from the hospitality {{of the founders of}} the Bronx, instead of the common idea that it was just the attitude of the unsociable people of the Bronx. He was once chided by Deputy Mayor Henry Curran for using the word contact as a verb. He then decided he would set up the [...] "Henry Curran University" [...] in order to correct all grammar mistakes made in the city, in an effort to mock the Deputy Mayor. Lyons had his people send grammar corrections to all of the politicians in the city when they made mistakes. At one point he got the New York City Police Chief to apologize for putting up signs that were not incorrect. Despite these lighter moments in office, Lyons was a very hard worker. He would attend up to 10 meetings a night, and was always present at the opening of a new institution in the Bronx. When Long Beach Airport was being built in Queens, Lyons was instrumental in getting it to be named after Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.|$|E

The most obvious is to hit him smartly and with precision on the exact tip of the nose. But if you have scruples (moral or physical) about this course, you may proceed to employ Reason, {{which in this case}} has all the savage solidity of a blow with the fist. It is stupid to say that [...] "most people" [...] are stupid. It is like saying [...] "most people are tall," [...] when it is obvious that [...] "tall" [...] can only mean taller than most people. It is absurd to denounce the majority of mankind as below the average of mankind.|$|E
5000|$|Timed {{melatonin}} administration may {{be effective}} in reducing jet lag symptoms.

6000|$|... § 17. How far Turner {{followed}} it, is {{not easily}} shown; for his finish is so delicate as to be nearly uncopiable. I have just {{said it was not}} possible to finish that ash trunk of his, farther, on such a scale.[42] By using a magnifying-glass, and giving the same help to the spectator, it might perhaps be possible to add and exhibit a few more details; but even as it is, I cannot by line engraving express all that there is in that piece of tree-trunk, on the same scale. I have therefore magnified the upper part of it in fig 4. (Plate 5.), so that the reader may better see the beautiful lines of curvature into which even its slightest shades and spots are cast. Every quarter of an inch in Turner's drawings will bear magnifying in the same way; much of the finer work in them can hardly be traced, except by the keenest sight, until it is magnified. In his painting of Ivy Bridge,[43] the veins are drawn on the wings of a butterfly, not above three lines in diameter; and in one of his smaller drawings of Scarborough, in my own possession, the muscle-shells on the beach are rounded, and some shown as shut, some as open, though none are as large as one of the letters of this type; and yet this is the man who was thought to belong to the [...] "dashing" [...] school, literally <b>because</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> had not patience or delicacy of sight enough to trace his endless detail.|$|E
