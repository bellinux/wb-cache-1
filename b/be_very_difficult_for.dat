5|$|Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig {{election}} victory. In 1833 {{he appointed}} Hogg to a lucrative {{position on the}} royal commission to examine the municipal corporations. Hogg became a fierce critic of the Municipal Corporations Act; he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members, and was {{considered by many to}} be an unusually conservative Whig. His commission work required him to be away from home for an extended period, which proved to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Jane. She knew that Hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married. After receiving his appointment, Hogg finally visited Norton House after a seven-year absence, but his family had not altered their opinion of his relationship with Jane.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the patrol}} boats of Squadron One were an {{essential}} part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams, Commander, MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970. Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use. The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} year 2001–02 {{would prove to}} <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Emirates {{and one of the}} toughest for the airline. Initially sales were affected by a recession and later influenced by the bombing of Colombo Airport. The bombing destroyed three of SriLankan Airlines' twelve aircraft and damaged three other aircraft. A few months later, the September 11 attacks in New York City saw thousands of cancellations and deferments of travel plans. Emirates needed to find funds for a spike in its multibillion-dollar insurance cover due to the events. Seat factors fell considerably and profitability disappeared. The airline announced a recruitment freeze, but did not make any redundancies. The airline also reduced flight frequencies to other destinations. The unstable situation in the region, however, benefited Emirates as international airlines cut flights to Dubai and lowered competition.|$|E
25|$|According to the Erste Group Bank, {{it would}} <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Romania {{to meet this}} 2019 target, not in regards of {{complying}} with the five nominal convergence criteria values, but in regards of reaching some appropriate levels of real convergence (i.e. raising the GDP per capita from 50% to a level above 60% of the EU average) ahead of the euro adoption. The Romanian Central Bank governor, Mugur Isărescu, admitted the target was ambitious, but obtainable if the political parties passed a legal roadmap for the required reforms to be implemented, and clarified this roadmap should lead to Romania entering ERM-2 only on 1 January 2017 so the euro could be adopted {{after two years of}} ERM-2 membership on 1 January 2019. In April 2015, Isărescu stated that the technical requirement for adoption of the euro 1 January 2019 would imply joining ERM-2 at the latest {{in the first half of}} 2016. Ahead of ERM-2 entry, Isărescu argued, Romania needs to conduct monetary adjustments in form of finalizing the process of bringing minimum reserve requirement ratios in line with eurozone levels (a process envisaged to last between 1-1½ year) and to complete major economic policy adjustments: 1) Removing the sources of repressed inflation (i.e. completion of the energy market deregulation), 2) Removing sources of quasi-fiscal deficits (by restructuring loss-making state-owned enterprises), 3) Removing other sources of future budgetary pressures (i.e. the unavoidable expenditures to modernise road infrastructure).|$|E

25|$|On March 14, 2011, the ISU {{published}} {{a statement that}} 2011 Worlds would not be held in Tokyo during the dates originally planned, and that a decision regarding rescheduling or a complete cancellation would be made after further evaluation. The ISU began considering various possibilities, including holding the event in another country. ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta suggested the event could be canceled or postponed until October, with the ISU saying they would make an announcement by March 21. The JSF head, Seiko Hashimoto, said that her federation was hoping to reschedule the event to September or October, but Japanese skating fans felt moving it to another country {{would be a better}} option. Although it would oblige a number of skaters to back out of agreements to appear in skating tours, an important source of income for many, many coaches and officials voiced their preference for April–May, citing greater complications arising from an autumn Worlds. However, others noted it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a new host to organize the event in under a month. Typically, a host country of a World Championships has over two years and the shortest period was in 2000 when France organized the event in seven months. On March 21, the ISU announced that the JSF had relinquished its hosting rights and that it was looking into alternate locations, while noting there would be major logistical challenges to organize the event on short notice. The criteria for new candidate hosts included a start date in April or May, 700 hotel rooms, a television production, and two rinks: A competition rink with a minimum 8000 seats and available from the Thursday early morning through Sunday late evening of the following week, and a practice rink from Friday early morning through Friday late evening of the following week. Local expertise, good transportation infrastructure, and quick visa processing were also important factors. ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta said he would support a bid by the Japanese federation to host the 2015 World Championships. In June 2011, Japan was chosen as host for the 2014 World Championships, at either Tokyo or Saitama, still to be determined.|$|E

500|$|The pair {{discussed}} {{having an}} Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. [...] The lyrics for that scene proved to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Hammerstein to write. [...] He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives {{something about her}} past, and wrote such lyrics as [...] "I was dazzled by the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay" [...] and [...] "The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey)." [...] Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son {{to the court of}} Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. [...] "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. [...] He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. [...] Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. [...] Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. [...] Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, {{and at the end of}} the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. [...] Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on South Pacific, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. [...] It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.|$|E
