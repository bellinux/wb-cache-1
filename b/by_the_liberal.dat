5|$|Since 1905, when Saskatchewan entered Confederation, the {{province}} had been dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party, which practised highly effective machine politics.

5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the changes}} to the design and its growing costs, {{construction}} of three DDLs was approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party McMahon Government in August 1972. At this time, the total project cost was estimated at A$355 million; this figure included all costs associated with building three ships and operating them for ten years. The ships themselves were expected to cost approximately $210 million. All three ships were to be built at Williamstown Dockyard, with construction of the first ship beginning in 1975, followed by the other ships at two-yearly intervals. The initial DDL was to be commissioned in 1980, and the third in 1984. Further DDLs {{may also have been}} ordered over time to replace the Navy's destroyers as they reached the end of their service lives.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of higher education. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest. It is followed by the Leipzig University (1409), the Rostock University (1419) and the Greifswald University (1456). The University of Berlin, founded in 1810 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many European and Western universities. In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence: Humboldt University Berlin, the University of Bremen, the University of Cologne, TU Dresden, the University of Tübingen, RWTH Aachen, FU Berlin, Heidelberg University, the University of Konstanz, LMU Munich, and the Technical University of Munich.|$|E

5|$|Gough Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{was elected in}} 1972 after 23 years of rule by a coalition formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> and Country parties. The ALP Government enjoyed a nine-seat majority in the House of Representatives, but did not control the Senate. In accordance with pre-election promises, it instituted {{a large number of}} policy changes, and offered much legislation. The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed some Government bills to pass the Senate, and blocked others.|$|E
5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> party in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Centre Party {{has been}} the {{traditional}} party of rural voters, but according to polls, it had been losing support to the True Finns in its traditional stronghold regions. The party has traditionally had both a liberal and a conservative wing, however, with the leadership reshuffling in 2010, the central posts are now held <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> wing. The Centre Party has held the portfolio {{of the prime minister}} since 2003. According to opinion polls, Kiviniemi's personal support was higher than that of the party. She had also been campaigning as a staunch defender of Finland's participation in guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries.|$|E

5|$|Though Harper won {{his seat}} of Calgary-Heritage in the 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party was {{defeated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party of Canada, led by Justin Trudeau, who was sworn-in as Harper's successor on November 4, 2015. Harper resigned as party leader on October 19, 2015 and Rona Ambrose {{was chosen as}} interim leader on November 5, 2015. Harper moved back to Calgary, Alberta, and commuted to Ottawa as an opposition backbench member of parliament. Andrew Scheer was elected as the next leader of the Conservative Party in May 2017.|$|E
5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} from Maranhão, Caxias saw that the {{political}} climate had changed. Francisco de Lima's Liberal Party had pushed through the premature declaration of the Emperor's majority on 23 July 1840. In May 1842, the Liberals rebelled in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais {{in retaliation for the}} Emperor's decision—on the advice of a Council of State dominated by Reactionaries—to call for new elections, annulling the previous election tainted by widespread fraud <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party.|$|E
5|$|Verran {{called an}} {{election}} in February 1912, and the ULP were defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> Union, although Denny was again returned first in the seat of Adelaide with 15.8 per cent of votes cast. He {{became a member of}} the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912, as a representative of the Parliament. In 1913, a referendum to fix the closing time of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP. Even after the governing Liberal Union agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the next state election, Denny attacked them, claiming that they had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re-elected. Denny was returned unopposed at the March 1915 state election.|$|E
5|$|By 1875, France {{was enjoying}} {{improved}} political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, {{if for no other reason}} than it was proposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>liberal</b> Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E
