50|$|Soyuz 32 was {{launched}} with its two-man crew on 25 February 1979. The crew's main {{mission was to}} overhaul the Salyut 6 space station's systems and prepare it for further long-duration crews. They would also attempt a new record duration flight. Soyuz 32 docked with Salyut 6 the next day, and Lyakhov and Ryumin, the third long-duration crew at the station, commenced de-mothballing the facility which had been vacant since November. When the hatch to the station was opened, the cosmonauts smelled <b>burnt</b> <b>steel,</b> a scent Ryumin called the odor of space.|$|E
50|$|During {{the second}} world war 60 percent of the {{building}} and 70 percent of its roofing got <b>burnt.</b> The <b>steel</b> framework was the only remains of the clock tower. The damages were rebuilt but the decision on the tower reconstruction was put off many times. It was rebuilt on the Main Building 13 May 2012.|$|R
5000|$|After {{adopting}} the persona of [...] "Steel", Irons discovers upgraded {{versions of the}} BG-60, now called [...] "Toastmasters", are being sold to the gangs of Metropolis. Steel personally witnesses their destructive power: one solid hit reduces the victim to a <b>burnt</b> corpse. <b>Steel</b> discovers part of the distribution chain is his old partner, {{now known as the}} White Rabbit.|$|R
50|$|Skyridge High School is a {{high school}} in Lehi, Utah, United States. The school opened in August, 2016.Skyridge High's mascot is a falcon, and their colors are <b>burnt</b> orange and <b>steel</b> gray. The {{principal}} is Joel Perkins.|$|R
50|$|In {{that year}} <b>Steel's</b> {{warehouse}} <b>burnt</b> down and <b>Steel</b> sold {{the property to}} Wesley Munger and George Armour. Munger had owned a small mill at Waukegan, which had burned down. As Munger & Armour, they built the first modern, steam-driven grain elevator in Chicago. The grain elevator was completed in 1855 and had a capacity of 300,000 bushels.|$|R
500|$|Design firm Sarofsky {{once again}} {{worked on the}} film's main-on-end title {{sequence}}, having done the same for Winter Soldier. The sequence used [...] "muted and mottled, <b>burnt</b> umber and <b>steel</b> blue and cold grey" [...] colors, which were stark contrasts to the sequences for Winter Soldier and The First Avenger (the later created by Method Design) which were [...] "a minimalist graphic approach, reducing the key players to silhouettes and paring the palette down to three colors" [...] and [...] "vibrant and iconic propaganda art comes to life, enticing the viewer to join the fray", respectively. Creative director Erin Sarofsky noted {{one of the challenges}} for Civil Wars sequence was [...] "to make it feel like a Captain America title sequence and not an Avengers sequence" [...] given the number of characters in the film.|$|R
40|$|Smoke spread {{tests were}} carried out in a two-plane compartment. The size of each plane was 5. 6 x 5. 6 x 3. 0 m high. The fuel was {{kerosene}} <b>burnt</b> in square <b>steel</b> pans in the bottom plane. The parameters varied were the fire size, ceiling vent and the open-ing between the planes. Experimental data measured were the smoke-free height, temperature, mass flow, optical density and the oxygen concentration. Calculated data by zone and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were compared with the measured data from some test runs. 1. Background In multi-level buildings, composed {{of two or more}} planes, there are in many cases hori-zontal openings between the planes. Such buildings are, for example, atriums and shopping malls but also garages, basements, hydro-electric stations and other under-ground facilities. The openings between the levels are arranged for stairs and ramps or for lifting and ventilation facilities. If a fire occurs at the bottom of such a building the smoke and hot gases spread upward through the planes and fill the building wit...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{induced by}} {{focusing}} laser {{is very important}} phenomena to be applied in industries, medical and fusion research. A preliminary study leading to this research has been carried out. A Q-switch Nd:YAG laser with 1064 nrn and 532 nm wavelength and 4 ns pulse duration was employed {{as a source of}} energy. The laser was focused using a single lens technique. Some variable were used in this laser plasma characterization studies including range of lenses with different focal length, different laser frequency and laser energy. In preliminary studies, the plasma, generated at the focal region was detected and analyzed using video camera in conjunction of image processing system and interferornetric technique. For laser irradiation on solid target, the pulsed laser was irradiated on alurninums, <b>steels,</b> <b>burnt</b> papers, silicon wafer and nanospheres. The interaction area was analyzed using metallurgical microscope and FE-SEM. The observation results show that the plasma was formed in an oval-like shape. The width and the length of the plasma were found linearly increased with respect to the lens focal length. The plasma temperature was found can achieve up to thousands of Kelvin when studied using interferometric technique. Besides that, solid material target show some physical changes due to shock wave induced by the pulsed laser...|$|R
