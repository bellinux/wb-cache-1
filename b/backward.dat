5|$|A recommended, <b>backward</b> {{compatible}} {{change to}} Mini-B plugs {{that results in}} longer lasting connectors.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Birbhum {{one of the}} country's 250 most <b>backward</b> districts (out of a {{total of}} 640). It is one of the eleven districts in West Bengal {{currently}} receiving funds from the <b>Backward</b> Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).|$|E
5|$|Cosmologists {{often work}} with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the comoving coordinates. The section of spacetime which can be {{observed}} is the <b>backward</b> light cone, which delimits the cosmological horizon.|$|E
5|$|HDMI is <b>backward</b> {{compatible}} with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric cable is used, {{so there is}} no loss of video quality.|$|E
5|$|High-speed (HS) rate of 480Mbit/s was {{introduced}} in 2001. All hi-speed devices are capable of falling back to full-bandwidth operation if necessary; i.e., they are <b>backward</b> compatible with USB1.1 standard. Connectors are identical for USB2.0 and USB1.x.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in mid-air {{due to the}} rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly <b>backward.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled <b>backward</b> {{into the}} Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled <b>backward</b> into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
5|$|Pawn structure: Players {{strive to}} avoid the {{creation}} of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or <b>backward</b> pawns, and pawn islands– and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.|$|E
5|$|Perl 6 is not {{intended}} to be <b>backward</b> compatible, although there will be a compatibility mode. Perl 6 and Perl 5 are distinct languages with a common ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces <b>backward.</b> The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly <b>backward.</b> The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} banded sea krait is black, with lateral {{nostrils}} and an undivided rostral scale. The upper lip and snout are characteristically colored yellow, and the yellow color extends <b>backward</b> {{on each side of}} the head above the eye to the temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|USB3.0 {{defines a}} new SuperSpeed {{transfer}} mode, with associated new <b>backward</b> compatible plugs, receptacles, and cables. SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles are {{identified with a}} distinct logo and blue inserts in standard format receptacles.|$|E
5|$|All {{currently}} available Rock Band peripherals {{are compatible with}} their respective console version of The Beatles: Rock Band. Similarly, peripherals designed for The Beatles: Rock Band are <b>backward</b> compatible with other Rock Band titles. Some controllers designed for Guitar Hero games will also work with The Beatles: Rock Band.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{survey of}} yoga practitioners in Australia showed that about 20% had suffered some physical injury while practicing yoga. In the previous 12 months 4.6% {{of the respondents}} had suffered an injury producing prolonged pain or requiring medical treatment. Headstands, shoulder stands, lotus and half lotus (seated cross-legged position), forward bends, <b>backward</b> bends, and handstands produced {{the greatest number of}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} <b>backward,</b> particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the castle, but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions. Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them <b>backward</b> in the autumn to standard time.|$|E
5|$|Despite growing {{pressure}} for his deposition, Stigand continued {{to attend the}} royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of {{the view that the}} English church was <b>backward</b> and needed reform.|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move <b>backward</b> in the night sky, performing a looping motion.|$|E
5|$|Horner {{differentiated}} the {{two species}} by details of the crest. He interpreted P. blackfeetensis as having a steeper, taller face than P. maximus, with the crest migrating <b>backward</b> toward the eyes during growth. More recent studies have regarded the differences as insufficient to support two species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, Pluto's orbit is chaotic. Computer {{simulations}} {{can be used}} to predict its position for several million years (both forward and <b>backward</b> in time), but after intervals longer than the Lyapunov time of 10–20 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft added <b>backward</b> {{compatibility}} for {{the base}} game and its expansion on the company's Xbox One, {{the successor to}} the Xbox 360, in July 2016. Red Dead Redemption {{had been one of}} the most requested titles for the feature. The game's sales position on Amazon.com spiked following the announcement. The release runs at a smoother frame rate on the Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Narendra Modi {{was born}} on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six {{children}} born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.1915 - 1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c.1920). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other <b>Backward</b> Class by the Indian government.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2010, Six Flags Magic Mountain officially {{announced}} the refurbishment and re-theming of Superman: The Escape, {{in addition to}} the construction of two new roller coasters. As part of the refurbishment, the ride was renamed to Superman: Escape from Krypton and featured new <b>backward</b> launching cars and a new color scheme. The upgraded ride reopened to the public on March 19, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Our {{understanding}} of the universe back to very early times {{suggests that there is}} a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further <b>backward</b> in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If {{the expansion of the universe}} continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.|$|E
5|$|SuperSpeed (SS) rate of 5.0Gbit/s. The written USB3.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} by Intel and its partners in August 2008. The first USB3.0 controller chips were sampled by NEC in May 2009, and the first products using the USB3.0 specification arrived in January 2010. USB3.0 connectors are generally <b>backward</b> compatible, but include new wiring and full-duplex operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{downloadable}} content The Warpath Campaign was criticised by Game Watcher for not integrating {{into the}} original campaign and for only adding {{a few new}} units. Concerns were also voiced about the difficulty curve, though the reviewer felt the DLC provided players a challenge by playing as the technologically <b>backward</b> Native Americans against the European interlopers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{supports}} single-player, four-player local multiplayer, and System Link with up {{to eight}} players across up to eight Xbox consoles, but does not support Xbox Live online play. Deathrow has a futuristic electronic dance music soundtrack and over 3,000 words of voice acting. It also supports 5.1 surround sound and customized soundtracks. The game is <b>backward</b> compatible with the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|The game, played under rugby rules, was {{a battle}} from {{beginning}} to enda regular knock down and drag out fight. Both sides became immediately excited and the audience was aroused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the spirited contest. The ball oscillated <b>backward</b> and forward over the ground without any material result.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and <b>backward</b> at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable {{because it seems}} to require <b>backward</b> causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|USB 3.0 and USB 1.0 Type-A plugs and {{receptacles}} {{are designed}} to interoperate. In order to achieve USB3.0's SuperSpeed (and SuperSpeed+ for USB3.1Gen2), 5 extra pins {{are added to the}} unused area of the original 4 pin USB1.0 design, making USB3.0 Type-A plugs and receptacles <b>backward</b> compatible to those of USB1.0.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two <b>backward,</b> while several species have only three toes. Many woodpeckers have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails, and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two <b>backward,</b> while several species have only three toes. Many woodpeckers have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks. Nine species have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers, sapsuckers, and {{flickers}} {{are small}} to medium-sized birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two <b>backward,</b> while several species have only three toes. Many woodpeckers have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks.|$|E
25|$|Step: The flying cat {{can move}} one square orthogonally <b>backward</b> or diagonally <b>backward.</b>|$|E
25|$|Range: The free serpent and coiled dragon {{can move}} {{any number of}} free squares in a {{straight}} line orthogonally forward, <b>backward,</b> or diagonally <b>backward.</b>|$|E
