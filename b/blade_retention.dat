40|$|A {{rotor disk}} 18 and rotor blade 26 {{assembly}} is disclosed having a blade lock 66 which retains the rotor blade {{against axial movement}} in an axially extending <b>blade</b> <b>retention</b> slot 58. Various construction details are developed which shield the dead rim region D. sub. d and shift at least {{a portion of the}} loads associated with the locking device from the dead rim. In one detailed embodiment, a projection 68 from the live rim D. sub. 1 of the disk 18 is adapted by slots 86 to receive blade locks 66...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{capabilities}} of CAMRAD II {{are used to}} develop two enhanced models of the AH- 64 Apache rotor system. Based on existing sources of structural and dynamic blade properties, common characteristics of both models are first validated. Then, a single-loadpath, kinematic joint model, which includes the exact kinematics of the <b>blade</b> <b>retention</b> system, is developed and validated. A multiple-load-path model, which incorporates an accurate representation of the strap pack into the kinematic joint model, is also created. Pitch link loads are calculated and compared to flight test data...|$|E
40|$|The {{improved}} {{foreign object}} damage resistance of a metal matrix advanced composite fan blade was demonstrated. The fabrication, whirl impact test and subsequent evaluation of nine advanced composite fan blades of the "QCSEE" type design were performed. The blades were designed to operate at a tip speed of 282 m/sec. The blade design was the spar/shell type, consisting of a titanium spar and boron/aluminum composite airfoils. The <b>blade</b> <b>retention</b> was designed to rock on impact with large birds, thereby reducing the blade bending stresses. The program demonstrated {{the ability of the}} blades to sustain impacts with up to 681 g slices of birds at 0. 38 rad with little damage (only 1. 4 percent max weight loss) and 788 g slices of birds at 0. 56 rad with only 3. 2 percent max weight loss. Unbonding did not exceed 1. 1 percent of the post-test blade area during any of the tests. All blades in the post-test condition were judged capable of operation in accordance with the FAA guidelines for medium and large bird impacts...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the drag characteristics of the HU 2 K helicopter fuselage. The effects of body shape, engine operation, appendages, and leakage on the model drag were determined. The results of the tests showed that the largest single contribution to the parasite drag {{was that of the}} rotor hub installation which produced about 80 percent of the drag of the sealed and faired production body. Fairings on the rotor hub and <b>blade</b> <b>retentions,</b> or a cleaned-up hub and retentions, appeared to be the most effective single modifications tested. The total drag of all protuberances and air leakage also contributed {{a major part of the}} drag - an 83 -percent increase over the drag of the sealed and faired production body. An additional increment of drag was caused by the basic shape of the fuselage - 19 percent more than the drag obtained when the fuselage shape was extensively refaired. Another sizable increment of drag was caused by the engine oil-cooler exit which gave a drag of 8 percent of that of the sealed and faired production body...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{configuration}} of the P&W SSME Alternate Fuel Turbopump turbine disk/blade assembly, combined with a severe thermal environment, resulted in several structural anomalies that were driven by frictional contact forces. Understanding the mechanics of these problems provides new quality checks for future turbo machinery designs. During development testing in 1997 of the SSME alternate fuel turbopump at Stennis Space Center, several potentially serious problems surfaced with the turbine disk/blade assembly {{that had not been}} experienced in extensive earlier testing. Changes to the operational thermal environment were noted based on analytical prediction of modifications that affected performance and on stationary thermal measurements adjacent to the rotor assembly. A detailed structural investigation was required to reveal the mechanism of distress induced by the change. The turbine disk experienced cracking in several locations due to increased thermal gradient induced stress during start and shutdown transients. This was easily predictable using standard analysis procedures and expected once the thermal environment was characterized. What was not expected was the curling of a piston ring used for <b>blade</b> axial <b>retention</b> in the disk, indentation of the axial face of the blade attachment by a spacer separating the first and second stage blades, and most significantly, galling and cracking of the blade root attachment that could have resulted in blade release. Past experience, in gas turbine environments, set a precedent of never relying on friction for help and to evaluate it only in specific instances where it was obvious that it would degrade capability. In each of the three cases above, friction proved to be a determining factor that pushed the components into an unsatisfactory mode of operation. The higher than expected temperatures and rapid thermal transients combined with friction to move beyond past experience. The turbine disk/blade assembly configuration contributed to the potential for these problems to occur by limiting the radial deflection from thermals and centrifugal loading. The cooled solid bore configuration was chosen to improve rotordynamic stability by limiting the length of rotor overhang while still protecting the roller bearing by maintaining zero slope under the inner race. During a start transient, the rim area of the disk heats rapidly and expands axially and circumferentially and requires corresponding radial and axial growth of the disk to maintain relative positioning of the disk, blades, spacers and retainer rings. The stiffness, large thermal mass, and bore cooling flow combine to severely limit the disk rim radial growth which results in the potential for relative movement between these parts. Friction then becomes a player in the determination of component stress...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a quantitative concept developed jointly by WR-ALC, the FAA, and the Technology for Energy Corporation {{to ensure the}} structural integrity of aluminum alloy propeller blades used on numerous military and civil aircraft. The propeller assembly of a turboprop engine is a highly energetic rotating assembly [...] that a catastrophic, single point failure in a propeller blade can cause catastrophic loss of aircraft is cause to question its structural integrity. To provide a useful fatigue life, the critical <b>blade</b> <b>retention</b> region is cold rolled to introduce residual compressive stresses in {{the surface of the}} appropriate magnitude and depth. Blind hole drilling has been employed for process verification, but this technique is qualitative in nature and is typically unsuitable for structures with stress gradients, such as those resulting from rolling. This tendency obviates the effectiveness of blind hole drilling as a quality control tool. In fact, there have been military and civil mishaps caused by premature blade failures attributed to inadequate rolling. Furthermore, the beneficial residual compressive surface stresses are degraded in service by wear, stress relaxation, and other damage that render the blades unserviceable. WR-ALC, the propeller repair center for all USAF aircraft, developed a rolling capability as part of the propelle...|$|E
40|$|The XV- 15 Tilt Rotor Research Aircraft {{has just}} {{completed}} the first series of flight tests with the Advanced Technology Blade (ATB) rotor system. The ATB are designed specifically for flight research and provide the ability to alter blade sweep and tip shape. A number of problems were encountered from first installation through envelope expansion to airplane mode flight that required innovative solutions to establish a suitable flight envelope. Prior to operation, the <b>blade</b> <b>retention</b> hardware had to be requalified to a higher rated centrifugal load, because the blade weight was higher than expected. Early flights in the helicopter mode revealed unacceptably high vibratory control system loads which required a temporary modification of the rotor controls to achieve higher speed flight and conversion to airplane mode. The airspeed in airplane mode was limited, however, because of large static control loads. Furthermore, analyses based on refined ATB blade mass and inertia properties indicated a previously unknown high-speed blade mode instability, also requiring airplane-mode maximum airspeed to be restricted. Most recently, a structural failure of an ATB cuff (root fairing) assembly retention structure required a redesign of the assembly. All problems have been addressed and satisfactory solutions {{have been found to}} allow continued productive flight research of the emerging tilt rotor concept...|$|E
