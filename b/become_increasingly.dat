5|$|Severe {{landslides}} {{and floods}} {{are projected to}} <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> common in such states as Assam. Ecological disasters, such as a 1998 coral bleaching event that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems off Lakshadweep and the Andamans and was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> common. Meghalaya and other northeastern states are also concerned that rising sea levels will submerge much of Bangladesh and spawn a refugee crisis. If severe climate changes occurs, Bangladesh and parts of India that border it may lose vast tracts of coastal land.|$|E

5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths, three at the college level, were attributed to football; 159 serious injuries were also reported, 88 at the college level.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} 19th century, {{industry}} in Birmingham was dominated by small workshops rather than large factories or mills.

50|$|After the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the {{curriculum}} {{of the national}} educational system <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> nationalistic and {{after the start of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, {{the curriculum}} <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> militaristic and was influenced by ultranationalist Education Minister Sadao Araki.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} from his business, around 1890, Lilly was a millionaire who had been involved in civic affairs for several years. Later in life he had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> more philanthropic, granting funds to charitable groups in the city.|$|E
5|$|Crowley had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{frustrated}} with Rose's alcoholism, and in November 1909 he divorced {{her on the}} grounds of his own adultery. Lola was entrusted to Rose's care; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at Boleskine. Her alcoholism worsened, and as a result she was institutionalised in September 1911.|$|E
5|$|Just {{outside the}} main walls, the castle mills had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{ineffective}} from the 16th century onwards {{because of a}} reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water-wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam engine to drive the machinery; this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Posadists <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{interested}} in UFOs, claiming they were evidence of socialism on other planets.

50|$|Two {{opposing}} storylines developed out of {{the film}} material.

5|$|Lieberman Aiden was {{involved}} in the analysis of a corpus of around 5 million digitised books, applying data mining techniques to advance the new field of culturomics. Leiberman Aiden {{was involved}} in a project to digitise Anglo-Saxon texts in 2004, the analysis of which led to the discovery of verb regularisation, a process whereby irregular verbs <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> regular over time.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier is a pier in Brighton, England. It was {{designed}} by Eugenius Birch, opening in 1866 and closing in 1975. The pier {{was the first to}} be Grade I listed in Britain but has <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> derelict since closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 19th century saw {{geological}} and paleontological activity <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> well organised with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. Interest increased for reasons that were not purely scientific, as geology and paleontology helped industrialists to find and exploit natural resources such as coal.|$|E

5|$|The {{focus of}} a temple is the centre or sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) where {{the image of the}} deity resides, so temple {{architecture}} is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for circumambulation and halls or chambers (mantapas) that <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> sacred as the deity is approached.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{environment}} of Pushkar Lake and its precincts has <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> degraded {{in the last}} few decades. The problems arise primarily from the over development of tourist facilities as well as the deforestation of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The road {{had been}} {{proposed}} since the 1960s, {{as part of}} the London Ringways, and was an important link between central London and the Docklands to East Anglia. However, road protests elsewhere had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> visible, and urban road building had fallen out of favour with the public. Local Member of Parliament Harry Cohen had been a vocal opponent of this scheme.|$|E

5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E
5|$|Claudia Cardinale met Italian film {{producer}} Franco Cristaldi in 1958. She married him in Atlanta in 1966, but they divorced in 1975. The couple had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> detached {{and he wanted}} to remarry without any ties. Although Cardinale did not believe the Atlanta marriage had any status in Italy, she consented to his request. As a result, Cristaldi married Zeudi Araya and had no further contractual relationships with Cardinale.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} {{west to the}} highway's end on Long Island Sound, CR101 follows a mostly east–west {{alignment}} through Sands Point. Along this last stretch, the route passes {{to the south of}} Sands Point County Park and north past Sands Point Golf Club as the surroundings around the route <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> forested and undeveloped. At Tibbits Lane, the route turns to the northwest and continues to the road's end at a dead end on the southern shore of Long Island Sound.|$|E
50|$|In {{cities such}} as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{integrated}} into society. As they lived and worked more closely with European Americans, the divide <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> indefinite. This period marked the transition for many African Americans from lifestyles as rural farmers to urban industrial workers.|$|R
50|$|Micombero <b>became</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{paranoid}} {{after suffering}} an injury in a road accident in 1967. He was {{widely believed to}} be an alcoholic.

5|$|His socialist {{activism}} monopolised his time, {{forcing him}} to abandon a translation of the Persian Shahnameh. It also led to him seeing far less of Burne-Jones, {{with whom he had}} strong political differences; although once a republican, Burne-Jones had <b>become</b> <b>increasingly</b> conservative, and felt that the DF were exploiting Morris for his talents and influence. While Morris devoted much time to trying to convert his friends to the cause, of Morris' circle of artistic comrades, only Webb and Faulkner fully embraced socialism, while Swinburne expressed his sympathy with it.|$|E

The ventral scales number 132-150 in males and 132–158 in females. The anal plate is single. The subcaudals are paired, numbering 32–46 in males and 23–38 in females.|$|E
