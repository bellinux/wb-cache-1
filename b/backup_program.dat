50|$|The <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> for DOS {{as well as}} Windows {{does not}} support long file names which had been {{introduced}} by Windows 95 {{just a few months}} before the release. Also, because the tape runs at its usual speed and data rate, it takes 90 minutes to record approximately 250 megabytes of uncompressed data. Other backup media common in those days are faster, have more capacity, and support long file names, so the DCC <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> are relatively uninteresting for users.|$|R
5000|$|Validation: Many <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> use {{checksums}} or hashes {{to validate}} {{that the data}} was accurately copied. These offer several advantages. First, they allow data integrity to be verified {{without reference to the}} original file: if the file as stored on the backup medium has the same checksum as the saved value, then it is very probably correct. Second, some <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> can use checksums to avoid making redundant copies of files, and thus improve backup speed. This is particularly useful for the de-duplication process.|$|R

5000|$|Norton 360 was {{developed}} and marketed as an [...] "all-in-one" [...] computer security suite. The package included an antivirus program, a personal firewall, a phishing protection program, and a <b>backup</b> <b>program.</b> What distinguished this suite from Norton Internet Security was the inclusion of file backup and PC maintenance capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{stability}} {{issues with}} early third-party NLMs, they never became popular for server application programming, {{with few exceptions}} like antivirus <b>programs,</b> <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> and certain database products.|$|R
50|$|Backup Sync Share (BSS) is an {{emerging}} {{category of products}} that stems {{from a combination of}} more traditional data <b>backup</b> <b>programs,</b> data synchronization and mirroring applications, and data sharing applications - many of which have a considerable, expanding social media element.|$|R
50|$|The {{sleep and}} displaysleep can show an imposed value of 0 (disabled) {{together}} {{with a list of}} process IDs that impose this value. These are processes such as <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> which need the machine to stay awake, for example until the backup is finished.|$|R
50|$|The {{program counter}} (PC) is {{maintained}} in the F3851 PSU. There is one program counter for each PSU in the system. Each PSU has a <b>backup</b> <b>program</b> counter. The PSU {{also contains a}} pointer register called a data counter, DC. The user only sees one program counter and one data counter.|$|E
5000|$|Fifth Generation Systems was a {{computer}} security company founded October 1984 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States by Bob Mitchell, Leroy Mitchell, Roger Ivey, and Bruce Ray. All four later left the company. Fifth Generation's initial commercial product was FastBack, the first practical hard disk <b>backup</b> <b>program</b> for the IBM PC.|$|E
50|$|Ghost is {{marketed as}} a <b>backup</b> <b>program.</b> Its {{recovery}} environment comes in an ISO image file {{that needs to}} be written to a CD or other physical media, {{if it is to be}} used on a physical machine. This provides an environment to perform offline system recovery or backup. Ghost can mount a backup volume to recover individual files.|$|E
5000|$|... "Backup Wizard" [...] creates <b>backups</b> of <b>programs</b> without uninstallation.|$|R
50|$|Relying on {{the archive}} bit for backing up files can be {{unreliable}} if multiple <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> are setting and clearing the attribute {{bit on the}} same volume. Another possibility {{is to use the}} timestamp of the last change to the file or directory. This is typically the technique used in UNIX-like operating systems.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> only back up user files; boot {{information}} and files locked by the operating system, {{such as those}} in use {{at the time of the}} backup, may not be saved on some operating systems. A disk image contains all files, faithfully replicating all data. For this reason, it is also used for backing up CDs and DVDs.|$|R
50|$|Iperius Backup is a {{software}} to make backups of Oracle databases, version 9i, 10g and 11g, from any Windows operating system. Iperius {{can also make}} backups of the free database Oracle Express Edition (Oracle XE).

50|$|The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) keeps {{historical}} {{versions of}} files and folders on NTFS volumes by copying old, newly overwritten data to shadow copy via copy-on-write technique. The user may later request {{an earlier version}} to be recovered. This also allows data <b>backup</b> <b>programs</b> to archive files currently in use by the file system. On heavily loaded systems, Microsoft recommends setting up a shadow copy volume on a separate disk.|$|R

50|$|Although disk cloning {{programs}} are not primarily backup programs, they are sometimes used as such. A key feature of a <b>backup</b> <b>program</b> is to allow the retrieval of individual files without needing to restore the entire backup. Disk cloning programs either provide a Windows Explorer-like program to browse image files and extract individual files from them, or allow an image file to be mounted as a read-only filesystem within Windows Explorer.|$|E
5000|$|SpiderOak {{was founded}} in 2007 by Ethan Oberman and Alan Fairless as an {{encrypted}} private <b>backup</b> <b>program.</b> In 2013, SpiderOak began developing the Crypton framework, [...] "a JavaScript framework for building applications where the server doesn't know the contents it's storing on behalf of users." [...] Crypton is an open-source project allowing developers to easily add encryption security to mobile applications. By mid-2014, SpiderOak neared 1 million users.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} FastBack {{was unique}} in the industry {{in that it was}} able to read from a computer hard drive and write to the floppy drive simultaneously using the full capability of the dual-channel DMA chip found in personal computers of that time. When combined with compression techniques and a proprietary disk format that got more data on each floppy disk, this easily made FastBack the fastest computer <b>backup</b> <b>program</b> of the time.|$|E
5000|$|Without LTFS, data is {{generally}} written to tape as {{a sequence of}} nameless [...] "files", or data blocks, separated by [...] "filemarks". Each file is typically an archive of data organized using some variation of tar format or proprietary container formats developed for and used by <b>backup</b> <b>programs.</b> In contrast, LTFS utilizes an XML-based index file to present the copied files as if organized into directories. This means LTFS-formatted tape media can be used similarly to other removable media (USB flash drive, external hard disk drive, and so on).|$|R

5000|$|... is an {{open-source}} MySQL hot <b>backup</b> software <b>program.</b> Features include hot, non-locking backups for InnoDB storage, incremental backups, streaming, parallel-compressed backups, throttling {{based on}} the number of I/O operations per second, etc.|$|R
50|$|Most Outrageous Moments (originally titled for {{the first}} season, Most Outrageous TV Moments) is an NBC clip show {{showcasing}} video bloopers and mishaps, and commonly used as a <b>backup</b> <b>program</b> by NBC to fill any timeslots where regular programming did not get any traction in the ratings, or to fill in timeslots between seasons of reality programming. In its first season, premiered on February 8, 2005, it aired {{a limited number of}} specials focusing on live television and game shows.|$|E
5000|$|Jazz shipped on four 400K 3½" [...] diskettes, one {{to start}} up and one to operate the program, along with a copy {{protected}} <b>backup</b> <b>program</b> disk and a disk with sample files. The most frustrating issue users experienced was the need for multiple swapping of the Start-Up and Program or Backup floppy disks. Lotus Jazz Release 1 cannot be run from a hard drive or dual 400K floppy disk drives. If the Lotus Jazz Start-Up disk, Program Disk, and Backup Disks failed, the program {{could not be used}} and another unit of the software would need to be purchased for continued use.|$|E
5000|$|System Restore: Windows ME {{introduced}} the [...] "System Restore" [...] logging and reversion system, which {{was meant to}} simplify troubleshooting and solve problems. It was intended {{to work as a}} rollback and recovery feature so that if the installation of an application or a driver adversely affected the system, the user could undo the installation and return the system to a previously working state. It does this by monitoring changes to Windows system files and the registry. System Restore protects only the operating system files, not documents, and therefore is not a substitute for a <b>backup</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
