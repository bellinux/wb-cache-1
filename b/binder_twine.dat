500|$|In February 1930 Brownlee {{advocated}} a federally {{guaranteed minimum price}} to farmers of $0.70 per bushel of wheat. [...] In November he asked new Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, {{with whom he had}} practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous, to stabilize wheat [...] "at some reasonable price". [...] Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable {{in the face of a}} global oversupply of 400 million bushels. [...] Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers, many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans. [...] Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance, but only quietly and only in the last resort; he was concerned that a well-publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms, knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would. [...] When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks' loans to farmers for <b>binder</b> <b>twine,</b> he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government. [...] To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans, he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter. [...] As he had hoped, this threat enhanced lenders' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers' payments did not even cover interest. [...] Despite these minor successes, Brownlee's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished. [...] It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat, part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply.|$|E

5000|$|Berton {{wrote an}} article in the Toronto Star in 1992 {{comparing}} the <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Queen contest with beauty pageants, stating that [...] "while other queen contests are fading away under the disapproving frowns of feminists, the <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Queen contest has never been healthier or more popular".|$|E
5000|$|By 1878, Appleby had {{developed}} a successful <b>twine</b> <b>binder,</b> which he patented. [...] <b>Twine</b> <b>binders</b> did not cut into the wheat or, like wire binders, kill cattle that happened to eat a strand.|$|R
50|$|He {{licensed}} the <b>twine</b> <b>binder</b> {{mechanism to}} the Gammon and Deering Company, which incorporated it into its Marsh Harvester grain binders and harvesters. Primarily {{on the value}} of Appleby’s <b>twine</b> <b>binder,</b> The Deering Harvester Company (as it became known in 1880) outsold its competitors. Appleby's design soon became the standard grain binding device used on machines manufactured by Cyrus McCormick’s McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, Champion Machine Works, and the D.M. Osborne Co.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Festival, or usually <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine,</b> is {{an annual}} festival held the first Saturday after Labour Day in Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada. It {{is now one}} of the most popular festivals in {{southern}} Ontario, and marks the beginning of the harvest fair season in the Greater Toronto Area.|$|E
5000|$|The festival {{features}} the <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Parade, the <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Queen contest and a Quilt Raffle, along with craft sales and musical entertainment. The McMichael Canadian Art Collection sponsors art {{activities at the}} festival. It includes an arts and craft show, pioneer skills demonstration, and [...] "old-fashioned" [...] entertainment.|$|E
50|$|The {{festival is}} {{organized}} and operated entirely by volunteers, which once included author Pierre Berton, a famous resident of the village. Berton's wife Janet was an executive of the organizing committee from 1967 until 1996, during which time she published 16 booklets {{about the history of}} Kleinburg. <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> has become a successful community event, and has resulted in new town signage and the creation of <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Park.|$|E
5000|$|Withington's {{original}} binder used wire {{to tie the}} bundles. There were {{various problems}} with using wire {{and it was not}} long before William Deering invented a <b>binder</b> that used <b>twine</b> and a knotter (invented in 1858 by John Appleby).|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} Marsh harvester, the company pioneered a {{harvesting}} reaper incorporating an automatic <b>twine</b> <b>binder</b> invented by John Appleby of Beloit, Wisconsin. Deering Manufacturing Company produced and sold 3,000 of Appleby's twine-tie binder for the 1880 harvest, with profits above $400,000. In 1880, Deering moved {{the company to}} Chicago and established the Deering Harvester Works.|$|R
50|$|Beloit was {{originally}} named New Albany (after Albany, Vermont) in 1837 by its founder, Caleb Blodgett. The name {{was changed to}} Beloit in 1838. The name Beloit was coined to be reminiscent of Detroit. Beloit lays claim to such inventions as the speedometer, Korn Kurls, and John Francis Appleby's <b>twine</b> <b>binder.</b> Korn Kurls, which resemble Cheetos, are credited with {{the founding of the}} snack food industry.|$|R
50|$|Local attractions include McMichael Art Gallery, Kortright Centre, Humber River Trails, and <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Park, Copper Creek Golf Course.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, farmers {{would come to}} the {{community}} to acquire <b>binder</b> <b>twine</b> with which they could bind sheaves of wheat. Charlie Shaw, a resident and owner of a hardware store, offered food and entertainment to those farmers, establishing the <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Night festival which was held annually until his death in the 1930s. In 1967, a committee of residents revived the concept as part of the Canadian Centennial celebrations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> is {{a festival}} held {{annually}} that attracts 25,000 people on average. This tradition began in 1890 by Charles Shaw Jr. who distributed <b>binder</b> <b>twine</b> to local farmers. Kleinburg {{also has a}} Christmas tree lighting celebration where the community comes together to donate to The Red Bow Campaign and the KARA Holiday Food Drive {{while waiting for the}} lighting of the tree in front of the Kline house. There is also Canada Day in Kleinburg and Cartunes in Kleinburg events which allow the community to celebrate the history of the village.|$|E

50|$|Son of a German American {{entrepreneur}} from Ohio, Seiberling {{spent two}} years attending Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, before joining the J.F. Seiberling Company, his father’s farm machinery manufacturing business, working there as secretary and treasurer. His father, John Seiberling, founder of that Akron, Ohio company, invented {{one of the first}} reaping machines. While working for the company, Seiberling invented a <b>twine</b> <b>binder</b> that tied grain bundles with a bow knot.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in 1871 the Great Chicago Fire {{destroyed}} the McCormick factory. Despite Case's {{offer to help}} McCormick with the manufacturing of their machines, McCormick Company refused the offer and a new facility, called the McCormick Works was built, in southwest Chicago. The McCormick company introduced {{the first of many}} <b>twine</b> <b>binder</b> machines in 1881, leading to the so-called [...] "Harvester Wars" [...] that gained the attention of the farm industry during the 1880s.|$|R
50|$|Through direct {{bulk buying}} in {{competition}} with established stores, the movement brought down the price of farm supplies (<b>binder</b> <b>twine)</b> and other farmers' needs, and through strong lobbying it helped achieve a cut in tariffs on imported goods important to farmers.|$|E
50|$|Deering {{was also}} {{responsible}} for building a modern twine factory to supply farmers with sufficient length and quality of twine {{to work with the}} binders, a move followed by most competitors. He conducted several experiments and determined that the ideal <b>binder</b> <b>twine</b> would be made of manila, spun to 700 feet per pound.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, sisal {{has been}} the leading {{material}} for agricultural twine (<b>binder</b> <b>twine</b> and baler twine) because of its strength, durability, ability to stretch, affinity for certain dyestuffs, and resistance to deterioration in saltwater. The importance of this traditional use is diminishing with competition from polypropylene {{and the development of}} other haymaking techniques, while new higher-valued sisal products have been developed.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>twine</b> <b>binder</b> is a {{mechanical}} device or machine that wraps knotted twine around a bundle or sheave of grain in bound form {{after it has}} been reaped. While working at a farm in Whitewater, Wisconsin in 1857, John Appleby invented the twine knotter. Incorporating many of Jacob Behel's innovations as found in his development of the [...] "billhook" [...] knotter in 1864, Appleby later sold the patent around the year 1877 to William Deering who began the manufacturing and exploited the practicability of Appleby's twine knotter into a commercially profitable reaper-binder.|$|R
5000|$|He took up {{work as a}} {{machinist}} in a Beloit reaper factory {{the next}} year for $1 a day, and would walk back home to his family in Belvidere on Friday evenings, returning to his job on the following Monday morning. In 1850 he permanently moved Eleanor and their family to Beloit. In 1852 he and his partner, brother-in-law Gustavus Stone, went into business together, building all the machinery necessary to their industry. They commenced by first making hoes and then expanding to such implements as grain sickles and blades for mowing machines. Parker would end up {{the president of the}} Parker & Stone Reaper Company. (It was while working for Parker and Stone that John Appleby developed his famous Appleby <b>Twine</b> <b>Binder)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The farmers {{faced an}} even more {{immediate}} need to reduce their costs for basic supplies like gas, oil, grease and <b>binder</b> <b>twine.</b> At Siemen's suggestion they organized the Rhineland Consumers' Co-operative in the same year, electing him president. The directors had to put their farms up as collateral for the $2,500 bank loan. But the co-operative succeeded, paying its first dividend in 1935. By 1939 it had 573 members.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine</b> Queen contest {{requires}} contestants {{to demonstrate}} their abilities {{in a set of}} activities such as cow milking, hog calling, and log sawing. Each year, one activity is kept secret until the day of the festival so contestant cannot practice for it. Contestants wear costumes and often have props, including live animals, and [...] "shamelessly spoof the traditional beauty contest". It has sometimes been judged by well-known personalities, including Knowlton Nash and Ben Wicks.|$|E
50|$|The {{area was}} also {{served by a}} blacksmith, a shoemaker, a casket maker, a {{dressmaking}} establishment, a chopping mill, a woodworking shop, which supplied wagons and buggies, two slaughterhouses and a community hall. The Edgeley farmers club was organized in 1917, and for years the farmers in the area obtained their supplies of coal, <b>binder</b> <b>twine,</b> salt and other necessities through the club. The club's annual oyster supper {{was one of the}} community's social highlights. The oldest extant Mennonite meeting house in Ontario was moved to Black Creek Pioneer Village in October 1976.|$|E
50|$|The Plymouth Cordage Company was a rope making company {{located in}} Plymouth, Massachusetts, USA. The company, founded in 1824, {{had a large}} factory located on the Plymouth waterfront. By the late 19th century, the Plymouth Cordage Company had become the largest {{manufacturer}} of rope and twine in the world. The company specialized in ship rigging, and was chosen among other competitors in the early 1900s to manufacture the rope used on the USS Constitution. The company's twine, Plymouth <b>binder</b> <b>twine,</b> popular among farmers, was {{the inspiration for the}} naming of the Plymouth brand of automobiles first produced in 1928.|$|E
50|$|Apart from ropes, twines, {{and general}} cordage, sisal {{is used in}} {{low-cost}} and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters, geotextiles, mattresses, carpets, handicrafts, wire rope cores, and Macramé. Sisal has been utilized as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fibre {{is used in the}} cordage industry for making ropes, baler and <b>binder</b> <b>twine.</b> Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.|$|E
50|$|The Plymouth {{automobile}} {{was introduced}} at Madison Square Garden on July 7, 1928. It was Chrysler Corporation's first {{entry in the}} low-priced field, {{which at the time}} was already dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. Plymouths were initially priced higher than the competition, but offered standard features such as internal expanding hydraulic brakes that Ford and Chevrolet did not provide. Plymouths were originally sold exclusively through Chrysler dealerships, offering a low-cost alternative to the upscale Chrysler-brand cars. The logo featured a rear view of the ship Mayflower which landed at Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts. However, the inspiration for the Plymouth brand name came from Plymouth <b>binder</b> <b>twine,</b> produced by the Plymouth Cordage Company, also of Plymouth. The name was chosen by Joe Frazer due to the popularity of the twine among farmers.|$|E
50|$|Henequen {{industry}} in Yucatán Peninsula is an agribusiness {{of a plant}} native to Yucatán, Mexico. After extraction from the plant, henequen is processed as a textile in various forms to obtain a range of products for domestic, commercial, agricultural and industrial use, as <b>binder</b> <b>twine</b> for crops such as hay. Until the mid-20th century, {{it was a major}} industrial activity, the mooring of vessels depending on it. Its decline is attributed to the industry size, its socio-economic impact, as well as the invention of synthetic fibers and the manufacturing from these of substitute products which displaced henequen and sisal fibers. In addition to its fiber, the juice extracted from the henequen plant has been industrialized as a liquor similar to tequila. Also derived from its juice are certain steroidal chemicals used in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E
5000|$|Frazer {{first met}} Walter P. Chrysler in 1923 at Maxwell Chalmers. Chrysler {{was aware of}} Frazer's growing {{reputation}} in the business as a thinker who made large-scale sales a possibility. Frazer joined Chrysler and, with him on board, Maxwell tripled its annual sales, helping Chrysler obtain the resources build his own car. In 1925 Chrysler founded the Chrysler Corporation. Frazer suggested to Chrysler that the company build a low-priced car that would directly challenge Ford and GM. Frazer suggested calling the car [...] "Plymouth". [...] "Why not call it Plymouth? That's a good old American name. Ever hear of Plymouth Binder Twine?" [...] While others were unimpressed by Frazer's proposition, Chrysler (himself once a farmer) replied, [...] "Every farmer in America knows about Plymouth <b>Binder</b> <b>Twine.</b> Let's give them a name they're familiar with." [...] On January 11, 1928, the first car was produced [...] and by 1931 the car was ranked third in automobile sales in the U.S.|$|E
