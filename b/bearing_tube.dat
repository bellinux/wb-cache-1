40|$|To {{respond to}} the recent {{increase}} in container transportation {{and the pursuit of}} higher economic efficiency of ocean transportation, container ships are getting bigger and have higher propulsive power.

50|$|The 'cannon box' bearing was {{introduced}} by George Stephenson on his locomotive Locomotion of 1825 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. One of the axles was carried in a 'cannon box' bearing that was pivoted centrally and could tilt from side to side. Unlike Stephenson's earlier locomotives and their steam springs, this new suspension had no springing but was a compensated suspension: as one side was raised, the <b>bearing</b> <b>tube</b> pivoted {{and the other side}} was pushed downwards. Although not giving a stable ride for the locomotive, it did allow the wheels to follow uneven track. Rails of this period were short pieces of cast iron rather than lengths of rolled steel and had frequent, often misaligned, joints.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a design of squeeze film air journal bearing {{based on the}} design rules derived from CFX and FEA simulation study of an air film in between two flat plates, {{one of which was}} driven in a sinusoidal manner. The rules are that the oscillation frequency should be at least 15 kHz and that the oscillation amplitude be as large as possible to ensure a greater film thickness and to allow the bearing to reach its stable equilibrium quickly. The proposed journal bearing is made from AL 2024 -T 3, of 20. 02 mm outer diameter, 600 mm length and 2 mm thickness. Three 20 -mm long fins are on the outer surface of the <b>bearing</b> <b>tube</b> and are spaced 120 &deg; apart; three longitudinal flats are milled equi-spaced between the fins and two piezoelectric actuators are mounted lengthwise on each flat. Such a design produces a modal shape on the <b>bearing</b> <b>tube</b> which resembles a triangle. When excited in this mode at the frequency of 16. 37 kHz, and a voltage of 75 V AC with 75 V DC offset acting on the piezoelectric actuators, the air gap underneath of the <b>bearing</b> <b>tube</b> behaves as a squeeze air film with a response amplitude of 3. 22 &mu;m.

Methods 203 cases of mediastinal lesions were collected from General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region between 2010 and 2013.

The time in surgery, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage amount within three days after surgery, the period of <b>bearing</b> drainage <b>tubes,</b> hospital stays and hospitalization expense were then compared. Results All patients were successfully operated, the postoperative recovery is good and there is no perioperative death. The different of the time in surgery between two groups is Robots group 82 (20 - 320) min and thoracoscopic group 89 (35 - 360) min (P> 0. 05). The intraoperative blood loss between two groups is robot group 10 (1 - 100) mL and thoracoscopic group 50 (3 - 1, 500) mL. The postoperative drainage amount within three days after surgery between two groups is robot group 215 (0 - 2, 220) mL and thoracoscopic group 350 (50 - 1, 810) mL. The period of <b>bearing</b> drainage <b>tubes</b> after surgery between two groups is robot group 3 (0 - 10) d and thoracoscopic group: 5 (1 - 18) d.
