25|$|Audits of {{the banks}} that had been taken over showed massive bad debts, {{exceeding}} 55%. Further audits showed that the other banks were also fundamentally weak. Banking reform continued throughout 1999, with the merger of four state banks in October 1998 into Bank Mandiri, the closure of 38 <b>banks,</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> of nine, and takeover of seven more in March 1999. By this point the total bank capital had reached a negative 245 trillion rupiah. Twenty-three further banks were recapitalised in May, and in October 1999, Bank Mandiri itself was recapitalised. Interest rates fell steadily in 1999, to an SBI of 13.1% in October. The rupiah finished the year at Rp 7,900 to the US dollar.|$|R
40|$|The European Council has {{outlined}} {{the creation of}} a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), complementing the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The thinking on the SRM’s legal basis, design and mission is still preliminary and depends on other major initiatives, including the European Stability Mechanism’s involvement in <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisations</b> and the <b>Bank</b> Recovery and Resolution (BRR) Directive. The SRM should also not be seen as the final step creating Europe’s future banking union. • Both the BRR Directive and the SRM should be designed to enable the substantial financial participation of existing creditors in future bank restructurings. To be effec-tive, the SRM should empower a central body. However, in the absence of Treaty change and of further fiscal integration, SRM decisions will need to be implemen-ted through national resolution regimes. The central body of the SRM should be either the European Commission, or a new authority. • This legislative effort should not be taken as an excuse to delay decisive action on the management and resolution of the current European banking fragility, which imposes a major drag on Europe’s growth and employment...|$|R

Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, if we get a positive review, <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, in June 2012, Spain {{became a}} prime {{concern for the}} Euro-zone when {{interest}} on Spain's 10-year bonds reached the 7% level and it faced difficulty in accessing bond markets. This led the Eurogroup on 9 June 2012 to grant Spain a financial support package of up to €100 billion. The funds will not go directly to Spanish banks, but be transferred to a government-owned Spanish fund responsible to conduct the needed bank recapitalisations (FROB), and thus it will be counted for as additional sovereign debt in Spain's national account. An economic forecast in June 2012 highlighted {{the need for the}} arranged <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> support package, as the outlook promised a negative growth rate of 1.7%, unemployment rising to 25%, and a continued declining trend for housing prices. In September 2012 the ECB removed some of the pressure from Spain on financial markets, when it announced its [...] "unlimited bond-buying plan", to be initiated if Spain would sign a new sovereign bailout package with EFSF/ESM. Strictly speaking, Spain was not hit by a sovereign debt-crisis in 2012, as the financial support package that they received from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.|$|E

40|$|Pan-European {{banks are}} {{starting}} to emerge, while arrangements for financial supervision and stability are still nationally rooted. This raises the issue who should {{bear the burden of}} any proposed recapitalisation in the event of failures in large cross-border <b>banks.</b> A <b>recapitalisation</b> is effi-cient if the social benefits (preserving systemic stability) exceed the cost of recapitalisation. Using the multi-country model of Freixas (2003), we show that ex post negotiations on burden sharing lead to an underprovi-sion of recapitalisations. Against this background, we explore different ex ante burden sha-ring mechanisms. The first is a general scheme financed from the seigniorage of participating central banks (generic burden sharing). The second relates the burden to the location of the assets of the bank to be recapitalised (specific burden sharing). As the specific scheme gives a better alignment of costs and benefits, it is better able to overcome the co-ordination failure. Finally, decision-making procedures are required for the administration of an ex ante burden sharing mechanism. 1...|$|R
2500|$|At 01:20am, on 23 December 2016, {{the midnight}} after the failed recapitalisation, BMPS {{requested}} a precautionary recapitalisation by the Italian Government {{in order to}} bail out the bank by excising Article 32(4) of EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (The EU-wide banking resolution law, which restricted state aid to a means of last resort).

We consider bank bailouts for these banks in a simulation framework with stochastic country-specific bailout benefits.

40|$|What role does {{politics}} play {{in financial}} crises {{and how does}} this affect economic outcomes? This thesis employs a political economy framework to examine the effect politics has on the causes, containment, and resolution of financial crises. The first paper examines the development of Irish financial regulation and supervision {{in the context of}} the politics of financial services policy. It argues that domestic politics prior to the crisis in Ireland played a significant contributing role in fostering a permissive banking environment which allowed the build up of financial imbalances. The second paper, with Christopher Gandrud, aims to understand why policymakers may end up choosing sub-optimal financial crisis containment strategies when taking decisions under uncertainty. We develop a signalling model of financial crisis management to enhance our understanding of the interactions between bureaucrats and decision-makers and to show how asymmetries of information can have significant implications for policy choice. The third paper, with Alessio Terzi, uses cross-country econometric evidence to examine the impact that political and party systems have on the fiscal cost of financial sector intervention. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that there is a systematic relationship between political economy factors and the fiscal cost of financial sector intervention in banking crises. We find that governments in presidential systems are associated with lower fiscal costs when managing banking crises. Looking further at crisis containment strategies, we show that these governments are are less likely to employ costly bank guarantees and <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisations</b> which expose the state to significant contingent and direct fiscal liabilities, and are more likely to impose losses on depositors. The fourth paper analyses reform of the framework for crises management in the EU from a political economy perspective, following the 2007 financial and subsequent sovereign debt crisis. It explains how the limits of coordination and unprecedented public support led to the proposal for the establishment of a harmonised framework for bank resolution across the EU. However, the distributional consequences of financial sector support and the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism led to deeper integration for euro area Member States and agreement on the Single Resolution Mechanism. It analyses in detail the negotiations on the financing structure for future resolution, decision-making procedures and crisis management tools and demonstrates how the power of certain Member States and distributive conflict with regard to legacy assets shaped the new architecture. It also highlights the important role the European Parliament played in the negotiations. This thesis makes a number of substantive contributions to political economy. The new theoretical and empirical findings will help foster a better understanding as to how governments may react to future financial crises and show what factors lead to and shape reform. It also has a number of policy implications. It stresses the need for a robust regulatory and supervisory architecture which creates the appropriate incentives for bureaucrats to provide timely and accurate information to decision-makers. It also highlights the need for a more intrusive approach to supervision...|$|R
40|$|The issue: The European Union's pre-crisis growth {{performance}} was disappointing enough, but the performance has {{been even more}} dismal since {{the onset of the}} crisis. Weak growth is undermining private and public deleveraging,and is fuelling continued banking fragility. Persistently high unemployment is eroding skills, discouraging labour market participation and undermining the EU’s long-term growth potential. Low overall growth is making it much tougher for the hard-hit economies in southern Europe to recover competitiveness and regain control of their public finances. Stagnation would reduce the attractiveness of Europe for investment. Under these conditions, Europe's social models are bound to prove unsustainable. Policy Challenge: The European Union's weak long-term growth potential and unsatisfactory recovery from the crisis represent a major policy challenge. Over and above the structural reform agenda, which vitally important, bold policy action is needed. The priority is to get bank credit going. Banking problems need to be assessed properly and <b>bank</b> resolution and <b>recapitalisation</b> should be pursued. Second, fostering the reallocation of factors to the most productive firms and the sectors that contribute to aggregate rebalancing is vital. Addressing intra-euro area competitiveness divergence is essential to support growth in southern Europe. Third, the speed of fiscal adjustment needs to be appropriate and EU funds should be front loaded to countries in deep recession, while the European Investment Bank should increase investment...|$|R

40|$|On 8 October 2008 the UK Government {{announced}} a far-reaching plan to restore financial stability, protect depositors and re-invigorate {{the flow of}} credit to businesses and individuals in the UK. The £ 400 billion bailout plan embraced three elements: a massive expansion in emergency liquidity support from the <b>Bank</b> of England; <b>recapitalisation</b> of UK <b>banks</b> and building societies using taxpayers' money; {{and the provision of}} a Government guarantee of new short- and medium-term debt issuance made by UK-incorporated banks and building societies. This action proved necessary in the wake of continuing and substantial weaknesses in many banks' share prices despite the temporary ban on short-selling imposed by the Financial Services Authority. It followed two revisions to domestic deposit protection arrangements, and the adoption of a piecemeal approach to failure resolution which saw the eventual nationalisation of Northern Rock in February 2008, the nationalisation of Bradford and Bingley in September 2008 and the brokering of takeover rescues of Alliance and Leicester and HBOS by Banco Santander and Lloyds TSB respectively in July and September 2008, and of the Cheshire and Derbyshire Building Societies by the Nationwide Building Society in September 2008. This metamorphosis in approach to failure resolution by the UK authorities in response to the sub-prime crisis and the credit crunch – nationalisation by default to (part) nationalisation as the preferred course of action - is duly analysed in this article, as well as their proposals for banking reforms which still have to be agreed by Parliament.

40|$|Summary Neither {{the current}} Labour {{government}} nor the previous Conservative one {{can look back}} over their respective terms of office as periods of great success in fiscal management. Both started by strengthening their underlying budget balances for three years after taking office, but both then allowed them to drift steadily back into the red. This meant that they were already borrowing significant amounts when the onset of recession required them to borrow more. Labour is entering this recession with a similar structural budget deficit {{to the one that}} it inherited from the Conservatives, but with a smaller underlying debt. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the structural budget deficit will deteriorate as far under Labour as it did under the Conservatives, but debt is very likely to rise above the peak it recorded under the Conservatives (even without the impact of recent <b>bank</b> nationalisations and <b>recapitalisations).</b> Labour recorded a similar structural budget deficit in the year before this recession to that which the Conservatives recorded in the year before the last. However, the structural deficit appears to have deteriorated more sharply in the early phase of the downturn than it did under the Conservatives and as a result is set to be higher in the first year of recession than it was under the Conservatives. This largely reflects the particular impact of the credit crunch and falls in the stock market and housing market, rather than budget decisions. Labour is also going into the recession with a significantly higher level of debt than the Conservatives did. Turning to the international context, we are entering the current recession with one of the largest structural budget deficits in the industrial world and a debt level that may be among the smallest in the G 7 but which is larger than that of most industrial countries. We have done less to reduce our structural budget deficit and less to reduce our debt than most other industrial countries since Labour came to office. ...|$|R

5000|$|By early 2015, the HFSF kept a {{remaining}} buffer of 11 billion euros in EFSF {{bonds that}} the outgoing Greek government {{had intended to}} repurpose as a precautionary credit line. In February 2015, the new, SYRIZA-led administration negotiated with the Troika over a six-month extension of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement.

50|$|His {{second year}} in office, 2011, was also marked by a {{deterioration}} of the Greek debt crisis, leading to Van Rompuy calling an extraordinary meeting of the Eurozone heads of state or government in July to adopt a first package of further measures (notably longer term loans at lower interest rates, private sector debt-writedown, further fiscal consolidation in Greece) and again in October (in conjunction with full European Council meetings) to contain contagion from Greece to other countries (through <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> across Europe and by leveraging the firepower of the EFSF to about €1 trillion).|$|E

50|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the German government quickly backtracked on the commitment about direct <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> by the ESM. In September 2012, it was joined on this stance by {{the governments of}} Finland and the Netherlands. Eventually, such conditions were put on the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument that, as of September 2014, {{it has never been}} activated. However, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism proceeded apace. Furthermore, in December 2012 the European Council announced the creation of the Single Resolution Mechanism. Europe's banking union has been identified by many analysts and policymakers as a major structural policy initiative that has {{played a significant role in}} addressing the Eurozone crisis.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, EFSF and ESM {{were only}} allowed to offer {{financial}} stability loans directly to sovereign states, meaning that offered <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> packages were first {{paid to the}} state and then transferred to the suffering financial sector; and thus these type of loans were accounted for as national debt of the sovereign state - adversely impacting its gross debt-to-GDP ratio and credit rating. In example, this regime was utilized when ESM established a bank recapitalization support programme for Spain in 2012-13. On the EU summit on 19 October 2012, it was decided that ESM <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> packages in the future (starting from the date when ECBs new supervision unit for the financial sector has been set to commence operations: 4 November 2014), instead only shall by paid directly to the financial sector, so that it no longer counts as state debt in the statistics. ESM made the decided [...] "direct bank recapitalization" [...] framework operational starting from December 2014, as a new novel ultimate backstop instrument to apply for systemic banks in their recovery/resolution phase, if such banks will be found in need to receive additional recapitalization funds after conducted bail-in by private creditors and regulated payment by the Single Resolution Fund. In this way, the primary backstop to patch future uncovered recapitalization needs of a failing systemic bank will be provided by bail-in of private creditors along with contributions from the Single Resolution Fund (as regulated by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive), while the ESM [...] "direct bank recapitalization" [...] instrument only will be needed as an [...] "ultimate backstop" [...] for the most extreme cases where the primary backstop funds are found to be insufficient.|$|E

Secondly, the Government supported British banks in their plan to increase their market capitalisation through the newly formed <b>Bank</b> <b>Recapitalisation</b> Fund, by £25 billion {{in the first instance}} with a further £25 billion to be called upon if needed. Thirdly, the Government temporarily underwrote any eligible lending between British banks, giving a loan guarantee of around £250 billion. However, only £400 billion of this was 'fresh money', as there was already in place a system for short term loans to the value of £100 billion.|$|E
50|$|Through the <b>Bank</b> <b>Recapitalisation</b> Fund, the {{government}} bought {{a combination of}} ordinary shares and preference shares in affected banks. The amount and proportion of the stake taken in any one bank was negotiated with the individual bank. Banks that took the rescue packages had restrictions on executive pay and dividends to existing shareholders, {{as well as a}} mandate to offer reasonable credit to homeowners and small businesses. The long-term government plan was to offset the cost of this program by receiving dividends from these shares, and in the long run, to sell the shares after a market recovery. This plan covered the possibility of underwriting new issues of shares by any participating bank. The plan has been characterised as, in effect, partial nationalisation.|$|E

In contrast to the global focus found {{in the rest of}} the book, the focus here is largely on Britain and Northern Rock (who issued false figures for mortgage arrears - p24), with some attention to cooperation and dialogue with the US and Europe, especially to Brown's work in persuading them of the need to recapitalise their own banks fearing the threat of a recession (p27).

It followed by announcing two major policy initiatives: first, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism under the European Central Bank's authority, using Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; and second, [...] "when an effective single supervisory mechanism is established," [...] the possibility of direct <b>bank</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> by the European Stability Mechanism, possibly with retroactive effect in the case of Spain and Ireland.|$|E
