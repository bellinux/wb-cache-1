The format of general {{interest}} music en espanol was redubbed [...] "La Original" [...] (The Original) tied {{to the fact that}} the music is a throw <b>backl</b> to the old KJJT station, a small daytime AM in Odessa called KJJT. That station operated between 1979 and about 1990 when call letters had changed to KNDA and the station handed in its license. The current KJJT on 98.5 has had numerous instances of downtime; i.e. it spent most of April 2016 off the air (no carrier) or in dead air (no audio on a silent carrier). These have often run for days and weeks at a time. It is unknown what is happening, since the station rarely files with the FCC.|$|E
40|$|The most {{commonly}} used scheduling algorithm for parallel super-computers is FCFS with <b>backlling,</b> as originally introduced in the EASY scheduler. <b>Backlling</b> means that short jobs are allowed to run ahead of their time provided they do not delay previously queued jobs (or at least the rst queued job). To make such de-terminations possible, users are required to provide estimates of how long jobs will run, and jobs that violate these estimates are killed. Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that user estimates are inaccurate, and that history-based system generated predictions may be signicantly better. Remarkably, predictions were never in-corporated into production schedulers. One reason explaining this anomaly is studies claiming inaccuracy is actually good for per-formance. More important is the fact no study overcame the dif-culty {{of what to do}} when job runtimes exceed system generated predictions: with <b>backlling</b> such jobs are killed, but users will not tolerate jobs being killed just because system predictions were too short. We solve this problem by divorcing kill-time from the runtime prediction. To make this work, predictions need to be cor-rected adaptively if proved wrong. The end result is a surprisingly simple scheduler we call EASY++, which requires minimal devi-ations from current practices (e. g. using FCFS as the basis), and behaves exactly like EASY as far as users are concerned. Never-theless it achieves signicant improvements in performance, pre-dictability, and accuracy, and we argue it can (and in our opinion should) replace the default currently in use on production systems. In addition, our techniques can be used to enhance any <b>backlling</b> algorithm previously suggested. 1...|$|R
40|$|Buered coscheduling {{is a new}} {{methodology}} {{that can}} substantially increase resource utilization, improve response time, and simplify {{the development of the}} run-time support in a parallel machine. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of three important aspects of the proposed methodology: the impact of the communication pattern and type of synchronization, the impact of memory constraints, and the processor utilization. The experimental results show that if jobs use non-blocking or collectivecommunication patterns, the response time becomes largely insensitive to the job communication pattern. Using a simple job access policy, we also demonstrate the robustness of buered coscheduling in the presence of memory constraints. Overall, buered coscheduling generally outperforms <b>backlling</b> and <b>backlling</b> gang scheduling with respect to response time, wait time, run-time slowdown, and processor utilization.

40|$|International audienceComputing {{resources}} in data centers are usually managed by a Resource and Job Management System whose main {{objective is to}} complete submitted jobs {{as soon as possible}} while maximizing resource usage and ensuring fairness among users. However, some users might not be as hurried as the job scheduler but only interested in their jobs to complete before a given deadline. In this paper, we derive from this initial hypothesis a low-complexity scheduling algorithm, called Deadline-Based <b>Backlling</b> (DBF), that distinguishes regular jobs that have to complete as early as possible from deadline-driven jobs that come with a deadline before when they have to nish. We also investigate a scenario in which deadline-driven jobs are submitted and evaluate the impact of the proposed algorithm on classical performance metrics with regard to state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms. Experiments conducted on four dierent workloads show that the proposed algorithm signicantly reduces the average wait time and average stretch when compared to Conservative <b>Backlling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Excavation of mock graves in sediments of aeolian and ?uvial origin were {{conducted}} to test the bleaching ef?ciency of grave digging in materials that commonly host ancient burials in Australia. Grave-size pits were dug into Pleistocene aeolian sediments at Willandra Lakes and younger ?uvial sediments on the Lachlan River, <b>back?lled,</b> and re-excavated. Samples for optical dating were taken from sediment in?lling the mock graves and from the adjacent, undisturbed substrate, and analysed using the single aliquot-regenerative dose (SAR) protocol applied to single quartz grains. The resulting equivalent dose (De) distributions revealed that 1 % of grains had been fully zeroed in both settings, and an additional 1 e 6 % of poorly bleached grains were apparent in the ?uvial sediments. Insuf?cient and heterogeneous bleaching of sediments during excavation and <b>back?lling</b> produced {{a decrease in the}} central dose of between 3 and 6 Gy, and an increase in over-dispersion values of between 5 and 10 %. These differences were insuf?cient to clearly distinguish the disturbance event from the effects of bioturbation, biological mixing, or other sources of De variation. The use of the Minimum Age Model substantially over-estimated the burial age (zero years) in both depositional environments, with the degree of over-estimation increasing with the age of the host sediments. These results suggest that optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques will not produce accurate ages for grave in?ll in a number of forensic and archaeological settings. Further study of the bleaching susceptibility of grains within grave in?lls, as well as the effectiveness of grave-digging as a bleaching mechanism is required. In other archaeological and geomorphological applications of OSL dating we recommend routine checks on the effective zeroing of sediments in modern equivalent situations.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we explore the {{performance}} of various aspects of gang scheduling designs. We developed an event-driven simulator of a vanilla gang scheduler that relies on the Distributed Hierarchical Control (DHC) structure. We also developed three variations of the vanilla gang scheduler that rely on a push-down heuristic and on two job-migration schemes to decrease response times by reducing processor idle time. We evaluated the gang schedulers on a compiled, one-month long history of jobs from the Cornell Theory Center that was scheduled by EASY-LL, a particular version of LoadLeveler with <b>backlling.</b> Our results demon-strate the signicant performance improvements {{that can be achieved}} with gang scheduling. They also show the performance impact of various aspects in the design of gang schedulers. We identify and discuss the potential benets of several approaches for addressing a number of gang scheduling issues that, under certain workload conditions, become im-portant in practice. Our techniques include heuristics for mapping jobs to processors and for choosing time quanta, block paging for reducing memory overheads, and the allocation of multiple time-slices to smaller jobs per timeplexing cycle. ...|$|R
