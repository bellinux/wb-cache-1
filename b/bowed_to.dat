5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|Fleming <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> family {{pressure}} in October 1933, {{and went into}} banking with a position at the financiers Cull & Co. In 1935 he moved to Rowe and Pitman on Bishopsgate as a stockbroker. Fleming was unsuccessful in both roles. Early in 1939 Fleming began an affair with Ann O'Neill (née Charteris), who was married to the 3rd Baron O'Neill; she was also {{having an affair with}} Esmond Harmsworth, the heir to Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail.|$|E

Three months later, GSA rented {{out the last}} of its space in Constitution Center by signing leases for the National Endowment for the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities.|$|E

5|$|Various Polish {{military}} {{organizations and}} provisional governments (the Regency Council in Warsaw; Ignacy Daszyński's government in Lublin; and the Polish Liquidation Committee in Kraków) <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, {{such as the}} eight-hour day, free school education, and women's suffrage. This was necessary to avoid major unrest.|$|E
5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a {{subscription}} of 1,000 shillings to be {{contributed to the}} Gould testimonial. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up {{to the value of}} a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, {{the club}} {{supported}} {{the war effort}} by allowing the ground {{to be used as}} a rifle range for military training. On the outbreak of the Second World War, all outdoor sport was banned by the Government until safety implications could be assessed. When football resumed a few weeks later, Birmingham's Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of its proximity to probable air-raid targets such as the BSA munitions factories. The matter was first raised in Parliament in November 1939, but the Home Secretary felt unable to intervene. By March 1940, when St Andrew's had for some time been the only football ground in England still closed, the Chief Constable <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> public pressure, and a crowd of 13,241 witnessed Birmingham's first home game in more than six months.|$|E
5|$|The Ashvamedhika Parva narrates Uttanka's {{meeting with}} the god Krishna. As Krishna was {{returning}} to his kingdom Dwarka, he noticed the wandering ascetic Uttanka. Uttanka met Krishna and asked for news. Krishna told about the devastation in the Kurukshetra War. Uttanka was agitated {{and was about to}} curse Krishna for not bringing about a compromise between the warring cousins Pandavas and Kauravas. Krishna explained the necessity of war for restoration of dharma and revealed his Vishvarupa form to Uttanka. The sage <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> Krishna. Krishna told Uttanka to ask for a boon. Uttanka asked Krishna to grant him the boon of finding water whenever he was thirsty. Krishna granted the boon to Uttanka. Uttanka was the only other person other than Arjuna and Bhishma to get a divine vision of Krishna.|$|E
5|$|The Stadio San Paolo was {{the only}} stadium during the {{competition}} where the Argentine National Anthem was not jeered, Maradona <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> the Napoli fans {{at the end and}} his country went on to reach the final. However, after the final, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) forced Maradona to take a doping test, which he failed testing positive for cocaine; both Maradona and Napoli staff later claimed it was a revenge plot for events at the World Cup. Maradona was banned for 15 months and would never play for the club again. The club still managed to win the Supercoppa Italiana that year, with a record 5–1 victory against Juventus, but it would be their last major trophy for 22 years. However, in the European Cup, they were eliminated in the second round.|$|E

5|$|During the 44-year {{reign of}} Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang dynasty reached its height, {{a golden age}} with low {{economic}} inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court. Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished {{the death penalty in}} the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (these were relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730). Xuanzong <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions. His staunch Confucian chancellor Zhang Jiuling (673–740) worked to reduce deflation and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, while his aristocratic and technocratic successor Li Linfu (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage. After 737 most of Xuanzong's confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor Li Linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals. This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 the Cremation Society of Great Britain {{bought an}} {{isolated}} {{piece of the}} LNC's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site. The crematorium was completed in 1879 but Richard Cross, the Home Secretary, <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted. As a consequence the crematorium was not used other than for the experimental incineration of livestock. The 1884 trial of William Price established that human cremation was not unlawful in England, and on 26March 1885 the first human cremation took place at Woking. Although the LNC was hostile {{to the idea of}} cremation, Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country. Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area, transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for the LNC.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia's Lisbon mission {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key {{link between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the Carnation Revolution of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered {{the closure of the}} Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.|$|E
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{recall of}} Sir William Hamilton to Britain was a further {{incentive}} for Nelson to return, although {{he and the}} Hamiltons initially sailed from Naples on a brief cruise around Malta aboard the Foudroyant in April 1800. It was on this voyage that Horatio and Emma's illegitimate daughter Horatia was probably conceived. After the cruise, Nelson conveyed the Queen of Naples and her suite to Leghorn. On his arrival, Nelson shifted his flag to , but again disobeyed Keith's orders by refusing to join the main fleet. Keith came to Leghorn in person to demand an explanation, and refused to be moved by the Queen's pleas {{to allow her to}} be conveyed in a British ship. In the face of Keith's demands, Nelson reluctantly struck his flag and <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> Emma Hamilton's request to return to England over land.|$|E

5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat <b>bowed</b> <b>to</b> the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
