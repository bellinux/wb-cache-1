50|$|Thermal {{batteries}} are used almost exclusively for military applications, notably for guided missiles. They {{are the primary}} power source for many missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, MIM-104 Patriot, BGM-71 TOW, BGM-109 Tomahawk and others. In these batteries the electrolyte is immobilized when molten by a special grade of magnesium oxide that holds it in place by capillary action. This powdered mixture is pressed into s to form a separator between the anode and cathode of each cell in the <b>battery</b> <b>stack.</b> As long as the electrolyte (salt) is solid, the battery is inert and remains inactive. Each cell also contains a pyrotechnic heat source, {{which is used to}} heat the cell to the typical operating temperature of 400-550 °C.|$|E

The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of iron powder and potassium perchlorate in weight ratios of 88/12, 86/14, or 84/16. The higher the potassium perchlorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 cal/g respectively). This property of unactivated storage has the double benefit of avoiding deterioration of the active materials during storage and eliminating capacity loss due to self-discharge until the battery is activated.|$|E

The principles of high ratio step down and step-up operations are analyzed. In terms of the bidirectional characteristic of the H-Bridge, the bidirectional synchronous rectification (SR) operation is presented without any extra hardware. Then the SR power switches can achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on and turn-off during dead time, and the power conversion efficiency is improved {{compared to that of}} the diode rectification (DR) operation, as well as the utilization of power switches. Experimental results show that the proposed converter can operate bidirectionally in the wide ratio range of 3 ~ 10, when the low voltage continuously varies between 15 V and 50 V. The maximum efficiencies are 94. 1 % in the Buck mode, and 93. 6 % in the Boost mode. In addition, the corresponding largest efficiency variations between SR and DR operations are 4. 8 % and 3. 4 %.

50|$|Pyrotechnic heat {{sources are}} often used for {{activation}} of thermal batteries, where they serve to melt the electrolyte. There are two main types of design. One uses a fuze strip (containing barium chromate and powdered zirconium metal in a ceramic paper) {{along the edge of}} the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an electrical igniter or squib by application of electric current. The second design uses a center hole in the <b>battery</b> <b>stack</b> into which the high-energy electrical igniter fires a mixture of hot gases and incandescent particles. The center-hole design allows much faster activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can also be accomplished by a percussion primer, similar to a shotgun shell. It is desired that the pyrotechnic source be gasless. The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of iron powder and potassium perchlorate in weight ratios of typically 88/12, 86/14, and 84/16. The higher the potassium perchorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 calories/gram, respectively). The size and thickness of the iron-perchlorate pellets has little influence on their burn rate, however the effect of density, composition, and particle size have significant effect on the burn rate and can be used for its adjusting for desired heat output profile. Another composition in use is zirconium with barium chromate. Another mixture is 46.67 wt.% of titanium, 23.33% of amorphous boron, and about 30% barium chromate. Yet another one is 45 wt.% tungsten, 40.5% barium chromate, 14.5% potassium perchlorate, and 1% vinyl alcohol acetate resin binder.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, four {{energy control}} {{strategies}} are proposed and analyzed for the Standalone Renewable / Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Source (RES/FC HPS). The {{concept of the}} Load Following (LF) and Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking (MEPT) is used to control the fueling rates. A standalone RES/FC HPS uses at least one Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell (FC) as backup source. Photovoltaic (PV) array and wind turbines (WT) farm are used as RES and the surplus of energy during light load stages is stored in hydrogen tank via water electrolysis to fuel the PEMFC. Small-scale RESs and commercially available PEMFCs are interfaced to the common DC bus via power converters {{and then to the}} single-phase distribution grid through a voltage source inverter. RES/FC HPS seem to be an efficient alternative for supplying smart houses and isolated sites. This paper proposes a new supervision strategy of the Energy Management Unit (EMU) based on the LF control approach that assures a charge-sustaining (CS) mode for the Energy Storage System (ESS). So, the capacity of the <b>batteries</b> <b>stack</b> can be reduced at minimum if it is directly connected to the DC bus. The ultracapacitors stack compensates dynamically the power flow balance on the DC bus, regulating the DC voltage via a bidirectional buck-boost power converter. Thus, a semi-active hybrid topology is adopted for the ESS having the <b>batteries</b> <b>stack.</b> The MEPT loops ensure an optimized energy management of the RES/FC HPS. The LF strategy designed based on the power flow balance guarantees th...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{remaining}} challenges {{in the field of}} portable electronics is the miniaturization of lithium-ion batteries. To prepare all-solid-state batteries with a sufficient high storage capacity it is vital to prepare high quality thin films for <b>battery</b> <b>stacks</b> on 3 D-structured substrates. A remote plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD) process has therefore been developed for LiCoO 2 which can serve as a cathode material. A combination of CoCp 2 as cobalt precursor, LiOtBu as lithium precursor and O 2 plasma as oxidant source was used to create super-cycles to deposit LiCoO 2 from Co 3 O 4 and Li 2 CO 3 cycles. The thin films were deposited at a temperature of 325 ◦C and showed linear growth with a rate of 0. 06 nm/cycle. After annealing the samples at 700 ◦C for 6 minutes high temperature phase LiCoO 2 was obtained, as was demonstrated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. A new procedure was proposed to obtain the composition of all three chemical elements in the LiCoO 2 films.
