5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur. Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, {{and took his}} family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a passenger in the corpse.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned to the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, which therefore led him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no point in hiding it from them.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Buddhist temples, {{including}} Borobudur, at {{that time}} was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples. In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 CE. This has led some archaeologists to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise. However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the time—the Buddhist Sailendra and the Saivite Sanjaya—in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau. Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the Prambanan complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor Rakai Pikatan as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur, but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.|$|E

25|$|According to some, {{his first}} arrest {{was not the}} result of anti-Hasidic {{agitators}} fabricating charges, or officials seeking extortion monies. An accusation was made on May 8, 1798 by Hirsh ben David of Vilna accused him of trying to assist the French Revolution, by sending money to Napoleon and the Sultan. Since this Hirsch ben David was untraceable, some were led to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no such person as Hirsh and the authorities were attempting to stir up internecine fighting among the Jews.|$|E
25|$|Latter Day Saints do not {{typically}} distinguish between this Restoration {{movement and the}} broader Protestant Reformation, since both were an attempt by humans {{to return to the}} values and doctrines taught by Jesus and the Apostles, while most Latter Day Saint groups <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a need for God to actively restore both authority and doctrine. However, in spite of their different use of the word restoration, this movement was {{an important part of the}} culture that led Joseph Smith to become interested in religion.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prospecting}} in {{the area}} {{was done by the}} Englishmen Mr Donaldson and Mr Hinds on a portion of the farm Zoeten-Inval in 1896.

They returned to England to test the samples they had extracted, but died before reaching their destination when their ship sank in the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

25|$|Harris had {{a single}} meeting with Michelet in Oslo. At first Harris did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a {{significant}} Norwegian left-wing grouping, nor did he realize that the Russian presence and the conflict in Svalbard was real. Michelet initially wanted Harris to include details such as Jansen's father being a war sailor and that {{he came from a}} working-class family, but Harris, with Michelet's understanding, dropped much of the personal backdrop to shorten the storyline. However, the screenplay is loyal to the novel's political stance. Harris never visited Svalbard, although he traveled to Finnmark.|$|E
25|$|The oldest manuscripts {{discovered}} yet, {{including those}} of the Dead Sea Scrolls, date to about the 2nd century BCE. The common traditional dating of the Pentateuch suggests it was written between the 16th century and the 12th century BCE. Some secular scholars, who tend to suggest latter dates, <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a final redaction between 900-450 BCE. The traditional view is that all five books were written in immediate succession, but some scholars believe that Deuteronomy was written later than the other four books. Religious and secular scholars generally agree that the other books of the Bible were written at a latter date than the Pentateuch.|$|E

25|$|There is {{universal}} agreement that some Mesoamerican people practiced human sacrifice, {{but there is}} a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism in pre-Columbian America was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of Cannibals and Kings, has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. While most historians of the pre-Columbian era <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris's thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet. Others have hypothesized that cannibalism was part of a blood revenge in war.|$|E
25|$|This {{was also}} the belief of {{geologist}} Palmer, who convinced Steven Jones that the helium-3 occurring naturally in Earth perhaps came from fusion involving hydrogen isotopes inside catalysts like nickel and palladium. This led their team in 1986 to independently make the same experimental setup as Fleischmann and Pons (a palladium cathode submerged in heavy water, absorbing deuterium via electrolysis). Fleischmann and Pons had much the same belief, but they calculated the pressure to be of 1027 atmospheres, when cold fusion experiments only achieve a loading ratio of one to one, which only has between 10,000 and 20,000 atmospheres. John R. Huizenga says they had misinterpreted the Nernst equation, leading them to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> enough pressure to bring deuterons so {{close to each other}} that there would be spontaneous fusions.|$|E
25|$|Empedocles is {{considered}} the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, Purifications and On Nature. Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of Xenophanes and Parmenides– allusions to the latter {{can be found in}} the fragments,– but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. Aristotle called him the father of rhetoric, and, although he acknowledged only the meter as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of Homer, he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction. Lucretius speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model. The two poems together comprised 5000 lines. About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only one poem, and that the Purifications merely formed the beginning of On Nature.|$|E
