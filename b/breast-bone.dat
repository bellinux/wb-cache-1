2500|$|In 1772 Sheridan fought two duels with Captain Thomas Mathews, who {{had written}} a {{newspaper}} article defaming the character of Elizabeth Ann Linley, the woman Sheridan intended to marry. In the first duel, they agreed to fight in Hyde Park, but finding it too crowded they went first to the Hercules Pillars tavern (on the site where Apsley House now stands at Hyde Park Corner) {{and then on to}} the Castle Tavern in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Far from its romantic image, the duel was short and bloodless. Mathews lost his sword and, according to Sheridan, was forced to [...] "beg for his life" [...] and sign a retraction of the article. The apology was made public and Mathews, infuriated by the publicity the duel had received, refused to accept his defeat as final and challenged Sheridan to another duel. Sheridan was not obliged to accept this challenge, but could have become a social pariah if he had not. The second duel, fought in July 1772 at Kingsdown near Bath, was a much more ferocious affair. This time both men broke their swords but carried on fighting in a [...] "desperate struggle for life and honour". Both were wounded, Sheridan dangerously, being [...] "borne from the field with a portion of his antagonist's weapon sticking through an ear, his <b>breast-bone</b> touched, his whole body covered with wounds and blood, and his face nearly beaten to jelly with the hilt of Mathews' sword". His remarkable constitution pulled him through, and eight days after this bloody affair the Bath Chronicle was able to announce that he was out of danger. Mathews escaped in a post chaise.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{there was a}} splash in his plate, a skip-jack made of the <b>breast-bone</b> of a chicken had alighted there with a leap.|$|E
6000|$|Considine smiled rather ruefully. [...] "I {{believe my}} <b>breast-bone</b> is knocked in. Just {{help me to}} examine; but first catch my horse, like a good fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Inside these <b>breast-bones</b> I lie smutch'd and choked, [...] Beneath {{this face}} that appears so impassive hell's tides {{continually}} run, [...] Lusts and wickedness are acceptable to me, [...] I walk with delinquents with passionate love, [...] I feel I am of them--I belong to those convicts and prostitutes myself, [...] And henceforth I will not deny them--for how can I deny myself? ...|$|R
6000|$|No husband, no wife, no friend, {{trusted to}} hear the confession, [...] Another self, a {{duplicate}} of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, [...] Formless and wordless {{through the streets of}} the cities, polite and [...] bland in the parlors, [...] In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, [...] Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bedroom, [...] everywhere, [...] Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the [...] <b>breast-bones,</b> hell under the skull-bones, [...] Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, [...] Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, [...] Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{with his}} knife {{he made a}} slight {{incision}} down the <b>breast-bone,</b> and then proceeded to tear off the skin, bit by bit, feathers and all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody answered, {{but when}} the corpse was put down in the hold the mate {{examined}} it and found the broken point of Zola's knife stickin' in the <b>breast-bone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>breast-bone</b> is gone," [...] said Severall in {{the same}} awed whisper. [...] "He's broken to bits. Thank God {{that he had the}} laudanum. You can see by his face that he died in his sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{had been}} dead for months. All that was left was a clean-picked {{skeleton}} bleached by the snow and a few rags of clothes. The significant thing was that the <b>breast-bone</b> was cut through: sharply cleft, as if by an ax.” ...|$|E
60|$|At this {{exhibition}} of amusement on the countenance of his friend, Jumbo threw {{back his head}} and again showed not only his teeth and gums but the entire inside of his mouth, and chuckled softly from the region of his <b>breast-bone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And so will mine," [...] said Aziel, ceasing from a {{prolonged}} and fruitless effort to loosen his sword from the <b>breast-bone</b> of the savage, [...] "on such paths they are safer than any beasts. Friend, will you lead my mule with yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: The {{absence of}} any keel on the <b>breast-bone</b> and some other osteological peculiarities, {{observed}} by Professor Marsh, however, suggest that Hesperornis may be a modification of a less specialised group of birds than that to which these existing aquatic birds belong.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, dear master, I {{will ride}} on before. Do you follow gently, {{and if there}} be a pigeon in the pot in all Germany. I swear by {{the patron saint of}} every village for fifty miles round, {{provided}} they be not heretics, that you shall taste of its <b>breast-bone</b> this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am the mash'd fireman with <b>breast-bone</b> broken, [...] Tumbling walls buried me {{in their}} debris, [...] Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades, [...] I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels, [...] They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.|$|E
6000|$|A {{version of}} [...] "Binnorie." [...] The ballad here ends abruptly; doubtless the fiddler made fiddle-strings of the lady's hair, and a fiddle of her <b>breast-bone,</b> while the {{instrument}} probably revealed {{the cruelty of}} the sister. Other extant versions are composite or interpolated, so this fragment (Sharpe's) has been preferred in this place.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Halbert, [...] "I am {{incapable}} of a lie. I should choke on one were {{my life to}} require that I pronounced it. I say, that this sword of my father was through the body--the point came out behind his back--the hilt pressed upon his <b>breast-bone.</b> And I will plunge it as deep {{in the body of}} any one who shall dare to charge me with falsehood." ...|$|E
60|$|But we {{also were}} four, {{and thanks to}} Userti, two of us were clad in mail beneath our robes--four strong men {{fighting}} for their lives. Against us came four of the Hebrews. One leapt from the chariot straight at Seti, who received him upon the point of his iron sword, whereof I heard the hilt ring against his <b>breast-bone,</b> that same famous iron sword which to-day lies buried {{with him in his}} grave.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{round at}} the last moment for a weapon, then he turned {{suddenly}} at a sharp sudden pain, and saw Burleigh's clenched fist nearly touching his <b>breast-bone.</b> The hand came away from his breast again, and something with it. It went a long way off. Trayton Burleigh suddenly went to a great distance and the room darkened. It got quite dark, and Fletcher, with an attempt to raise his hands, let them fall to his side instead, and fell in a heap to the floor.|$|E
60|$|He {{seconded}} {{the word}} with the action, and plunged the dagger, which he suddenly displayed, into the broad breast of the English yeoman, with such fatal certainty and force that the hilt made a hollow sound against the <b>breast-bone,</b> and the double-edged point split {{the very heart}} of his victim. Harry Wakefield fell and expired with a single groan. His assassin next seized the bailiff by the collar, and offered the bloody poniard to his throat, whilst dread and surprise rendered the man incapable of defence.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Shore your <b>breast-bone</b> ain't smashed," [...] replied Wilson, hopefully. And {{he began}} to run his hand around one side of Anson's body and then the other. Abruptly he stopped, averted his gaze, then slowly ran the hand all along that side. Anson's ribs had been broken and crushed in {{by the weight of}} the horse. He was {{bleeding}} at the mouth, and his slow, painful expulsions of breath brought a bloody froth, which showed that the broken bones had penetrated the lungs. An injury sooner or later fatal! ...|$|E
60|$|A careful sight followed, and was {{repeated}} again and again, the bird continuing to rise higher and higher. Then followed the flash and the report. The swift messenger sped upward, and, {{at the next}} instant, the bird turned on its side, and came swooping down, now struggling with one wing {{and then with the}} other, sometimes whirling in a circuit, next fanning desperately as if conscious of its injury, until, having described several complete circles around the spot, it fell heavily into the end of the Ark. On examining the body, {{it was found that the}} bullet had pierced it about half way between one of its wings and the <b>breast-bone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 164. Then should I {{be struck}} {{into a very}} great trembling, insomuch that at {{sometimes}} I could, for whole days together, feel my very body, {{as well as my}} mind, to shake and totter under the sense of this dreadful judgment of God, that should fall on those that have sinned that most fearful and unpardonable sin. I felt also such a clogging and heat at my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was, especially at some times, as if my <b>breast-bone</b> would split asunder; then I thought of that concerning Judas, who by falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. Acts i. 18.|$|E
60|$|Embarking in the boat, he rowed {{towards a}} point of rocks jutting out into the sea, over which {{albatrosses}} had been seen hovering many times. On the way, Nellie, who had previously been taught what to do, fastened a small bit of wood {{to the end of}} the line she had spun. Hanging from this was a hook that the coxswain had made from a gull's <b>breast-bone.</b> It was baited with a piece of pork. Before arriving at the point of rocks, they saw that an albatross was soaring over it on its mighty outspread wings. On observing the boat, it flew away and disappeared in the distance; but Bob was not much concerned about that.|$|E
6000|$|... "a swift runner, a {{wonderful}} leaper, and, {{what was more}} rare, a boxer, [...] with some slight training.... He would allow the strongest boy in the [...] school to strike him with full force in the chest. He taught me the [...] secret, and I imitated him, after my measure. It was to inflate the [...] lungs to the uttermost, {{and at the moment}} of receiving the blow to [...] exhale the air. It looked surprising, and was, indeed, a little rough; [...] but with a good <b>breast-bone,</b> and some resolution, it was not difficult [...] to stand it. For swimming he was noted, being in many of his athletic [...] proclivities surprisingly like Byron in his youth." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, [...] "they sailed {{and they}} sailed," [...] and came {{at last to}} Fayal, where {{everything}} was so new and strange that Annie's big brown eyes could hardly spare time to sleep, so busy were they looking about. The donkeys amused her very much, so did the queer language and ways of the Portuguese people round her, especially the very droll names given to the hens of a young friend. The biddies seemed to speak the same dialect as at home, but evidently they understood Spanish also, and knew their own names, so {{it was fun to}} go and call Rio, Pico, Cappy, Clarissa, Whorfie, and poor Simonena, whose <b>breast-bone</b> grew out so that she could not eat and had to be killed.|$|E
6000|$|Whether {{it was the}} Wonderstone {{under his}} <b>breast-bone,</b> on {{the sight of his}} cudgel, or a distaste for his shrill voice and skinniness, Nod could not tell, but in a little while, when he stopped a moment to peer between the thick {{streamers}} of Samarak, the secret beast was gone. Day drew on. He saw no tracks in the snow, except of wild pig and long-snouted Brackanolls. The only sound he heard was the falling of frosted clots of snow from the branches of the trees and the sad, continuous [...] "Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!" [...] of the little rust-coloured Bittock amid the sunlit snow. He did not dare now to rest, though his feet grew more painful at every step, and his poisoned shoulder itched and ached.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This {{is where}} it is,' said Waterloo. 'If people jump off {{straight}} forwards {{from the middle of}} the parapet of the bays of the bridge, they are seldom killed by drowning, but are smashed, poor things; that's what THEY are; they dash themselves upon the buttress of the bridge. But you jump off,' said Waterloo to me, putting his fore- finger in a button-hole of my great-coat; 'you jump off from the side of the bay, and you'll tumble, true, into the stream under the arch. What you have got to do, is to mind how you jump in! There was poor Tom Steele from Dublin. Didn't dive! Bless you, didn't dive at all! Fell down so flat into the water, that he broke his <b>breast-bone,</b> and lived two days!' ...|$|E
60|$|Pambe {{measured}} {{the distance to}} Nurkeed's naked breast. If he sprang at him he might be tripped up, and a blind blow at the chest sometimes only means a gash on the <b>breast-bone.</b> Ribs are difficult to thrust between unless the subject be asleep. So he said nothing; nor did the other lascars. Their faces immediately dropped all expression, as is the custom of the Oriental when there is killing on the carpet or any chance of trouble. Nurkeed looked long at the white eyeballs. He was only an African, and could not read characters. A big sigh--almost a groan-- broke from him, and {{he went back to}} the furnaces. The lascars took up the conversation where he had interrupted it. They talked of the best methods of cooking rice.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, Elsley's ill-temper (as well as Lucia's) had its excuses in {{physical}} ill-health. Poor fellow! Long years of sedentary work {{had begun to}} tell upon him; and while Tom Thurnall's chest, {{under the influence of}} hard work and oxygen, measured round perhaps six inches more than it had done sixteen years ago, Elsley's, thanks to stooping and carbonic acid, measured six inches less. Short breath, lassitude, loss of appetite, heartburn, and all that fair company of miseries which Mr. Cockle and his Antibilious Pills profess to cure, are no cheering bosom friends; but when a man's <b>breast-bone</b> is gradually growing into his stomach, they will make their appearance; and small blame to him whose temper suffers from their gentle hints that he has a mortal body as well as an immortal soul.|$|E
6000|$|Another man {{joined the}} conference, crying: [...] "Oh, foolish men! What this babe says is true. He is the heart's heart of those white troops. For {{the sake of}} peace let them go both, for if he be taken, the {{regiment}} will break loose and gut the valley. Our villages are in the valley, and we shall not escape. That regiment are devils. They broke Khoda Yar's <b>breast-bone</b> with kicks {{when he tried to}} take the rifles; and if we touch this child they will fire and rape and plunder for a month, till nothing remains. Better to send a man back to take the message and get a reward. I say that this child is their God, and that they will spare none of us, nor our women, if we harm him." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Jones, {{the front}} of his soiled white tunic soaked and {{plastered}} against his <b>breast-bone,</b> staggered away from the water-pipe. Steadying himself on Ricardo's shoulder, he drew a long breath, raised his dripping head, and produced a smile of ghastly amiability, which was lost upon the thoughtful Heyst. Behind his back the sun, touching the water, was like a disc of iron cooled to a dull red glow, ready to start rolling round the circular steel plate of the sea, which, under the darkening sky, looked more solid than the high ridge of Samburan; more solid than the point, whose long outlined slope melted into its own unfathomable shadow blurring the dim sheen on the bay. The forceful stream from the pipe broke like shattered glass on the boat's gunwale. Its loud, fitful, and persistent splashing revealed the depths of the world's silence.|$|E
6000|$|But Tom {{was most}} {{astonished}} {{to see how}} he fired himself off--snap! like the leap-frogs which you make out of a goose's <b>breast-bone.</b> Certainly he took the most wonderful shots, and backwards, too. For, if he wanted to go into a narrow crack ten yards off, {{what do you think he}} did? If he had gone in head foremost, of course he could not have turned round. So he used to turn his tail to it, and lay his long horns, which carry his sixth sense in their tips (and nobody knows what that sixth sense is), straight down his back to guide him, and twist his eyes back till they almost came out of their sockets, and then made ready, present, fire, snap!--and away he went, pop into the hole; and peeped out and twiddled his whiskers, as much as to say, [...] "You couldn't do that." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Achilles {{drew his}} great sword, and flew on Memnon, and with sword-strokes they lashed {{at each other}} on shield and helmet, and the long {{horsehair}} crests of the helmets were shorn off, and flew down the wind, and their shields rang terribly beneath the sword strokes. They thrust at each others' throats between shield and visor of the helmet, they smote at knee, and thrust at breast, and the armour rang about their bodies, and the dust from beneath their feet rose up in a cloud around them, like mist round the falls of a great river in flood. So they fought, neither of them yielding a step, till Achilles made so rapid a thrust that Memnon could not parry it, and the bronze sword passed clean through his body beneath the <b>breast-bone,</b> and he fell, and his armour clashed as he fell.|$|E
60|$|And now, how did science {{confirm this}} statement, and scatter {{at once to}} the winds the foolish, brain-spun cobwebs of our windy, vaporous, modern evolutionists? These {{diagrams}} which he held before him would sufficiently answer that important question. He would show them {{that there was no}} real community of structure in any way between the two classes of birds and reptiles. Let them observe the tail, the wings, the feathers, the <b>breast-bone,</b> the entire anatomy, and they would see at once that Darwin's ridiculous, ill-digested theory was wholly opposed to all the plain and demonstrable facts of nature. It was a very learned discourse, certainly; very crushing, very overwhelming, very convincing (when you heard one side only), and not Netta alone, but the whole congregation of intelligent, inquiring artisans as well, was utterly carried away by its logic, its clearness, and its eloquent rhetoric. Last of all, Cyril Milliter raised his two white hands solemnly before him, and uttered thus his final peroration.|$|E
60|$|But not to sleep. He {{crouched}} on his snug dry bed of moss, and waited patiently till Battle's snores rose slow and mournful beneath the snow-piled roof. Then very quickly {{he put on}} his sheep's-coat over his Juzanda jacket and breeches. He crawled out, and lifted down with both hands the heavy bar of the door, and stole out into the moonlight again. He thrust his puckered hand under his jacket, and touched his skinny <b>breast-bone,</b> beneath which, ever since the little Horse of Tishnar had toppled him into the snow, he had felt the slumbering Wonderstone strangely burning. And, as if even Oomgar magic, too, might help him, he hobbled back into the hut and put Battle's little dog's-eared book into his pocket. Then, before his heart could fail him, he ran out as fast as his fours could carry him to where he had heard rise up in the night the Hunting-Song of Immanâla.|$|E
6000|$|He leaned far {{over the}} table, till his very <b>breast-bone</b> {{was over the}} edge, as though his eyes had been stilettos {{and he wanted to}} drive them home into my brain. It was only much later that I {{understood}} how near death I had been at that moment. But the knives on the tablecloth were the usual restaurant knives with rounded ends and about as deadly as pieces of hoop-iron. Perhaps in the very gust of his fury he remembered what a French restaurant knife is like and something sane within him made him give up the sudden project of cutting my heart out where I sat. For it could have been nothing but a sudden impulse. His settled purpose was quite other. It was not my heart that he was after. His fingers indeed were groping amongst the knife handles by the side of his plate but what captivated my attention for a moment were his red lips which were formed into an odd, sly, insinuating smile. Heard! To be sure he had heard! The chief of the great arms smuggling organization! ...|$|E
