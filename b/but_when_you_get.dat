500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in June 2001 at an {{airplane}} hangar at Los Angeles International Airport {{and at a}} Lifehouse show in London. It was directed by Marcos Siega, who is most notable for his work with Blink-182 and Papa Roach. In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing. From far away, the stage set looked normal, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> closer you get smaller and it gets huge. We were being filmed {{in front of this}} bookcase that was like 150 feet high. It's a real visual trip." [...] It premiered on VH1.com on June 27, 2001.|$|E

500|$|Tracy {{was set to}} star in a {{film version}} of The Yearling for 1942, but on-set {{difficulties}} and bad weather forced the production to close. With {{the end of that}} project, he became available for the new Katharine Hepburn movie, Woman of the Year (1942). Hepburn greatly admired Tracy, calling him [...] "the best movie actor there was". She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle, The Philadelphia Story (1940). Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for Woman of the Year, saying [...] "I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me." [...] The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews. William Boehnel wrote in the New York World-Telegram, [...] "To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot, you've got something to cheer about." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> on set {{you have so many}} different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things {{to each other about}} their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into religion, some people get very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is an equal opportunity offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E

My advice to you is this, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>get</b> yer sure a while afterwards to want something else, and to wish as you had bought that instead; that's human nature, and it's the same with men, women, and boys--at least that's my 'sperience, and mother {{will tell you the}} same. My advice is, give that money to mother to keep for you, say for a month. Well then, every day you can settle fresh what you mean to buy, and that will be most as good as buying it; perhaps {{towards the end of the}} month you will have settled yer mind on to something which really seems to you better than all the others: that's my advice." ...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, but this is my first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

Now, some of that can balance out. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to cutting the services for the least of thesein the 25th chapter of Matthew in the 37th verse the Lord says, 'Whatsoever you do to the least of these, so also you do unto me'that's when I question whether somebody is really living out the faith that they profess". The interviewer noted that Granholm would be criticized, but she hoped that everyone would [...] "keep those values in mind...through the budget process". Betsy DeVos, {{the chairman of the}} Michigan Republican Party (1996–2000, 2003-05), was upset that Granholm had decided [...] "to cloak her views on balancing the budget in religious terms in order to demonize her political opponents". Granholm responded that she did not think her response was controversial and said that many people of faith were serving in state government.|$|E
2500|$|... "There's a {{tone and}} feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march {{and a kind}} of rambunctious energy to it that, for me, I {{immediately}} wanted to tap into. I showed [...] some references from the classic rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get into places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [...] There's less order and more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." [...] "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," [...] he said. [...] "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people are really gonna flip on this".|$|E

2500|$|Friedgen {{was born}} on April 4, 1947 in Harrison, New York. His father, [...] "Big Ralph" [...] Friedgen, {{attended}} Fordham University, where he played from 1938 to 1939, and coached high school football for 30years. The younger Friedgen worked under his father as a water boy and manager, and the two often attended New York Giants and Jets games together. He attended Harrison High School where he played quarterback on his father's team. John Nugent, the head coach of Harrison's rival Rye High School, recommended that his brother, Maryland head coach Tom Nugent, recruit Friedgen. His recruitment was handled by Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at the school. After his first season at Maryland, Nugent was fired as head coach, and his successor Lou Saban moved Friedgen to fullback to fill in for an injured teammate. The following year, Maryland had a new coach, and Bob Ward again changed Friedgen's position, this time to offensive guard, although he had never blocked before. Upset about the constant turnover at head coach and position changes, Friedgen received a favorable recommendation to transfer from coach Ward, but his father said, [...] "You can transfer, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> home, the key you have {{is not going to}} fit the door because we're changing the lock. Quitters don't live here." [...] He remained at Maryland as a guard and later said the experience taught him a lesson in perseverance. As an undergraduate, {{he was a member of}} Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. After completion of his bachelor's degree in physical education in 1970, Friedgen served as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, before later accepting positions on the staffs of The Citadel, William and Mary, and Murray State. Joining him on many of these coaching stops was Frank Beamer, who later served as head coach at Virginia Tech.|$|E

40|$|Accepting a {{sequence}} of independent positive mean bets that are individually unacceptable is what Samuelson called a fallacy of large numbers. Recently, utility functions were characterized where this occurs rationally, and examples were given of utility functions where any finite number of good bets should never be accepted. 1 Here the author shows how things change if you are allowed the option to quit early: Subject to some mild conditions, you should essentially always accept a sufficiently long finite sequence of good bets. Interestingly, the strategy of quitting <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> ahead does not perform well, <b>but</b> quitting <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> behind does. This sheds some light on more possible behavioral reasons for Samuelson's fallacy, as well as strategies for handling a series of sequentially observed good investments.
