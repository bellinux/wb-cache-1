The aim of IANH is to identify and reduce or remove sources of variability and irreproducibility in existing protocols. Here, we present results of the first IANH round robin studies into methods to assess the size and surface charge of suspended nanoparticles. The test materials used (suspensions of gold, silica, polystyrene, and ceria nanoparticles, with [primary] particles sizes between 10 nm and 80 nm) were first analysed in repeatability conditions to assess the possible contribution of between-sample heterogeneity to the <b>between-laboratory</b> variability. <b>Reproducibility</b> of the selected methods was investigated in an interlaboratory comparison between ten different laboratories in the USA and Europe. Robust statistical {{analysis was used to}} evaluate within- and between-laboratory variability. It is shown that, if detailed shipping, measurement, and reporting protocols are followed, measurement of the hydrodynamic particle diameter of nanoparticles in predispersed monomodal suspensions using the dynamic light scattering method is reproducible. On the other hand, measurements of more polydisperse suspensions of nanoparticle aggregates or agglomerates were not reproducible between laboratories. Ultrasonication, which is commonly used to prepare dispersions before cell exposures, was observed to further increase variability.

40|$|Determination of moisture, fat, protein, {{and other}} {{components}} of meat {{is important for}} the evaluation of the quality of raw materials and finished products, the assessment of process control, and for ensuring regulatory compliance of meat products. Standard methods of analysis may be time- or labor-intensive, expensive, potentially harmful to the user or environment, or may require advanced training for operation of analytical equipment, but technology has allowed the introduction of more rapid methods that require less time, labor, skill, and cost. Microwave drying and nuclear magnetic resonance technologies for the determination of moisture and fat in meat products, respectively, have been incorporated into the CEM Smart Trac 5 System?, an instrument designed for the rapid analysis of moisture and fat in various food products. The CEM Smart Trac 5 System?, approved as an AOAC Peer Verified Method, was used in a collaborative study for the rapid determination of moisture and fat in a variety of raw and processed meat products of beef, pork, chicken, and turkey origin. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine if the CEM Smart Trac 5 System? could analyze moisture and fat in meat products with the same accuracy and precision as standard methods of analysis as specified by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC). Meat products were obtained from various commercial sources, homogenized, and distributed to 10 collaborative laboratories. Each collaborative laboratory evaluated the fat and moisture content of each meat product samples provided using the CEM Smart Trac 5 System?. Two standard methods of analysis, Forced Air Drying Method (AOAC Official Method 950. 46) and Soxhlet Extraction of Crude Fat (AOAC Official Method 960. 39), were performed on each sample for comparison to the Smart Trac 5 System?. Ten replicates were analyzed by the reference methods to achieve an analytical variance of no more than + 2 %. Data collected from the reference methods for moisture (AOAC 950. 46) and fat (AOAC 960. 39) were used for the calibration of each of the CEM Smart Trac 5 Systems? and for comparison to the results produced by the Smart Trac 5 System? in each of the collaborative laboratories. The results indicated that the CEM Smart Trac 5 System? compares favorably with the AOAC methods for moisture and fat determination. The CEM Smart Trac 5 System? would be suitable for the rapid determination of moisture and fat in a variety of commercially produced raw and processed meat and poultry products. Statistical analysis confirmed the within-laboratory repeatability qualities of AOAC methods and provided a baseline for comparing the <b>between-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> potential of the CEM Smart Trac 5 System?.

40|$|CORESTA joint {{experiment}} work in 2006 had compared {{data on a}} {{wide range}} of smoke constituents obtained from Kentucky reference cigarettes (1 R 5 F and 2 R 4 F), according to the existing methods used by participants. This work had identified that the methods used to determine aromatic amine yields in mainstream smoke would particularly benefit from further study to investigate the main weaknesses and influencing factors in their yield variability before progressing to full method standardisation. This report describes the output from a 2007 joint experiment to address these issues. Participating laboratories carried out experiments to investigate several factors that had been identified in the methodology as potential sources of variability. These were the amine derivative type, the derivatisation time and the point at which the addition of the internal standard for calibration occurred. A statistical assessment was made of their possible influence on aromatic amine smoke yields and yield reproducibility across different laboratories. Results showed that aromatic amines again had poor between-laboratory yield reproducibility. The stage at which the internal standard was added to the smoke sample had the most significant effect on yields. The least variable data were obtained when it was added directly after extraction from the filter pad rather than later in the process. It also appeared beneficial to use at least two calibration standards (i. e., an aminonaphthalene and an aminobiphenyl) to minimise yield differences although this recommendation was not supported by statistically significant data. Large differences in yields were not found when comparing the two studied derivatising agents especially when compared against the greater overall between-laboratory variability. Any differences between laboratories in total particulate matter and puff count at the smoke collection stage did not appear to significantly contribute to betweenlaboratory differences in yields. It appeared that some laboratories had significantly improved their methodology since the last study although high values for the <b>between-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> in this study were still found. It may be that significant improvements in reproducibility may not be forthcoming for compounds such as the aromatic amines measured at low nanogram smoke yields. Some important features that need to be controlled to minimise variability were identified in this study and will be incorporated within a collaborative study leading to a recommended method. Also, a wider range of product styles will need to be investigated, to determine the effects of differences in tobacco blends and product styles and the potential of greater product variability of commercial products. This should provide more robust estimates of within-laboratory repeatability and <b>between-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility...</b>|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{the skin}} {{sensitisation}} hazard of chemicals has traditionally relied {{on the use of}} animals. Progress in the development of alternative methods has been prompted by the increasing knowledge of the key biological mechanisms underlying this human health effect, as documented by the OECD's recent report summarising the key biological events leading to skin sensitisation ("Adverse Outcome Pathway" (AOP) for skin sensitisation). The molecular initiating event defined within this AOP is the covalent binding of chemicals with skin proteins. Thus peptide reactivity assays may provide valuable information in the context of integrated approaches such as Weight of Evidence (WoE) or Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) for skin sensitisation hazard and safety assessment. Based on these considerations, EURL ECVAM coordinated a validation study on the Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA) addressing mainly the test method’s transferability and within- and <b>between-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility.</b> Following independent scientific peer review by the EURL ECVAM’s Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) and having considered the input from regulators, stakeholders, international partners and the general public, EURL ECVAM concluded that the DPRA may prove a valuable component of a WoE or ITS for skin sensitisation hazard assessment.

Dichlorvos, an organophosphorus anticholinesterase pesticide, was extracted from wheat with hexane, and the filtered extract was directly analyzed by gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus flame detection (NPD). Recoveries of dichlorvos from milled wheat spiked at 0. 25 - 1. 5 mu g/g ranged from 96. 5 to 100. 9 %, and the limit of detection was 0. 02 mu g/g. The electrochemical assay {{was based on the}} detection of choline, the acetylcholinesterase product, via a choline oxidase biosensor. An aliquot of the filtered hexane extract was partitioned with phosphate buffer solution, and the organic layer was evaporated prior to electrochemical analysis. A limit of detection of 0. 05 mu g/g of dichlorvos was obtained with mean recoveries of 97 - 103 % at spiking levels of 0. 25 - 1. 5 mu g/g.

Two laboratories, experienced with Caco- 2 cultures {{participated in this}} study. Ten test chemicals with documented in vivo oral absorption data were selected by the Management Team. Atenolol, Cimetidine and propranolol were included as reference compounds for low, medium and high intestinal absorption, respectively. Transport experiments were independently {{carried out in the}} two laboratories, in accordance with the established protocol. The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated either in apical to basolateral (absorption) or in basolateral to apical (efflux) direction. To investigate the involvement of possible active transport processes, experiments were also run in the presence of Sodium Azide plus 2 -deoxy-D-glucose in the donor compartment. Before performing the permeability experiments the highest concentration that did not impair barrier integrity was identified for each test chemical in both cell models by applying the chemicals together with a marker of the paracellular pathway ([14 C]-Mannitol or Lucifer Yellow). Measurement of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was also used as a marker of barrier integrity. All permeability data obtained were collected and submitted to ECVAM for an independent biostatistical analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) was selected as an appropriate measure of within-laboratory variability. Median CVs of 10. 5 % and 15. 5 % were found for each laboratory.

40|$|The {{potential}} for a compound to induce carcinogenicity is a key consideration when ascertaining hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. Among the in vitro alternatives {{that have been developed}} for predicting carcinogenicity, in vitro cell transformation assays (CTAs) have been shown to involve a multistage process that closely models important stages of in vivo carcinogenesis and have the potential to detect both genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens. These assays have been in use for decades and a substantial amount of data demonstrating their performance is available in the literature. However, for the standardised use of these assays for regulatory purposes, a formal evaluation of the assays, in particular focusing on development of standardised transferable protocols and further information on assay reproducibility, was considered important to serve as a basis for the drafting of generally accepted OECD test guidelines. To address this issue, a prevalidation study of the CTAs using the BALB/c 3 T 3 cell line, SHE cells at pH 6. 7, and SHE cells at pH 7. 0 was coordinated by ECVAM and focused on issues of standardisation of protocols, test method transferability and within- and <b>between-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility.</b> The study resulted in the availability of standardised protocols that had undergone prevalidation [1 - 2] that should serve as basis for future use. The results of the ECVAM study demonstrated that for the BALB/c 3 T 3 method, some modifications to the protocol were needed to obtain reproducible results between laboratories, while the SHE pH 6. 7 and the SHE pH 7. 0 protocols are transferable between laboratories, and results are reproducible within- and between-laboratories. It is recommended that the BALB/c 3 T 3 and SHE protocols as instituted in this prevalidation study should be used in future applications of these respective transformation assays.
