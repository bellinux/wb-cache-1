The asphalt coating is impermeable and presents a secondary immobilizing barrier effectively preventing any pollutant getting leached by aqueous solutions.

In {{an attempt to}} understand how the blanking process affects edge fracture, an experimental and numerical study was undertaken on the plane-strain <b>blanking</b> process. <b>Blanking</b> <b>tests</b> on a DP 780 steel sheet were carried out on a special fixture utilizing a in-situ microscope for the digital mage correlation (DIC) deformation measurement. The DIC method provides a detailed deformation field of the specimen that has not been reported in any other publications before.

Inhibition of biomass growth was performed by variation of 9 K medium by increasing ferrous iron concentration (substrate inhibition), by addition of limestone (inhibition by pH increase) and olive pomace (inhibition by organic compounds). Inhibition tests of batch growth were performed according to a full factorial design with three factors (ferrous iron, limestone and olive pomace) taken at two levels. <b>Blank</b> <b>tests</b> were also performed in the same operating conditions but without inoculum.

Biomass characterization was performed by determining the sequence of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene that denoted a 100 % homology with the sequence of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, one of the main bacteria responsible for acid mine drainage. Experimental data of cell growth denoted a strong inhibition in all the operating conditions, except the case when larger ferrous iron concentrations were used. <b>Blank</b> <b>tests</b> allowed isolation of the effect of chemical speciation frorn the effect due to metabolic activities.
