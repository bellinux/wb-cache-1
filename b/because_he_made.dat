From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
5|$|If an {{employee}} does {{make such a}} disclosure, Section 2 inserts a new Section 47B, providing that the employee shall suffer no detriment in their employment as a result. This includes both negative actions {{and the absence of}} action, and as such covers discipline, dismissal, or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided. If {{an employee}} does suffer a detriment, he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3. In front of an employment tribunal, the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation, and to reverse the burden of proof; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure, this dismissal is automatically considered unfair. Similarly, under Section 6, an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> such a disclosure. These sections take into account Section 7, which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect.|$|E
25|$|Mondino de Luzzi, or de Liuzzi or de Lucci, (ca. 1270– 1326), {{also known}} as Mundinus, was an Italian physician, anatomist and {{professor}} of surgery, who {{lived and worked in}} Bologna. He is often credited as the restorer of anatomy <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> seminal contributions to the field by reintroducing the practice of public dissection of human cadavers and writing the first modern anatomical text.|$|E

25|$|The Republicans' defeats in 1932 and 1936 plunged {{their party}} into {{a period of}} bitter intraparty strife. Landon played an {{important}} role in ending this internal bickering in 1938, in helping to prepare a new group of leaders for the presidential campaign of 1940, and in trying to bring about a compromise between the isolationist and internationalist viewpoints in foreign policy. Landon declined a position in Franklin Roosevelt's Cabinet <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> his acceptance contingent upon the President's renunciation of a third term.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 2010, Bayh {{announced}} he would not seek reelection to a third Senate term in the November 2, 2010 midterm election. Bayh's announcement came very shortly after former Senator Dan Coats declared his own candidacy for Bayh's Senate seat. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> his announcement {{the day before the}} deadline for filing for the primary, no Democrat was able to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the primary ballot, so the state party committee chose Congressman Brad Ellsworth as the nominee.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the final}} race {{at the street}} circuit in Adelaide, Australia Prost was fired from the Ferrari team <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> some scathing {{comments}} about the team and described his car as a 'truck' and the Ferrari team as unwilling {{to work with him}} during a press conference for the Japanese Grand Prix. He was replaced by Ferrari test driver Gianni Morbidelli (who had been driving for Minardi).

25|$|President Franklin Pierce {{recognized}} Guthrie's financial acumen {{and appointed}} him Secretary of the Treasury in 1853. Soon, {{he became the}} most influential member of Pierce's cabinet. A hard money Democrat, Guthrie was opposed to a national bank and to the issuance of small distinctive notes by free and charter banks. He advocated for {{the adoption of a}} universal currency that would be convertible to gold on demand. In his first report, he was critical of his predecessor, Thomas Corwin, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> private arrangements for debt repurchases. He also accused Corwin of conspiring with a New York port master to under-report duties collected and deposit them into a trust. Guthrie caused a brief public uproar by removing the port master from his post.|$|E
25|$|But these differences, though {{demonstrating a}} Lagašite respect of {{religious}} figures simply {{in the amount}} of time and energy they required, is not as telling as the language Gudea uses to justify any punishment. Whereas Sargon or Naram-Sin simply demand punishment to any who change their words, based on their power, Gudea defends his words through tradition, “since the earliest days, since the seed sprouted forth, no one was (ever) supposed to alter the utterance of a ruler of Lagaš who, after building the Eninnu for my lord Ningirsu, made things function as they should”. Changing the words of Naram-Sin, the living god, is treason, because he is the king. But changing the words of Gudea, simple governor of Lagaš, is unjust, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> things work right.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{only two}} non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter {{were the only}} Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was {{controversial}} and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps {{to make room for}} Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in track position due to the driver change, Hamlin got back to the front to take the checkered flag after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the win <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.|$|E

500|$|Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein {{finished}} his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus with {{the proposition that}} [...] "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." [...] Beverly and Brian Clack have suggested that because of this statement, Wittgenstein was taken for a positivist by many of his disciples <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a distinction between what can and cannot be spoken about. They argue that this interpretation is inaccurate because Wittgenstein held the mystical, which cannot be described, as important. Rather than dismissing the mystical as meaningless, as the logical positivists did, Wittgenstein believed that while {{the facts of the}} world remain the same, the perspective from which they are viewed will vary.|$|E
500|$|Matthias's former {{brother-in-law}} Victor of Poděbrady invaded Austria {{in early}} 1468. Emperor Frederick appealed to Matthias for support, hinting {{at the possibility}} of Matthias's election as King of the Romansfirst step towards the imperial throne. Matthias declared war on Victor's father King George of Bohemia on 31 March. He said he also wanted to help the Czech Catholic lords against their [...] "heretic monarch" [...] whom the Pope had excommunicated. Matthias expelled the Czech troops from Austria and invaded Moravia and Silesia. He took an active part in the fighting; he was injured during the siege of Třebíč in May 1468 and was captured at Chrudim while spying out the enemy camp in disguise in February 1469. On the latter occasion, he was released <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> his prisoners believe he was a local Czech groom.|$|E
500|$|Childe has {{typically}} {{been seen}} as a Marxist archaeologist, being the first archaeologist in the West to use Marxist theory in his work. McNairn noted that Marxism was [...] "a major intellectual force in Childe's thought", while Trigger stated that Childe identified with Marx's theories [...] "both emotionally and intellectually". Biographer Sally Green noted that Childe's beliefs were [...] "never dogmatic, always idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "continually changing throughout his life" [...] but that [...] "Marxist views on a model of the past" [...] were accepted by Childe because they offer [...] "a structural analysis of culture in terms of economy, sociology and ideology, and a principle for cultural change through economy." [...] She noted that [...] "Childe's Marxism" [...] often differed from the orthodox Marxism of his contemporaries <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> reference to the original texts of Hegel, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels rather than later interpretations and because he was selective in his use of their writings. Similarly, McNairn considered Childe's Marxism to be [...] "an individual interpretation" [...] that differed from [...] "popular or orthodox" [...] conceptions of Marxism.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group E, along with Dutch champions PSV, Greek club Panathinaikos and Norwegian side Rosenborg. An Alex own goal {{was enough for}} Arsenal to claim three points against PSV on the first matchday. The team drew away to Rosenborg and earnt a point at Panathinaikos, despite twice having taken the lead at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences. Wenger accepted referee Herbert Fandel's decision, but added his surprise that Mark van Bommel was not cautioned: [...] "If {{you look at the}} number of fouls he made without being punished it is very surprising <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> some deliberate fouls. Some people might criticise Patrick when we were down to 10 men but he felt he had to fight harder to win the ball." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E
500|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were cloudy with an air temperature ranging from [...] and a track temperature between [...] Approximately 75,000 people attended the event. Most of the field chose a strategy of running at the front of the pack for as long as they could without driving to the lead because it would consume more fuel than needed and thus they elected to draft behind other cars. Barron started from the back of the field <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a pit stop to have his electronics box changed. The start of the race was delayed to 1.27 p.m. because more rain had fallen. Tagliani maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Da Matta passed him around the outside to move into first but Herta got ahead of him to lead the first lap. After starting 12th, Tracy had moved into second by the sixth lap, while Herta lost the first position to Papis. Da Matta reclaimed the lead by lap 10 and held a three-tenths advantage over Papis, who in turn was two-tenths in front of Tracy. Franchitti had moved up into fourth, and was 0.6 seconds ahead of Gidley in fifth.|$|E

500|$|Asquith {{was partly}} blamed for Gallipoli and other {{disasters}} and was overthrown in December 1916, when David Lloyd George proposed a war council under his authority, with the Conservatives {{in the coalition}} threatening to resign unless the plan was implemented. After failure to reach agreement, Lloyd George and then Asquith resigned, followed by Lloyd George becoming Prime Minister. Lloyd George formed a new government, from which Churchill, active again in the House of Commons from June 1916, was excluded because of Conservative opposition. In the summer of 1917, Churchill was eventually appointed to the cabinet-level post of Minister of Munitions {{but not to the}} War Cabinet. The final report of the Commission was issued in 1919, concluding that with the forces available, success was dependent on the government giving priority to the expedition and leaving the British Expeditionary Force in France to make do. The Commissioners found that Hamilton had been over-optimistic from the beginning and had added to Stopford's difficulties on 8 August 1915. Hamilton emerged from the investigation more favourably than perhaps was justified, partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> devious attempts to gain collusion from witnesses and obtain leaks from the [...] deliberations of the Commission; Hamilton was never given another army appointment.|$|E
500|$|While in Los Angeles, Brinkley toured KHJ, a {{radio station}} Chandler owned. He {{immediately}} saw the power radio held as an advertising and marketing medium and resolved to build his own to promote his services, even though at the time advertising on public airwaves was very much discouraged. By 1923, he had enough capital to build KFKB ("Kansas First, Kansas Best" [...] or sometimes [...] "Kansas Folks Know Best") using a 1kilowatt transmitter. That same year, the St. Louis Star published a scathing expose of medical diploma mills, and in 1924, the Kansas City Journal Post followed suit, bringing unwelcome attention Brinkley's way. In July 1924, a grand jury in San Francisco handed down 19 indictments to people responsible for conferring fake medical degrees, and for some doctors who received them; Brinkley was one, due mostly to his questionable application for a California medical license. [...] When agents from California came to arrest Brinkley, the governor of Kansas refused to extradite him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> the state too much money. Brinkley took to his radio station's airwaves to crow about his victory over the American Medical Association and Fishbein, who by this time had started giving speeches and writing articles for the Journal of the American Medical Association deriding Brinkley and his treatments as quackery. [...] His gland business made more money than ever, and had begun attracting patients from around the globe.|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>made</b> a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring".

You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they {{no longer have to}} pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E
