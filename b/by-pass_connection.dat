40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{possibility}} of employing narrow band power line communication (PLC) in medium voltage (MV) distribution networks. The topic is investigated by means of both simulations and experimental tests, which were carried out in the distribution network of Ustica Island. In detail, a two-way MV communication was tested between two secondary substations connected by an MV cable power line. Each substation has a <b>by-pass</b> <b>connection</b> at MV bus-bars and an MV/LV oil filled power transformer. In this paper, the MV and the PLC systems under test are described and the experimental tests are presented, which were carried out to evaluate the parameters of the simulation model. The aforesaid model is described and a comparison is shown between simulation and results of experiments, which were carried out in the presence of voltage net, i. e., 24 kV. Finally, the possibility is investigated of a reliable communication and the faster achievable bit-rate; the analysis is performed by means of further experimental results of several communication tests, which were carried out with different modulation technique...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} the image super-resolution (SR) problem. The main challenge of image SR is to recover high-frequency details of a low-resolution (LR) image that are important for human perception. To address this essentially ill-posed problem, we introduce a Deep Edge Guided REcurrent rEsidual~(DEGREE) network to progressively recover the high-frequency details. Different from most of existing methods that aim at predicting high-resolution (HR) images directly, DEGREE investigates an alternative route to recover {{the difference between a}} pair of LR and HR images by recurrent residual learning. DEGREE further augments the SR process with edge-preserving capability, namely the LR image and its edge map can jointly infer the sharp edge details of the HR image during the recurrent recovery process. To speed up its training convergence rate, <b>by-pass</b> <b>connections</b> across multiple layers of DEGREE are constructed. In addition, we offer an understanding on DEGREE from the view-point of sub-band frequency decomposition on image signal and experimentally demonstrate how DEGREE can recover different frequency bands separately. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of DEGREE over well-established baselines and DEGREE also provides new state-of-the-arts on these datasets...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{conventional}} PV module {{system based on}} crystalline Si solar cell, solder joint {{has been used for}} electrical connection in the four positions such as (1) Cu ribbon interconnection on Ag electrode of Si solar cell, (2) electrical connection of Cu ribbon, (3) <b>by-pass</b> diode <b>connection</b> in the junction box, (4) inverter connection. There are two kinds of solder joint failure modes, (1) Ag or Cu leaching into solder and (2) long-term solder joint fatigue. In both cases, crack is generated and DC arcing discharge may happen at the crack. It is well known phenomena as Ag leaching in the electronic packaging that Ag easily dissolves into solder during the soldering process. Because Ag 3 Sn compound formed in the solder as result of Ag leaching is rigid and brittle material, crack is generated at the interface between solder and Ag dissolved area. It induces to increase contact resistivity of Cu ribbon and Ag electrode of Si cell and to disconnect the Cu ribbon from Si cell in the worst case. It has been reported as solder joint failure that the bus line of Cu ribbon heated up is one of suspicious causes of PV fire. [4] We observed the two types of crack after 1000 thermal cycles from + 85 to - 40 degree C. The crack at the interface between Cu ribbon and Ag electrode may be due to Ag leaching. The crack inside solder joint composed of large grain growing by repeated thermal stress is typical long-term fatigue. Considering highly reliable PV module system, we should pay attention to protect solder joint failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing number}} of {{vehicles}} on the road {{has led to a}} rapid increase in fuel consumption and toxic gas emissions, so the challenges in fuel efficiency improvement and reduction of CO 2 and NOx emissions have always been on the top agenda of the automotive industry. The paper presents a feasibility study of recovering the low-pressure exhaust gas energy via <b>by-pass</b> <b>connection</b> of a scroll expander to the engine system exhaust. The paper starts with the description of the proposed new exhaust energy recycling scheme and the mathematical modelling of the system. A feasibility study is carried out to investigate whether this new scheme can work with the engine operation conditions specified by the engine test data. The initial study indicated that the scroll expander structure needs to be modified; otherwise, it cannot be used for exhaust energy recovery. The experimental test and simulation results presented in this paper indicate that it is feasible to recover the low-pressure exhaust gas energy using a scroll expander with a modified structure. The proposed energy recovery system has the potential to produce over 400 W power output with over 90 % of engine exhaust flow recycling...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to perform a {{feasibility}} study on the power line communication {{for the development of}} a new generation of interface devices (IDs) for smart grid and energy storage applications. More in detail, this paper deals with one of the most important issues on this topic, which is the communication system. Among the existing communication technologies, the study is focused on power line communications (PLCs). After an analysis of the state of the art in the field, the main aspects are analyzed, concerning the open issues on the use of PLCs, especially for medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) systems. In this work the use of PLC in MV-LV networks is investigated, by means of experimental tests in the case of a two-ways MV/LV communication between two secondary substations connected by a MV overhead power line by considering a ST 7580 transceiver used in a new ID developed by the authors. Each substation has a <b>by-pass</b> <b>connection</b> at MV bus-bars and a MV/LV oil filled power transformer. Firstly, communication issues are presented, secondly experimental test in the presence of voltage net, i. e. 24 kV have been carried out to verify the possibility of power transformer crossing...|$|E
30|$|In 2013, {{prostate}} cancer {{was the most}} frequently diagnosed cancer in males (1.4 million) worldwide, while the incidence is still low in developing countries [2]. In 2008, approximately 14 % of {{prostate cancer}} worldwide was diagnosed within the Asia-Pacific region, with three {{out of every four}} being diagnosed in Japan (32 %), China (28 %), or Australia (15 %) [3]. The bone (90 %), lung (46 %), and liver (25 %) are well-known and common metastatic sites of prostate cancer [1]. In general, liver metastasis occurs as a part of systemic dissemination of prostate cancer [4]. Therefore, solitary liver metastasis of prostate cancer is extremely rare. Batson et al. referred to the importance of the vertebral venous system (Batsonâ€™s plexus) as a metastatic pathway of prostate cancer. The vertebral venous system with their rich, valveless ramifications and <b>connections</b> <b>by-passes</b> the portal system, so this system offers a possible reason why a solitary metastatic prostate cancer occurred. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful resection of a solitary metastatic liver tumor from prostate cancer in the medical literature. Although the utility of hepatic resection for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer or endocrine tumors has been established, for patients with non-colorectal, non-endocrine liver metastases, it remains unclear because of the limited numbers of patients in each primary tumor groups [5]. Adam et al. reported 5 -year overall survival rates of patients with liver metastases from urologic cancer after hepatic resection of 66 % in adrenal, 55 % in testicular, and 38 % in renal cancer, respectively; furthermore, these authors report that these patients may benefit from hepatic resection [5]. Herein, we also discuss portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after hepatectomy which is relatively rare complication. Kuboki et al. reported that the incidence rate of PVT after hepatectomy was 2.1 % and that right-side hepatectomy, caudate lobectomy, splenectomy, and postoperative bile leakage were independent risk factors for PVT after hepatectomy [6]. Although this patient had no risk factors for PVT after hepatectomy, he had a past medical history of unidentified arterial thromboses, so this might have caused PVT. Hepatic resection for a solitary metastatic liver tumor from prostate cancer is one possible therapeutic option, provided that the systemic metastatic work-up is negative. In such a rare circumstance, hepatic resection for liver metastasis of prostate cancer seems justified.|$|R
