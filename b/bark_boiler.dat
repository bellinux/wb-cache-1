40|$|This thesis {{goes into}} the task of {{analysing}} a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> {{and the structure of}} its automatic control system. The boiler being discussed is located at Billerud Karlsborg AB, although the results are {{to be able to be}} used on any BFB <b>bark</b> <b>boiler.</b> The main objective is to try to answer the following question: Exists there any changes to be made to the current structure of the control system that will add any significant improvements in the operation of the boiler, and if so what are those changes? As no experiments were able to be carried out on the boiler, the analysis were done with measurements from a normal day of running. This lead to rather inaccurate results in the modeling of the boiler, especially concerning the modeling of the bed temperature. The control structure evaluation was nevertheless carried out, as also weaker process models can point on improvements to be made. RGA analysis made it clear that with the current process knowledge, the decentralized control structure currently in use were the only decent option. HIIA analysis, although with uncertain results because of the modeling work, indicated on the possibility that the oxygen content controller could be complemented with a feed-forward signal from the bark and basic air flow input.

40|$|Tannery {{and timber}} {{treatment}} effluents {{are considered to}} be the major source of Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr) and Arsenic (As) heavy metal contamination into the environment. Chromium is used in tanneries for the treatment of hides and skins whereas, copper, chromium, and arsenic (CCA) solution is used as the timber treatment chemical. Chromium is used as Cr (III) in tannery industry and as Cr (VI) in timber treatment industry. Arsenic and Cr (VI) which are present in the timber treatment effluent are highly toxic and carcinogenic. An initial survey has indicated that some tannery industries in New Zealand have not developed pre-treatment practices to reduce the heavy metal concentration before discharging the effluent into soil or waterways. The heavy metal pollution due to timber treatment industries may occur from the drips, leaks and spills due to poor handling of CCA solution while treating timber. In this project, the potential value of industrial waste materials, such as Pinus radiata <b>bark,</b> fluidised bed <b>boiler</b> ash (FBA), flue gas desulphurisation gypsum (FGDG) and natural resources, such as zeolite, peat soil, and two soils (Tokomaru and Egmont soils) to reduce heavy metal concentration in tannery and timber treatment effluents was examined. The value of these materials in the remediation of soil contaminated with Cr was examined using a growth experiment. The effect of pre-treatment of Pinus bark with acid, alkali of formaldehyde/acid on the retention of Cr was examined. Pre-treatment of Pinus bark increased the heavy metal retention only at low heavy metal concentration and did not significantly improve the heavy metal retention at high concentration. The extent of adsorption increased with an increase in surface area of Pinus bark material. Speciation of Cr indicated that Cr (VI) is reduced to Cr (III) and adsorbed onto the Pinus bark. FBA was found to be most efficient in reducing the Cr (III) concentration from tannery effluent and As and Cu concentrations in the timber treatment effluent. In the case of Cr (VI), the highest retention was shown by the Pinus bark and the peat soil. The increased retention of Cr (III), Cu and As by FBA was due to the precipitation of Cr (III) as chromium hydroxide, Cu as cupric hydroxide and As as calcium arsenate. A combination of FBA + Pinus bark or FBA + peat soil was efficient in reducing all the three heavy metal (Cu, Cr (VI) and As) concentration from the timber treatment effluent. The effluents contaminated with Cu, Cr and As can be passed through a column containing FBA and Pinus bark or peat soil. A growth experiment using sun flower (Helianthus annus) was set-up to examine the effectiveness of FBA, lime and Pinus bark to immobilise Cr in contaminated soil. FBA and lime amended soils were effective in establishing a normal plant growth of sun flower in Cr (III) contaminated soil even at high Cr (III) levels (3200 mg/kg soil). Incorporation of lime or FBA in Cr (III) contaminated soils causes precipitation of Cr (III) and thereby reduces the bioavailabilty of Cr for plants uptake. Only Pinus bark amended soil was found to be effective in remediating Cr (VI) contaminated soil even at 3200 mg/kg soil. Pinus bark material effectively retained the Cr (VI) present in the soil solution and thus reducing the toxicity and bioavailability of Cr (VI) to plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} has a large consumption of energy. It is therefore interesting to see if this use of energy can be decreased. This would mean less use of fuel and lower emissions to the atmosphere. This study has been undertaken as a case study at Skoghall Board Mill, where the possibilities for decreased use of live steam by increased internal heat exchanging have been investigated. As a tool Pinch Technology has been used. This is a tool that makes it easier to see where the system has heat and cooling demand and at which temperatures. Using this as a base, it is then possible to identify where the potential for more internal heat exchange is possible and as a result one can reduce the steam demand. The mill has two power boilers in addition to the recovery boiler, one oil boiler and one <b>bark</b> <b>boiler.</b> The <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> is fired with both bark from the mill’s own debarking and purchased bark. The oil boiler has the highest marginal operating costs, thus a reduced steam demand will decrease usage of the oil boiler. By identifying the pinch violations in the system one can identify potential measures for increasing internal heat exchanging. Four alternatives with different degrees of heat recovery have been identified. For these cases the investment costs have been calculated and the technical consequences considered. The calculations were carried out for winter operation. Two cases were considered for potential fuel savings: oil fuel and bark fuel. The results show that the use of live steam can be reduced by 10 to 20 MW. The pay back periods for these investments lie around one year when the saved fuel is oil. For the case with bark the pay back periods are approximately 2. 5 to 4 years...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the steam {{production}} in a chemical pulp mill that is retrofitted to reduce its process heating demand. A multi-period optimization model for design decisions is proposed {{that takes into account}} operational limits of the boilers and variations in heat demand. Large variations in combination with the retrofit cause off-design loads that affect the flexibility of the steam system. The minimum boiler load limits will be a greater constraint on operation when the average load of the boilers is moved closer to the minimum for longer periods of time. As shown in this paper, a conventional approach that considers fixed annual averages of process parameters therefore risks leading to sub-optimal solutions because of neglecting the variations in heat demand and inaccurately modelling the operational limits. The multi-period approach suggested in this paper considers operational flexibility associated with different designs. A case study based on a Kraft pulp mill with a recovery boiler and a <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> shows the benefit of this approach. Four scenarios for heat savings and lignin prices are analyzed. Numerical results are presented that compares the solution of the multi-period model with that of a conventional annual average approach.

The sizes of FT crude plants are quantified, when the amount of excess heat from the FT plant exactly matches the heating demand otherwise satisfied by the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> at the mill, considering a number of development pathways at the mill, including various degrees of steam savings and biorefinery options, such as lignin extraction. Performance of {{integrated production}} is {{compared with that of}} an FT stand-alone plant on the basis of wood fuel-to-FT crude efficiency, GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions balances and FT crude production cost. The results show that there exists a heat integration opportunity for an FT crude plant ranging from 0 up to 350  MW (LHV) of wood fuel depending on the development pathway for the mill. The results indicate higher overall efficiency and a generally lower production cost for the heat integrated, co-located production. Heat integrated production has a larger potential to contribute to GHG emission mitigation, assuming a future generation of grid electricity emitting equal to or less than an NGCC (natural gas combined cycle) power plant. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve an {{increased}} energy efficiency within the Swedish industry the law about energy auditing in large companies has recently been implemented. The law {{is based on the}} EU Energy Efficiency Directive. The law requires that affected companies performs an energy auditing every fourth year. Besides mapping of energy supply and consumption, an analysis is required to be performed where suggestions for energy efficiency measures and related cost estimations are to be included. The result must thereafter be reported to the Swedish Energy Agency. The pulp and paper industry accounts for more than 1 / 6 of Sweden’s total energy usage which indicates the importance to study this specific industry from an energy perspective. This since implementation of energy efficiency measures can potentially result in large energy savings which can eventually result in a reduced climate impact. Södra Cell Värö is a Softwood Kraft Pulp Mill which has recently experienced a large expansion and reconstruction. Energy efficiency measures, such as a new secondary heating system, were included to improve the heat recovery within the process. In this master’s thesis, an energy efficiency study has been performed in order to investigate whether additional measures can be implemented to save energy at the pulp mill. Pinch analysis was utilized as a method to determine the potential for energy savings of the process. The result of the analysis shows that it is theoretically possible to save 66. 7 MW steam, which corresponds to 23 % of the total steam consumption at the pulp mill. However, to achieve these savings a maximum energy recovery network is required which is rarely applied in industry due to technical limitations and that it is not feasible from an economic perspective to achieve such a heat exchanger network. Retrofit suggestions were proposed that utilized an identified excess heat in terms of warm water, and moist air from the drying machine. By doing so, the energy efficiency in the existing heat exchanger network was improved resulting in 9. 1 MW steam savings. By also utilizing heat from flue gases from the lime kiln and the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler,</b> it was shown that a total of 19. 5 MW steam savings could be achieved. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} saved steam could for example be utilized to generate additional green electricity in the newly installed condensing turbine which in turn would enable an increased delivery of electricity to the grid by 41 GWh/yr. Another alternative that was investigated was to save fuel in the form of bark by reducing the steam production of the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler.</b> The result shows that it would be possible to save 144 GWh/yr bark. The potential for the process to deliver an increased amount of district heating was investigated and the result indicates that the theoretically maximum heat load for district heating delivery is 33 MW after the suggested energy efficiency measures have been implemented...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{influence}} on the system performance and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of different biomass pretreatment methods before gasification and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) crude production was evaluated. Entrained flow gasification has the benefit of producing a practically tar-free synthesis gas with nearly complete carbon conversion. This gasifier type requires a relatively dry fuel, with small particle size, at high pressure. The size can be acquired by milling, which is energy intensive and feeding is challenging. Torrefaction of biomass facilitates milling; it thus requires less electricity, however, the torrefaction process requires heat. Pyrolysis decomposes the biomass into gaseous, liquid, and solid parts, respectively. This further makes feeding easier, but comes with a greater heat demand than torrefaction. The impact of the different pretreatment methods on the overall energy system has been evaluated using process integration methodology. The {{results show that the}} excess heat from an FT process with a biomass input of 300 MWHHV can replace the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> in a large chemical pulp and paper mill, producing 350, 000 tonnes of bleached paperboard annually. With the preconditions given for this study, thermal pretreatment of biomass may be beneficial in terms of wood-to-FT crude efficiency, with efficiencies up to 68 %, assuming 40 % electrical efficiency. Pretreatment using pyrolysis performed the best in regards to GHG emissions, if CO 2 from acid gas removal was vented, while milling, with an annual reduction of around 700, 000 tonnes of CO 2,eq, had the best results if the CO 2 was captured and sequestrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} has a great opportunity {{to take advantage of the}} experience about forestry and wood handling for production of renewable fuels, chemicals and materials. Residues from forestry, i. e., tops, branches and stubs, have great potential to become a raw material that can replace crude oil or natural gas in many applications. By constructing a gasification-based production facility close to a {{pulp and paper}} mill, heat from the gasification process can be utilised in the mill, which replaces fuel for the boiler. The overall aim of this thesis has been to demonstrate how the {{pulp and paper industry}} can help cut global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase revenues by efficient use of biomass via gasification. In this thesis, the impact of different end products and biomass pretreatment measures connected to integrated gasification processes were evaluated regarding efficiency, GHG emissions and economic performance. The selection of end product from a gasification-based process (methanol, Fischer-Tropsch crude, synthetic natural gas or electricity, in this thesis) was demonstrated to significantly influence the required biomass input, if the sizing constraint was to replace heat production in the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler.</b> The size varied between approximately 200 MWbiomass and 600 MWbiomass. The selection of dryer type was shown to significantly impact the economic performance of a process despite its relatively low capital cost in relation to the total capital cost of 100 to 140 million Euros. With the preconditions in this study, thermal pretreatment (torrefaction or pyrolysis) of biomass may be beneficial with biomass-to-biofuel efficiencies reaching 68 %. Assumptions regarding the electricity production sector influence whether an integrated gasification process is better than a stand-alone unit and whether onsite co-generation of electricity should be prioritised in favour of increased yield of biofuels. Sequestration of separated CO 2 has been shown to improve the climatic performance of a system and increase its competitiveness against, e. g., co-firing biomass in a coal power plant, by increasing the potential from approximately 300 kgCO 2,eq. /MWhbiomass to 700 kgCO 2,eq. /MWhbiomass.

40|$|Production of {{renewable}} motor fuels and green chemicals {{is important in}} the development towards a more sustainable society where fossil fuels are replaced. The global annual production of methanol and ammonia from fossil fuels is very large. Alternative production pathways are therefore needed to reduce emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and to reduce the fossil fuel dependency. Gasification of lignocellulosic biomass is one promising renewable alternative for that purpose. However, to be able to compete with fossil feedstocks, a highly efficient production of biomass-based products is required to maximize overall process economics and to minimize negative environmental impact. In order to reach reasonable production costs, large production plants will likely be required to obtain favourable economy-of-scale effects. Integrating large scale biofuel or green chemical production processes in existing pulp mills or in other large forest industries may provide large logistical and feedstock handling advantages due to the already existing biomass handling infrastructure. In addition, there are large possibilities to make use of different by-products. In chemical pulp mills, black liquor, a residue from pulp making, provides a good feedstock for the production of chemicals. It has previously been shown that investment in a black liquor gasification plant is advantageous regarding efficiency and economic performance compared to investment in a new recovery boiler. The potential production volume of green chemicals from black liquor is however limited since the availability of black liquor is strongly connected to pulp production. Increased chemical production volumes and thereby potential positive scale effects can be obtained either by adding other types of raw material to the gasification process or by increasing the syngas production by other gasification units operating in parallel. Several publications can be found regarding biomass gasification using one single feedstock and/or gasifier, but only a few consider cogasification of different fuels and dual gasification units. The overall aim of this thesis has therefore been to investigate technoeconomically the integration of biomass gasification systems in existing pulp and paper mills for green chemical production with the focus on creating economy-of-scale effects. The following system configurations were selected: i) a solid biomass gasifier that replaces the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> in a pulp mill for methanol or ammonia production, ii) a solid biomass gasifier operated in parallel with a black liquor gasifier for methanol production, and iii) methanol production from gasification of black liquor blended with biomass-based pyrolysis oil. The main objectives were to find possible and measurable technically and economically added values for different integrated system solutions. The gasifier, the gas conditioning and synthesis were modelled in the commercial software Aspen Plus for material and energy balance calculations. A thermodynamic model developed for gasification of black liquor was used to simulate co-gasification of black liquor blended with pyrolysis oil. The outputs served as inputs for the process integration studies, where models based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) were used. An iterative modelling approach between the two models was adopted to ensure that all constraints of the pulp and paper mill {{as well as for the}} gasification plant were met. The resulting material and energy balances were used to analyze the different system configurations in terms of overall energy efficiency and process economics. The results show that replacing the recovery or <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> with a biomass gasifier for green chemical production improves the overall energy system efficiency and the economic performance compared to the original operation mode of the mill and a non-integrated standalone gasification plant. Significant economy-of-scale effects were obtained when co-gasifying black liquor and pyrolysis oil. This adds extra revenue per produced unit of methanol compared to gasification of pure black liquor, even for pyrolysis oil prices that are considerably higher than projected future commercial scale production costs. Ingeneral, methanol sold to replace fossil gasoline showed good investment opportunities if exempted from taxes. Ammonia produced via gasification of lignocellulosic biomass is per unit of produced chemical significantly more capital intensive than methanol. The investment opportunity of the ammonia configuration is therefore diminished in comparison to methanol production. The main conclusion is that production of green chemicals via biomass gasification integrated in a pulp and paper mill is advantageous compared to stand-alone alternatives. Highest efficiencies and economic benefits are obtained for the systems where co-utilization of upstream (air separation unit) as well as downstream process equipment (gas conditioning units and synthesis loop) is possible.

40|$|Mondi Dynäs is a {{pulp and}} paper {{producer}} {{in the north of}} Sweden close to the town Kramfors. Last year Mondi Dynäs produced 231, 404 tons of Kraft paper. In order to increase their production to 300, 000 tons of paper per year this study was done in order to investigate how the increased biomass flow would affect the generation of steam along with the steam and condensate balance. This study started with a mapping of the current steam and condensate balance for one winter period January – Mars and one summer period July – September 2015. The resulting balance is used as reference period {{for the development of the}} future steam and condensate scenario where Mondi Dynäs will achieve the targeted production of 300, 000 tons of paper per year. The future model shows that the future production of paper will give an abundance of biomass since the generation of steam will be more than sufficient. For the winter period the venting of steam over roof could be derived to 11. 9 tons per hour and 34. 4 tons per hour during the summer period. This can be compared to the current situation where the winter period gave an average steam blow out of 8. 7 tons per hour and for the summer period 13. 1 tons per hour. To utilize the accumulated energy from these energy streams, three different scenarios was studied. The first scenario were a future installation of a backpressure turbine along with a condensing turbine section. The new turbine would be attached to the highest pressure level at 65. 5 bar and have a backpressure exhaust at 20 bar which will give a power of 7. 6 MWe. The second scenario included the implementation of a new condensing turbine with the current system design for the steam network and boilers. This turbine would be attached to the 3. 5 bar network and give the electricity power of 1. 9 MWe. The third scenario included the installation of a new bark dryer. This would give Mondi Dynäs the possibility to sell bark to an external actor on the energy market.

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass {{gasification}} is {{a promising}} production pathway for green chemicals, which can support the development towards a more sustainable society where fossil fuels are replaced. To {{be able to}} compete with fossil fuels, a highly efficient production of biomassbased products is required in order to maximize overall process economics and to minimizenegative environmental impact. Large production plants will likely be required to obtain favourable economy-of-scale effects and reasonable production cost. Entrained flow gasification (EFG) is a favourable technology due to its suitability for large-scale implementation and ability to produce a high quality syngas from various biomass feedstocks. In order to estimate overall energy efficiency and production costs for gasification-based biorefineries, {{it is important to be}} able to characterise the gasifiers’ performance. This in turnrequires reliable estimations of the gasification process. Integration of EFG-based biorefineries with existing pulp mills or other large-scale forestindustries can be achieved by integration of material and/or energy flows, as well as by coutilisation of process equipment. This could potentially induce both technical and economic added-values. At chemical pulp mills, an important feedstock for green chemical production may be the black liquor from the pulp production, since it provides an attractive combinationof advantages. The black liquor availability is, however, directly correlated to the pulp production (i. e. the mill size) and the potential green chemical production volume via pure black liquor gasification (BLG) is therefore limited. In this thesis, two systems are considered that expand on the BLG concept with the intent to increase the chemical production volume, since this could generate positive economy-of-scale effects and is a rather unexamined area. In addition to this, an EFG configuration entailing a lower availability related risk for the considered host pulp mill is also considered. The threeconsidered integrated systems are: (i) co-gasification of biomass-based pyrolysis oil blended with black liquor for methanol production, (ii) parallel operation of BLG and solid biomass EFG for methanol or ammonia production, and (iii) replacing the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> with solid biomass EFG for methanol or ammonia production. These system solutions establish a combination of material, energy and equipment integration. The main aim of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of the characteristics of entrained flow biomass gasification systems and their opportunities for integration in existing industries for production of green chemicals (methanol and ammonia). An appropriate modelling framework that combines chemical modelling on a high level of detail with holistic industrial site modelling is designed and used to identify and quantify energetic and economic addedvalues for the integrated biorefineries. Mathematical process integration models based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) of pulp mills are used to study integration of the biomass gasification systems with the mills. An iterative modelling approach is applied between the process integration model and the detailed biomass gasification models based on Aspen Plus or a Matlab-based thermodynamic equilibrium model. As a complement to themodelling framework, a multi-scale equivalent reactor network (ERN) solid biomass-based EFG model is developed to be able to identify and study influential parameters on the gasifiers’ performance in the Aspen Plus platform. This is approached by considering the effect of mass and heat transfer as well as chemical kinetics. The results show that replacing a recovery or a <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> with EFG for green chemicals production improves the overall energy system efficiency and the economic performance,compared to the original operation mode of the mill as well as compared to a stand-alone gasification plant. Significant economy-of-scale effects can be obtained from co-gasification of black liquor and pyrolysis oil. Co-gasification will add extra revenue per produced unit of methanol and reduces the production cost significantly compared to gasification of pure pyrolysis oil. In general, integrated EFG systems producing methanol sold to replace fossilgasoline are shown to constitute attractive investments if the product is exempted from taxes. Ammonia produced via EFG is per unit of produced chemical significantly more capital intense than the corresponding system producing methanol. The economic viability in the considered ammonia configurations is therefore found to be lower compared to methanol. The ERN model is shown to be able to estimate key performance indicators such as carbon conversion, cold gas efficiency, syngas composition, etc. for a real gasification process, showing good agreement with experimental results obtained from a pilot scale gasifier. This simulation tool can in future work be implemented in more global models to study and use to improve the techno-economic performance of EFG-based biorefineries, by quantifying theinfluence of important operational parameters. The main conclusion from this work is that production of green chemicals from biomass EFG integrated with a pulp mill is techno-economically advantageous compared to stand-alonealternatives. It is also concluded that the pulp mill size will be decisive for what integration route is the most favourable. Integration of an individual BLG plant with a pulp mill of maximum size would be the most economically beneficial alternative. However, the possibility to increase the green chemical production from a given black liquor volume improves the viability for integration in smaller mills. Increasing the production volume would therefore result in the highest efficiency and economic benefits given mill sizes up to 300 kADt/y. From a resource perspective, this would however lead to an increased demand for biomass import to the mill, and this expansion could be limited by the overall availability of biomass resources.

40|$|In recent years, Northwestern pulp mills {{have been}} {{experiencing}} {{a decrease in}} competitiveness on the global market. Countries with different climates have access to larger and cheaper wood feedstock and thus produce cheaper products. Furthermore, recent global concerns such as limited fossil fuels supply and greenhouse gases emissions have put even more pressure on European forest industries. This situation creates the urgency and the opportunity for North-American and European pulp mills to increase their revenues and their energy efficiency. This aim {{can be reached by}} upgrading a traditional pulp mill into an Integrated Forest Biorefinery (IFBR), producing higher value-added products in addition to pulp and paper (van Heiningen, 2006). In this Thesis, a biorefinery with hemicelluloses pre-extraction aiming at producing simultaneously pulp and ethanol was studied. In this process, hemicelluloses are extracted from wood chips prior to cooking and further processed into ethanol. Acetic acid is formed as byproduct. Although several hemicelluloses pre-extraction processes are reported in literature, the focus was put on Near-Neutral and Alkaline extraction to minimize the impact on pulp. The biorefinery was based on a model mill developed in the FRAM program: Bleached Market Kraft Pulp mill – Type mill. One constraint was that pulp yield and quality should remain unchanged, therefore hardwood was chosen as raw material. The objectives of this Thesis were to investigate opportunities to increase energy efficiency in the pulp mill itself in a first time, then energy integration options between the pulp mill and the hemicelluloses processes. Concerning the Kraft pulp mill, Pinch Analysis showed a pinch temperature of 107 °C and a minimum hot utility demand of 159 MW. Compared to the mill’s current consumption, potential heat savings amount to 28 MW, i. e. 15 % of the current hot utility demand. All pinch violations were identified, they mainly consisted in heating streams below the pinch with live LP steam. A total of 20. 5 MW of pinch violations were solved through 4 retrofits, i. e. 73 % of the total potential for hot utility savings. Energy integration of hemicelluloses pre-extraction for ethanol production was then investigated. For this part, only three retrofits were considered in the mill, with hot utility savings of 16. 2 MW. Energy integration of the Near-Neutral process allows saving 10. 8 MW and yields an IFBR with 190. 7 MW as hot utility demand. A cash flow analysis was finally performed to compare three different scenarios for the new biorefinery. Conclusions that can be drawn from this Thesis are that hot utility savings potential exists in the mill studied, which is encouraging since it represents an average Scandinavian hardwood Kraft pulp mill. According to the results, 15 % of the mill’s current hot utility demand can be saved. Cash flow analysis of the pulp+ethanol plant showed that an IFBR with unchanged electricity geenration, but increased steam production through an increased load on the <b>bark</b> <b>boiler</b> was the configuration that yielded the largest income from other products than pulp. This income was found to be 2. 6 times greater than in the original FRAM mill...|$|E
