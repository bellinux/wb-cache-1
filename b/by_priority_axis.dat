30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the short-run effects of the European Regional Funds received by Spain in 2007 – 2013, a period of economic crisis and recession, 1 and analyze, with a highly detailed computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, to what extent these short-run effects may be overestimated or underestimated by the closure rule. In CGE models, closures determine what variables are endogenous and exogenous in market clearance conditions and the effects may be significantly different depending on the simulation (Rattso 1982; Lögfren et al. 2002). The most common closure is the neoclassical, where investment is an endogenous variable determined by public and private savings. This is the general rule used in previous studies elaborated for Spanish regions (Monrobel et al. 2013; Cardenete and Delgado 2012, 2013), where the effects of the funds are simulated altering final demand. In this case, the reaction of private investment is very sensitive to changes in foreign savings, which may over react, hiding the impact on employment (Álvarez-Martínez and Polo 2012). Keynesian closure can be a better option because private investment is an exogenous variable and there are no fictitious booms after altering other final demand components (Partridge and Rickman 1998). The results of this study are in line with this idea and the effects of regional funds on real GDP and employment found are bigger under Keynesian closure, which raise in 0.68 and 1.2 %, than under neoclassical, which does not almost change. As a consequence, these funds can play an important role in raising employment, a key macro variable in periods of economic recession. On the other hand, the database used in this paper is a social accounting matrix where private and public investments are disaggregated into six capital goods. This disaggregation allows more accurate simulations compared to previous national and regional studies where the allocation of the funds <b>by</b> <b>priority</b> <b>axis</b> and productive sectors was, in some cases, counterintuitive. The original theoretical approach used in this paper and a detailed literature review of CGE studies of cohesion funds in Spain can be found in Álvarez-Martínez (2014).|$|E

Version: FinalMalta is the smallest of the EU member states both by population as well as geographic size. This characteristic is one that has influenced a number of aspects of Cohesion Policy in the country. Firstly, the whole Maltese archipelago is considered as one region at NUTS I and II levels. Second, at a local level, regional policy is limited with most national policy documents addressing the entire country, noting however the specific characteristics of the island of Gozo. The smallness of the economy results in the country being greatly exposed to external shocks, not least the recent economic recession. Although this is true, over the past decade Malta has built up its resilience against these shocks by diversifying its economic structure and shifting from traditional manufacturing activities to more lucrative, higher value added manufacturing and services activities that has helped to wither the economic storm. As a result, the deterioration in economic growth and public finances was contained in comparison to the EU average. Malta’s strategy for Cohesion Policy is presented in its National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2007 - 2013 with projects outlined in two operational programmes. Malta has been allocated EUR 728. 1 million under OP I (European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund) with total funds amounting to EUR 856. 6 million when including the Malta funds under co-financing. Around 38 % of funds have been allocated to environment and energy, 25 % to transport, 22 % to territorial development and 13 % to enterprise environment. Although changes to the financial allocation have occurred across measures within priority axis, no changes in allocation have taken place <b>by</b> <b>priority</b> <b>axis</b> over the past year, thereby leaving the overall strategy adopted by the local authorities broadly unchangedN/...|$|E
