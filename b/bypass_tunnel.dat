25|$|The M7 Clem Jones Tunnel (CLEM7), known {{during its}} {{development}} as the North-South <b>Bypass</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (NSBT), is a A$3.2billion motorway grade toll road under the Brisbane River, between Woolloongabba and Bowen Hills in Brisbane, Queensland. The tunnel was progressively opened to traffic from late on 15 March 2010 until {{just after midnight}} on 16 March 2010. It was completely open by 12:02 am.|$|E
25|$|Since {{construction}} of the second section, the weather and geology have continued to impact on the line. There were landslides during 1894, 1896, 1904, 1909 and 1910, but the biggest disruption occurred {{in the summer of}} 1910-11. Slips in December 1910 resulted in a tramway being built to <b>bypass</b> <b>Tunnel</b> 10, which was blocked on the Kuranda side, and the line was closed for 10 weeks. There were more slips and washouts in late March 1911, with interruptions to traffic until the end of April 1911.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2001 a {{road tunnel}} was {{constructed}} under nearby Bage Street, diverting through traffic {{away from the}} suburban centre. There was considerable popular support to name the road tunnel after George Bridges in recognition of his contribution {{to the development of}} the district and the fact that the tunnel was located on his original land holding. However, the local member Liddy Clark would not support it for fear it would offend the Aboriginal community. In 2009 as part of Queenslands 150th Birthday Celebrations, the Nundah <b>Bypass</b> <b>Tunnel</b> was renamed [...] "George Bridges Tunnel".|$|E
40|$|Abstract — MPLS TE Fast Reroute {{proposes a}} local {{protection}} mechanism to quickly reroute protected TE LSPs onto precomputed and signaled <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels.</b> This paper explores {{the case of}} multiple network element failure scenarios. The undesired complexity inherent to the multiple failure scenario originates {{from the fact that}} those failure scenarios are more disruptive, and may require multiple <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> to cope with. The objective {{of this paper is to}} adapt the MPLS local recovery schemes to multi-failure scenarios, while controlling the number of <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> that are required. This objective is achieved by mapping multi-failure scenarios onto Probable Failure Patterns (PFP’s). PFP’s are characterized by their probability (or frequency) of occurrence during the network lifetime. A number of <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> is then computed to effectively cope with the PFP’s according to their frequency or probability of occurrence. It is shown that by properly choosing how the PFP’s are grouped, and how the corresponding <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> are computed, it is possible to trade the required number of <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> for their average length and outage probability, i. e., the probability that the local recovery scheme cannot cope with the occurrence of a multi-failure pattern.

40|$|Abstract — MPLS Fast Reroute advocates local {{protection}} mechanisms to rapidly reroute traffic onto pre-computed and signaled <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels.</b> When {{the network is}} subject to multiple element failures, it becomes challenging to handle all the possible failure scenarios, for they are more disruptive and may require many more <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> to be dealt with. The objective {{of this paper is}} to adapt the MPLS local recovery schemes to deal with multi-failure scenarios, while retaining as much as possible the simplicity and the fast failure detection feature of current (single failure) local recovery mechanisms. This objective is achieved by optimally grouping failure patterns into clusters and minimizing the overall additional network resources — i. e., <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels</b> and bidirectional forwarding detection sessions — while yielding full recovery from such failure patterns.

40|$|Supporting fast {{restoration}} {{for general}} mesh topologies with minimal network over build is a technically challenging problem. Traditionally, ring based SONET networks have offered 50 ms restoration {{at the cost}} of requiring 100 % over-build. Recently, fast (local) reroute has gained momentum in the context of MPLS networks. Fast reroute, when combined with preprovisioning of protection capacities and <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnels,</b> comes close to providing fast restoration for mesh networks. Preprovisioning has the additional advantage of greatly simplifying network routing and signaling. Thus even for protected connections, online routing can now be oblivious to the offered protection, and may only involve single shortest path computations...|$|R

This thesis describes a method for finding friction factors for Litjfosstunnellen using numerical models. Three turbulence models are tested and compared; k-Epsilon, k-Omega and k-Omega SST. For otherwise identical setups k-Epsilon converges better than the other two. k-Epsilon yields larger Darcy friction factors than k-Omega and k-Omega SST in general. Grids with more cells yield larger friction factors than a coarse mesh (with one exception). Grid independence is not reached...|$|R

Except in the Interlaken area and Sarnen, where it is four lanes, it is mostly an Autostrasse road (wider, with hard shoulders and designed for 100 km/h speeds), however the Brünig Pass section just a normal pass road (80km/h speed limit although the practical limit is considerably less in sections). Development projects are underway in Lungern (<b>Bypass</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> opening 2012) and between the Sachseln <b>bypass</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the Zollhouse tunnel (opening mid-2010). In planning is another tunnel, which will link the Giswil tunnel up to Kaiserstuhl.
