High levels of bromine can convert phenol red to bromophenol red (dibromophenolsulfonephthalein, whose lowered pKa results in an indicator with a range shifted in the acidic direction – water at pH 6.8 will appear to test at 7.5). Even higher levels of bromine (>20 ppm) {{can result in}} the secondary conversion of bromophenol red to <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> with an even lower pKa, erroneously giving the impression that the water has an extremely high pH despite being dangerously low.|$|E
2500|$|Tracking dye; as {{proteins}} and nucleic acids are mostly colorless, their {{progress through the}} gel during electrophoresis cannot be easily followed. Anionic dyes of a known electrophoretic mobility are therefore usually included in the PAGE sample buffer. A very common tracking dye is <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> (BPB, 3',3",5',5" [...] tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein). This dye is coloured at alkali and neutral pH and is a small negatively charged molecule that moves towards the anode. Being a highly mobile molecule it moves ahead of most proteins. As it reaches the anodic end of the electrophoresis medium electrophoresis is stopped. It can weakly bind to some {{proteins and}} impart a blue colour. [...] Other common tracking dyes are xylene cyanol, which has lower mobility, and Orange G, which has a higher mobility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> is {{also used}} as a color marker to monitor the process of agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> carries a slight negative charge at moderate pH, it will migrate {{in the same direction}} as DNA or protein in a gel; the rate at which it migrates varies according to gel density and buffer composition, but in a typical 1% agarose gel in a 1X TAE buffer or TBE buffer, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> migrates at the same rate as a DNA fragment of about 300 base pairs, in 2% agarose as 150 bp. Xylene cyanol and orange G may also be used for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Commonly used color markers include <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> Cresol Red, Orange G and Xylene cyanol. Generally speaking, Orange G migrates {{faster than}} <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> which migrates faster than xylene cyanol, but the {{apparent}} [...] "sizes" [...] of these dyes (compared to DNA molecules) {{varies with the}} concentration of agarose and the buffer system used. For instance, in a 1% agarose gel made in TAE buffer (Tris-acetate-EDTA), xylene cyanol migrates {{at the speed of}} a 3000 base pair (bp) molecule of DNA and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> migrates at 400 bp. However, in a 1% gel made in TBE buffer (Tris-borate-EDTA), they migrate at 2000 bp and 250 bp respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> is {{also used}} as a dye. At neutral pH, the dye absorbs red light most {{strongly}} and transmits blue light. Solutions of the dye, therefore, are blue. At low pH, the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution. In solution at pH 3.6 (in {{the middle of the}} transition range of this pH indicator) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> has a characteristic green red color, where the apparent color shifts depending on the concentration and/or path length through which the solution is observed. This phenomenon is called dichromatic color. <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft's dichromaticity index. This means it has the largest change in color hue, when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> (3′,3″,5′,5″-tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein, BPB, albutest) {{is used as}} a pH indicator, a color marker, and a dye. It can be {{prepared}} by slowly adding excess bromine to a hot solution of phenolsulfonphthalein in glacial acetic acid.|$|E
50|$|Xylene cyanol {{can be used}} as a color marker, or {{tracking}} dye, {{to monitor}} the process of agarose gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> and orange G can also be used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Since DNA is {{not visible}} in natural light, the {{progress}} of the electrophoresis is monitored using colored dyes. Xylene cyanol (light blue color) comigrates large DNA fragments, while <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> (dark blue) comigrates with the smaller fragments. Less commonly used dyes include Cresol Red and Orange G which migrate ahead of <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue.</b> A DNA marker is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the DNA fragments. Note however that the size of a circular DNA like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by restriction digest, alternatively a supercoiled DNA marker may be used.|$|E
50|$|Examples of dichromatic {{substances}} are {{pumpkin seed}} oil, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> and resazurin.When {{the layer of}} pumpkin seed oil is less than 0.7 mm thick, the oil appears bright green, and in layer thicker than this, it appears bright red.|$|E
50|$|An ethanol {{solution}} (0.04 wt%) of {{bromocresol green}} {{has been proposed}} for TLC staining and is suitable for visualisation of the compounds with functional groups whose pKa is below 5.0 (carboxylic acids, sulfonic acids, etc.). These appear as yellow spots on a light or dark blue background; no heating is necessary. <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> solution {{can be used for}} the same purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Cresol red {{can also}} be used as a color marker to monitor the process of agarose gel {{electrophoresis}} and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a 1% agarose gel, it runs approximately at the size of a 125 base pair (bp) DNA molecule (it depends on the concentration of buffer and other component). <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> and xylene cyanol {{can also be}} used for this purpose.|$|E

(However, the apparent [...] "size" [...] of all these dyes varies according to the concentration of agarose in the gel and the buffer system used, so one should look up the appropriate reference before using the dyes to determine how far a gel has run.) ...|$|E

50|$|Conventionally, {{proteinuria}} {{is diagnosed}} {{by a simple}} dipstick test, although {{it is possible for}} the test to give a false negative reading, even with nephrotic range proteinuria if the urine is dilute. False negatives may also occur if the protein in the urine is composed mainly of globulins or Bence Jones proteins because the reagent on the test strips, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> is highly specific for albumin. Traditionally, dipstick protein tests would be quantified by measuring the total quantity of protein in a 24-hour urine collection test, and abnormal globulins by specific requests for protein electrophoresis. Trace results may be produced in response to excretion of Tamm-Horsfall mucoprotein.|$|E
50|$|Once the gel has set, {{the comb}} is removed, leaving wells where DNA samples can be loaded. Loading buffer {{is mixed with}} the DNA sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells. The loading buffer {{contains}} a dense compound, which may be glycerol, sucrose, or Ficoll, that raises {{the density of the}} sample so that the DNA sample may sink {{to the bottom of the}} well. If the DNA sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation, it may float out of the well. The loading buffer also include colored dyes such as xylene cyanol and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA samples are loaded using a pipette.|$|E
50|$|Since EtBr stained DNA is {{not visible}} in natural light, {{scientists}} mix DNA with negatively charged loading buffers before adding {{the mixture to}} the gel. Loading buffers are useful because they are visible in natural light (as opposed to UV light for EtBr stained DNA), and they co-sediment with DNA (meaning they move {{at the same speed}} as DNA of a certain length). Xylene cyanol and <b>Bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> are common dyes found in loading buffers; they run about the same speed as DNA fragments that are 5000 bp and 300 bp in length respectively, but the precise position varies with percentage of the gel. Other less frequently used progress markers are Cresol Red and Orange G which run at about 125 bp and 50 bp, respectively.|$|E

50|$|For example, the {{transport}} numbers of hydrochloric acid (HCl(aq)) may {{be determined by}} electrolysis between a cadmium anode and a Ag-AgCl cathode. The anode reaction is Cd → Cd2+ + 2 e− so that a cadmium chloride (CdCl2) solution is formed near the anode and moves toward the cathode during the experiment. An acid-base indicator such as <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> is added to make visible {{the boundary between the}} acidic HCl solution and the near-neutral CdCl2 solution. The boundary tends to remain sharp since the leading solution HCl has a higher conductivity that the indicator solution CdCl2, and therefore a lower electric field to carry the same current. If a more mobile H+ ion diffuses into the CdCl2 solution, it will rapidly be accelerated back to the boundary by the higher electric field; if a less mobile Cd2+ ion diffuses into the HCl solution it will decelerate in the lower electric field and return to the CdCl2 solution. Also the apparatus is constructed with the anode below the cathode, so that the denser CdCl2 solution forms at the bottom.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, Qams, are an {{important}} class of chemicals which present interesting challenges to analysts. This thesis reports results of investigations on uses of ion-pairing techniques for separations and detection of Qams.

Analyses for Qams were developed using ion-pair extraction techniques with <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> anthraquinone sulfate and naphthyl sulfate as ion-pair extraction reagents. Bulk extraction experiments were executed to evaluate the dependance of the ion-pair reagent concentration on the extraction efficiency of Qam ion pairs. The pH dependance on extraction efficiency for gallamine triethiodide and decamethonium bromide, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> ion pairs was also evaluated. A solvent segmented flow injection analysis system was designed and assembled for the rapid evaluation of ion-pair extraction efficiency of several different Qams with <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> as the ion-pair extraction reagent. Separations of Qams using ion-pair liquid chromatography were developed using reverse phase columns and both alkyl sulfonic acid and tetramethylammonium salts in the mobile phase as ion-pair liquid chromatography reagents.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} novel dyes to stain lens capsule (LC), internal limiting membrane (ILM), epiretinal membrane (ERM), and vitreous. DESIGN: Experimental study in animal and human donor eyes. METHODS: Thirteen dyes, methyl violet, crystal violet, eosin Y, sudan black B, methylene blue, toluidine blue, light green, indigo carmine, fast green, congo red, evans blue, brilliant blue, and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> were injected onto the LC and ILM of enucleated porcine eyes. the vitreous was stained with 2 mL of dyes for 1 minute. Six dyes (indigo carmine, evans blue, fast green, light green, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> and brilliant blue) were selected for experiments in human donor eyes and freshly removed ERM. RESULTS: in the porcine eyes, ILM staining with methylene blue, toluidine blue, indigo carmine, evans blue, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> and fast green was moderate, and methyl violet, crystal violet, brilliant blue, or sudan black resulted in strong staining. Methyl violet, crystal violet, sudan black, toluidine blue, and methylene blue caused histologic damage in porcine retinas. Vitreous examination revealed moderate staining with congo red, crystal violet, fast green, eosin Y, methylene blue, toluidine blue, brilliant blue, <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> and methyl violet and strong staining with light green and evans blue. ERMs showed strong staining with 0. 5 % evans blue and moderate staining with 0. 5 % light green, fast green, brilliant blue, and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue.</b> Evaluation of donor eyes disclosed moderate staining with evans blue, light green, and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> and strong staining with 0. 5 % brilliant blue. Moderate or strong staining of the vitreous occurred with most dyes. LC evaluation showed moderate staining with 0. 5 % evans blue, fast green, and brilliant blue, whereas 0. 5 % light green produced strong LC staining. CONCLUSIONS: Brilliant blue shows the best ILM staining, whereas <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> evans blue, and light green also stain ILM. Most dyes bind well to LC, vitreous, and ERM.

40|$|Combination of fish {{serum protein}} with a {{cationic}} dye, methylene blue and with two anionic dyes, methyl orange and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> was studied by equilibrium dialysis, paper electrophoretic analysis and spectrophotometry. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1) As to the binding ability with methyl orange of various serum proteins, it was ascertained that {{a considerable amount}} of methyl orange can be bound with the serum protein of teleosts such as, Scomber tepeinocephalus, Niphon spinosus, Chrysophrys major, Thunnus thynnus, Coryphaena hippurus and Mugil cephalus, and also with the mammalian serum protein (rabbit and bovine), but to the serum protein of elasmobranchs such as Dasyatis akajei, Mustelus griseus, Orectolobus japonicas and Carcharhinus albimarginatus, such binding ability wae barely observed. (Fig. 1). While, the amount of methylene blue bound to serum protein was found to be quite small in any cases. (Fig. 2). In case of teleosts, the binding ability with methyl orange of serum protein varied with kinds of fish and was found in the following order. Bovine (control) ＞Scomber tapeinocephalus, Thunnus thynnus＞Chrysophrys major, Mugil cephalus. 2) In the electrophoretic diagrams obtained from the mixture of serum and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> in case of teleosts and control animals there were two peaks of A and B, while in elasmobranchs there was one (A) peak only. (Fig. 5). Peak A (purple) is occasioned by free <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> and Peak B (blue) is brought forth by the combination of albumin fraction and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue.</b> Namely, in case of serum protein of teleosts and control animals there were observed the combination of <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> with albumin component and a metachromasis according to this combination, but in case of serum protein of elasmobmnchs no such phenomenon could be observed. 3) In the adsorption spectra obtained from the mixture of serum and <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue,</b> in case of elasmobranchs the adsorption maximum was observed, {{as in the case of}} free <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> (blank), at about 595 mμ, while in teleosts and control animals the maximum was at about 605 mμ. (Fig. 6). That is, the serum protein of elasmobranchs does not show metacromasis. In the case in which methylene blue and congo red were used in place of <b>bromophenol</b> <b>blue</b> no such difference in adsorption maximum was found between any samples. (Fig. 7 and 8). From these results it has been ascertained that the serum protein of elasmobranchs, unlike that of teleosts or higher vertebrates, is lacking in albumin component which is rich in cation radicals. ...|$|E
