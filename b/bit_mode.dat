50|$|Contemporary {{processors}} {{incorporate a}} <b>mode</b> <b>bit</b> {{to define the}} execution capability of a program in the processor. This bit can be set to kernel mode or user mode. Kernel mode is also {{commonly referred to as}} supervisor mode, monitor mode or ring 0. In kernel mode, the processor can execute every instruction in its hardware repertoire, whereas in user mode, it can only execute a subset of the instructions. Instructions that can be executed only in kernel mode are called kernel, privileged or protected instructions to distinguish them from the user mode instructions. For example, I/O instructions are privileged. So, if an application program executes in user mode, it cannot perform its own I/O. Instead, it must request the OS to perform I/O on its behalf. The system may logically extend the <b>mode</b> <b>bit</b> to define areas of memory to be used when the processor is in kernel mode versus user mode. If the <b>mode</b> <b>bit</b> is set to kernel mode, the process executing in the processor can access either the kernel or user partition of the memory. However, if user mode is set, the process can reference only the user memory space. We frequently refer to two classes of memory user space and system space (or kernel, supervisor or protected space). In general, the <b>mode</b> <b>bit</b> extends the operating system's protection rights. The <b>mode</b> <b>bit</b> is set by the user mode trap instruction, also called a supervisor call instruction. This instruction sets the <b>mode</b> <b>bit,</b> and branches to a fixed location in the system space. Since only system code is loaded in the system space, only system code can be invoked via a trap. When the OS has completed the supervisor call, it resets the <b>mode</b> <b>bit</b> to user <b>mode</b> prior to the return.|$|R

50|$|Unlike Alpha, Sparc, and MIPS {{that only}} allows one {{register}} file to load/fetch one operand at the time; {{it would require}} multiple register files to achieve superscale. The ARM processor {{on the other hand}} does not integrate multiple register files to load/fetch instructions. All GPRs hold no special purpose to the instruction set (the ARM ISA does not require accumulator, index, and stack/base points. Registers do not have an accumulator and base/stack point can only be used in thumb mode). Any GPRs can propagate and store multiple instructions independently in smaller code size that is small {{enough to be able to}} fit in one register and its architectural register act as a table and shared with all decoder/instructions with simple bank switching between decoders. The major difference between ARM and other designs is that ARM allows to run on the same general-purpose register with quick bank switching without requiring additional register file in superscalar. Despite x86 sharing the same mechanism with ARM that its GPRS can store any data individually, x86 will confront data dependency if more than three non-related instructions are stored, as its GPRs per file are too small (eight in 32 <b>bit</b> <b>mode</b> and 16 in 64 bit, compared to ARM's 13 in 32 bit and 31 in 64 bit) for data, and it is impossible to have superscalar without multiple register files to feed to its decoder (x86 code is big and complex compared to ARM). Because most of x86's front-end become much larger and much more power hungry than the ARM processor in order to be competitive (example: Pentium M & Core 2 duo, bay trail). Some third-party x86 equivalent processor even became noncompetitive to ARM due having no dedicated register file architecture. Particularly for AMD, Cyrix and VIA that cannot bring any reasonable performance without register renaming and out of order execution, which leave only Intel Atom to be the only in-order x86 processor core in the mobile competition. This was until x86 in Nehalem merged both of its integer and floating point register into one single file and the introduction of a large physical register table and enhanced allocator table in its front-end before renaming in its out-of-order internal core.|$|E

40|$|While one-bit Sigma-Delta {{modulators}} {{are widely}} used in Analog to Digital conversion stages due to their inherent linearity and precision, it is less common for the entire digital processing path to operate in single <b>bit</b> <b>mode</b> at the oversampled rate of the conversion system. The conventional approach has been to decimate the signal bit stream after conversion and for the remaining processing to be performed in standard multi-bit binary at the Nyquist rate and with a resolution mandated by the dynamic range and noise. Using a Finite Impulse Response filter design as an example, we compare the area and performance of this conventional approach with the alternative single bit approach that operates directly on the Sigma-Delta data stream using ternary coefficients {. 1, 0, + 1 } derived from the Sigma-Delta modulation of the target impulse response. Filters exhibiting approximately equivalent spectral performance in the two alternative approaches were developed using VHDL and simulated using some commercial FPGA types. In these experiments, the single-bit filters using ternary coefficients were found to dissipate less power compared to the conventional approach despite their need to operate at much higher clock rates. They also exhibit up to 40 % higher performance and offer useful area savings at lower filter orders. At higher orders, the Sigma-Delta approach retains its power and performance advantages but exhibits slightly higher chip area. The simplicity and low power of the Sigma-Delta approach makes it applicable to mobile communication processing using low cost FPGA technology...|$|E

40|$|The chief {{goals of}} the summer project have been twofold - first, for my host group and myself {{to learn as much}} of the working details of Taguchi {{analysis}} as possible in the time allotted, and, secondly, to apply the methodology to a design problem with the intention of establishing a preliminary set of near-optimal (in the sense of producing a desired response) design parameter values from among a large number of candidate factor combinations. The selected problem is concerned with determining design factor settings for an automated approach program which is to have the capability of guiding the Shuttle into the docking port of the Space Station under controlled conditions so as to meet and/or optimize certain target criteria. The candidate design parameters under study were glide path (i. e., approach) angle, path intercept and approach gains, and minimum impulse <b>bit</b> <b>mode</b> (a parameter which defines how Shuttle jets shall be fired). Several performance criteria were of concern: terminal relative velocity at the instant the two spacecraft are mated; docking offset; number of Shuttle jet firings in certain specified directions (of interest due to possible plume impingement on the Station's solar arrays), and total RCS (a measure of the energy expended in performing the approach/docking maneuver). In the material discussed here, we have focused on single performance criteria - total RCS. An analysis of the possibility of employing a multiobjective function composed of a weighted sum of the various individual criteria has been undertaken, but is, at this writing, incomplete. Results from the Taguchi statistical analysis indicate that only three of the original four posited factors are significant in affecting RCS response. A comparison of model simulation output (via Monte Carlo) with predictions based on estimated factor effects inferred through the Taguchi experiment array data suggested acceptable or close agreement between the two except at the predicted optimum point, where a difference outside a rule-of-thumb bound was observed. We have concluded that there is most likely an interaction effect not provided for in the original orthogonal array selected as the basis for our experimental design. However, we feel that the data indicates that this interaction is a mild one and that inclusion of its effect will not alter the location of the optimum...|$|E
