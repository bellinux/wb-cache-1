To compare {{perinatal}} {{and infant}} mortality in <b>breech</b> and cephalic <b>presentations</b> and between planned vaginal and cesarean section (CS) breech deliveries in Sweden. Methods. The study comprised two parts. Study A {{is a national}} cohort study for the period 1991 - 2001, including 22 549 <b>breech</b> <b>presentations</b> and 875 249 cephalic presentations born at >= 38 completed weeks. Study B is a case-control study, including all 164 breech deliveries with perinatal or 1 -year infant death (during 1991 - 1999 in Sweden) and controls. Results. Study A: Among non-malformed infants, the total mortality rate was 0. 46 % in breech and 0. 28 % in cephalic presentations [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1. 6; 95 % confidence interval 1. 3 - 1. 9]. Non-malformed breech babies were at {{an increased risk of}} antenatal death (breech versus cephalic hazard ratio: 2. 7, 2. 1 - 3. 6). The infant mortality among non-malformed breech deliveries was higher in vaginal birth than in delivery by CS before labor (OR 2. 5, 1. 2 - 5. 3). The perinatal + infant mortality among non-malformed breech babies was higher at delivery after 39 completed weeks than at CS delivery at 38 weeks (0. 53 % versus 0. 14 %; OR 3. 5, 1. 9 - 6. 4). The estimated needed number of CS to avoid one death was 400. Study B: In <b>breech</b> <b>presentations</b> without malformations, OR for perinatal or infant death was 3. 1 (1. 7 - 5. 8) at planned vaginal delivery compared with planned CS delivery, and when <b>breech</b> <b>presentations</b> not diagnosed at 37 gestational weeks were excluded, OR was 3. 7 (1. 6 - 9. 2).

40|$|Objective: To compare {{selected}} {{umbilical cord}} parameters, especially cord coiling, between <b>breech</b> and vertex <b>presentations.</b> Methods: We prospectively collected umbilical cords from uncomplicated breech and vertex obtained during elective term cesarean deliveries.

Results: We evaluated 55 umbilical cords from breech and 55 from vertex deliveries. Umbilical cord length (56. 93  cm vs. 63. 95  cm, P= 0. 05), number of coils (5. 1 ± 0. 4 vs. 11. 7 ± 0. 6, P&# 60; 0. 0001) and umbilical cord index (UCI) (0. 09  coils/cm vs. 0. 18  coils/cm, P&# 60; 0. 0001) were all significantly lower for <b>breech</b> <b>presentations</b> and remained significant following multivariate analysis.

50|$|The piriform (pear-shaped) {{morphology}} of {{the uterus}} has been given as the major cause for the finding that most singletons favor the cephalic presentation at term.

Factors that influence this positioning include the gestational age (earlier in gestation <b>breech</b> <b>presentations</b> are more common as the head is relatively bigger), size of the head, malformations, amount of amniotic fluid, presence of multiple gestations, presence of tumors, and others.|$|R

The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of different methods for estimating fetal weight (EFW) during labour. A quality audit of the ultrasound images was also performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study performed in thirty patients at 37 weeks gestation or more, during {{the second stage of}} labour. The accuracy of clinical versus ultrasonographic (US) approach for EFW was tested (by two formulas according to Hadlock, with one that does not account head circumference [HC]). The ultrasound images' quality was also evaluated. RESULTS: The clinical assessment was significantly more accurate (- 1 ± 8. 5  %) than the US approach using the formula with HC (- 8 ± 9. 8  %) (P< 0. 01). This difference was not found when choosing the formula without HC. Analysis of ultrasound images for abdomen and femur showed 74 % and 89 % of satisfactory measurements respectively, but only 43 % for HC.

WATSU {{is believed to}} exert beneficial effects on pregnancy-related complaints. We conducted a pilot study {{to test the hypothesis}} that WATSU treatment during pregnancy can affect low back pain, everyday stress perception, quality of life, tonus of the uterus, amount of amniotic fluid, spontaneous course of <b>breech</b> <b>presentations,</b> and the success rate of external cephalic versions. Methods Healthy women with singleton pregnancies at gestational week 36 were included in our cohort control pilot trial. Participants in the treatment group (n = 8) received a standardized WATSU-treatment on their first and fourth day of study participation, while participants in the control group were in a waiting condition. Participants underwent ultrasound investigations and completed quantitative and qualitative questionnaires before and after intervention, as well as weekly until birth. Results In contrast to the control group, participants in the WATSU-treatment group reported significant relief of low back pain and stress. After WATSU treatment spontaneous version out of breech position occurred once in seven cases, and external cephalic version was successful in two out of three cases.
