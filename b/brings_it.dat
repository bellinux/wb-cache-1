5|$|Believing she {{has finally}} lost her sanity, Jenni {{resolves}} to be committed. She tells Eric {{that the entire}} property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals the skull and <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{comes across}} an {{advertisement}} {{in the newspaper}} for a free trampoline. He rushes to the address from the advertisement, where Krusty is giving it away, and <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> home. Bart and Lisa are thrilled, but Marge {{is concerned about the}} potential dangers. However, Homer brushes aside her worries; he has grand plans of building a theme park in their backyard, and decides to charge others a fee to use the trampoline. Inevitably, however, people begin to get injured, and Homer accepts Marge's advice {{to get rid of the}} trampoline. After failing at his various attempts to do so, Bart steps in to help, by chaining the trampoline to a pole and waiting for Snake to break the chain and steal it for himself.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
5|$|North of Haskinville, NY21 {{takes on}} a more northerly course through the county that {{eventually}} <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> {{to the village of}} Wayland, where it intersects I-390 at exit3 south of the village. The interchange also serves as the southern terminus of NY15 and is adjacent to the north end of NY415, which terminates north of the exit at NY21. NY15 joins NY21 north into the center of Wayland, where the two routes separate upon intersecting NY63. While NY15 continues north from the village into Livingston County, NY21 leaves Wayland on an eastwest alignment, roughly paralleling the northern county line and a B Rail Corporation line as it runs through a valley surrounding the Cohocton River. After , the road enters the hamlet of North Cohocton, centered around NY21's junction with the northern terminus of NY371.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> into reality.|$|E
5|$|When {{she brings}} the scandal to the {{attention}} of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative defense and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: Madeleine Rees, head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. When Raya is found dead, Kathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> to the BBC News. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors such as Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).|$|E
5|$|Between {{the bridge}} and exit18, I-87 passes two rest areas, one for each direction. The road's northward course through Queensbury quickly <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> to the {{outskirts}} of Glens Falls, and as such the highway heads across another swath of residential neighborhoods. Exits18 and19 are the main exits for the city, with the latter connecting to NY254 near the commercial center of Queensbury. Just east of the exit is Aviation Mall, located on NY254 just west of the route's junction with US9. A northwestern turn in the freeway takes I-87 past the Great Escape amusement park and lodge, both of which are accessed from exit20 and NY149. Past exit20, I-87 runs across increasingly remote areas of Queensbury as the road enters Adirondack Park and heads toward Lake George. The freeway closely follows US9 northwest to the village of Lake George, where I-87 meets NY9N via exits21 and22.|$|E

5|$|Nests {{are usually}} built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, {{although}} sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may {{be built in}} a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for compactness. Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but these records may reflect confusion with the Spanish sparrow. The average clutch contains three to five eggs. Both sexes incubate the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males incubate for shorter periods and less often. Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> to their nestlings, he less often brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.|$|E

25|$|Densin-180 {{is another}} {{important}} synaptic protein found to interact with CNKSR2. It is known to bind at its C-terminal PDZ domain. In transfected cells, no association could be found between PSD95 and Densin-180 without the presence of CNKSR2.

25|$|The Jocassee Hydro Station, {{located in}} the {{southeast}} corner of Lake Jocassee, separates it from the beginning of Lake Keowee, also known as the Keowee River. Lake Keowee's furthest extent to the south <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> close to the city of Seneca, with the old mill town of Newry actually on it. Unlike Lake Jocassee, Keowee is heavily settled, primarily because most of the land adjacent to Lake Jocassee is owned by Duke Power and the State of South Carolina.|$|E

This <b>brings</b> <b>it</b> into the Central New York Region, where James Fenimore Cooper set his Leatherstocking Tales. This section of the highway keeps trending south as it skirts the northern edge of the Catskill Plateau, offering scenic valley vistas to the south. To the north the land levels to the Mohawk Valley. Through much of this stretch the road expands to four lanes as the region's main eastwest artery.|$|E
