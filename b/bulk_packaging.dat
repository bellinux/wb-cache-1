50|$|Packaging {{preserves}} aroma {{and flavor}} and eases shipping and dispensation. Wax paper seals against air, moisture, dust, and germs, while cellophane is valued by packagers for its transparency {{and resistance to}} grease, odors and moisture. In addition, it is often resealable. Polyethylene is another form of film sealed with heat, and this material {{is often used to}} make bags in <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging.</b> Plastic wraps are also common. Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. Vegetable parchment lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. Cardboard cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.|$|E

50|$|Warehouse Economy Outlet, (W.E.O), Where Economy Originates, was a discount, warehouse-style {{supermarket}} {{concept that}} {{was developed in the}} 1970s by The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A&P), and is credited with being among {{the first of its kind}} in the industry. The first W.E.O. opened in Pennsauken, New Jersey in 1971, and quickly became a successful, profitable venture. W.E.O. featured top-selling grocery items in their original wholesale <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> at greatly reduced prices. In 1972 A&P expanded this format to 1,500 stores; however, the expansion failed because many of its older stores, built prior to the 1950s, were not large enough to stock the large quantities of discounted groceries that the format called for. By 1975, A&P abandoned the format.|$|E
5000|$|ALF {{obtained}} blank disks at {{very low}} prices due to the huge quantities needed for its disk copying service. ALF began selling blank disks in <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging,</b> {{instead of the usual}} ten-pack boxes, and with some advertising in the major personal computer magazines quickly became a major disk vendor. As competition in bulk disk sales began to increase, ALF looked for a way to distinguish its bulk disk products and soon hit upon the idea of selling pre-formatted disks. Normally, the user would have to format each disk before being able to use it in their computer, which was time-consuming. With pre-formatted disks, the user could use the disk in their computer immediately upon receipt. ALF, being a manufacturer of disk copying equipment, had a significant advantage in producing pre-formatted disks over most of the bulk disk vendors. Soon, ALF was formatting and selling millions of disks each year. ALF also formatted disks for some of the major disk manufacturers, such as Nashua Corporation ...|$|E
40|$|By postponing {{the packing}} of {{consumer}} electronics (CE) products into their final consumer package, until after long-distance transportation, substantial economic savings and environmental improvements can be achieved, due to higher efficiency during transportation. In such a case, long-distance transportation {{is done in}} multiple or bulk packages. Literature presents {{only a limited number}} of examples of <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> for CE goods, all with the goal of economic savings obtained through maintaining flexibility in the supply chain. The logic of environmental improvement by using <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> is based on including transport efficiency as a criterion in the environmental assessment of packaging concepts. This is a new approach as until now literature and practice in eco-design of packaging have focused on resource conservation and recycling. <b>Bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> can be applied in different ways. Which way is most successful depends on the type of product, the mode of distribution, the transportation distance, the size of the production run and the prices of material and labor. This paper investigates the conditions for success of <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> and works towards a methodology for comparing single-set packaging with several <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> options, in order to determine when and how <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> leads to an environmental improvement and a competitive advantage.

50|$|Blank CD and DVD {{media are}} often sold in <b>bulk</b> <b>packages</b> called {{spindles}} or, less formally, cake boxes. This {{type of packaging}} consists of a round, clear plastic cup that mates bayonet-style to a base with a central post that holds a stack of discs; dummy discs made of clear polycarbonate with no recording surface are often packed {{on the ends of}} the stack to avoid scratches from contact with the hard plastic of the packages. Such packages have been designed to hold anywhere from ten up to 100 discs, and offer the user multiple options for packaging the finalized disc.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{choice between}} unit-of-use versus {{traditional}} <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> in the US {{has long been}} a continuous debate for drug manufacturers and pharmacies in order to have the most efficient and safest practices. Understanding the benefits of using unit-of-use packaging over <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> by US drug manufacturers in terms of workflow efficiency, economical costs and medication safety in the pharmacy is sometimes challenging. Methods: A time-saving study comparing the time saved using unit-of-use packaging versus <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging,</b> was examined. Prices between unit-of-use versus bulk packages were compared by using the Red Book: Pharmacy’s Fundamental Reference. Other articles were reviewed on the topics of counterfeiting, safe labeling, and implementation of unit-of-use packaging. Lastly, a cost-saving study was reviewed showing how medication adherence, due to improved packaging, could be cost-effective for patients. Results: When examining time, costs, medication adherence, and counterfeiting arguments, unit-of-use packaging proved to be beneficial for patients in all these terms...|$|E

Food systems {{considered}} in the study {{are based on the}} International Space Station (ISS) Assembly Phase and Assembly Complete food systems. The four systems considered are: 1) ISS assembly phase food system (US portion) with individual packaging without salad production; 2) ISS assembly phase food system (US portion) with individual packaging, with salad production; 3) ISS assembly phase food system (US portion) with <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging,</b> with salad production; 4) ISS assembly complete food system (US portion) with <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> with salad and refrigeration/freezing. The food system options are assessed using equivalent system mass (ESM), which evaluates each option based upon the mass, volume, power, cooling and crewtime requirements that are associated with each food system option. However, since ESM is unable to elucidate the differences in psychological benefits between the food systems, a qualitative evaluation of each option is also presented...|$|E
50|$|An added {{complication}} {{is several}} unofficial system entry methods resulting in no revenue loss but forbidden by tariff are frequently practiced. At unstaffed locations, fellow passengers often open EXGs for entry by customers with <b>bulk</b> <b>packages</b> after witnessing them rotate turnstiles without entering. Children often squeeze through HEETs with paying adults (if under 44”, no revenue loss occurs). At token booths, agents often admit passengers through an AOG or SET for operational reasons. Police in uniform, construction workers, contractors in safety vests, employees, and concession vendors often enter with keys or agent’s permission. Police officers sometimes allow student groups to enter through gates.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Ergonomics, plant layout, and {{material}} handling are very interrelated and interdependent disciplines. Unfortunately, these courses are often taught as separate subjects, with little overlapping commonalities. To maximize {{the learning process}} for students, however, {{it is important to}} establish the linkages between them, as these fields are so closely intertwined in actual industrial settings. Consequently, the objective of the initiative described here was to establish a series of laboratory experiences that would expose students to several of these issues simultaneously. Seven separate laboratory exercises were developed to accomplish this goal.
