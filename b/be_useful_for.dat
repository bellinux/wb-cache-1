5|$|For {{older people}} with chronic pain, opioids {{may be used}} in those for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk, {{including}} those with diabetes, stomach or heart problems. They may also <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> a select group of people with neuropathic pain.|$|E

50|$|Waxes {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of shapes: blocks, sheets, rods and tubes, and in recent times there are even {{extruded}} shapes available. The rods <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> lathe turning, among other things, and the tubes <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> making rings in jewelry work.

5|$|Kosher salt, though refined, {{contains}} no iodine {{and has a}} much larger grain size than most refined salts. This can give it different properties when used in cooking, and can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> preparing kosher meat. Some kosher salt has been certified to meet kosher requirements by a hechsher, {{but this is not}} true for all products labelled as kosher salt.|$|E
5|$|SLCO1B3 {{has been}} {{identified}} as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; moreover, substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, ciclosporin and prednisolone—may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Projections include maximum {{intensity}} projection (MIP), which enhance areas of high radiodensity, and so <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> angiographic studies. MIP reconstructions tend to enhance air spaces so <b>are</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> assessing lung structure.|$|R
30|$|Malignant endometriosis {{can arise}} in the small {{intestine}} and MR imaging <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> diagnosing endometriosis with malignant transformation.

5|$|The {{development}} of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has {{been inspired by}} the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid, capable of climbing and lifting up bricks. Such robots may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> future projects on Mars, or for building levees to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{a cardiac}} {{troponin}} activator could <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> increasing cardiac contractility {{in the treatment}} of systolic heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation {{in the treatment of}} diastolic heart failure. Troponin modulators could also be used to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
50|$|Models {{developed}} can be broadly {{divided into}} two categories (1) mean-field/steady state model and (2) stochastic model. The mean-field model <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> describing transport by {{a large group of}} motors. In mean-field description, fluctuation in the forces that individual motors feel while pulling the cargo is ignored. In stochastic model, fluctuation in the forces that motors feel are not ignored. Steady-state/mean-field model <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> modeling transport by a large group of motors whereas stochastic model <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> modeling transport by few motors.|$|R

5|$|Whilst the Campaign for Borders Rail {{acknowledged}} that the half-hourly weekday stopping service would <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> commuters, it questions whether {{this is the best}} use of a line, which could carry other types of traffic. The organisation had proposed a two-tier service, whereby both a half-hourly stopping train and an hourly limited express service would continue north of Gorebridge.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> chronic pain. There {{are several}} types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive {{as to whether}} mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests {{that it may be}} useful in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> {{short-term}} {{treatment of}} insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks {{is not recommended}} due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences {{in those with}} pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Find {{insertion}} {{sites for}} other proteins. Inserting one protein as a domain into another protein can <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> <b>For</b> instance, inserting calmodulin into {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) allowed researchers to measure the activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split-GFP. Regions of GFP that tolerate the introduction of circular permutation {{are more likely to}} accept the addition of another protein while retaining the function of both proteins.|$|E
5|$|In MN 4, Seorsumuscardinus {{has been}} {{recorded}} from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 Seorsumuscardinus alpinus teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece (S.alpinus); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; S. cf. alpinus). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of S.bolligeri were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. In all these localities, {{it is part of}} a diverse dormouse fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are temporally distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> biostratigraphy (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits). Seorsumuscardinus occurred at the same time as the oldest known Muscardinus.|$|E

5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} feet {{in the ground and}} twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> spreading odors.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1971, {{there were}} rising {{tensions}} between India and Pakistan, and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s {{in the vicinity of}} Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also be operating in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a demarcation line which ships in their fleet would not cross. Later this deployment proved to <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> gaining experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> <b>for</b> military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
