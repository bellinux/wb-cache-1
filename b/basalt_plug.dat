40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. An {{extension of the}} trace of the Chaman-Nushki fault was detected and delineated for 42 km, as was the Ornach-Nal fault for 170 km. Two structural intersections responsible for restricted movements in particular segments of the Chaman-Nushki fault were detected and interpreted. The newest and youngest fault named the Quetta-Mustung-Surab system was delineated for 580 km. The igneous complex of the Lasbela area was interpreted and differentiation was made between ultramafic complex, mafic complex, and basaltic lava flows. One oblong feature was also found which was interpreted as a porphyritic <b>basalt</b> <b>plug...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary. The Benue trough is a graben {{structure}} containing folded Upper Cretaceous sediments. Mid-Tertiary to Recent rift-valley type vulcanicity in {{and near}} the trough was mainly basaltic (in the north at least), salic lavas being now represented mainly by a few eroded plugs. The Nigerian rocks are regarded as a practically extinct sub-province within a larger Gulf of Guinea alkaline province, dominatecl by the voluminous and still active vulcanicity of the Cameroun rift. The two structures have the same trend as other graben features further south along Africa's western margin. Large sodic plagioclase crystals in a <b>basalt</b> <b>plug</b> within the Nigerian sub-province have rounded edges and more caleic overgrowths. They probably crystallized at deep crustal levels bdt are unaccompanied byany of the mafic phases that normally crystallize fi'om basalts under high pressure. However, spinel crystals and olivine nodules found in a nearby plug indicate that the complementary marie assemblage may be found not far away. Sparse published ata on phenocrysts and inclusions in the Jos Plateau lavas offer some support for this suggestion. Crystallization ofsodic feldspars in basalt may have a bearing on the independent genesis of salic liquids, while apatite and magnetite inclusions in them suggest a possible link with carbonatites. T HE principal features of Nigeria's Cenozoic alkaline province are summarized in fig. 1. The Benue trough is a graben structure (Cratchley and Jones, 1965), filled by up to 13 000 feet of Upper Cretaceous ediments, which were folded parallel to the trough axis and uplifted prior to onset of the Cenozoic vulcanicity (Carter et al., 1963). In {{the northern part of}} the province, on the Jos Plateau and the area near Gombe, basic lavas range from olivine basalt to basanite (Falconer, 1926; Carter et al., 1963) and occur as plugs, lava plateaux, and thin flows emanating from small lava and cinder cones, some of which have a very youthful aspect. Trachyte and phonolite are represented only by a small concentration of plugs south of Gombe, and their advanced state of erosion suggests they belong to an early phase of the activity...|$|E

30|$|At {{the southernmost}} part of Tierra del Fuego a few {{outcrops}} and erratic boulders of alkali basaltic rocks with ultramafic enclaves have been studied. Alkali <b>basalt</b> <b>plugs</b> or pipes hitherto identified are scarce, and host rocks are constituted by slates {{that belong to}} Mesozoic deposition. The petrography, texture and composition of the basalt and xenoliths were investigated by petrographic microscope and electron microprobe analysis. Xenocrysts of amphibole and alkali feldspar, phenocrysts of nepheline, olivine, spinel, phlogopite and Fe–Ti minerals (10  %) and a diversity of xenoliths, mainly lherzolitic, pyroxenite and wehrlitic nodules (15  %), but also from metamorphic rocks provenance, are contained in the basalt groundmass (75  %). This finer-grained material {{is made up of}} laths or needles of plagioclase, pyroxene, opaque minerals, apatite and glass, with intersertal, hyalopilitic and pilotaxitic. Locally, rock has an even granoblastic texture. Former amygdules are filled by analcite, zeolites, sodalite and calcite. The normative classification, based on nepheline content, conclude that this rock is an alkali basalt. The chemical classification, considering immobile elements as Zr/TiO 2 versus Nb/Y indicate an alkali basalt too and plots over the TAS diagram fall in the foidite (Na-rich or nephelinite) and basanite fields. The REE patterns are fractionated (La/Yb primitive mantle normalized is approximately 30). The K–Ar isotopic technique on individual macrocrysts gave ages of 146  ±  5  Ma (amphibole) and 127  ±  4  Ma (alkali feldspar); and K–Ar whole rock datum reported 8.3  ±  0.3  Ma. Nevertheless, fertile samples show geochemical features typical of deep derived material thus, based on the position in the actual tectonic setting, indicate that the basalt is older than its isotopic age.|$|R
2500|$|Igneous {{activity}} between 350 and 400 {{million years}} ago, coupled with faulting, {{led to the}} creation of tough <b>basalt</b> volcanic <b>plugs,</b> which predominate over much of the area. One such example is the Castle Rock which forced the advancing icesheet to divide, sheltering the softer rock and forming a [...] tail of material to the east, thus creating a distinctive crag and tail formation. Glacial erosion on the north side of the crag gouged a deep valley later filled by the now drained Nor Loch. These features, along with another hollow on the rock's south side, formed an ideal natural strongpoint upon which Edinburgh Castle was built. Similarly, Arthur's Seat is the remains of a volcano dating from the Carboniferous period, which was eroded by a glacier moving west to east during the ice age. Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the east. This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags, a series of teschenite cliffs between Arthur's Seat and the location of the early burgh. The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges south of the city centre, which were deposited as the glacier receded.|$|R

40|$|Based on field-mapping and {{geochemistry}} of lavas outcropping {{between the}} two stratovolcanic centres of Lyttelton and Akaroa, a new Miocene volcanic stratigraphy for central Banks Peninsula has been established. Five lithologically and geochemically distinct phases of volcanism are recognised. These are the Lyttelton Volcanics (11 – 10 Ma), Mt Herbert Volcanics (9. 7 - 8. 0 Ma), Akaroa Volcanic s (9. 0 - 8. 0 Ma). Church Volcanics (8. 1 - 7. 3 Ma) and Stoddart Volcanics (7. 0 - 5. 8 Ma). A model is proposed {{to account for the}} volcanic evolution of Banks Peninsula. The Lyttelton Volcanics range in composition from hawaiite to trachyte and consist of a mildly alkaline to transitional association of lava flows, pyroclastic deposits and high level intrusive rocks. Eruption style was dominantly of the mild Strombolean to Hawaiian-type and during the later stages of volcanic activity, a large breach formed in the south-east sector of the Lyttelton crater wall. The Mt Herbert Volcanics comprise a volcanic complex of mildly alkaline <b>basalt</b> <b>plugs</b> and lava flows, epiclastic and pyroclastic rocks that record the migration of volcanic activity from the Lyttelton centre to that of Akaroa. Field and geochemical relationships together with new K-Ar data, show that the Mt Herbert Volcanics can be divided into five formations. In order of eruption these are: - 1 / Kaituna Olivine-Hawaiites; 2 / Orton-Bradley Volcanic Suite; 3 / Port Levy Volcanic Suite: 4 / Castle Rock Hawaiites; 5 / Mt Herbert Hawaiites. Volcanic products associated with the Orton-Bradley Volcanic Suite infill the breach in the south-east crater wall of Lyttelton Volcano. There is evidence that a crater lake occupied the floor of Lyttelton Volcano during this infilling. Concomitant lacustrine deposition and Surtseyan volcanic activity is recorded by sub-aqueous pyroclastic deposits. Lavas of the Mt Herbert Volcanics were erupted from two main centres located respectively beneath the present position of Mt Herbert and in the vicinity of Port Levy. Eruption of lavas from the main vents was accompanied by the building of local Surtseyan and Strombolean tuff cones. These are recorded by base-surge and airfall deposits. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the Mt Herbert Volcanics indicate that magmas evolved in reservoirs near the base of the crust. Magmas of the Kaituna Olivine-Hawaiites have undergone selective crustal contamination. The Akaroa Volcanics in central Banks Peninsula comprise a mildly alkaline association of basalt to mugearite lava flows and high-level basaltic to trachytic intrusive rocks. Lavas reached the central area of Banks Peninsula during the final stages of Mt Herbert Volcanism. Geochemical data indicate that Akaroa magmas evolved mostly in reservoirs near the base of the crust. The Church Volcanics represent the most geochemically primitive rocks in central Banks Peninsula. A newly defined formation of basanitoid lava flows, dikes and plugs (Darra Basanitoids) is shown to be chemically related to alkali-basalt lava flows defined as the Church Bay Olivine-Basalts. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the Church Volcanics indicate that magmas were derived from different degrees of partial melting from a common mantle source. Magmas ascended directly through the crust without significant interruption. The Stoddart Volcanics comprise a volcanic group dominated by olivine-basalt to olivine-hawaiite lava flows and plugs, minor basanite and conglomerate units and rare olivine-hawaiite dikes. The Stoddart Volcanics are divided into two formations:- the Stoddart Point Olivine-Basalts and the Kaioruru Olivine-Hawaiites. Mineralogical and geochemical data indicate that Stoddart Volcanics were derived from different degrees of partial melting from a common mantle source. Some of these lavas underwent selective crustal contamination during ascent to the surface. Geochemical and isotopic characteristics of lavas from central Banks Peninsula indicate that magmas were derived from a common, light Rare-Earth-Element enriched mantle source. Tectonically, all the lavas of central Banks Peninsula are within-plate basalts and show no affinity with subduction-related volcanism. A within-plate stress field corresponding to the intersection of E - W trending faults of the Chatham Rise and NE - SW trending faults of the transform plate boundary through the South Island is considered to have triggered the Miocene volcanism recorded on Banks Peninsula. A model is proposed to account for the petrogenetic evolution of Banks Peninsula magmas during the Miocene...|$|R
