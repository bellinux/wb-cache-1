30|$|Answering these {{questions}} will involve combining <b>basic</b> logistics and <b>freight</b> transport knowledge e.g. {{for planning and}} scheduling activities for an overall Freight ITS management framework, with the capabilities made available {{to us by the}} electronics and telecommunication systems developed with ICT research.

30|$|As this is {{the most}} <b>basic</b> model (no <b>freight</b> trains) to be {{presented}} it is crucial that it is validated to check that the model does indeed function as the real world network does. There are two means of validation performed on the model. Firstly the results of the end line are analysed. The total time that a passenger train should take is the total waiting time in all the stations up to the airport, multiplied by two for the return journey, plus the time spent at airport and all the times between stations.|$|R
5000|$|For the USSR in 1989 (shortly {{before the}} collapse), the {{railroad}}s hauled nearly eight {{times as much}} ton-km of freight by rail as they did by highway truck. [...] For the US, it was only 1.5 times as much by rail. [...] Thus trucks in the USSR played a far lesser role in hauling freight {{than they did in}} the US, leaving the railroad as the <b>basic</b> means of <b>freight</b> transportation. In 1991 a law was passed which declared that railroads were the basic transportation system of the USSR.|$|R
50|$|Aberdare was an {{important}} community that had lost its passenger train service in 1964, although a <b>basic</b> <b>freight</b> service continued. In 1973 the passenger service was restored, connecting from Abercynon over the former Taff Vale line as far as Abercwmboi. The reinstated route then crossed the Cynon to the north side by a new bridge (though {{very close to the}} alignment of a much earlier TVR connection to Werfa Colliery) then following the VoNR route to Aberdare station, {{at the site of the}} former High Level.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze freight {{generation}} and freight trip generation {{patterns in the}} metropolitan area of Medellin, Colombia; and to suggest how these freight patterns should be considered for future planning decisions. In doing so, this study presents the <b>basic</b> <b>freight</b> data collection techniques used to depict all the complexity of freight distribution in metropolitan areas. The studies consisted in an external cordon survey to catch the cargo entering and exiting from the area; an establishment survey applied to small and medium size commercial establishment to study the internal movement of cargo; and a series of interviews to some companies of carries and trucks drivers with the objective of precise some logistics practices and to have a more deep knowledge of the urban freight generation. All these surveys complement each other, and must be conducted to have a good depiction of the freight movements in urban areas.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a game-theoretic model {{to analyze the}} competition between two container freight transportation modes (shipping and railway) using competitive game strategic interactions method, namely, deterrence, by taking account of the most cost-effective scale of the transportation capacity settings. The competition was set {{against the background of}} China’s Belt and Road (B&R) Initiative as a new situation for intercontinental Sino-Europe container freight transportation. The behavior of each mode (modeled as a carrier, resp.) is characterized by an optimization model with the objective of minimizing its cost by setting optimal <b>basic</b> <b>freight</b> rate and transportation deployment. A firm can use this method to compare the difference in the time value of the cargos and reduce the expense during the whole transportation process. Finally, the developed model is numerically evaluated by a case study of intercontinental transportation between Hefei (China) and Hamburg (Germany). The results show that deterrence effects largely depend on the deterrence objective, and the differential in the cost of two transportation modes tends to be stable with higher values in the deterrence objective. In the new intercontinental circumstance, the mode of railway transportation provides a new way to transport the cargos between China and Europe...|$|E

The paper studies the Application of GPS data mining in freight transportation. The paper analyses the freight truck utilization, the spatial-temporal features of truck trips, the flux, flow of freight corridors and some related traffic information by matching the truck tracks into Google Earth, coordinate transformation, trip division and other methods. Through comparing the results of sample data analysis with the actual situation, the method to analysis freight truck operation characteristics based on GPS data is proven with strong reliability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The railway {{transport}} {{plays an important}} role in social and economic life of the country and carries out the large containment of transportation activities. The transport industry should migrate towards innovation changes and increase its significance as an important transit subsystem on the way of renovation of both the infrastructure and the strategy of all transportation process components including the interaction with other transport modes. At present the life sets strategic challenges for the railway branch, and the basic goals among them are as follows: high-speed train traffic development, increase of the weight of freight trains, new rolling stock development etc. Due to the urgency of this subject, the researchers should cope with the task devoted to one of aspects of improving the freight transportation efficiency, namely to the study of effects of various factors and characteristics of technical conditions of the freight cars running gears (which are unavoidable to arise during operation) on their basic dynamic indices. The deviations of technical conditions of running gears from the normal state of the wedge system of bogie swing suspension also play an important role among them. The purpose of the paper is to investigate the influence of different factors of the technical conditions of freight car running gears (size deviation in both the bearers and the wedge system during operation) on their basic indices – coefficients of horizontal and vertical dynamics, vehicle body acceleration, frame strength, and derailment stability coefficient. Methodology. The study was conducted by numerical integration and mathematical modeling of the freight car dynamic loading using the software package “Dynamics of Rail Vehicles” (“DYNRAIL”). Findings. As a result of the research for freight car dynamic coefficients determination taking into account technical conditions of the side bearers, the dependencies of the <b>basic</b> <b>freight</b> cars dynamic coefficients on the parameters of side bearers (the clearances in the side bearers and the wedge system conditions of the bogie swing suspension) considering running speed in the tangent and curved track sections of minor and mean radii were obtained. Originality. The impact of the technical condition of the car running gears on the traffic safety factors is determined. Practical value. The theoretical research results in determination of freight car dynamic indices taking into consideration the technical conditions of the side bearers of freight cars allow for an adequate assessment of effect of the freight car bogies’ technical conditions, namely the bearers parameters, on the railway traffic safety factors (coefficients of horizontal and vertical dynamics, vehicle body acceleration, frame strength and derailment stability coefficient) ...|$|E
