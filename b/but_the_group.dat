5|$|Archie Clement led {{the guerrillas}} after Anderson's death, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> {{splintered}} by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas lost heart around that time, owing to {{a cold winter}} {{and the failure of}} General Price's 1864 Missouri campaign, which ensured that the state would remain under Union control. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.|$|E

Glenn on June 28, 1906 and was approved by Fulton County on June 20, 1908. The Georgia Tech Alumni Association published its first annual report in 1908, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was largely dormant during World War I. The organization {{played an important role}} in the 1920s Greater Georgia Tech Campaign, which consolidated all existing alumni clubs and funded a significant expansion of Georgia Tech's campus.|$|E

5|$|In 1978 Burnet {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, {{he missed his}} laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet {{was one of three}} contributors to Challenge to Australia, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result {{of the success of the}} book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> folded after several members became too frail or died.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 1896, an American {{prospector}} named George Carmack, his Tagish wife Kate Carmack (Shaaw Tláa), {{her brother}} Skookum Jim (Keish), and their nephew Dawson Charlie (K̲áa Goox̱) were travelling {{south of the}} Klondike River. Following a suggestion from Robert Henderson, a Canadian prospector, they began looking for gold on Bonanza Creek, then called Rabbit Creek, one of the Klondike's tributaries. It is not clear who discovered the gold: George Carmack or Skookum Jim, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> agreed to let George Carmack appear as the official discoverer because they feared that mining authorities would be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indigenous Person.|$|E

Some are injured and kidnapped to Grady, a hospital run by corrupt cops and doctors. When everybody regroups, they are approached by Aaron, inviting them to join a fortified community called Alexandria. The group are initially welcomed, but as the residents have not faced the zombie threat directly, Rick's group starts to take charge. Morgan, who has been searching for Rick, arrives and is shocked to see Rick killing an Alexandrian, who has been abusing his wife, in anger.|$|E

5|$|Serb sources {{assert that}} the first mujahideen began {{arriving}} in Kosovo {{in the spring of}} 1998, mainly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that summer, about 240 mujahideen were present in Kosovo and northern Albania. Most of these were ethnic Albanians, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> also included several dozen Arabs from the Middle East and North Africa. According to the diary of the ambushed KLA group's leader, Ali Rabiçi, the mujahideen involved in the July 18 ambush had initially gathered in Munich before taking a ferry from Bari to the Albanian port city of Durrës. Once in Albania, the mujahideen were escorted to the frontier towns of Tropojë and Bajram Curri by their KLA handlers, where they rendezvoused with Rabiçi's men.|$|E
5|$|The priests {{began their}} missionary work, but {{encountered}} suspicion from most chiefs.

(The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Kaʻahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.|$|E
5|$|At {{a charity}} event held by Stark Industries, {{reporter}} Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently {{delivered to the}} Ten Rings and {{are being used to}} attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two F-22 Raptor fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has {{the rest of the group}} killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Pepper to hack into its database. She discovers Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> reneged. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.|$|E

5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> has diversified {{to use all}} the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad {{took part}} in blowing up railway tracks on the {{stretches}} around Støren Station, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near Hovin, which they sought as their main target. He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945, and Durham was dissolved. He reacted with shock that London had {{decided that it was}} too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim. He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to Namsvatnet {{at the end of the}} month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station Quail. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway. He was in Troms at the time of the German capitulation.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon.

Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E
5|$|Paul and Amanda Kirby, a {{seemingly}} wealthy couple, offer Grant funding for his research {{if he will}} give them an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Although initially suspicious of their true intentions, Grant is desperate for research support and thus reluctantly agrees. He flies there along with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. On the plane, Grant learns that the Kirbys actually plan {{to land on the}} island. When Grant opposes, he is knocked out by Cooper and wakes to the sound of Amanda using a megaphone. This attracts a Spinosaurus, which devours Cooper and Nash. The creature's obstructing of the runway causes the plane to crash into the forest. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the Spinosaurus, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus. The Spinosaurus returns, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> escapes while the two predators fight each other. The Spinosaurus bites the T. rexs neck and kills it.|$|E
5|$|Poor soil {{conditions}} and bad weather led to crop failures {{during the first}} three years of the project, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> still managed to cultivate mint and farm livestock. The burgeoning timber industry provided a boost to the settlement's economy, and by 1918 there were over 500 families residing there. A fire in 1917 razed the entire village, leading to the departure of around twenty families. Ueshiba was attending a meeting over railway construction around 50 miles away, but on learning of the fire travelled back the entire distance on foot. He was elected to the village council that year, and took a prominent role in leading the reconstruction efforts. In the summer of 1918, Hatsu gave birth to their first son, Takemori.|$|E

Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and other documents related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was not able to find conclusive information.
