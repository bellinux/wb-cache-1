5|$|A related {{issue to}} the classic horizon problem arises <b>because</b> <b>in</b> most {{standard}} cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should {{not be able to}} prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is <b>because</b> <b>in</b> all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E

Organizational pride in employees’ abilities was measured with “I am proud of this organization <b>because</b> employees <b>in</b> this organization possess great abilities” and “I am proud of this organization <b>because</b> employees <b>in</b> this organization are very competent” (α = [...]. 91). Answers were provided on seven-point Likert-scales.|$|R

5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves?

How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people <b>because</b> <b>in</b> the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have also}} been {{captured}} and bred by zoos, {{but they are not}} a common zoo species. Fishers are poor animals to exhibit <b>because,</b> <b>in</b> general, they hide from visitors all day. Some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity. Yet {{there is at least one}} example of a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be ten years old, and one case of a fisher living to be approximately 14 years old, well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years.|$|E
50|$|The Silk Road {{transmission}} between Eastern and Indian Buddhism thus {{came to an}} end in the 8th century, on {{one hand}} <b>because</b> Islam <b>in</b> Central Asia repressed Buddhism along the Silk Road itself, but also <b>because</b> Buddhism <b>in</b> both India and China were in decline by that time.|$|R

5|$|From {{the bone}} {{features}} of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, {{it is estimated that}} Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may be much higher <b>because</b> <b>in</b> the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, Acrocanthosaurus needs 18–24 years to be mature.|$|E
5|$|God must be good, Paley argues, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> {{many cases}} the designs seen in nature are beneficial, and because animals {{perceive}} pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of gout which are beneficial to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> recent decades the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E

5|$|Iwane Matsui {{was born}} in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former {{retainer}} to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts {{and did not want}} to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{authorities}} {{investigating the}} charges said the alleged victims {{were not being}} fully cooperative, whereas former members were suspicious of the Mexican legal system, arguing that it favored the church.

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that the effect is stronger for higher numbers <b>because</b> <b>in</b> daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E

5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope was adamant, leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of the pope, and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished <b>because</b> <b>in</b> 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E
5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly <b>because</b> <b>in</b> the frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, {{there was no}} requirement to do so. This began to change after the Spanish-American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Odin {{was also}} {{closely linked to}} ravens <b>because</b> <b>in</b> Norse myths he {{received}} the fallen warriors at Valhalla, and ravens were linked with death and war due to their predilection for carrion.

They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are more aware of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.'
