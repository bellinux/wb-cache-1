Disertantė atliktu originaliu tyrimu siekė nustatyti save ir kitus žalojančio elgesio kitimus paauglystės laikotarpiu ir išskirti psichosocialinius veiksnius, susijusius su šiuo elgesiu; patikrinti probleminio elgesio teorijos pritaikymo galimybes save ir kitus žalojančiam elgesiui paaiškinti. In her dissertation, L Šeibokaitė {{analyzes}} {{gender differences}} in harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others, changes in harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others from 5 th to 12 th grade, and relationships among forms of harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others. The study also analyzes psychosocial factors related to harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others. In her study, 2, 894 students from grade 5 to grade 12 were assessed {{at the beginning of}} study and at the time of discharge using measures of psychosocial functioning in adolescence (Goštautas, 1998), Health and Lifestyle questions from the international Kaunas Rotterdam Intervention Study (Glazunov, Dowd, Baubinienė et al., 1981), the Abstract Thinking Scale from Cattell’s 16 Factor Inventory (1979), Rokeach values (Goštautas, Goštautas, 1996; Rokeach, 1969) and other social-demographic data. The survey was administered during years 2003, 2004 and 2005, each time following the same procedure. The results of the study show that boys are more prone to harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> compared to girls; harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others has different transitional trends from 5 th to 12 th grade; changes in harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others occur due to age effect, but not the cohort effect; the relationship among forms of harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others has been determined; psychosocial factors are related to harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others; there are different groups of students according to links between forms of harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others; the results of this research partly expand the Theory of Problem Behavior.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} is to assess the relationship between false <b>self</b> <b>behavior,</b> object relations and attachment variables, and adjustment. Theory suggests that object relations and attachment are interrelated, and have been independently linked to psychological consequences.

Given the interrelatedness of object relations and attachment theory {{it is possible that}} false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> may also be linked to attachment variables. While the relationship between object relations and false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> seems to have been established object relations theory and attachment theory have not been studied in tandem as related to false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> In addition, this investigation will explore the relationship of adjustment variables to attachment and object relations variables.

40|$|Abstract An {{experimental}} manipulation {{was used}} to investigate the effect of peer unconditional regard on adolescents’ false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> A total of 387 (M= 13. 4 years) participants conducted a brief writing task, focusing on unconditional regard. Receiving unconditional regard implies that one is accepted for who {{he or she is}} and that, as a consequence, one does not have to show as much false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> Of specific interest to the current study was whether unconditional regard could be beneficial in order to reduce false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> in children with a high in need for approval. Further from that, it was proposed that children {{with a high level of}} need for approval would also score high on false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> and that girls show more false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> than boys. Results support these latter two hypotheses. No evidence was found for the prediction that unconditional regard may reduce false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> These results demonstrate that reflecting on unconditional support does not reduce false <b>self</b> <b>behavior,</b> regardless of need for approval levels...|$|R

We aimed to explore whether the well-known Johari window model of self-awareness could guide feedback conversations between faculty and residents and enhance the institutional feedback culture. METHODS: We had previously explored perceptions of residents and faculty regarding sociocultural factors impacting feedback. We re-analyzed data targeting themes related to self-assessment, reflection, feedback seeking and acceptance, aiming to generate individual and institutional feedback strategies applicable to each quadrant of the window. RESULTS: We identified the following themes for each quadrant: (1) <b>Behaviors</b> known to <b>self</b> and others - Validating the known; (2) <b>Behaviors</b> unknown to <b>self</b> but known to others - Accepting the blind; (3) <b>Behaviors</b> known to <b>self</b> and unknown to others - Disclosure of hidden; and (4) <b>Behaviors</b> unknown to <b>self</b> and others - Uncovering the unknown. Normalizing self-disclosure of limitations, encouraging feedback seeking, training in nonjudgmental feedback and providing opportunities for longitudinal relationships could promote self-awareness, ultimately expanding the "open" quadrant of the Johari window.

The aim of our {{study was to examine}} how school personnel are experiencing antisocial behavior among students from a gender perspective. We were also interested {{to find out what the}} school's staff has of the experience of the differences and similarities between girls 'and boys' antisocial behavior. We used gender theory, when we analyzed our individual responses to interview questions. We made six qualitative interviews with low-and high school teachers, assistant principals, counselors and special education teachers training in Kalmar County. We had 17 questions for respondents to answer. Based on the responses we received in the interviews, we divided the issues into three themes; the school staff's approach to antisocial behavior, what school officials consider to be the differences between girls 'and boys' antisocial behavior and what school officials consider to be the similarities between girls 'and boys' antisocial behavior. The results of the interviews and literature study showed that informants felt that antisocial behavior occurred when pupils do not follow regulations in school, if students do not come to school or do not want to go to school and also pupils' rages. The informants also promoted the importance of absenteeism, truancy, abusive <b>behavior,</b> <b>self</b> harm, concentration difficulties, delayed language and bullying. The informants felt that there were more boys who had an antisocial behavior than girls, as a consequence with antisocial behavior in a different way than with girls.

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{identify}} and predict the major ways in which males and females differ in interpersonal <b>behavior.</b> <b>Self</b> and observer act reports {{were used to assess}} performance frequencies of 800 acts in a sample of 93 married couples over a three-month period. Although numerous sex differences were found with respect to each data source, only 69 acts showed significant sex differences across both data sources. Subsequently, these 69 acts were factor analyzed separately for the two data sources in order to identify the major dimensions of sex difference. Four clear and comparable factors emerged from the two analyses: Coercive-Manipulative, Communal, Flashy Attire, and Initiative. Standard masculinity-femininity scales were used to predict composites based on the factor loadings. The California Psychological Inventory Femininity scale correlated highly with most composites for the total sample, suggesting considerable predictive power in identifying dimensions of sex difference. The Spence-Helmreich Extended Personality Attribute Questionnaire scales correlated strongly with the factor composites within sex, but less so for the total sample. Results are discussed in terms of strategies for assessing sex differences in interpersonal behavior, alternative foci of convenience for different masculinity and femininity scales, and the use of multiple data sources to transcend single-source limitations. Differences between males and females have long been of interest to psychologists, as well as to sociologists, anthropologists, and economists. Sex differences historically have been linked to such diverse phenomena as role assignment (e. g., division of labor), social participation (e. g., exclusive men's clubs), child rearing, and social identity. Indeed, sex is the clearest biological typology in human populations, and the presence of this typology has led {{to some of the most}} intense political activity in the past two decades.

The clinical picture is well known in younger patients and includes the typical high-pitched cry, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, growth rate failure, and craniofacial abnormalities including round face, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, downward slanting palpebral fissures, and micrognathia. With advancing age, the clinical picture becomes less striking. We present seven patients with 5 p deletion syndrome, who were between age 16 and 47 years. Comparing their phenotype at several ages, a change of their phenotype was noted. Some of the clinical characteristics became more evident such as long face, macrostomia, and scoliosis. All patients were severely or profoundly mentally retarded except one patient who was mildly mentally retarded.
