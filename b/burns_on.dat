5|$|At Tomorrowland Station {{in early}} 2004, {{accumulated}} diesel fumes in the firebox of the DRR's No. 3 locomotive exploded after its fire suddenly went out. The explosion ejected the engineer from the locomotive's cab and inflicted serious <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> the fireman.|$|E
5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> over {{one-third of}} his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> almost half {{of his body}} and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cryogenic}} liquid, {{liquid nitrogen}} {{can be dangerous}} by causing cold <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, {{a young woman in}} England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|On June 27, a one-acre {{spot fire}} <b>burned</b> <b>on</b> Los Alamos National Laboratory until firefighters {{extinguished}} it.

5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, {{but this time the}} winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One of the men who had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law. Witnesses {{said that}} the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head, stabbed, then gathered into one room and set on fire. A pile of ashes {{was found on the}} floor of one victims' house; at least one child's body was found partially charred. A reporter for The New York Times inspected the children's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> some of the legs and heads.|$|E

5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} <b>burns.</b> <b>On</b> day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E

5|$|Rachel Beck {{wakes up}} in a shallow grave {{in the woods with}} rope <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> her neck and no memory of how she got there. She hitchhikes to her house in Manson, Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a mortician, examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close to bringing about the End times, which will also destroy Manson. During their conversation, Zoe slits her wrists and Malus leaves her body to find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E

25|$|In New Nightmare, Freddy's {{appearance}} is updated considerably, {{giving him a}} green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a turtleneck version of his trademark sweater, a dark blue trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the <b>burns</b> <b>on</b> his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual third degree burns than in the original series.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of life}} {{failure mode}} for {{fluorescent}} lamps varies depending on how they are used and their control gear type.

The lamp may also flicker at a noticeable rate (see Flicker problems).|$|E

25|$|In rats, sleep {{deprivation}} causes {{weight loss and}} reduced body temperature. Rats kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, hyperphagia, loss of body mass, hypothermia, and, eventually, fatal sepsis.

When compared with a control group, sleep-deprived rats' blood tests indicated a 20% decrease in white blood cell count, {{a significant change in}} the immune system.|$|E
