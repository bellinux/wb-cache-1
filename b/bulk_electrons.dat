40|$|The {{role that}} {{occupied}} $d$ bands {{play in the}} inelastic lifetime of bulk and surface states in Ag is investigated from {{the knowledge of the}} quasiparticle self-energy. In the case of <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons,</b> $sp$ bands are taken to be free-electron like. For surface states, the surface band structure of $sp$ states is described {{with the use of a}} realistic one-dimensional hamiltonian. The presence of occupied $d$ states is considered in both cases by introducing a polarizable background. We obtain inelastic lifetimes of <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons</b> that are in good agreement with first-principles band-structure calculations. Our surface-state lifetime calculations indicate that the agreement with measured lifetimes of both crystal-induced and image-potential induced surface states on Ag(100) and Ag(111) is considerably improved when the screening of $d$ electrons is taken into account.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the hollow bulk electron temperature pro les measured in the low-temperature (2 { 15 eV) plasmas of the WEGA stellarator. For this the global power balance equation was solved for the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons.</b> The observed hollow temperature proles could be reproduced satisfactorily assuming that the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons</b> are heated through energy transfer from fast electrons and that the parallel heat conduction in the scrape-o layer is determined by the potential drop in the sheath {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. These results imply that the cause of the hollow shape of bulk electron temperature proles is the heating of them through collisions with fast electrons produced by the heating method.

40|$|During X-ray {{irradiation}} of MOS devices, {{interface states}} as T well as <b>bulk</b> <b>electron</b> and hole traps are generated at the Si/SiO 2 interface {{and in the}} SiO 2 layer respectively. In this paper, we investigate the effect of X-ray irradiation on the electrical characteristics of 4. 2 nm oxide and 4. 4 nm oxynitride layers. It is shown that the <b>bulk</b> <b>electron</b> traps generated during irradiation {{lead to an increase}} of the gate current in the low gate voltage region, behaviour which can be attributed to trap assisted tunneling. From the analysis of time-dependent dielectric breakdown characteristics, it is demonstrated that the irradiation-induced bulk traps participate {{in the formation of the}} breakdown (percolation) path in the gate oxide layer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{current density}} {{responsible for the}} mean magnetization M of a uniformly magnetized bounded sample is localized near its surface. In order to evaluate M one needs the current distribution in the whole sample: bulk and boundary. In recent years {{it has been shown}} that the boundary has no effect on M in insulators: therein, M admits an alternative expression not based on currents. M can be expressed in terms of the <b>bulk</b> <b>electron</b> distribution only, which is “nearsighted” (exponentially localized); this virtue is not shared by metals, having a qualitatively different electron distribution. We show, by means of simulations on paradigmatic model systems, that even in metals the M value can be retrieved in terms of the <b>bulk</b> <b>electron</b> distribution only...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of waves with frequencies downshifted from the plasma frequency, as observed in the electron foreshock, is analyzed by particle simulation. Wave excitation differs fundamentally from the familiar excitation of the plasma eigenmodes by a gentle bump-on-tail electron distribution. Beam modes are destabilized by resonant interaction with <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons,</b> provided the beam velocity spread is very small. These modes are stabilized, starting with the higher frequencies, as the beam is broadened and slowed down by the interaction with the wave spectrum. Initially a very cold beam is also capable of exciting frequencies considerably above the plasma frequency, but such oscillations are quickly stabilized. Low-frequency modes persist for a long time, until the bump in the electron distribution is completely 'ironed' out. This diffusion process also {{is quite different from}} the familiar case of well-separated beam and <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons.</b> A quantitative analysis of these processes is carried out...|$|E
40|$|Low {{pressure}} capacitive {{radio frequency}} (RF) plasmas are often described by equivalent circuit models based on fluid approaches that predict the self-excitation of resonances, e. g., high frequency oscillations {{of the total}} current in asymmetric discharges, but do not provide a kinetic interpretation of these effects. In fact, they leave important questions open: How is current continuity ensured {{in the presence of}} energetic electron beams generated by the expanding sheaths that lead to a local enhancement of the conduction current propagating through the bulk? How do the beam electrons interact with cold <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons?</b> What is the kinetic origin of resonance phenomena? Based on ki- netic simulations, we find that the energetic beam electrons interact with cold <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons</b> (modulated on a timescale of the inverse local electron plasma frequency) via a time dependent electric field outside the sheaths. This electric field is caused by the electron beam itself, which leaves behind a positive space charge, that attracts cold <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons</b> towards the expanding sheath. The resulting displacement current ensures current continuity by locally compensating the enhancement of the conduction current. The backflow of cold electrons and their interaction with the nonlinear plasma sheath cause the generation of multiple electron beams during one phase of sheath expansion and contribute to a strongly non-sinusoidal RF current. These kinetic mechanisms are the basis for a fundamental understanding of the electron power absorption dynamics and reso- nance phenomena in such plasmas, which are found to occur in discharges of different symmetries including perfectly symmetric plasmas...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the scattering dynamics of hot electrons at the atomically well defined In rich 2 4 reconstructed InP 100 {{surface in the}} presence of different surface states. Using energy and time resolved femtosecond two photon photoemission spectroscopy, we determined the electron transfer between three dimensional bulk states and the two dimensional surface state C 2, located high above the conduction band minimum CBM avoiding energetic overlap with relaxed <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons.</b> At excitation energies, where C 2 was populated through hot <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons,</b> relaxing towards the CBM, we found evidence that the energy loss rate of the photoexcited electron distribution is mostly determined by inelastic electron phonon scattering between bulk states. This was confirmed by measurements repeated after quenching the surface states with oxygen. For resonant photoexcitation, on the other hand, we measured a time constant of amp; 964;fast 20 fs for the depopulation of C 2, showing that electron phonon scattering between bulk and surface states might have direct consequence on ultrafast relaxation dynamics for materials with a high surface to bulk rati...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is developed {{to explain the}} plasma rotations induced by lower hybrid waves in Alcator C-Mod. In this model, torodial rotations are driven by the Lorentz force on the bulk electron flow across flux surfaces, which is a response of the plasma to the resonant-electron flow across flux surfaces induced by the lower hybrid waves. The flow across flux surfaces of the resonant electrons and the <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons</b> are coupled through the radial electric fi eld initiated by the resonant electrons, and the friction between ions and electrons transfers the toroidal momentum to ions from electrons. An improved quasilinear theory with gyrophase dependent distribution function is developed to calculate the perpendicular resonant-electron flow. Toroidal rotations are determined using a set of fluid equations for <b>bulk</b> <b>electrons</b> and ions, which are solved numerically by a fi nite- difference method. Numerical results agree well with the experimental observations in terms of flow pro file and amplitude. The model explains the strong correlation between torodial flow and internal inductance observed experimentally, and predicts both counter-current and co-current flows, depending on the perpendicular wave vectors of the lower hybrid waves. _________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Precise {{measurement}} of the optical Hall effect in InN using magneto-optical generalized ellipsometry at IR and THz wavelengths, allows us to decouple the surface accumulation and <b>bulk</b> <b>electron</b> densities in InN films by non-contact optical means and further to precisely measure the effective mass and mobilities for polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the optical axis. Studies of InN films with different thicknesses, free electron densities and surface orientations enable an intricate picture of InN free electron properties to emerge. Striking findings on the scaling factors of the <b>bulk</b> <b>electron</b> densities with film thickness further supported by transmission electron microscopy point to an additional thickness dependent doping mechanism unrelated to dislocations. Surface electron accumula-tion is observed to occur not only at polar but also at non-polar and semi-polar wurtzite InN, and zinc blende InN surfaces. The persistent surface electron density shows a complex behavior with bulk density and surface orientation. This behavior might be exploited for tuning the surface charge in InN. I...|$|R
