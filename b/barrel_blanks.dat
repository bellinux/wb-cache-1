50|$|Charles St. George had to {{convince}} Australian engineering companies {{that it was possible}} to make gun parts and that close tolerances were not imperative, as is the common belief. Barrels from Lithgow were too expensive so St. George designed and built his own button rifling machine using a self-rotating button with a pushing motion. The <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks</b> were imported from Parker Hale in the United Kingdom with H&K providing the chamber machining details and Chartered Industries of Singapore supplied the 20-round M16 magazines.|$|E
50|$|Olympic Arms, Inc. {{was founded}} by Robert C. Schuetz and began as Schuetzen Gun Works (SGW) in 1956, {{manufacturing}} barrels in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Prior to that Mr. Schuetz had been partnered in business with well-known gunsmith P.O. Ackley. In 1975 the company moved to Olympia, Washington, and while its business in rifle barrels and <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks</b> thrived, it also began manufacturing complete custom bolt-action rifles. In 1982, Schuetzen Gun Works began to manufacture AR-15/M16 rifles and components under the trade name of Olympic Arms, Inc, while custom bolt-action rifles continued to be produced under the SGW brand.|$|E
50|$|The <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks</b> have a 1:8 in (203 mm) {{twist and}} are {{stainless}} steel {{with a unique}} heavy barrel profile, starting with 0.980 in (25 mm) in diameter for the first 2.60 in (66 mm) of length, then narrowing down to 0.850 (22 mm) in diameter, 0.750 in (19 mm) in diameter underneath the front sight block, and 0.725 in (18 mm) in diameter to the muzzle. The barrels have the Ops Inc 12th model suppressors with the specified muzzle brake to mount the suppressor. A carbine-length gas system is used. These barrels were mated to flat top upper receivers, and back up iron sights (BUIS) from KAC (Knight's Armament Company).|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{barrel length}} is 600 mm (23.62 in) for the M 98 and 620 mm (24.41 in) for the M 98 Magnum variant.Other barrel lengths are available upon {{request for the}} M 98 and M 98 Magnum variant, subject to availability.As an option the rifles can be ordered with an integral barrel. This is a barrel with a quarter rib, sight bases and a sling swivel mounting machined out of a solid <b>barrel</b> <b>blank.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The final {{model of}} the above initial series was the MAE in 1965, when new rules were {{introduced}} in Formula 3 allowing up to [...] engines with 36mm intake restrictor plate. MAE used one barrel of a two barrel Weber IDA downdraft carburetor with the other <b>barrel</b> <b>blanked</b> off. The domination of this engine was absolute as long as these regulations lasted until 1968. As Cosworth had a serious difficulty meeting the demand, the MAE was mainly sold as a kit. This experience led to the later FVA/DFV contract to be drawn where the responsibility of development rested with Cosworth, and the manufacturing right and responsibility rested with Ford. There also were some specially cast iron heads with similar dimensions to these brazed heads with Titanium alloy valve spring retainers called the 'Screamer Head' for MAE in later years.|$|R
50|$|A squib load (also squib round, squib, squib fire, {{insufficient}} discharge, incomplete discharge) is {{an extremely}} dangerous malfunction that happens when a fired projectile does not carry enough force and becomes stuck in the gun barrel instead of exiting it. In the case of semi-automatic or automatic weapons, this can cause subsequent rounds to impact the projectile obstructing the barrel, which can cause a catastrophic failure of the structural integrity of the firearm, posing {{a threat to the}} operator or bystanders. The bullet from a squib stuck in the barrel must never be cleared by subsequently attempting to fire a live or blank round into an obstructed <b>barrel.</b> <b>Blank</b> rounds use a type of powder different from that of other rounds, and generate much more pressure, which, combined with the presence of the projectile obstructing the barrel may cause the firearm to fail catastrophically.|$|R
50|$|Production {{shifted from}} {{typewriters}} to various military weapons and parts during World War II. In October 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company began producing M1903A3 Springfield rifles at its plant in Syracuse, with assistance from Remington Arms and High Standard Manufacturing Company. Subcontractor barrels give unusual collector value {{to some of}} these 234,580 Springfield rifles. Serial numbers 3608000 to 3707999 and 4708000 to 4992000 carry the Smith-Corona name on the receiver ring. While many M1903A3 rifles manufactured by Remington have 2-groove barrels, most rifles assembled by Smith Corona used 4-groove barrels manufactured by High Standard, and approximately five thousand of the barrels finished by High Standard were from 6-groove <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks</b> made by Savage Arms.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{weapon is}} largely made up from Sten Mk II submachine gun {{components}} (which the Germans copied as Gerät Potsdam), {{most notably the}} receiver and buttstock. The magazine and magazine release are from the StG-44, and so were the <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks.</b> There were three variants designed. The Spz-l (lange Bauart, long variant) used a conventional layout with separate pistol grip, while in the Spz-kr (kurze Bauart mit Regler für Serienfeuer, short model with burst-fire switch) and Spz-kv (kurze Bauart mit Verschlußzündung, striker-fired short model) the magazine itself was the pistol grip. The Spz-l and Spz-kr were hammer-fired, while the Spz-kv was striker-fired. All variants were gas-operated, had swappable barrels, and were designed for selective fire. Single-shot fire could be applied by pulling the trigger half way, while pulling the trigger further to the rear produced burst fire. This function predates the similar operation used on the present day Steyr AUG series of rifles.|$|E
50|$|A {{project to}} {{manufacture}} the first Pakistani tank gun barrel {{was started by}} Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division (SPD) in 2000. In April 2011, {{it was reported that}} the first Pakistani-produced tank gun barrel was ready to be delivered to HIT for installation on the Al-Khalid and Al-Zarrar. Previously, HIT imported 125 mm gun <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks</b> from France for the two tanks which would then be machined in Pakistan by HIT. The first Pakistani gun barrel blank was produced at Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) in a joint project involving HIT, People's Steel Mills Limited (PSML) and other defence-related organisations. The specialist grade steel was produced at PSML and the resulting steel block was passed on to HMC. HMC then pressed the block to a length of 5 metres and square cross-section, before forging it into a 125 mm smoothbore barrel. The barrel was then heat treated several times in facilities such as a large vertical furnace. The process took 2-3 months and was watched by experts from other defence-related organisations. The barrel was to be capable of firing at 4 rounds per minute as well as being compatible with the autoloader and its 24-round magazine. According to a HIT official, a joint team proved to the Pakistan Army that strict standards would be met before the army approved production of a first batch of 50 gun barrels by HMC. The Pakistani gun barrels would likely be installed on upgraded versions of the Al-Khalid which are under development by HIT. A Rs200 million PKR contract has been finalised by HIT for the first 50 barrel batch, which is slightly lower than the barrels imported from France. After production of the first batch of local tank gun barrels in 2011, Heavy Machinery Complex is planning to explore manufacture of artillery guns.|$|E
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{are composed}} of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which {{is connected to the}} motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun <b>barrel.</b> The <b>blank</b> cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~600 ft/s) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and engage the starter ring gear on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{difference}} may be that most polygonal rifling is produced by hammer forging the barrel around a mandrel containing a reverse impression of the rifling. Hammer forging machines are tremendously expensive, far {{out of the reach}} of custom gunsmiths (unless they buy pre-rifled blanks), and so are generally only used for production barrels by large companies. The main advantage of a hammer forging process is that it can rifle, chamber, and contour a bored <b>barrel</b> <b>blank</b> in one step. First applied to rifling in Germany in 1939, hammer forging has remained popular in Europe, but was only later used by gunmakers in the United States. The hammer forging process produces large amounts of stress in the barrel that must be relieved by careful heat treatment, a process that is less necessary in a traditionally cut or button rifled barrel. Due to the potential for residual stress causing accuracy problems, precision shooters tend to avoid hammer forged barrels, and this limits them in the type of available rifling. From a practical standpoint, any accuracy issues resulting from the residual stresses of hammer forging are extremely unlikely to be an issue in a defense or service pistol, or a typical hunting rifle.|$|R
50|$|The QBZ-95 {{can launch}} rifle grenades from the <b>barrel</b> using <b>blank</b> ammunition. It can also mount the QLG91B (Type 91B) under-barrel grenade {{launcher}}. This 35 mm launcher weighs 1.45 kg and is 310 mm long. It loads from the breech and fires grenades at 75 m/s. Various lethal and non-lethal rounds are available including high explosive, tear gas, and illumination. On the QBZ-95-1 rifle, the new QLG10A 35 mm grenade launcher can be mounted. The QLG10A {{is the same}} length and weighs {{the same as the}} QLG91B, but differs in that it fires caseless ammunition. It is modeled after the Russian GP-25 and fires DFS-10 grenades. The DFS-10 has the same caseless design as the Russian VOG-25 where the base of the round is the propellant and nothing is left in the barrel after firing. The QLG10A launcher is loaded from its muzzle and the shell has pre-engraved rifling for added stabilization. It is aimed with iron sights mounted to the left above the barrel, but a red dot sight can be installed over the sight base. The DFS-10 round weighs 169 g, has a velocity of 78 m/s, and has an effective range of 430 meters. Warheads include high explosive fragmentation, high explosive dual-purpose, inert practice, and less-lethal riot control versions.|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of a quality {{assessment}} of a bore of shotgun barrels. There are mentioned both definitions of a quality shotgun barrel and also a quality of shotgun barrel bore. In conclusion, there are presented particular proposals for evaluation of parameters of surface texture of forged shotgun <b>barrel</b> <b>blanks...</b>|$|E
