40|$|The {{olfactory}} epithelium {{is exposed}} {{to a variety of}} xenobiotic chemicals, including odorants and airborne toxic compounds. Recently, two novel, highly abundant, olfactory-specific biotransformation enzymes have been identified: cytochrome P- 450 olf 1 and olfactory UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT(olf)). The latter is a phase II <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzyme</b> which catalyses the glucuronidation of alcohols, thiols, amines and carboxylic acids. Such covalent modification, which markedly affects lipid solubility and agonist potency, may be particularly important in the rapid termination of odorant signals. We report here the identification and characterization of a second olfactory phase II <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzyme,</b> a glutathione S-transferase (GST). The olfactory epithelial cytosol shows the highest GST activity among the extrahepatic tissues examined. Significantly, olfactory epithelium had an activity 4 - 7 times higher than in other airway tissues, suggesting a role for this enzyme in chemoreception. The olfactory GST has been affinity-purified to homogeneity, and shown by h. p. l. c. and N-terminal amino acid sequencing to constitute mainly the Yb 1 and Yb 2 subunits, different from most other tissues that have mixtures of more enzyme classes. The identity of the olfactory enzymes was confirmed by PCR cloning and restriction enzyme analysis. Most importantly, the olfactory GSTs were found to catalyse glutathione conjugation of several odorant classes, including many unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, as well as epoxides. Together with UGT(olf), olfactory GST provides the necessary broad coverage of covalent modification capacity, which may be crucial for the acuity of the olfactory process...|$|E

They occur especially in brassica vegetables, which represent {{a major part}} of the human diet. Glucosinolates undergo hydrolysis, catalysed by an endogenous plant enzyme, known as myrosinase, into a range of biological active compounds.

30|$|Finally, the {{responses}} of zebrafish larvae exposed to diazinon and diuron were assessed by means of already established molecular and biochemical biomarkers. The evaluation of biochemical alterations {{can be used for}} an early detection of environmental contamination. <b>Biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which include cytochrome P 450 enzymes (CYP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), are relevant parameters for evaluation of toxicity since they may condition the final outcome (i.e. toxicity vs. inactivation) of a vast array of xenobiotics [29]. Also, as already mentioned, oxidative stress can substantially contribute to the toxicity of xenobiotics. The responses of organisms can be assessed by monitoring changes in their antioxidant defenses such as changes in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) or catalase (CAT) (e.g., [30]). Organophosphates, such as diazinon, are known to inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [31], so this biomarker was also included in the assessment. Hence, the effects of diazinon and diuron were assessed by measuring <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes,</b> oxidative stress biomarkers and AChE activity in vivo, complemented with the measurement of <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes</b> and AChE activity in vitro. Besides the biochemical responses, the effects of diazinon and diuron were also assessed on a molecular level.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{many studies have}} {{indicated}} that decreased toxicity can be achieved through the modulation of the GST activity (Henderson et al. 2000). GST is a <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzyme</b> in phase II involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics by conjugating these toxic substances with GSH, ultimately protecting cells and organs against drug-induced toxicity. Reduction of GST activity together with GSH depletion (Figure  1 A & C) in liver of APAP-treated rats may be due to its effective role in detoxification of reactive metabolite of APAP (Henderson et al. 2000). Increasing of GST in liver by Achillea wilhelmsii essential oils which use GSH as substrate (Figures  2 A- 3 B) might advice to more metabolic disposal of APAP metabolites, resulting in the protection of hepatocytes and simultaneous inhibition of toxicity. On the other hand, it was found that GST and GSH is induced upon oxidative stress (Moghadasian et al. 1996; Toyokuni et al. 1995). In addition, GST, a secondary antioxidant enzyme used in drug detoxification, helps in the radical-scavenging activity of GSH (Kumari and Kakkar 2012). Therefore, the GST induction following essential oil treatments may reflect a decreased oxidative stress arising from the oxygen radical scavenging activity of Achillea wilhelmsii essential oils.|$|E
40|$|Isothiocyanates are {{electrophiles}} {{that are}} able to induce phase II <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzyme</b> gene expression via an electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) in the gene regulatory region. To study the potency of different isothiocyanates to induce the expression of EpRE-regulated genes, a Hepa- 1 c 1 c 7 luciferase reporter cell line was exposed to structurally different isothiocyanates. The reporter cell line, EpRE(mGST-Ya) –LUX, contains the EpRE from the regulatory region of the mouse glutathione S-transferase Ya gene. Isothiocyanates containing a methyl-sulfur side chain, e. g. sulforaphane, showed a lower EC 50 (0. 8 – 3. 2 µM) and a comparable induction factor (17 – 22. 4) compared to the structurally different isothiocyanates containing an alkyl or aromatic side chain, e. g. allyl and phenylethyl isothiocyanate (EC 50 3. 9 – 6. 5 µM, induction factor 17. 5 – 23). After 24 h of exposure, on average (±SD) 23 ± 5 % of the isothiocyanate was found in the cells and 77 % in the cell medium. Isothiocyanates prove to be strong inducers of electrophile-responsive element-mediated gene expression at physiological concentrations. The here described luciferase reporter cell line is a suitable assay to measure the potency of compounds to induce EpRE-regulated gene expressio...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which brassica vegetables might decrease the risk of cancer are reviewed in this paper. Brassicas, including all types of cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, may be protective against cancer due to their relatively high glucosinolate content. Glucosinolates are usually broken down through hydrolysis catalyzed by myrosinase, an enzyme that is released from damaged plant cells. Some of the hydrolysis products, viz. indoles and isothiocyanates, are able to influence phase 1 and phase 2 <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzyme</b> activities, thereby possibly influencing several processes related to chemical carcinogenesis, e. g, the metabolism, DNA-binding and mutagenic activity of promutagens. A reducing effect on tumor formation {{has been shown in}} rats and mice. The anticarcinogenic action of isothiocyanates and indoles depends upon many factors, such as the test system, the target tissue, the type of carcinogen challenge and the anticarcinogenic compound, their dosage, as well as the timing of the treatment. Most evidence concerning anticarcinogenic effects of glucosinolate hydrolysis products and brassica vegetables has come from studies in animals. Animal studies are invaluable in identifying and testing potential anticarcinogens. In addition, studies carried out in humans using high but still realistic human consumption levels of indoles and brassica vegetables have shown putative positive effects on health...|$|E

40|$|Most {{economic}} losses in ruminant {{are associated with}} gastrointestinal parasite infections. Haemonchus contortus {{is one of the}} most pathogenic parasites of small ruminants (sheep, goat). H. contortus exhibits considerable adaptability to unfavourable conditions and its occurrence is world-wide. Today, the treatment of haemonchosis is complicated due to resistance of H. contortus to common anthelmintics, especially those with benzimidazole structure. <b>Biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes,</b> that protect parasite against toxic effect of anthelmintics, may contribute to development of resistance. The aim of this project was to study the biotransformation of benzimidazole anthelmintic flubendazole in H. contortus and to find out biotransformation of other model xenobiotics. The results showed that cytosolic NADPH-dependent enzymes of H. contortus deactivate flubendazole via reduction of its carbonyl group. Substantial reduction of other xenobiotics was also found. Significant activity of glutathion S- tranferases may aid to anthelmintics further deactivation. The new information about <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes</b> of parasites contribute to understanding of mechanism of resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} dietary {{compounds}} influence the susceptibility {{of human beings}} to cancer, is widely accepted. One of the possible mechanisms {{that is responsible for}} these (anti) carcinogenic effects is that dietary constituents may modulate <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes,</b> thereby affecting the (anti) carcinogenic potential of other compounds. This ambiguous theme is the basis for the present paper. The possible effects of enzymatic bioactivation and detoxification of dietary constituents are discussed using two representative examples of phase I and phase II <b>biotransformation</b> <b>enzymes</b> i. e., cytochrome P 450 and glutathione S-transferase. Furthermore, the impact of genetic polymorphisms of these two enzyme systems is considered. Although it is very difficult {{on the basis of the}} enzyme inducing or inhibiting properties of dietary compounds, especially to characterize them as anticarcinogenic, for certain constituents it is acknowledged that they have anticarcinogenic properties. As such, this provides for an important mechanistic substantiation of the established cancer chemopreventive effect of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.
