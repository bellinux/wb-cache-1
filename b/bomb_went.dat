5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' <b>bomb</b> <b>went</b> {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair and putting it out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war.

5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks.
