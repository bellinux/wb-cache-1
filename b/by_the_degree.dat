5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> sum formula.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, delay is affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy {{modifying the}} method of projection, the results of Hajek and Huskova are {{extended}} to show the asymptotic normality of signed and linear rank statistics under general alternatives for dependent random variables that can be expressed as independent vectors of fixed equal length. The score function is twice differentiable; the regression constants are arbitrary; and the distribution functions are continuous, but arbitrary. As an application, a rank transform statistic is proposed for the one-sample multivariate location model. The ranks of the absolute values of the observations are calculated without regard to component membership, and the scored ranks are substituted {{in place of the}} observed values. The limiting distribution of the proposed test statistic is shown to be χ 2 divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom under the null hypothesis, and noncentral χ 2 divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom under the sequence of Pitman alternatives...|$|R
