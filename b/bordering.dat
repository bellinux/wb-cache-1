5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two <b>bordering</b> tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more <b>bordering</b> tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bordering</b> to {{the north}} of Blue Spring State Park is Hontoon Island State Park, {{accessible}} only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare Timucua totem representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of Hontoon Island. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge {{at the bottom of the}} river. River otters (Lutra canadensis) can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees <b>bordering</b> waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we generalize {{the notion}} of <b>border</b> bases of zero-dimensional {{polynomial}} ideals to the module setting. To this end, we introduce order modules as a generalization of order ideals and module <b>border</b> bases of submodules with finite codimension in a free module as a generalization of <b>border</b> bases of zero-dimensional ideals {{in the first part}} of this paper. In particular, we extend the division algorithm for <b>border</b> bases to the module setting, show the existence and uniqueness of module <b>border</b> bases, and characterize module <b>border</b> bases analogously like <b>border</b> bases via the special generation property, <b>border</b> form modules, rewrite rules, commuting matrices, and liftings of <b>border</b> syzygies. Furthermore, we deduce Buchberger's Criterion for Module <b>Border</b> Bases and give an algorithm for the computation of module <b>border</b> bases that uses linear algebra techniques. In the second part, we further generalize {{the notion of}} module <b>border</b> bases to quotient modules. We then show the connection between quotient module <b>border</b> bases and special module <b>border</b> bases and deduce characterizations similar to the ones for module <b>border</b> bases. Moreover, we give an algorithm for the computation of quotient module <b>border</b> bases using linear algebra techniques, again. At last, we prove that subideal <b>border</b> bases are isomorphic to special quotient module <b>border</b> bases. This isomorphy immediately yields characterizations and an algorithm for the computation of subideal <b>border</b> bases. Comment: 65 page...|$|R
