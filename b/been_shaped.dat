5|$|Culture in German {{states has}} <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by major {{intellectual}} and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. Historically Germany {{has been called}} Das Land der Dichter und Denker ("the land of poets and thinkers"), because of the major role its writers and philosophers have played {{in the development of}} Western thought.|$|E
5|$|Israel’s culinary traditions {{comprise}} {{foods and}} cooking methods that span three {{thousand years of}} history. Over that time, these traditions have <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, and religious and ethnic influences {{have resulted in a}} culinary melting pot. Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE, {{in the days of the}} kings of ancient Israel.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on the north and east flanks of the volcano.|$|E

One <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a dinosaur (used by Kai-Lan, Rintoo, Tolee, and Hoho), one <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> {{like a duck}} (used by the Hula Ducks), one <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a rabbit (used by Ye-Ye and Mr. Fluffy), and the last is a smaller, old-fashioned ship (used by the Ants).|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft are static planes extending {{either side of the}} aircraft. When the aircraft travels forwards, air flows over the wings which <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> to create lift. This <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> called an airfoil and <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a bird's wing.|$|R
5|$|The view of Jinnah in the West has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> to {{some extent}} by his {{portrayal}} in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, Gandhi. The film was dedicated to Nehru and Mountbatten and was given considerable support by Nehru's daughter, the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi. It portrays Jinnah (played by Alyque Padamsee) in an unflattering light, who seems to act out of jealousy of Gandhi. Padamsee later stated that his portrayal was not historically accurate.|$|E
5|$|This {{history of}} Ditton has, in part, <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by the {{availability}} of natural resources in the area, especially water, soil and rocks. Its position in relation to transport links with London, notably the main roads and railways which tend towards the capital city, has {{also contributed to the}} village's development. Nowadays the parish is characterised by industrial units to the north, the middle by residential estates, and the south by fields and woodland.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the North has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by the Pennines, {{creating}} strong north-south axes along each {{coast and}} an east-west axis across the moorland passes {{of the southern}} Pennines. Northern England is a centre of freight transport and handles around one third of all British cargo. Both passenger and freight links between Northern cities remain poor, which is a major weakness of the Northern economy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{top-down}} tree transducers generalize generalized sequential machines, shape preserving top-down tree transducers naturally generalize length preserving generalized sequential machines. For instance, top-down relabeling tree transducers <b>are</b> <b>shape</b> preserving top-down tree transducers. We {{show that}} a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving {{if and only if}} it is equivalent to a top-down relabeling tree transducer. We also prove that it is decidable if a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving...|$|R

25|$|Routing <b>is</b> a <b>shaping</b> process used {{to produce}} {{finished}} edges and shapes. Some materials that prove difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> using routers.|$|R
5|$|A {{large part}} of the massif is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very sharply and some, such as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are very heavily covered in rock debris. The massif is itself defined by broad valleys which formed along fault lines and which have subsequently <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{cultural}} history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – 500 BCE), {{the foundations of}} Hindu philosophy, mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by various historical schools of thought, {{including those of the}} Upanishads, the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> to a {{large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E
50|$|The term goblet {{refers to}} the cell's goblet-like shape. The apical portion <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a cup, as it is {{distended}} by abundant mucus laden granules; its basal portion lacks these granules and <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a stem.|$|R
25|$|The {{formations}} in the Devils Garden were created, {{and continue}} to <b>be</b> <b>shaped,</b> by various weathering and erosional processes.

30|$|Consequently, for the EKD (α,λ,δ,ϕ,θ) distribution, α <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> and {{skewness}} parameter, δ <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> parameter, λ <b>is</b> a scale parameter, ϕ is a tail variation parameter, and the parameter θ {{characterizes the}} skewness, kurtosis, and {{tail of the}} distribution.|$|R
5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, Banff National Park has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by {{tension between}} {{conservationist}} and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, {{in response to}} conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who {{had the right to}} develop the hot springs for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside the hot springs as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel is a moon of Uranus {{discovered}} on October 24, 1851, by William Lassell. It was discovered {{at the same}} time as Ariel and named after a character in Alexander Pope's poem The Rape of the Lock. Umbriel consists mainly of ice with a substantial fraction of rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. The surface is the darkest among Uranian moons, and appears to have <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> primarily by impacts. However, the presence of canyons suggests early endogenic processes, and the moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing event that obliterated its older surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacteria}} also {{exhibit a}} dimorphism. The bacteria on the stalks <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> like rods, but {{those in the}} region of the ciliated oral apparatus of the microzooids <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> like small spheres (coccoid). Intermediate forms are also found in between.|$|R

5|$|Within 100 {{years of}} the {{appearance}} of Mendeleev's table in 1869 {{it has been estimated}} that around 700 different periodic table versions were published. As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have <b>been</b> <b>shaped,</b> for example, like a circle, cube, cylinder, building, spiral, lemniscate, octagonal prism, pyramid, sphere, or triangle. Such alternatives are often developed to highlight or emphasize chemical or physical properties of the elements that are not as apparent in traditional periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface appears to have <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, {{there is little evidence}} of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|Even at {{the start}} of the Middle Ages the English {{landscape}} had <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by human occupation over many centuries. Much woodland was new, the result of fields being reclaimed by brush after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Human intervention had established wood pastures, an ancient system for managing woods and animals, and coppicing, a more intensive approach to managing woodlands. Other agricultural lands included arable fields and pastorage, while in some parts of the country, such as the South-West, waste moorland remained testament to earlier over-farming in the Bronze Age. England's environment continued to be shaped throughout the period, through the building of dykes to drain marshes, tree clearance and the large-scale extraction of peat. Managed parks for hunting game, including deer and boars, were built as status symbols by the nobility from the 12th century onwards, but earlier versions of parks, such as hays, may have originated as early as the 7th century.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that {{looking at a}} wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian society has <b>been</b> <b>shaped</b> {{by two of}} the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E
