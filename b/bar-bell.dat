50|$|A jestrum piercing, {{also known}} as a {{vertical}} medusa, is an upper lip piercing that is very similar to a labret piercing, or more specifically a vertical labret piercing. It is placed in the philtrum of the upper lip, directly under the nasal septum. Unlike the similar medusa piercing, a jestrum piercing uses a curved <b>bar-bell,</b> and both ends of the piercing are visible externally with {{the lower part of the}} <b>bar-bell</b> curving around the underside of the upper lip. Sometimes it is combined with a lower labret piercing to form a symmetrical look.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} a Venetian-styled campanile, above {{which there is}} a four faced clock, each face six feet in diameter. To the clock were {{attached}} <b>bar-bell</b> chimes which could be rung independently of the mechanism, but these fell into disuse and were removed in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the class of}} stochastic matrices M generated {{in the following way}} from graphs: if G is an undirected connected graph on n vertices with adjacency matrix A, we form M from A by dividing the entries in each row of A by their row sum. Being stochastic, M has the eigenvalue λ= 1 and possibly also an eigenvalue λ=- 1. We prove that the remaining eigenvalues of M lie in the disk ¦λ¦⩽ 1 –n- 3, and show by examples that the order of magnitude of this estimate is best possible. In these examples, G has a <b>bar-bell</b> structure, in which n/ 3 of the vertices are arranged along a line, with n/ 3 vertices fully interconnected at each end. We also obtain better bounds when either the diameter of G or the maximal degree of a vertex is restricted...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{research}} was the comparison of the snatch technique between elite male and female weight-lifters. Two S-VHS cameras operating at 60 fields per second were used to record the snatch lifts of 6 male and 6 female Greek weightlifters under competitive conditions. The spa-tial coordinates of selected points on the body and the <b>bar-bell</b> were calculated using the direct linear transformation procedure, and the raw data were digitally filtered with a cutoff frequency of 4 Hz. Analyses of variance for dependent and independent samples were used to compare the selected variables in men with the corresponding variables in women. The results revealed that women flexed their knees signifi-cantly less and slower than men did during the transition phase (p, 0. 05). Women also dropped under the barbell during the turnover and catch phases significantly less and slower than men did (p, 0. 05). Moreover, the external me-chanical work for the vertical displacement of the barbell in men was significantly greater in the first pull than in the second pull (p, 0. 05). In contrast, women showed similar work outputs in the 2 phases. These differences between the 2 sexes might be because of the lower skill level of women in comparison with men, which is partly because of the re-cent participation of women in weightlifting...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{explicit}} formula {{for the global}} mean first-passage time (GMFPT) for random walks in a general graph with a perfect trap fixed at an arbitrary node, where GMFPT is the average of mean first-passage time to the trap over all starting nodes in the whole graph. The formula is {{expressed in terms of}} eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix for the graph. We then use the formula to deduce a tight lower bound for the GMFPT in terms of only the numbers of nodes and edges, as well as the degree of the trap, which can be achieved in both complete graphs and star graphs. We show that for a large sparse graph the leading scaling for this lower bound is proportional to the system size and the reciprocal of the degree for the trap node. Particularly, we demonstrate that for a scale-free graph of size N with a degree distribution P(d) ∼ d^-γ characterized by γ, when the trap is placed on a most connected node, the dominating scaling of the lower bound becomes N^ 1 - 1 /γ, which can be reached in some scale-free graphs. Finally, we prove that the leading behavior of upper bounds for GMFPT on any graph is at most N^ 3 that can be reached in the <b>bar-bell</b> graphs. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of previous results about trapping in various special graphs with a trap located at a specific location.
