40|$|<b>Breast</b> density, as {{assessed}} by mammography, reflects <b>breast</b> tissue composition. <b>Breast</b> epithelium and stroma attenuate x-rays more than fat and thus appear light on mammograms while fat appears dark. In this review, we provide {{an overview of}} selected areas of current knowledge about the relationship between <b>breast</b> density and susceptibility to <b>breast</b> cancer. We review the evidence that <b>breast</b> density is a risk factor for <b>breast</b> cancer, the histological and other risk factors that are associated with variations in <b>breast</b> density, and the biological plausibility of the associations with risk of <b>breast</b> cancer. We also discuss the potential for improved risk prediction that might be achieved by using alternative <b>breast</b> imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance or ultrasound. After adjustment for other risk factors, <b>breast</b> density is consistently associated with <b>breast</b> cancer risk, more strongly than most other risk factors for this disease, and extensive <b>breast</b> density may account for a substantial fraction of <b>breast</b> cancer. <b>Breast</b> density is associated with risk of all of the proliferative lesions that are thought to be precursors of <b>breast</b> cancer. Studies of twins have shown that <b>breast</b> density is a highly heritable quantitative trait. Associations between <b>breast</b> density and variations in <b>breast</b> histology, risk of proliferative <b>breast</b> lesions, and risk of <b>breast</b> cancer {{may be the result of}} exposures of <b>breast</b> tissue to both mitogens and mutagens. Characterization of <b>breast</b> density by mammography has several limitations, and the uses of <b>breast</b> density in risk prediction and <b>breast</b> cancer prevention may be improved by other methods of imaging, such as magnetic resonance or ultrasound tomography...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{quantify}} vertical movement of the <b>breast</b> beyond the anatomical position (<b>breast</b> extension) in various support conditions and to investigate the relationship of <b>breast</b> extension to <b>breast</b> pain, <b>breast</b> mass, and <b>breast</b> kinematics during running. The <b>breast</b> and trunk motion of 23 females of varying <b>breast</b> mass was recorded in a static no bra condition and during running in different support conditions. Static <b>breast</b> position was subtracted from dynamic position to calculate extension. In no bra, everyday and sports bra, the <b>breast</b> extended 21 mm, 9 mm, and 4 mm beyond the anatomical position. <b>Breast</b> extension displayed a strong relationship to <b>breast</b> pain and provides information on the mechanical loading of the <b>breast</b> beyond that of gravity.

40|$|Abstract Background Unusual {{presentation}} of <b>breast</b> lymphoma with {{signs and symptoms}} suggestive of inflammatory <b>breast</b> cancer.

The most frequent mode of presentation is a painless <b>breast</b> mass. The clinical {{presentation of}} localized left <b>breast</b> erythema and edema with an associated left <b>breast</b> mass is common for an inflammatory <b>breast</b> cancer but highly unusual for lymphoma of the <b>breast.</b> Conclusion In patients with a left <b>breast</b> mass associated with erythema and edema, the differential diagnosis should include <b>breast</b> lymphoma in addition. </p...|$|R

5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg.

This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her <b>breasts</b> with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the winnowing basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full <b>breasts</b> and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging <b>breasts,</b> wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high <b>breasts,</b> wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E

25|$|The <b>breast</b> implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed <b>breast</b> cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the <b>breast</b> implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study <b>Breast</b> Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic <b>Breast</b> Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed <b>breast</b> cancer after undergoing <b>breast</b> augmentation, when compared to <b>breast</b> cancer patients who had not undergone <b>breast</b> augmentation.
