5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} have found nitrates in ice cores from Antarctica at depths corresponding to the known supernovae of 1006 and 1054 AD, {{as well as from}} around 1060 AD. The nitrates were apparently formed from nitrogen oxides created by gamma rays from the supernovae. This technique should be able to detect supernovae going <b>back</b> <b>several</b> thousand years.|$|E

This was the only combat duty that the 104th Infantry Division has served during its history. At the end of the fighting on 7 May 1945 (V-E Day), this division was in central Germany opposite the troops of its allies from the Soviet Army.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put <b>back</b> <b>several</b> days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily through the crowds that had gathered around the door.|$|E

5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought <b>back</b> <b>several</b> collaborators from Believe to handle this new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E
5|$|The most {{high-profile}} sprinters {{lined up}} to begin the 2007 Giro were Alessandro Petacchi and Robbie McEwen. They, along with countrymen Mario Cipollini and Baden Cooke, had had a back-and-forth rivalry for sprinting supremacy that had gone <b>back</b> <b>several</b> years but had been stunted in 2006 when Petacchi missed most of the season, including all but the first three stages of the Giro, due to a fractured kneecap sustained from a crash. One pre-race analysis viewed Petacchi's 2007 Giro and season as a chance at redemption for him. Other fast men in the race noted to be contenders in the flat stages included two-time points classification winner Bettini, Danilo Napolitano, and Graeme Brown.|$|E
5|$|While Newell's {{place was}} taken first by Kevin Blackwell and later former player Mick Harford, {{the team was}} then relegated twice in a row, {{starting}} in 2006–07, and spent {{the latter part of}} the 2007–08 season in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its 2008–09 record by the Football Association and the Football League for financial irregularities dating <b>back</b> <b>several</b> years. These deductions proved to be too large an obstacle to overcome, but Luton came from behind in the final of the Football League Trophy to win the competition for the first time.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} months in 1855 the players of Sheffield Cricket Club {{organised}} informal football matches in order to retain fitness until {{the start of the}} new season. Two of the players were Nathaniel Creswick (1826–1917) and William Prest (1832–1885), both of whom were born in Yorkshire. Creswick came from a Sheffield family of silver plate manufacturers that dated <b>back</b> <b>several</b> centuries. After being educated at the city's Collegiate School he became a solicitor. Prest's family had moved from York while he was a child. His father bought a wine merchants that William subsequently took over. Both men were keen sportsmen. Creswick enjoyed a number of sports including cricket and running. Prest played cricket for the All England XI and also captained Yorkshire on several occasions. The inaugural meeting of Sheffield F.C. took place on 24 October 1857 at Parkfield House in the suburb of Highfield. The original headquarters would become a greenhouse on East Bank Road. The adjacent field was used as their first playing ground.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen had {{continued}} their journey to Norway while Scharnhorst was immobilized. At 14:45, the ships {{were attacked by}} five Whirlwind fighter-bombers—German fighters beat them <b>back.</b> <b>Several</b> more air attacks followed {{over the next two}} hours, though without success for the British. At 16:17, five British destroyers attempted to torpedo the German ships, but heavy fire from Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen mauled one and forced the others to turn away. Near Terschelling, Gneisenau struck a mine that did minor damage to the hull, though the explosive shock damaged one of her three turbines. Her captain ordered the ship to stop while temporary repairs were conducted, which lasted for about 30minutes. By 03:50 on 13February, the ship had reached Helgoland.|$|E

5|$|In Italy, Archduke John went {{up against}} Napoleon's stepson Eugène. The Austrians beat <b>back</b> <b>several</b> bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène {{to fall back}} on Verona and the Adige River, but Eugène regrouped and {{launched}} a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eugène's forces had joined Napoleon's main army. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eugène, was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Like Eugène, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict. He went back on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, O~3 Entertainment {{announced}} that it would be localizing Radirgy in February for North America exclusively for the GameCube under the new title of Radio Allergy. The company had previously localized MileStone's other shooter, Chaos Field. However, the release date was pushed <b>back</b> <b>several</b> times, and was eventually cancelled by June 2007 {{due to a lack of}} interest from retailers in stocking GameCube titles. MileStone began looking into options to include the game in a compilation for the Wii. Radio Allergy was finally localized for the Wii in the Ultimate Shooting Collection compilation along with Chaos Field and Karous. A sequel, Radirgy Noa, was released in 2009. Another title, Radirgy De Gojaru, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2014 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{was born}} in Prague in 1619, {{at the start of}} the Thirty Years' War, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, and was {{declared}} a prince by the principality of Lusatia. He was given his name in honour of King Rupert of Germany, a famous Wittelsbach ancestor. Rupert's father was a leading member of the Holy Roman Empire and the head of the Protestant Union, with a martial family tradition stretching <b>back</b> <b>several</b> centuries. Rupert's family was at the heart of a network of Protestant rulers across the north of Europe, as Frederick had close ties through his mother to the ruling House of Orange-Nassau in the United Provinces, and Elizabeth was the daughter of James I of England and Anne of Denmark. The family lived an extremely wealthy lifestyle in Heidelberg, enjoying the palace gardens—the Hortus Palatinus, designed by Inigo Jones and Salomon de Caus—and a lavish castle with one of the best libraries in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{have been}} raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The main product locally was felt, produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried and cut into lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date <b>back</b> <b>several</b> centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Stavka {{postponed}} Operation Saturn until 16 December, as Soviet forces {{struggled to}} clear German defenders {{from the lower}} Chir River. The Red Army's offensive in the area commenced on 30 November, involving around 50,000 soldiers, which forced Manstein to use the 48th Panzer Corps {{in an attempt to}} hold the area. In response, the 5th Tank Army was reinforced by the newly created 5th Shock Army, drawn from existing formations of the South-Western and Stalingrad Fronts; the 5th Tank Army totaled nearly 71,000 men, 252 tanks and 814 artillery guns. The Soviet offensive succeeded in tying down the 48th Panzer Corps, originally chosen to lead one of the main attacks on the Soviet encirclement. The Soviets were forewarned of the impending German assault when they discovered the German 6th Panzer Division unloading at the town of Morozovsk, and as a result, held <b>back</b> <b>several</b> armies from the attack on the lower Chir River to prepare for a possible breakout attempt by German forces inside Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes <b>back</b> <b>several</b> centuries, with storms named after places, saints or things they hit before the formal start of naming in each basin. Examples of such names are the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane and the 1938 New England hurricane. The system currently in place provides identification of tropical cyclones {{in a brief}} form that is easily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems {{is given to the}} Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part of}} World War II for the Western Pacific. Over the following decades formal naming schemes were introduced for several tropical cyclone basins, including the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E
