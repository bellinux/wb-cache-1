5|$|As {{part of the}} process, Elections Canada mails out {{letters to}} 18-year-old {{citizens}} explaining how to register for inclusion on the voters list. The letters have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> by some recipients as confirmation {{that they have been}} added to the voter list.|$|E
5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken.</b> My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|On October 31, 2006, {{nearly a}} year after his retirement, Bure filed another suit after being kicked off a British Airways flight by the pilot, having <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a rowdy soccer fan. Despite an apology from the airline company in June 2007, Bure took the issue to court, suing British Airways for 20million rubles. In late-August 2007, a Russian court ruled in favour of Bure {{in the amount of}} 67,000 rubles.|$|E

5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia {{that are more}} often cup-shaped, and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its resemblance to the jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E
50|$|The {{abbreviations}} are unambiguous, {{with two}} exceptions. Leo for the constellation Leo could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Leo Minor (abbreviated LMi), and Tri for Triangulum could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Triangulum Australe (abbreviated TrA).|$|R

50|$|As such, decoy cells may {{strongly}} resemble malign cancer cells, {{from which}} they also derive their name. This is because they can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for cancer cells, or {{the other way around}} where cancer cells can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for decoy cells.|$|R
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum pectinatum has <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for the morphologically {{similar but}} smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges {{at the base of the}} spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E

60|$|The French <b>were</b> <b>mistaken,</b> because really Spinola was so weak {{that had}} they marched on into Montferrat the Spaniards must have raised the siege; the Duke of Savoy <b>was</b> <b>mistaken,</b> because the plague had so {{weakened}} the French that they durst not have stayed to winter in Piedmont; and Spinola <b>was</b> <b>mistaken,</b> for though he was very slow, if he had stayed before the town one fortnight longer, Thoiras the governor must have surrendered, being brought to the last extremity.|$|R

5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. They argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E
5|$|Writing was {{physically}} introduced to Japan from China {{in the form}} of inscribed artefacts {{at the beginning of the}} Christian era. Examples, some of which have been designated as archaeological National Treasures, include coins of the reign of Wang Mang (AD 8–25), a 1st-century gold seal from Shikanoshima, a late 2nd century iron sword from the Tōdaijiyama burial mound, the Seven-Branched Sword with inscription from 369 and a large number of bronze mirrors—the oldest dating to the 3rd century. All of these artefacts originated on the continent, most likely in China. However, the written inscriptions on them may not have been recognized as writing but instead may have <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for decorations by the Japanese. When the Japanese later manufactured locally copies of original Chinese mirrors, they may have continued to believe the written inscriptions to be merely decorative.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphous light {{eruption}} (PMLE) is {{the easiest}} disease to mistake for solar urticaria because {{the locations of the}} lesions are similar (the V of the neck and the arms). However, patients with SU are more likely to develop lesions on the face. Also, a reaction with PMLE will take a greater amount of time to appear than with solar urticaria. Lupus erythematosus has <b>been</b> <b>mistaken</b> for SU; however, lesions from lupus erythematosus will take a longer amount of time to go away. Furthermore, when being tested for the two diseases, patients with SU have a reaction immediately while patients with lupus erythematosus will have a delayed reaction. Patients who have experienced solar urticarial symptoms from a young age could mistakenly be thought to have erythropoietic protoporphyria. However, the main symptom for this disease is pain and patients with have been found to have abnormal levels of protoporphyrin in their blood while these levels are normal in SU patients. Finally, cholinergic urticaria, or urticaria induced by heat, can occasionally appear to be solar urticaria because the heat from the sun will cause a person with the disease to have a reaction.|$|E

25|$|Genes {{within the}} {{papillomavirus}} genome are usually identified after similarity with other previously identified genes.

25|$|In this example, simple logic tells {{that there}} is a difference: while the first {{statement}} may be true, it does not assert anything about {{the truth of the matter}} stated.

50|$|Because {{this is a}} rare tumor, {{not many}} family {{physicians}} or oncologists are familiar with this disease. DSRCT in young patients can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for other abdominal tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and mesenteric carcinoid. In older patients DSRCT can resemble lymphoma, peritoneal mesothelioma, and peritoneal carcinomatosis. In males DSRCT may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for germ cell or testicular cancer while in females DSRCT can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> for Ovarian cancer.
