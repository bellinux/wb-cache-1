This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>Bubbling</b> <b>and</b> AlCuP on primary Si size in Al- 18 %Si alloy. <b>Bubbling</b> process <b>and</b> AlCuP {{treatment}} are effective for refining primary Si in hypereutectic Al-Si alloy. Both the <b>bubble</b> <b>and</b> AlCuP {{can be used as}} nucleation sites of primary Si. Many nucleation sites can make the size of primary Si decreased. So, this experiment suggests that the mix using of <b>bubbling</b> process <b>and</b> AlCuP treatment are more effective for nucleation site of primary Si. For deciding the optimum treatment order, the experiments are processed 3 kinds of order with varying stirring time and holding temperature; 1) AlCuP treatment <b>and</b> then <b>bubbling</b> process, 2) simultaneously using of <b>bubbling</b> process <b>and</b> AlCuP treatment, 3) <b>bubbling</b> process <b>and</b> then AlCuP treatment...|$|R

The theoretical material and the relevant numerical implementation, valid for a <b>bubble</b> <b>and</b> a free surface with either equal or unequal uniform surface tensions, are briefly described and preliminary numerical results for a nearly-neutrally buoyant solid sphere interacting with a <b>bubble</b> <b>and</b> a free surface with equal surface tensions are presented...|$|R
5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases.

They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer <b>bubbles</b> <b>and</b> less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E

The plane's inaugural flight was held at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 17, 2000. In 2002 the aircraft was repainted with a different Powerpuff Girls theme to promote The Powerpuff Girls Movie. The Powerpuff Girls series has won two Primetime Emmys, two Annie Awards, and including those four wins, has been nominated a total of sixteen times for various awards.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas <b>bubbles,</b> <b>and</b> the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E

The movie, a prequel to the series, {{tells the story of}} how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. After Blossom, <b>Bubbles</b> <b>and</b> Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium to help the city against crime, they end up only causing chaos in Townsville. Down about how everyone refers to them as freaks, they turn to Mojo Jojo, a monkey who says he is there to help make people like them again. Unknown to the girls, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's lab chimp helper who was mutated as a cause from the Powerpuff Girls being made and has become super smart as a result and jealous of them. Mojo Jojo ends up tricking the girls into helping him make a machine to mutate other chimps. Seeing what they have done the kids run away in shame but come back after seeing Professor Utonium in trouble, and Blossom, <b>Bubbles</b> <b>and</b> Buttercup end up beating Mojo Jojo and his army of mutated smart chimps and saving the day, thus becoming Townsville's new defenders. The movie received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes and received some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.|$|E

The series premiered in Japan the {{following}} year with 52 half-hour episodes, airing each Saturday from July 1 to December 23, 2006, and from January 6 to June 30, 2007. The series deviated from its American predecessor in terms of style, storyline, and characterization, but only minimally retained the essential themes that made the original a success. The characters feature three junior high school students Momoko Akatsutsumi (Hyper Blossom), Miyako Gotokuji (Rolling <b>Bubbles),</b> <b>and</b> Kaoru Matsubara (Powered Buttercup) as the three heroes.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas <b>bubbles,</b> <b>and</b> that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of decompression sickness {{are known to}} be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas <b>bubbles</b> <b>and</b> other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage.

Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
