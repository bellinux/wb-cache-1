40|$|We derive {{analytic}} expressions for {{the energies}} and B(E 2) -transition probabilities {{in the states}} of the ground and γ bands of heavy deformed nuclei within a collective Vector-Boson Model with SU(3) dynamical symmetry. On this basis we examine the analytic behavior of the SU(3) energy splitting and the B(E 2) interband transition ratios in the SU(3) contraction limits of the model. The theoretical analyses outline physically reasonable ways in which the ground-γ <b>band</b> <b>coupling</b> vanishes. The experimental data on the lowest collective states of even-even rare earth nuclei and actinides strongly support the theoretical results. They suggest that a transition from the ground-γ <b>band</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme to a scheme in which the ground band is situated in a separate irreducible representation of SU(3) should be realized towards the midshell regions. We propose that generally the SU(3) group contraction process should play an important role for such a kind of transitions in any collective <b>band</b> <b>coupling</b> scheme in heavy deformed nuclei.

A parametrization for the dependence on the density and the ratio between light- and heavy-hole masses is given. We apply our results to a hole gas in an AlxGa 1 -xAs/GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs quantum well and calculate the two-dimensional band structure and the band-gap renormalization. The inclusion of the valence <b>band</b> <b>coupling</b> in the calculation of the exchange-correlation potentials for holes and electrons leads to a much better agreement between theoretical and experimental data than when it is omitted...|$|E

40|$|Magnon-photon {{coupling}} in antiferromagnets has many attractive features {{that do not}} exist in ferro- or ferrimagnets. We show quantum-mechanically that, {{in the absence of}} an external field, one of the two degenerated spin wave <b>bands</b> <b>couples</b> with photons while the other does not. The photon mode anticrosses with the coupled spin waves when their frequencies are close to each other. Similar to its ferromagnetic counterpart, the magnon-photon coupling strength is proportional to the square root of number of spins √(N) in antiferromagnets. An external field removes the spin wave degeneracy and both spin wave <b>bands</b> <b>couple</b> to the photons, resulting in two anticrossings between the magnons and photons. Two transmission peaks were observed near the anticrossing frequency. The maximum damping that allows clear discrimination of the two transmission peaks is proportional to √(N) and it's well below the damping of antiferromagnetic insulators. Therefore the strong magnon-photon coupling can be realized in antiferromagnets and the coherent information transfer between the photons and magnons is possible. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} technique for determining polarization-dependent optical transition matrix elements in quantum wires which rigorously incorporates {{the effects of}} <b>band</b> <b>coupling.</b> Using this technique, we examine the polarization anisotropy of the two lowest energy optical transitions in a GaAs quantum wire. Contrary to assumptions employed in previous studies, we show that the valence states involved in these transitions are a strong admixture of light and heavy hole character. The lowest energy transition {{is found to be}} four times stronger for electric fields oriented parallel to the wire than for the perpendicular orientation. In contrast, the next highest transition does not interact with optical waves polarized along the wire axis. We discuss sources of error which arise in simpler one-band models of this phenomenon in addition to the neglect of <b>band</b> <b>coupling</b> and show that the coupled band model presented here is essential for predicting these effects...|$|E

40|$|We derive {{analytically}} {{the change}} of exciton fine structure splitting (FSS) under the external stresses in the self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots using the Bir-Pikus model.
