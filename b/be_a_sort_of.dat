25|$|Numa {{built the}} Ianus geminus (also Janus Bifrons, Janus Quirinus or Portae Belli), a passage ritually opened {{at times of}} war, and shut again when Roman arms rested. It formed a walled {{enclosure}} with gates at each end, situated between the old Roman Forum and that of Julius Caesar, which had been consecrated by Numa Pompilius himself. About the exact location and aspect of the temple {{there has been much}} debate among scholars. In wartime the gates of the Janus were opened, and in its interior sacrifices and vaticinia were held, to forecast the outcome of military deeds. The doors were closed only during peacetime, an extremely rare event. The function of the Ianus Geminus was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> good omen: in time of peace it was said to close the wars within or to keep peace inside; in times of war it was said to be open to allow the return of the people on duty.|$|E

500|$|The {{reception}} to Quicksilver {{was generally}} positive. Some reviewers found the length cumbersome; however, others found the length impressive in its quality and entertainment value. Paul Boutin at Slate Magazine comments that Quicksilver offers {{an insight into}} how advanced and complicated science was during the age of [...] "alchemists and microscope-makers"; and that the scientists of the period were [...] "the forerunners of the biotech and nanotech researchers who are today's IT Geeks". Entertainment Weekly rates Quicksilver [...] an A-, stating that the book [...] "makes you ponder concepts and theories you initially thought you'll never understand". The critic finds a parallel between Stephenson's approach and a passage from the book describing an effort to put [...] "all human knowledge... in a vast Encyclopedia that will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> machine, not only for finding old knowledge but for making new".|$|E
500|$|The {{experimental}} {{findings of}} the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment were quickly confirmed, and extended to other hereditary characteristics besides polysaccharide capsules. [...] However, there was considerable reluctance to accept the conclusion that DNA was the genetic material. [...] According to Phoebus Levene's influential [...] "tetranucleotide hypothesis", DNA consisted of repeating units of the four nucleotide bases and had little biological specificity. [...] DNA was therefore {{thought to be the}} structural component of chromosomes, whereas the genes were thought likely to be made of the protein component of chromosomes. [...] This line of thinking was reinforced by the 1935 crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus by Wendell Stanley, and the parallels among viruses, genes, and enzymes; many biologists thought genes might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "super-enzyme", and viruses were shown according to Stanley to be proteins and to share the property of autocatalysis with many enzymes. [...] Furthermore, few biologists thought that genetics could be applied to bacteria, since they lacked chromosomes and sexual reproduction. [...] In particular, many of the geneticists known informally as the phage group, which would become influential in the new discipline of molecular biology in the 1950s, were dismissive of DNA as the genetic material (and were inclined to avoid the [...] "messy" [...] biochemical approaches of Avery and his colleagues). [...] Some biologists, including fellow Rockefeller Institute Fellow Alfred Mirsky, challenged Avery's finding that the transforming principle was pure DNA, suggesting that protein contaminants were instead responsible. [...] Although transformation occurred in some kinds of bacteria, it could not be replicated in other bacteria (nor in any higher organisms), and its significance seemed limited primarily to medicine.|$|E

2500|$|Although some of {{the third}} {{generation}} of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing {{to think in terms}} of marginal utility, most economists presumed that utility must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> quantity.

2500|$|In various {{critical}} {{interpretations of}} the novella, special note is made {{about the possibility that}} Dionis is the writer's alter ego. The story never reveals whether Dionis or Dan is the actual protagonist—according to Pârvulescu, the solution is [...] "so very simple that everyone misses it by a long shot: the 'real' hero of these episodes is the poet, no matter what pseudonym he uses, and his dream [...] is the poem". Early on, Eminescu admirers were especially prone to arriving at this conclusion. Eminescian poet Alexandru Vlahuță notes that he imagined Eminescu to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sleepwalking Dionis, and that, to his surprise, his idol was rather [...] "a stout and round-faced, aging, man, short-haired and dressed like any other".|$|E
2500|$|Robert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein {{dedicated}} his 1958 novel Methuselah's Children [...] "To Edward E. Smith, PhD".) Heinlein {{reported that}} E. E.

Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports {{that he began to}} suspect Smith might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "superman" [...] when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car.
