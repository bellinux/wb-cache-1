2500|$|On 19 November, local {{residents}} reported witnessing 28 Ethiopian military trucks and APCs loaded with troops establish a forward base in Guri'el, Somalia. Ethiopian government spokesman Shimeles Kemal would not {{confirm or deny}} the report. However, Ethiopian Foreign Ministry spokesman Dina Mufti dismissed the reports of the Ethiopian military's deployment as [...] "absolutely not true, there are absolutely no troops in Somalia People are simply speculating". Mufti added that [...] "there is an intention {{on the part of}} IGAD members to bolster peacekeeping forces, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know the regional countries are working on increasing the numbers of AMISOM". Somali government spokesman Abdirahman Omar Osman also denied that Ethiopian troops had entered the country, stating that the Ethiopian military would first [...] "need a mandate" [...] or a bilateral agreement since the TFG [...] "don't want anyone that could give propaganda for al-Shabab We don't want any backlash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rival {{networks}} ABC and CBS had discouraged [...] "their stars" [...] from {{appearing on}} The Jay Leno Show in its primetime slot. [...] Julia Louis-Dreyfus (The New Adventures of Old Christine) {{was the first}} CBS actor {{to appear on the}} show, on September 29, 2009; on that episode, she said [...] "there was a little pressure, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know you are now on prime time", but that [...] "Obviously, I committed to doing your show and we’re friends". [...] This boycott did not affect The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien nor was it industry-wide. [...] Other TV networks, like Fox, The CW, and HBO, were more encouraging. [...] Hugh Laurie from the Fox TV show House was a guest on the September 25, 2009, telecast. House is produced by Universal Media Studios, a sister company to NBC through NBC Universal, and Fox does not offer any network programming in the 10 p.m. time slots, instead allowing most of its affiliates to go to local news.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{completion}} of the series, Rowling began to speak openly about Snape, discussing the contrast between his character arc and that of Albus Dumbledore. Rowling said [...] "the series is built around [...] ", and maintained that she always knew what Snape {{would turn out to be}} at the end and that she carefully plotted his storyline throughout the series. [...] "I had to drop clues all the way through <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at the point where you see what was really going on, it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you've never seen before." [...] Rowling further said in an interview that she wanted Snape to find redemption and forgiveness: [...] "Snape is a complicated man...he was a flawed human being, like all of us. Harry forgives him...Harry really sees the good in Snape ultimately... I wanted there to be redemption." ...|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps you marvelled that I {{wrote to}} your reverence <b>as</b> brother ... <b>because,</b> just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are greater in age, you {{likewise}} are lesser in rank.|$|R
50|$|Hussain {{said at the}} Festival “I feel blessed as {{somebody}} from Afghanistan <b>because</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> hear about Afghanistan, people think war, poverty, and terrorism. But from such a country this is where I did very hard training to reach this level. Then beating all these {{people from around the}} world especially with many Chinese Masters, I feel great”.|$|R
5000|$|Ordway {{has noted}} that [...] "Inking is a weird job, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> put into it, the page still belongs to the penciler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} for the propriety of the thing; <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know very well, priests don't marry, and the {{children}} were illegitimate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I call {{it part of}} it, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{observed}} just now, {{our living}} here {{will be the same}} as though you made Emily an allowance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I run on at random, dear Sophy, {{hoping to}} give you {{one and a half}} hour's {{occupation}} on a sick bed or couch, and <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say, this is the only converse we are likely to have on earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think that, do you, Bickley?" [...] {{answered}} Bastin. [...] "Well, I {{hold that}} it is better to heal souls than bodies, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> even <b>you</b> will have learned out there in Orofena, they last so much longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think you}} ought to make a demand upon me <b>because</b> <b>as</b> my Chaplain <b>you</b> were asked to see a gentleman who called here on a {{delicate}} matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear that she will have to leave, Andrew, both for her own sake and <b>because</b> she might, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say, have been useful to us in making a few inquiries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{may well}} have observed, I have very much {{interest}} for all {{that has to do}} with the military, and, of course, castles are among them. You will excuse me for one moment, my dear Jack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"The kissing {{behind the}} door, {{and all that}} sort of thing, Tom," [...] said the old gentleman. And here he gave another impudent look, which made Tom very wroth, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> all know, gentlemen, to hear an old fellow, who ought to know better, talking about these things, is very unpleasant--nothing more so.|$|E
60|$|Thirdly: It {{is plain}} from what I have said, that {{you of the}} lower rank have no just reason to {{complain}} of your condition: <b>Because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> plainly see, it affordeth you so many advantages, and freeth you from so many vexations, so many distempers both of body and mind, which pursue and torment the rich and powerful.|$|E
40|$|Situate yourselves <b>as</b> close <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can to the {{perpetrators}} of crime and deviance, to the victims, to the agents of social control; put yourselves, <b>as</b> best <b>you</b> can and for <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, inside their lives, inside the lived moments of deviance and crime. You won't experience it nicely, and if the danger and hurt become too much, be glad of it. <b>Because</b> <b>as</b> near <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will ever get, you have found your way inside the humanity of crime and deviance...|$|R
3000|$|... “My {{parents have}} contributed {{a lot to}} get me there where I’m now. <b>Because</b> alone, <b>as</b> student <b>you</b> don’t have the {{possibility}} to stand up for yourself. You just believe the teacher.” (Zora) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will, in few words. You are cold, {{because you}} are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you. You are silly, <b>because,</b> suffer <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then we {{will say}} no more; <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> recollect, we {{agreed not to}} go too far. No expostulations, for {{we are going to}} be {{practical}} young people; besides, I won't listen if you utter them. I simply echo your words, and say I, too, believe you. Now I must go. Have faith in me, and don't magnify trifles light as air.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There is {{no fear of}} that, señor. They dread {{the wild}} beasts; {{there are so many}} in these forests, and they can scent a human being a long {{distance}} away. We have chosen this tree <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> see, the lower branch is near the ground, and it will be easier to climb up into it if I give the alarm.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} this would come one day," [...] she went on. [...] "Why don't you speak and get it over? Are you waiting to clothe your phrases? Are you afraid of the naked words? I'm not. Let me hear them. Don't be more melodramatic than you can help <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know, I am cursed {{with a sense of}} humour, but don't stand there saying nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your riches know {{no kind of}} pause, Your {{trade is}} fast advancing; You dance--but not for joy, <b>because</b> <b>You</b> weep <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are dancing.

6000|$|... "It matters {{above all}} things;--above all things, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> to them <b>you</b> {{may come to}} {{something}} like certainty. Of {{the inside of her}} heart you cannot know so much. The fact I take it is this--that you would wish to escape from this bondage." ...|$|R
60|$|First. If you do {{anything}} commanded in Scripture, and your doing of it do think that God is well pleased therewith, <b>because</b> <b>you,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are religious men, do do the same. Upon this mistake was Paul himself {{in danger of being}} destroyed; for he thought, because he was zealous, and one of the strictest sects for religion, therefore God would have been good unto him, and have accepted his doings, as it is clear, for he counted them his gain (Phil 3:4-8). Now this is done thus--When a man doth think that because he thinks he is more sincere, more liberal, with more difficulty, or to the weakening of his estate; I say, if a man, because of this doth think that God accepteth his labour, it is done from an old-covenant spirit.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} you must sit just where you are, and not gallop about. There's {{a matter of}} a hundred and twenty acres here, I should say, and a fox doesn't always choose to be evicted at the first notice. It's a chance whether he goes at all from a wood like this. I like woods myself, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say, we can take it easy; {{but if you want to}} ride, you should-- By George, they've killed him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is simply}} skill against brute force, Osip. I may tell you, what I have not told anyone before since I came here, {{that my mother}} was English. I did not say so, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may guess, I feared that were it known and {{reported}} it might be traced who I was, and then, instead of being merely classed as a vagabond, I should be sent back to the prison I escaped from, and be put among another class of prisoners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do! You {{were kind}} enough to hand me a glass of brandy-and-water, which the landlady had just mixed for your own drinking. And I was obliged to refuse it <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> I told <b>you,</b> the taste of brandy always turns me sick and faint, mix it how you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hewson reflected. [...] "I don't {{see how it}} can. I {{was trying}} to come to you, when I got your note, to say that St. John had been to see me, and offered to release me from my offer, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> I thought, <b>you</b> had made him a better one. He's amusingly rapacious, St. John is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{agree to}} your conditions," [...] he said, [...] "and the more readily <b>because</b> I shall, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say, at once free myself from difficulties, and avenge myself on Bajee Rao; who is, I know, {{in spite of}} his professions of friendship, {{constantly}} plotting against me. Tomorrow at daybreak an officer shall ride, with a troop of cavalry, and shall bring Nana here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] he said, with, {{more respect}} than he usually showed {{to any one}} save his master, [...] "I confess I may {{sometimes}} jest with those of your coat, but not with you; <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may partly recollect, I owe you a life. It is certain as the sun is in heaven, that Halbert Glendinning supped {{at the house of}} my master the Baron of Avenel last night, and that he came thither in company with an old man, of whom more anon." ...|$|E
60|$|You claim, as I understand, that {{according}} to my own position in the Albany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be released; and this <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> claim, he has not damaged the military service by discouraging enlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had, {{he should have been}} turned over to the civil authorities under the recent acts of Congress. I certainly do not know that Mr. Vallandigham has specifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in favor of desertion and resistance to drafting.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} to have a moral under all its gaiety," [...] assented Syme; [...] "but may I ask you two questions? You need not fear to give me information, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> remember, you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police, a promise I shall {{certainly}} keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries. First of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object to? You want to abolish Government?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't ask her. With her, somehow, one is very discreet. But I guessed, easily enough. She {{suffers from}} her wicked old {{mother and her}} Grand Turk of a brother.

2500|$|Transport for London {{promoted}} the Oyster card at launch with many adverts seeking to portray {{it as an}} alternative to the paper Travelcard. In late 2005 the Advertising Standards Authority ordered the withdrawal of one such poster which claimed that Oyster pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go was [...] "more convenient" [...] than Travelcards with [...] "no need to plan in advance". The ASA ruled that the two products were not directly comparable, mainly <b>because</b> the pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go facility was not valid on most National Rail routes at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the North American release has been mixed. IGN's Metacritic lists an average rating for the game at 66, {{which is also the}} listed industry average for all games at the site. GameRankings has the game listed at a similar figure of 70%. GameSpot gave a rating of 4.0 (out of 10.0) citing [...] "tedious quests and little payoff". IGN expressed similar concerns, noting the familiar grind between many other Korean MMOs. [...] "You know, it's frustrating <b>because</b> <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> want to like this game, unless Korean is your preferred flavor of MMO, you probably just won't." ...|$|R
