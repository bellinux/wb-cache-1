40|$|Multiple rocket {{exhaust plume}} {{interactions}} at high altitudes can produce base flow recirculation with attendant alteration {{of the base}} pressure coefficient and increased base heating. A search for a good wind tunnel benchmark problem to check grid clustering technique and turbulence modeling turned up the experiment done at AEDC in 1961 by Goethert and Matz on a 4. 25 -in. diameter domed missile base model with four rocket nozzles. This wind tunnel model with varied external <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> for the base flow wake produced measured p/p(sub ref) {{at the center of}} the base as high as 3. 3 due to plume flow recirculation back onto the base. At that time in 1961, relatively inexpensive experimentation with air at gamma = 1. 4 and nozzle A(sub e) /A of 10. 6 and theta(sub n) = 7. 55 deg with P(sub c) = 155 psia simulated a LO 2 /LH 2 rocket exhaust plume with gamma = 1. 20, A(sub e) /A of 78 and P(sub c) about 1, 000 psia. An array of base pressure taps on the aft dome gave a clear measurement of the plume recirculation effects at p(infinity) = 4. 76 psfa corresponding to 145, 000 ft altitude. Our CFD computations of the flow field with direct comparison of computed-versus-measured base pressure distribution (across the dome) provide detailed information on velocities and particle traces as well eddy viscosity in the base and nozzle region. The solution was obtained using a six-zone mesh with 284, 000 grid points for one quadrant taking advantage of symmetry. Results are compared using a zero-equation algebraic and a one-equation pointwise R(sub t) turbulence model (work in progress). Good agreement with the experimental pressure data was obtained with both; and this benchmark showed the importance of: (1) proper grid clustering and (2) proper choice of turbulence modeling for rocket plume problems/recirculation at high altitude...|$|E
40|$|In modern aircraft, one of {{the most}} {{difficult}} issues has been how to provide avionics with adequate cooling. Future versions of the fighter aircraft JAS 39 Gripen is equipped with new applications that have increased heat loads. In previous versions of the JAS 39 Gripen avionics was cooled by zero degree air and fuel, but in the next version a liquid loop will be installed to cool the new radar. The fluid in the liquid loop is cooled to proper temperature by pressurized bleed air from the engine which is cooled by ram air. The air to cool the avionics is produced the same way and this is a very expensive process for the airplane which lowers its performance. It is important to minimize the production of cooling air and therefore three new adjustable valves that provide various components of cooling air are installed in the next version of the JAS 39 Gripen. The cooled and pressure controlled air from the engine is distributed between different avionic shelves, each containing a set of components. Depending on the type of tasks performed and current flight mode of the aircraft the requirement of functions which should be active varies and therefore also the cooling demand to avionics. The first part of this thesis studies the overall priority of how the engine bleed shall be used. This part of the thesis results in a decision basis for the distribution of cooling air to be regulated in the absence of full cooling capacity. The amount of cooling which must be distributed to the radar is proportional to its developed power which varies widely depending on the radar’s operational mode. Since the pump which determines the liquid flow velocity operates at a constant speed is the regulation of cooling to the radar is controlled by varying the <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> into the heat exchanger which cools the fluid and thus the temperature of the fluid has when it reaches the radar. This part of the thesis creates a control algorithm for controlling the airflow into the heat exchanger. The regulation keeps the fluid inlet temperature to the radar within the range of + 25 ± 5 ˚ C and the gradient of the temperature less than 0. 5 ° C per second. The PI-controller with the feed-forward filter succeeded in controlling the temperature of the liquid as it reached the radar within + 25 ± 1 ° C, the temperature gradient requirement, 0. 5 ° C per second, was also passed in all flight cases which were used to evaluate the controller. The PI-controller with feed-forward has a low convergence time and no static error. It also performs well when the measurement signals contain a lot of noise because of the controllers integrated low pass filter.   The three new adjustable valves saves 12 to 97 g/s of cooling air for the different valve positions studied in this thesis, this corresponds to 9 - 70 % of the total amount of controllable air to the avionics. Since the production of cooling air is a costly process for the aircraft, the use of all 3 valves is recommended...|$|E

It is either the key consumer of pneumatic power or draws a substantial load from the electric power system. Therefore, it is crucial for the trade-off between aircraft and engine design and {{an important element of}} a tool to assess system architectures at aircraft level. Drawing on these findings, this paper presents the development of a dedicated simulation tool to evaluate potential ECS architectures in conceptual design with respect to systems weight and performance metrics such as electrical power demand or engine <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> mass <b>flow...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was {{determined}} to be a stall caused by the leading edge slats (strictly speaking, Krueger flaps) having been left in the retracted position. Even though the trailing edge flaps were deployed, without the slats being extended the aircraft's stall speed was higher and the maximum angle of attack was lower. As a result, the aircraft was unable to climb out of ground effect. The flight engineer was found to have failed to open the slat system <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> valves as required on the pre-flight checklist. This prevented <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from <b>flowing</b> to the 747's pneumatic slat system and, since the leading edge slats on the 747 are pneumatically driven, kept it from deploying the leading edge slats for takeoff. The take-off warning system that would have sounded an alarm due to the flaps not being lowered did not have a separate warning that the slats' pneumatic valve had not been opened by the flight engineer.|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} control system {{is an essential}} subsystem of an aircraft, which has to comply some vital tasks. These include {{the setting of the}} desired temperature, humidity and cabin pressure, as well as ensuring the fresh air or oxygen supply and air quality. The requirements must be achieved in very different ambient conditions. This refers to the environmental conditions in the flight and ground cases, and also to the different climate zones. In addition, the existing interfaces to the aircraft must be taken into account. State of the art in currently used commercial aircrafts is an {{environmental control}} system, which is based on the air cycle and is driven by <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from the engine. This technology allows only a significantly lower coefficient of performance for the given boundary conditions compared to a vapor-compression refrigeration system. Therefore the potential application of the vapor cycle in the aircraft air conditioning system is investigated in a research project with the cooperation partner Airbus. The new system has to be developed as a replacement of the existing air cycle system. In a detailed simulation model the thermodynamic state variables are calculated for every element and different operating cases. The calculation results are then used to investigate and size the main components, e. g. heat exchangers and turbomachinery. After the optimization of the system parameters and the individual components the new system is compared with the existing system. The benchmark shows a considerably decrease of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> for the reference cases on ground and in flight, both at hot ambient conditions...|$|R
50|$|Naturally any <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> {{returned}} to the cycle (or dumped overboard) must also be deducted from the main <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> at the point it is bled from the compressor. If some of the cooling air is bled from part way along the compressor (i.e. interstage), the power absorbed by the unit must be adjusted accordingly.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{statistics}} about civil transportation aircraft Environmental Control system (ECS), the three-wheel {{high pressure water}} separation system (HPWS) and low pressure water separation system (LPWS) {{are the most common}} choices for the 150 -seat airliners. Although the former has become the mainstream configuration for air conditioning pack, the latter is still used on Boeing 737 - 600 / 700. In order to compare the two configurations and choose the better one for a specific aircraft, simulation and analysis are done. The cabin heat load is calculated at first in order to calculate required engine <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> mass <b>flow.</b> Then a specific aircraft is defined so that required structural dimensions and cabin comfort indexes can be obtained based on Airbus 320. Thirdly, the component models are built by Matlab/Simulink according to the fundamental knowledge of heat transfer and aerodynamics, the working principles and mechanical dimensions of the components, the ambient environmental parameters and some data from Airbus 320. Consequently, the complete system model can be assembled. After confirming the validity of the model by checking the required ram <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> and temperature deviation of the state points referred to Airbus 320, the simulation model is used to do analyze the specific aircraft. Finally, through comparing the different values of ram <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> and turbine expansion ratio, as well as the system mass, economic cost and reliability, the better configuration is selected. It can be summarized that the three-wheel LPWS requires less ram <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> (0. 012 kg/s) and a little lower expansion ratio (0. 02) than the HPWS, and it also has lower weight (63 % of HPWS), lower (83 % of HPWS) cost and higher reliability (140 % of HPWS), thus it is the suitable configuration for the specific aircraft...|$|R

They are connected by a hose to the aircraft ducting, which includes a check valve to allow the APU <b>air</b> to <b>flow</b> into the aircraft, while not allowing the main engine's <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> to exit through the duct.|$|R
50|$|The huffer {{works by}} blowing {{compressed}} air via flexible hose to the aircraft's <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system. From there, the <b>air</b> <b>flows</b> via a pilot controlled valve to the engine's starter motor. The starter motor converts {{the energy of the}} moving air to rotational torque. The starter motor is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough <b>air</b> <b>flowing</b> through the compressor and the combustion chamber to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized kerosene starts flowing and an igniter similar to a spark plug ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.|$|R
50|$|Engine <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is {{admitted}} through a {{flow control valve}} to a heat exchanger.

The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is cooled in the heat exchanger by ram air entering the dorsal fin inlet and passing through the heat exchanger. The amount of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> cooling at the heat exchanger can be controlled by the hot air bypass valve (H-valve).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the six-decade use of unfiltered aircraft <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> taken from jet engines to supply breathing {{air in the}} flight decks and passenger cabins of commercial and military transport aircraft. During this time, numerous flight safety issues and adverse effects from exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> have been reported. The research undertaken in this thesis examined previous investigations into these matters {{and the consequences of}} using <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on flight safety and crew and passenger health. This research examined: (a) health issues reported by aircrew as a consequence of exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> whilst flying by way of several descriptive surveys; (b) various aviation air monitoring studies previously undertaken were reviewed to assess the knowledge base of the chemicals present during contaminated air events; (c) air sampling data were evaluated for their usefulness in determining any potential adverse health effects; (d) a review was undertaken of the frequency of contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> events; (e) a review was undertaken of some of the information known by the aviation industry and others about contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> Analysis of the evidence that <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> contaminated by synthetic jet engine oils and hydraulic fluids, is a regular and normal occurrence and far more common than previously accepted and is a consequence of the current <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system design. There are significant short and longterm health effects being reported {{as a direct result of}} documented exposure events that validate claims of adverse health effects in exposed individuals. The thesis argues that the precautionary principle, occupational health and safety guidelines and aviation regulations are being ignored by the aviation industry, who continue to claim that cabin air is safe. The systemic misuse of available data is widespread, secondary to commercial objectives, and places passenger and crew health and flight safety at serious risk. The thesis concludes that the use of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on commercial aircraft with no form of contaminated air detection or filtration system present should be discontinued. The risk to health and flight safety is no longer acceptable...|$|R
