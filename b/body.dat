5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object.

Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that <b>body</b> as the forces balance one another.

In gender archaeology the visibility of <b>bodies</b> as archaeological evidence has lead to questions being asked of the very formulation of gender as a concept, of how gender is understood to operate through <b>bodies</b> and in society. The point I will argue {{in the course of this}} paper is that the sex/gender split naturalizes a binary division of <b>bodies</b> and hence naturalizes the exclusive division of <b>bodies</b> into male and female. Such a binary division may be a pertinent description of current ideals of the structure of <b>bodies.</b> Its establishment as a natural fact, however, is impeding the investigation of <b>bodies</b> in prehistory, preventing the questioning of how <b>bodies</b> gain significance, how <b>bodies</b> become sexed...|$|R
