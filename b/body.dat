5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object.

Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that <b>body</b> as the forces balance one another.

In gender archaeology the visibility of <b>bodies</b> as archaeological evidence has lead to questions being asked of the very formulation of gender as a concept, of how gender is understood to operate through <b>bodies</b> and in society.
