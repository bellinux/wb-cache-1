40|$|We model masonry {{structures}} as elastodynamic systems assembled from a {{large number}} of elastic <b>bodies</b> (<b>bricks</b> or stone-blocks) in unilateral, frictional contact. The problem is formulated as a quasi-variational inequality and discretised using piecewise polynomial finite elements in conjunction with an energy consistent time integration scheme. At each time-step, the quasi-variational inequality is reformulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem. An iterative splitting of the contact problem into normal contact and frictional contact, together with a primal-dual active-set method is employed to calculate deformations and openings in the model structures. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the resulting approach in predicting the mechanical behaviour of a bidimensional arch-ring made of bricks, deformed due to body forces and surface tractions...|$|R

40|$|A new {{finding of}} the {{observation}} of an elemental gradient or zoning of calcium and sulphur in fired <b>brick</b> <b>bodies</b> is described, that {{does not appear to}} have been reported in the literature before. Many raw clays used in brickmaking and pottery contain sulphur and calcium evenly distributed in low amounts in the unfired clay body. However, when the clay body is fired in the kiln at 1050 °C, the elements sulphur and calcium appear to combine to a compound, most probably calcium sulphate. The formation of calcium sulphate, visualised using energy dispersive imaging micro X-ray fluorescence (?-XRF), only occurs around a so-called reduction core, also known as ‘black core’, caused by reduced magnetite Fe 3 O 4 in the centre of the <b>brick</b> <b>body.</b> The presence of a black reduction core appears to cause the formation of a calcium sulphate layer around the black reduction core. This research contributes to the understanding of phenomena like salt formation, efflorescence and durability in solid clay <b>brick</b> <b>bodies.</b> Large sums are spent on building conservation by national economies and improvement of bricks is of key interest to them. <br/...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the <b>brick</b> <b>bodies</b> from Achaemenid sites differ from the composition of bricks in the Mesopotamia region. Glazed wall plaques from neo-Assyrian sites and bricks from the neo-Babylonian period of Babylon were made with calcareous clays likely from the alluvial sediments between the Tigris and Euphrates [16, 21, 22]. In contrast, Achaemenid bricks were made in the faience technique [19], created by mixing sand or powdered quartz with lime or limestone and alkali in the form of natron or plant ashes [13, 23]. A previous study of bricks from Persepolis suggested they were faience due to a composition low in alumina indicating a lack of clay in the body [21], as was also found in this study. The faience technology likely originated from Elam. Twelve glazed bricks from Elam were identified as faience by Caubet using pXRF, with less than 1.7  % alumina and less than 2  % iron oxides, in contrast to bricks from Assyria and Babylon with 12 – 14  % alumina and 4 – 7  % iron oxides [23]. However, analysis of other <b>brick</b> <b>bodies</b> from Achaemenid Susa, the historic capital of Elam identified clays in the <b>brick</b> <b>bodies</b> [24, 25]. More research is needed to understand the use and cultural implications of faience technology across the Achaemenid empire.|$|R

40|$|Masonry {{structures}} may be modelled as {{an assembly}} of linearly elastic <b>bodies</b> (individual <b>bricks</b> or stone-blocks) in unilateral frictional contact. Such models generally constitute a formidable computational challenge {{owing to the}} need to resolve interactions between individual bodies, such as detection of crack and openings and the resolution of non-linear equations governing the contact. Even for medium size structures, the large number of blocks from which they are assembled renders a full direct simulation of such structures practically impossible. In this paper, an adaptive multi-scale technique for the modelling of large-scale dynamic structures is implemented and applied to the computer simulation of Clare College Bridge, in Cambridge, UK. The adaptive multi-scale approach enables us to carry out simulations at a complexity normally associated with the cost of modelling the entire structure by a simple continuum model whilst incorporating small scale effects, such as openings of gaps and slippage between individual masonry units, using a systematic and locally optimal criterion...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen {{voices are}} no longer heard and {{circulate}} the lies, when faces {{are no longer}} seen and gazes turned away, what possibility is left to oppose? To invade the space with one's body, to accumulate the meat to make mass, to form a crowd. In other words, to occupy, to be preoccupied, to look after. But how can the researcher account for this dynamics of the flesh, tell what the bodies say, tell the space reformulated by these organizing bodies, describe such a massive and flexible atmosphere? Occupy universities and schools: body matters Brazil, end of 2016. The temporary Government wants to pass a constitutional amendment that would freeze public spending, including spending for public schools and universities. Higher education {{is likely to become}} even more reserved to an elite of money, {{the only one who can}} afford private universities, or the secondary education that leads to it. Besides, sport, arts, literature and social sciences would no longer be mandatory. And the law wants to impose a 'political objectivity'; i. e. to prevent opinions from being expressed or discussed in those places. More than 2000 schools and universities are then occupied by students and teachers, maintaining the premises, organizing alternative courses, protesting while taking care of their space. The police and the army will repeatedly dislodge these occupying bodies, sometimes violently. Whereas, as Foucault has clearly demonstrated, it was these institutions, schools and universities, that used to enclose and discipline bodies, it is now the bodies that try to save them, so that they do not spread out in a collection of bodies that just work. These places are occupied. In French it is said that a line is occupied, when it is engaged. Communication is no longer possible, because bodies are engaged. An occupation is a matter of <b>bodies,</b> <b>bricks,</b> banners, and media. Only one face was to be seen, that of a young schoolgirl in front of the parliamentarians who asks them to come to see the occupation, to come with their bodies. It is the bodies that connect, that unite. Style We would like to argue that what is at stake, what is threatened, is a lifestyle, a form of life. If style is above all a matter of sensitive quality, of appearance, it is also one of the plans where human existence or social adventure qualify, struggle and even win (Macé, 2016). By occupying, by defending a habitat, it is also a habitus and a habit that they defend, i. e. an aesthetic and an ethos, an ethics. They defend a singular way of being in common, of engaging, of passing on. What the laws may entail is a confiscation of form, the stifling of a lifestyle, of a form of life, as much in its daily practices as in the values it affirms, and also in the possibilities of individuation that he promotes. But how to investigate a style, with its rhythms, vibrations, paces, tonalities, distinctions, with its forms-forces, reliefs, punctuations, dynamics of spacing? This very vocabulary of style leads us to turn to affects. We would like to try to think what the turn to affects in a Deleuzian logic might mean to study such a situation. For Deleuze, the stylist is the one who creates a foreign language inside his own language, and pushes it to its musical limit. The aim will then not to represent the occupation as an expression of a style but to make it feel, moving from the logic of sense to the logic of sensation (Deleuze, 1981). The sensation for Deleuze acts directly on the nervous system, which is flesh, without passing through the brain, through figuration, through a story. Giving to feel sensation is like entering the picture, touching the unity of feeling and be felt. It is to see the occupation as the performance of a theater of repetition. It is to paint the forces, to paint the cry rather than the horror. Gesture that Deleuze looks for with Francis Bacon, who leads him to invoke: Pity the meat! This form of life, this lifestyle has to be defended, not only as a matter of diversity, but because this style is for us one of the most cherished value...|$|R

This article is concerned with estimates of masonry deterioration {{and the effects of}} covariates on the damage to bricks on the walls of ve multiple-story buildings of a residential complex located in the Bronx, New York. In this case study, the damage of primary interest was a “spall, ” a physical separation of a portion of the brick face from the <b>body</b> of the <b>brick.</b> Eventually, the face becomes so damaged that portions fall off. The result is an unattractive appearance and a hazard to passersby. In this study, spall damage was assessed by means of three different and independent condition assessment surveys: an expensive, precise, and hence very limited scaffold drop survey and two additional inexpensive, but more detailed photographic and visual surveys. The photographic survey was obtained by photographing the walls of the entire residential complex, and the visual survey was done by individuals walking around the periphery of each building and making a visual assessment of the damage to each wall. In the photographic survey, a large amount of incomplete data was unavoidable because of either poor photo angles or various physical obstructions. A binomial regression model using four categorical explanatory variables or factors was tted to the observed photographic spall data. Sparseness of the data, the presence of outliers, and overdispersion were major problems encountered in selecting and tting a suitable model. A small pilot survey, in which the relevant portions of the photographic and visual surveys were matched to 11 drop locations of the scaffold survey, recorded spall counts using each survey method.

30|$|Cement {{is widely}} used as a {{construction}} material to strengthen soil (Stabnikov et al. 2013). However, the production of cement has environment impacts during all stages of manufacturing. Additionally, global cement production accounts for about 5  % of the total industrial energy consumption and 5  % of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions (Worrel et al. 2001). Chemical grout, {{which can be used}} in place of cement to strengthen soil, employs sodium silicate, calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, acrylates, and acrylamides to bind soil particles (Karol 2003; Ivanov and Chu 2008). However, this method is expensive and toxic to humans and the environment (Karol 2003; DeJong et al. 2006; Ivanov and Chu 2008). Therefore, economical alternatives to chemical grouting are necessary. Biocement is an alternative to cement and chemical grouts (De Muynck et al. 2010; Stabnikov et al. 2011) that can produce binder materials via MICP treatment to seal fractures and improve the strength and durability of cementious materials (Phillips et al. 2013; Dhami et al. 2014). Biocementation of MICP has been applied to strengthen soil and treat the cracks in concrete (Ramachandran et al. 2001; De Muynck et al. 2008). Soil cementation materials include carbonates, hydroxides, phosphates, silicates and sulfides (Ivanov and Chu 2008). Calcium carbonate is primarily used in biocementation because it is commonly found in nature. Biocement can improve soil shear strength through the production of soil particle-binding materials in response to the introduction of bacteria and cementation reagents into the soil (Ng et al. 2012). Different bacterial strains have been shown to produce various levels of urease activity ranging from 2.2 to 20  mM of hydrolyzed urea/min (Harkes et al. 2010; Stabnikov et al. 2013). Urease activity should not be too high or too low for successful biocementation because urease activity in the range of 4.4 to 9.5  mM hydrolyzed urea/min. increased the strength of biocemented soil. Qian et al. (2009) reported that stronger aggregates of calcium carbonate formed at a low rate of urea hydrolysis. Following MICP treatment (by BHI cured bricks), the absorption of water by bricks cured in the media was lower (− 14  %) than that of the control (25  %) because pores were blocked by calcite deposition, which prevented water and other pollutants from penetrating into the <b>body</b> of the <b>bricks</b> (Sarada et al. 2009). Ramachandran (2007) found that incorporation of high concentrations of bacterial cells into the cement mixture reduced compressive strength owing to inference of the biomass with the integrity of the mortar. However, other researchers reported that the compressive strength improved after MICP treatment relative to a control (De Muynck et al. 2008; Chahal et al. 2012).|$|R
