To fill this gap, we outline an incentive-based preventive supervision strategy that eliminates <b>bad</b> <b>asset</b> management in banks. Two supervision techniques are combined: temporary regulatory administration and random audits. Our design ensures good management without excessive supervision costs, through a gradual adjustment of supervision efforts to the bank's financial health. We also allow random audits to be delegated to an independent audit agency and show how to induce agency compliance with regulatory instructions in the least costly way...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{information}} spillovers and transparency in a dynamic setting with adverse selection and correlated asset values. A trade (or lack thereof) by one seller can provide information {{about the quality of}} other assets in the market. In equilibrium, the information content of this trading behavior is endogenously determined. We show that this endogeneity of information leads to multiple equilibria when the correlation between asset values is sufficiently high. That is, if buyers expect “bad ” assets to trade quickly, then a seller with a <b>bad</b> <b>asset</b> has reason to be concerned about negative information being revealed, which induces her to trade quickly. Conversely, if buyers do not expect bad assets to trade quickly, then the seller has less to be concerned about and is more willing to wait. We study the implications for policies that target market transparency. We show that total welfare is higher when markets are fully transparent than when the market is fully opaque. However, both welfare and trading activity can decrease in the degree of market transparency...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the Chinese {{financial}} system with non performing loans is significant and murky. If China 2 ̆ 7 s non performing loan problem exists on {{a certain level of}} severity and is not trending toward a more manageable state, then China could be moving toward financial crisis. Empirical and theoretical studies in recent years have implied that this might be the case. It might be impossible to conclusively prove or disprove notions that non-performing loans will cause financial crisis in China. However, little academic inquiry has very recently been focused toward the holistic 2 ̆ 2 puzzle 2 ̆ 2 of China 2 ̆ 7 s NPL issue, and it could be considered worthwhile to simply attempt to trace a broad outline of the issue.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, Japan has slowly entered into the process of bad debt restructuring. This process {{is taking place in}} two phases: an initial phase of bad debt restructuring, namely the {{consolidation}} of ownership of bad assets, which is now surfacing as <b>bad</b> <b>asset</b> receptors are being established; and a second phase, regarding the dispersion of ownership of bad assets, which has not yet emerged but will occur gradually over the next five years. The author explores a range of investment opportunities that are emerging as this restructuring process takes place. Particularly, two developments from last summer - the establishment of the Housing Loan Administration Corporation and the Resolution and Collection Bank - indicate that borrowers from Jusen companies and failed credit co-ops are no longer supported by the Japanese banking system. These borrowers, largely real estate developers many of whom are already technically insolvent, have been left with no other alternative but significant reorganization including the total liquidation of assets. Opportunities are arising from these bankruptcy/liquidation sales. Another area of opportunity lies in the increasing consolidation among banks, particularly among smaller shinking and second-tier regional banks which have been left without any specific official rescue packages due to the current political climate. As they consolidate there will be a further growth of opportunities for investors...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple model of {{financial}} crises, {{which may be}} useful for the unified analysis of macro and financial policies implemented during the 2008 – 2009 financial crisis. A financial crisis is modeled as a disappearance of inside money due to the lemon problem à la Akerlof (1970), in a simplistic variant of Lucas and Stokey’s (1987) Cash-in-Advance economy, where both cash and capital stocks work as media of exchange. The exogenous emergence of huge amount of <b>bad</b> <b>assets</b> represents the occurrence of a financial crisis. Information asymmetry regarding the good assets (capital stocks) and the <b>bad</b> <b>assets</b> causes the good assets to cease functioning as inside money. The private agents have no proper incentive {{to dispose of the}} <b>bad</b> <b>assets</b> and the crisis could be persistent, because the lemon problem is an external diseconomy. Macroeconomic policy (e. g., fiscal stimulus) provides outside money for substitution, and financial stabilization (e. g., bad-asset purchases) restores the inside money by resolving information asymmetry. The welfare-improving effect of the macro policy may be nonexistent or temporary, while the bad-asset purchases may have a permanent effect to shift the economy out of the crisis equilibrium.

40|$|Mr. Yashiro drew on his {{experience}} as a senior executive in the oil and banking industries in the United States, Japan, and China, to compare economic prospects and corporate cultures in Japan and China. Mr. Yashiro began by outlining some of the key reasons behind Japan's post-bubble economic malaise. With American industry in decline in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, excessive hubris among Japanese corporate leadership combined with a strengthened yen following the Plaza accords to help create a domestic economic bubble. The result has been stagnant growth and loss of competitive edge for Japan since the bubble burst in the early 1990 s. Mr. Yashiro went on to explain lessons that Japan should learn from the bubble experience. Lack of international perspective, English skills, scarcity of foreigners among senior corporate leadership, the seniority-based promotion system, and risk-averse behavior continue to hinder Japanese corporations' global competitiveness and the expansion of Japan's economy. Moreover, lack of clear national goals, exemplified by former Prime Minister Abe's stated goal of a "beautiful Japan," is the most significant roadblock to renewed economic and political strength. Reflecting upon his recent experience working to reform Chinese state-owned banks, Mr. Yashiro outlined several key challenges on the path of continued growth. Chinese financial institutions, which recently had <b>bad</b> <b>asset</b> problems similar to those experienced by Japan, have largely taken care of them by transferring them to asset management companies. Moving forward, China must maintain its high rates of economic growth to avoid further nonperforming loan problems. Chinese banks must continue to develop a strong credit culture and risk management skills, prevent irregularities, and improve profitability through services other than loans and deposits. In contrast to the Japanese corporations, Mr. Yashiro described the eagerness of Chinese banks to tap into the skill and experience of foreigners. Already benefiting from infusions of Western capital, by absorbing foreign expertise Chinese financial institutions will soon be among the leading banks in the world, according to Mr. Yashiro. In Tokyo, on the other hand, it is rare to see foreigners among senior banking executives, and without fresh ideas and perspectives, Japan will struggle to compete globally...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{constructs}} a {{model of}} financial crises that can explain characteristic features of the global financial crisis of 2008 - 2009, namely, the widespread freezing of asset transactions, the sharp contraction of aggregate output, and a deterioration in the labor wedge. This paper assumes that banks sell corporate bonds in the interbank market {{to raise money for}} short-term loans. The emergence of <b>bad</b> <b>assets</b> subsequent to the collapse of the asset-price bubble and asymmetric information among banks causes a freezing in the asset trading among banks (the market for lemons). Market freezing constrains the availability of bank loans as working capital for productive firms, causing output and the labor wedge to deteriorate. Given the market freeze, no proper incentives exist for banks to reveal their <b>bad</b> <b>assets</b> and dispose of them. ...|$|R
