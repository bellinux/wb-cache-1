An important concept introduced is that even when <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> are excited, there are two regime of BPD with radically different observational properties. They are described here as BPD with either classical or anomalous energy depositions. For high pressures or low altitudes, the classical is expected to dominate.

40|$|Fermi {{has been}} {{instrumental}} in constraining the luminosity function and redshift evolution of gamma-ray bright blazars. This includes limits upon the spectrum and anisotropy of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB), redshift distribution of nearby Fermi active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the construction of a log(N) -log(S) relation. Based upon these, {{it has been argued that}} the evolution of the gamma-ray bright blazar population must be much less dramatic than that of other AGN. However, critical to such claims is the assumption that inverse Compton cascades reprocess emission above a TeV into the Fermi energy range, substantially enhancing the strength of the observed limits. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of such a process, due, e. g., to the presence of virulent <b>plasma</b> <b>beam</b> <b>instabilities</b> that preempt the cascade, a population of TeV-bright blazars that evolve similarly to quasars is consistent with the population of hard gamma-ray blazars observed by Fermi. Specifically, we show that a simple model for the properties and luminosity function is simultaneously able to reproduce their log(N) -log(S) relation, local redshift distribution, and contribution to the EGRB and its anisotropy without any free parameters. Insofar the naturalness of a picture in which the hard gamma-ray blazar population exhibits the strong redshift evolution observed in other tracers of the cosmological history of accretion onto halos is desirable, this lends support for the absence of the inverse Compton cascades and the existence of the <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Relativistic {{electron}} <b>beam</b> propagation in <b>plasma</b> {{is fraught}} with several micro instabilities like two stream, filamentation etc., in plasma.

40|$|Recent work on Fermi {{acceleration}} at ultra-relativistic {{shock waves}} has demonstrated {{the need for}} strong amplification of the background magnetic field on very short scales. Amplification of the magnetic field by several orders of magnitude has also been suggested by observations of gamma-ray bursts afterglows, both in downstream and upstream plasmas. This paper addresses this issue of magnetic field generation in a relativistic shock precursor through micro-instabilities. In a generic superluminal configuration, the level of magnetization of the upstream plasma {{turns out to be}} a crucial parameter, notably because the length scale of the shock precursor is limited by the Larmor rotation of the accelerated particles in the background magnetic field and by the speed of the shock wave. We discuss in detail and calculate the growth rates of the following <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> seeded by the accelerated and reflected particle populations: for an unmagnetized shock, the Weibel and filamentation instabilities, as well as the Čerenkov resonant instabilities with electrostatic modes; for a magnetized shock, the Weibel instability and the resonant Čerenkov instabilities with the longitudinal electrostatic modes, as well as the Alfvén, Whisler and extraordinary modes.

40|$|Many astrophysical plasmas {{are prone}} to beam-plasma instabilities. For {{relativistic}} and dilute beams, the spectral support of the beam-plasma instabilities is narrow, i. e., the linearly unstable modes that grow with rates comparable to the maximum growth rate occupy a narrow range of wave numbers. This places stringent requirements on the box-sizes when simulating {{the evolution of the}} instabilities. We identify the implied lower limits on the box size imposed by the longitudinal <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instability,</b> i. e., typically the most stringent condition required to correctly capture the linear evolution of the instabilities in multidimensional simulations. We find that sizes many orders of magnitude larger than the resonant wavelength are typically required. Using one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we show that the failure to sufficiently resolve the spectral support of the longitudinal instability yields slower growth and lower levels of saturation, potentially leading to erroneous physical conclusion.

40|$|The Fast Ignition Scenario (FIS) for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) has {{prompted}} in re-cent years many theoretical [7], numerical and experimental works on relativistic <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> [4]. Due to the density gradient of the pre-compressed target (the center is about 104 denser than the border), the beam-plasma interaction is collisionless near the REB emitting region, and collisional near the center. For the collisionless part, {{it has been}} established {{on the one hand}} that modes propagating per-pendicularly (or obliquely) to the beam are the fastest growing ones for typical FIS parameters [2]. The beam is therefore broke-up into finite length filaments, which transverse typical size is the background plasma skin-depth λp = c/ωp. On the other hand, the unstable transport in the dense collisional region reveals a qualitatively different picture: the beam is still filamented, but the typical size of the filaments is now the beam skin-depth λb = c/ωb [3]. Within the FIS context, this means filaments about 100 times larger than in the collisionless region. The ques-tion comes immediately as to know how exactly is operated the transition from one regime to another. Such a bridge is important from the conceptual point of view, and necessary to describe the beam propagation in the intermediate region...|$|R
40|$|The {{annihilation}} of TeV photons from extragalactic TeV sources and the extragalactic background light produces ultrarelativistic e^± beams, which {{are subject to}} powerful <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> that sap their kinetic energy. Here we study the linear phase of the <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> that these pair beams drive. To this end, we calculate the linear growth rate of the <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> and oblique <b>instability</b> in the electrostatic approximation in both the reactive and kinetic regimes, assuming a Maxwell-Jüttner distribution for the pair beam. We reproduce the well-known reactive and kinetic growth rates for both the <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> and oblique mode. We demonstrate for the oblique instability {{that there is a}} broad spectrum of unstable modes that grow at the maximum rate {{for a wide range of}} beam temperatures and wave vector orientations relative to the beam. We also delineate the conditions for applicability for the reactive and kinetic regimes and find that the <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> mode transitions to the reactive regime at a lower Lorentz factor than the oblique mode due to a combination of their different scalings and the anisotropy of the velocity dispersions. Applying these results to the ultrarelativistic e^± beams from TeV blazars, we confirm that these beams are unstable to both, the kinetic oblique mode and the reactive beam-plasma mode. These results are important in understanding how powerful <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> may sap the energy of the ultrarelativistic e^± beams as they propagate through intergalactic space.

40|$|A {{recent study}} of {{magnetic}} reconnection in the earth’s magnetotail identified five events in which a pulse of heated electrons appeared {{near the end of}} an interval of fast tailward plasma flow. Further investigation of these events has revealed the following information on their microstructure: (1) Measurements of the electron velocity distribution show that the temperature rise can be characterized as a true heating process, in that the gross evolution of the distribution is from a narrower to a broader Maxwellian. (2) During the heating pulse a bump is often apparent in the tail of the electron distribution function at an energy of 2 – 5 keV. This bump could be the remnant of a beam produced by a 2 - to 5 -kV parallel potential drop. Thus a possible mechanism for the heating of electrons is the <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instability.</b> (3) The magnetic field during these events is highly variable in all three components. Part of this variability may result from magnetic turbulence generated by the tearing mode instability, but minimum variance analysis suggests that some of the more rapid variations (up to 20 nT/s) are caused by rotational or tangential discontinuities. (4) Both the Y and Z components of the magnetic field are quite large (10 – 20 nT) at times. The strongest southward fields are usually observed near the beginning of the heating pulse, while the strongest Y components generally occur during the pre-heating interval of tailward plasma flow. Transient large-scale changes in the normal magnetotail current system are indicated by these observations...|$|E
40|$|Many {{competing}} linear instabilities {{are likely}} to occur in astrophysical settings, and it is important to assess which one grows faster for a given situation. An analytical model including the main <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> is developed. The full 3 D dielectric tensor is thus explained for a cold relativistic electron beam passing through a cold plasma, accounting for a guiding magnetic field, a return electronic current and moving protons. Considering any orientations of the wave vector allows to retrieve the most unstable mode for any parameters set. An unified description of the Filamentation (Weibel), Two-Stream, Buneman, Bell instabilities (and more) is thus provided, allowing for the exact determination of their hierarchy in terms of the system parameters. For relevance to both real situations and PIC simulations, the electron-to-proton mass ratio is treated as a parameter, and numerical calculations are conducted with two different values, namely 1 / 1836 and 1 / 100. In the system parameters phase space, the shape of the domains governed by each kind of instability is far from being trivial. For low density beams, the ultra-magnetized regime tends to be governed by either the Two-Stream or the Buneman instabilities. For beam densities equalling the plasma one, up to four kinds of modes {{are likely to}} play a role, depending of the beam Lorentz factor. In some regions of the system parameters phase space, the dominant mode may vary with the electron-to-proton mass ratio. Application is made to Solar Flares, Intergalactic Streams and Relativistic shocks physics. Comment: To Appear in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Abridged) This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} magnetic field generation in a relativistic shock precursor through micro-instabilities. The level of magnetization of the upstream plasma {{turns out to be}} a crucial parameter, notably because the length scale of the shock precursor is limited by the Larmor rotation of the accelerated particles in the background magnetic field and by the speed of the shock wave. We discuss in detail and calculate the growth rates of the following <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> seeded by the accelerated and reflected particle populations: for an unmagnetized shock, the Weibel and filamentation instabilities, as well as the Cerenkov resonant longitudinal and oblique modes; for a magnetized shock, the Weibel instability and the resonant Cerenkov instabilities with the longitudinal electrostatic modes, as well as the Alfven, Whisler and extraordinary modes. All these instabilities are generated upstream, then they are transmitted downstream. The modes excited by Cerenkov resonant instabilities take on particular importance with respect to the magnetisation of the downstream medium since, being plasma eigenmodes, they have a longer lifetime than the Weibel modes. We discuss the main limitation of the wave growth associated with the length of the precursor and the magnetisation of the upstream medium for both oblique and parallel shock waves. We also characterize the proper conditions to obtain Fermi acceleration. We recover some results of most recent particle-in-cell simulations and conclude with some applications to astrophysical cases of interest, pulsar winds and gamma-ray burst external shock waves in particular.

40|$|The {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} (REB) propagation in a plasma is fraught with <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The prominent amongst them being the collisionless Weibel destabilization which spatially separates the forward propagating REB and the return shielding currents. This results {{in the formation of}} REB current filaments which are typically of the size of electron skin depth during the linear stage of the instability. It has been observed that in the nonlinear stage the filaments size increases as they merge with each other. With the help of 2 D PIC simulations in the plane perpendicular to the REB propagation, it is shown that these mergers occur in two distinct nonlinear phases. In the first phase, the total magnetic energy increases. Subsequently, however, during the second phase, one observes a reduction in magnetic energy. It is shown that the transition from one nonlinear regime to another occurs when the typical current associated with individual filaments hits the Alfven threshold. In the second nonlinear regime, therefore, the filaments can no longer permit any increase in current. Magnetic reconnection events then dissipate the excess current (and its associated magnetic energy) that would result from a merger process leading to the generation of energetic electrons jets in the perpendicular plane. At later times when there are only few filaments left the individual reconnection events can be clearly identified. It is observed that in between such events the magnetic energy remains constant and shows a sudden drop as and when two filaments merge. The electron jets released in these recon- nection events are thus responsible for the transverse heating which has been mentioned in some previous studies [Honda et al. Phys. Plasmas 7, 1302 (2000) ]...|$|R

40|$|Injections of nonrelativistic {{electron}} beams from {{a finite}} equipotential conductor into an ionospheric plasma have been simulated using a two-dimensional electrostatic particle code. The {{purpose of the}} study is to survey the simulation parameters for understanding the dependence of beam radius on physical variables. The conductor is charged to a high potential when the background plasma density is less than the beam density. Beam electrons attracted by the charged conductor are decelerated to zero velocity near the stagnation point, which is at a few Debye lengths from the conductor. The simulations suggest that the beam electrons at the stagnation point receive a large transverse kick and the beam expands radially thereafter. The buildup of beam electrons at the stagnation point produces a large electrostatic force responsible for the transverse kick. However, for the weak charging cases where the background plasma density is larger than the beam density, the radial expansion mechanism is different; the <b>beam</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>instability</b> is found to be responsible for the radial expansion. The simulations show that the electron beam radius for high spacecraft charging cases is of the order of the beam gyroradius, defined as the beam velocity divided by the gyrofrequency. In the weak charging cases, the beam radius is {{only a fraction of the}} beam gyroradius. The parameter survey indicates that the beam radius increases with beam density and decreases with magnetic field and beam velocity. The beam radius normalized by the beam gyroradius is found to scale according to the ratio of the beam electron Debye length to the ambient electron Debye length. The parameter dependence deduced would be useful for interpreting the beam radius and beam density of electron beam injection experiments conducted from rockets and the space shuttle...|$|E

It is important to understand what non-linear physics eventually stops the exponential growth of unstable modes. It is already known that the initial growth of <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in QCD closely parallels that in QED. However, once the unstable modes of the gauge-fields grow large enough for non-Abelian interactions between them to become important, one might guess that the dynamics of QCD <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> and QED <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> become very different. In this paper, we give suggestive arguments that non-Abelian self-interactions between the unstable modes are ineffective at stopping instability growth, and that the growing non-Abelian gauge fields become approximately Abelian after a certain stage in their growth. This in turn suggests that understanding the development of QCD <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the non-linear regime may have close parallels to similar processes in traditional plasma physics. We conjecture that the physics of collisionless <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities</b> in SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theory becomes equivalent, respectively, to (i) traditional plasma physics, which is U(1) gauge theory, and (ii) plasma physics of U(1) x U(1) gauge theory.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} to simulate plasma disruptions have contributed significantly in many aspects {{to the understanding}} of the physical processes occurring during high-energy deposition on target material surfaces due to <b>plasma</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Laser light, electron <b>beams,</b> and <b>plasma</b> guns have been used worldwide to study disruption effects and erosion damage of candidate divertor materials. The differences among these simulation experiments are examined. The net power flux reaching the originally exposed surface depends on many parameters, such as type of energy deposited, target material, pulse duration, and geometrical factors. Experimental results have been evaluated and compared with theoretical predictions, and the overall relevance of simulation {{experiments to}} reactor conditions has been critically examined...|$|R
