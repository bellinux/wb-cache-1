60|$|The {{ship had}} {{in that place}} to shave the bank so close that the {{gigantic}} wall of leaves came gliding like a shutter against the port; {{the darkness of the}} primeval forest seemed to flow into that bare cabin with the odor of rotting leaves, of sodden soil--the strong muddy smell of the living earth steaming uncovered after the passing of a deluge. The bushes swished loudly alongside; above there was a series of crackling sounds, with a sharp rain of small broken branches falling on the bridge; a creeper with a great rustle snapped on the head of a <b>boat</b> <b>davit,</b> and a long, luxuriant green twig actually whipped {{in and out of the}} open port, leaving behind a few torn leaves that remained suddenly at rest on Mr. Massy's blanket. Then, the ship sheering out in the stream, the light began to return but did not augment beyond a subdued clearness: for the sun was very low already, and the river, wending its sinuous course through a multitude of secular trees as if at the bottom of a precipitous gorge, had been already invaded by a deepening gloom--the swift precursor of the night.|$|E

Sailing thence with [...] "slow convoy" [...] SC-156, LST-57 began her voyage to the Old World, although for a time her crew wondered if they would ever {{get away from the}} New. Three events occurred before she even left Halifax harbor that presaged an [...] "eventful" [...] crossing. The wait for a frozen <b>boat</b> <b>davit</b> to thaw delayed recovery of one of the ship's landing craft, a tug ripped a hole in her port bow several feet above the waterline, and a steering casualty stopped her a few hundred feet from the antisubmarine nets causing the ship to-block the convoy sortie until it could be corrected. Once at sea, LST-57 and the convoy encountered dense fog that rendered visibility difficult for more than 48 hours, and another LST nearly collided with the ship. The fact that the other ship was known to be carrying ammunition [...] "didn't quiet anyone's nerves," [...] as LST-57s' chronicler, recounts. No sooner had the fog cleared but an ice field was encountered. Two emergency changes of course to avoid the ice caused the convoy [...] "...to lose all semblance of order...for several hours." ...|$|E

50|$|The Texas A&M Maritime Academy (TMA) {{is one of}} {{only seven}} United States {{maritime}} academies that trains U.S. Merchant Marine officers, and the only one located in the Gulf of Mexico. The program provides an opportunity for cadets to learn how to maintain and operate unlimited tonnage ocean-going vessels. Students sail aboard the TMA training ship and commercial ships during three summer cruises to gain practical experience in navigation, seamanship, and engineering operations. In addition the cadets receive classroom instruction and hands on training during the regular school semester. Training facilities include the training ship, simulators, diesel and steam labs, various small <b>boats,</b> <b>davits,</b> and other hands on resources. At the culmination of their study, License Option or Strategic Sealift Officer program cadets are tested to become licensed as unlimited tonnage third mates or third engineers (officers) in the U.S. Merchant Marine. This is per Title 46 Code of the Code of Federal Regulation Part 11. The academy also commissions reserve and active duty Naval Officers.|$|R
50|$|On 16 July 1983, Conifer {{arrived at}} the Coast Guard Yard. She was {{temporarily}} decommissioned, and commenced a $7.5 million overhaul under the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). Many noteworthy improvements were accomplished during the SLEP. The deckhouse was removed, and the hull was essentially gutted down to the keel. Conifer received new main engines and ship's service generators, a new electrical system, and a new interior climate control system. The interior spaces were reconfigured. The forward tanks were reduced in size, and the forward cargo hold was eliminated to make a space for additional berthing areas, a crew's lounge, and boatswain, electrical, damage control, and electronics shops. A bow thruster was installed. The electrical weight-handling gear was replaced with a hydraulic system. Hydraulic <b>boat</b> <b>davits</b> were installed, and the motor surf boat {{was replaced by a}} rigid hull inflatable (RHI). A new deckhouse was constructed with a larger pilothouse and a radio room. Six pieces of original equipment were re-installed: the anchor windlass; the mast; the ship's bell; the helm wheel; the main motor; and the steering gear.|$|R

Caesar was refitted at Devonport to repair the damage. Caesar became Flagship, Rear Admiral, Home Fleet, in December 1905. She was relieved of this duty in February 1907 and transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet to become its temporary flagship. She served in this role until May 1907. On 27 May 1907, Caesar was recommissioned for service in the Devonport Division of the new Home Fleet, which had been formed in January 1907. During this service she underwent a refit at Devonport in 1907–08. In May 1909, Caesar transferred to the Nore, temporarily serving as the flagship of Vice Admiral, 3rd and 4th Divisions, Home Fleet. In April 1911 she transferred to Devonport {{to serve in the}} 3rd Division, Home Fleet. On 16 January 1911, Caesar was rammed by the barque Excelsior in fog [...] at Sheerness, suffering no serious damage. In March 1912, Caesar was placed in commissioned reserve with a nucleus crew as part of the 4th Division, Home Fleet.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seems almost}} too simple to be true, but I {{assure you that}} the {{statement}} is as true as anything can be. We shall see whether the lesson will be taken to heart. We shall see. There is a Commission of learned men sitting to consider the subject of saving life at sea. They are discussing bulkheads, <b>boats,</b> <b>davits,</b> manning, navigation, but I am willing to bet that {{not one of them}} has thought of the humble [...] "pudding." [...] They can make what rules they like. We shall see if, with that disaster calling aloud to them, they will make the rule that every steamship should carry a permanent fender across her stern, from two to four feet in diameter in its thickest part in proportion {{to the size of the}} ship. But perhaps they may think the thing too rough and unsightly for this scientific and aesthetic age. It certainly won't look very pretty but I make bold to say it will save more lives at sea than any amount of the Marconi installations which are being forced on the shipowners on that very ground--the safety of lives at sea.|$|R
2500|$|Lusitania did {{not carry}} enough {{lifeboats}} {{for all her}} passengers, officers and crew on board {{at the time of}} her maiden voyage (actually carrying four lifeboats fewer than Titanic would carry in 1912). This was a common practice for large passenger ships at the time, since the belief was that in busy shipping lanes help would always be nearby and the few boats available would be adequate to ferry all aboard to rescue ships before a sinking. Interestingly after the Titanic sank, Lusitania and Mauretania would only be equipped with an additional six more clinker-built wooden <b>boats</b> under <b>davits,</b> making for a total of 22 <b>boats</b> rigged in <b>davits.</b> The rest of their lifeboat accommodations were supplemented with 26 collapsible lifeboats, 18 stored directly beneath the regular lifeboats and eight on the after deck.

50|$|The {{light is}} at the end of a reef that extends about 1500 ft south from Deer Island. The {{location}} first had a stone beacon in 1832. The first light, a sparkplug type light, was lit in 1890. It cost about $50,000. It included a three story dwelling, a veranda with <b>boat</b> <b>davits,</b> and a circular parapet. The water supply was a cistern in the base of the structure. A spiral staircase ran from the cellar to the top floor. It had a fixed white light, which was changed to flashing red every thirty seconds and then to the present alternating red and white flashes. The old light gradually deteriorated and was replaced in 1982 by a white fiberglass tower. The white tower raised complaints because it blended in with the background and was hard to see, so the Coast Guard moved it to Great Point Light, Nantucket, as a temporary replacement when that tower was destroyed by a storm in March 1984. A brown fiberglass tower was installed immediately thereafter. While the Spark plug light was interesting, it was much more expensive to maintain than the fiberglass structure. Imported from England, the pole light was the first of its kind in the United States.|$|R
500|$|After Valiant was {{commissioned}} {{she became the}} First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland, where she remained until 1885, an experience unique among the British ironclads, although she did have one break to have new boilers installed. From June to August 1878 the ship formed part of the Particular Service Squadron {{at the time of}} the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War, and sailed up the Dardanelles under the command of Admiral Hornby. On 20 July 1884 Valiant was accidentally rammed by the ironclad [...] in Lough Swilly, damaging her hull and tearing off her <b>boats,</b> <b>davits</b> and fittings on one side of the ship. Valiant was paid off in 1885, and saw no further front-line service; lying for thirteen years in a partially dismantled state at Devonport. In 1897 she was assigned to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so that she was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze, where she remained until 1956. Valiant was sold in that year to Belgian ship breakers and towed to Bruges on 8 December 1956.|$|R

The four other ships {{were completed}} as survey vessels, specifically {{to deal with the}} vast numbers of uncharted wrecks and mines around the British Isles from wartime. They were unarmed, except for four 3-pounder saluting guns. They had shorter forward shelter decks and carried survey <b>boats</b> under <b>davits</b> abreast the funnel and minesweeping gear aft.|$|R
