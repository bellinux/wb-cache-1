5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} the season and overshadowed the sport. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the Naval Reserve in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President Ed Barrow as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.|$|E
5|$|Lee Smith {{was born}} in Jamestown, Louisiana, {{and raised in the}} small town of Castor in Bienville Parish. Buck O'Neil claimed credit for having scouted him. At age 17, partly on O'Neil's recommendation, Smith was drafted in the second round as the 28th overall pick by the Chicago Cubs in the 1975 draft. Smith began his {{professional}} career as a starting pitcher. In 1978 with the Class AA minor league Midland Cubs, Smith struggled as a starter with an ERA near 6.00, prompting manager Randy Hundley to move him to the bullpen. Smith resisted the move and briefly tried college basketball at Northwestern State University. At the behest of former Cubs outfielder Billy Williams, Smith returned to Midland as a reliever for the 1979 season and pitched well enough to earn a promotion to Class AAA baseball for 1980. With the major league Chicago Cubs struggling to a last-place finish, Smith came into the <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> as a September call-up that season.|$|E

An old face claimed the crown in 1998: Real Madrid. The Spanish club won their first European Cup since 1966 and seventh overall when they beat Juventus 1–0 in the Italian club's third straight final (and second straight defeat).|$|E
25|$|Abueva was {{not able}} to suit up in Alaska's first three {{assignments}} as he still needed to finish his duties with his school in the NCAA. In his highly anticipated debut game, Abueva made an immediate impact as he came through with a beastly performance against the Petron Blaze Boosters. Still smarting from his alma mater's NCAA final four loss to Letran 4 days before, he showed that he definitely is ready for the <b>big</b> <b>leagues,</b> finishing with 12 points and 16 rebounds in just 27 minutes.|$|E

Although he allowed one run, three hits and two walks in the 2 innings he pitched in his <b>big</b> <b>league</b> debut earning the loss, his first <b>big</b> <b>league</b> at-bat was notable because he hit a double off an opposing pitcher Jim Bunning, driving in the Cubs only run of the game.

25|$|He pitched {{for several}} other minor league teams, his hopes {{of making it}} to the <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> still alive, but the Army derailed this. After serving two years in the military, he tried to return to baseball. Though {{hindered}} by an injury to his throwing arm, Pride played three games for the Missoula Timberjacks of the Pioneer League (a farm club of the Cincinnati Reds) in 1960, and had tryouts with the California Angels (1961) and the New York Mets (1962) organizations, but was not picked up by either team.|$|E
25|$|Except {{for five}} races in 1973, driving for Bud Moore Engineering, Waltrip {{primarily}} drove his own cars {{at the beginning}} of his NASCAR career until the middle of the 1975 Winston Cup season when he was signed to a multi-year contract and replaced driver Donnie Allison to drive the #88 DiGard Chevrolet, Waltrip's long-awaited jump into the <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> of United States stock car auto racing. The DiGard racing team was founded in part by Mike DiProspero and Bill Gardner, who were brothers-in-law, with the legendary Robert Yates as engine builder.|$|E
25|$|He {{became friends}} with WSM radio host Ralph Emery in his early years, forming a bond which would be {{influential}} throughout his career, as Waltrip would appear frequently on Emery's early morning television show on local Nashville television station, WSMV, and later substitute for Emery in the 1980s on Emery's television show, Nashville Now on the former TNN cable network (later, Spike TV). Waltrip would use the success he enjoyed at the Music City Motorplex, and his notoriety and public speaking skills that he acquired from television appearances in Nashville, as a springboard into NASCAR's <b>big</b> <b>leagues.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{two biggest}} moves the Astros {{made in the}} offseason were the {{acquisitions}} of Joe Niekro and José Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe {{was just starting to}} use it {{when he came to the}} Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07. José Cruz was also a steal, in retrospect, from the Cardinals. Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.|$|E
25|$|Mack's {{last three}} {{seasons in the}} National League were as a player-manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1894 to 1896, with a 149–134 (.527) record.

He agreed to a salary of $3,000 and 25% of the club. He managed the Brewers for four seasons from 1897 to 1900, their best year coming in 1900, when they finished second. It was in Milwaukee that he first signed pitcher Rube Waddell, who would follow him to the <b>big</b> <b>leagues.</b>|$|E
500|$|By April 1925, he was {{starting}} to show promise as a hitter with the Reading Keystones of the International League.
