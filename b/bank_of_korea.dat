25|$|The first note put in {{circulation}} by the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> in 1950 was printed in Japan by the National Printing Bureau (国立印刷局). The {{next year the}} Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation was created and took over as printer of South Korean currency.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{division}} of Korea, the won was introduced to replace the Korean yen. The won was subdivided in 100jeon. The first banknotes were issued by the Bank of Joseon in denominations ranging from 5jeon to 100won. In 1950 the currency management switched to the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> and new notes were then issued, mostly with higher denominations.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, 10- and 50-jeon, 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, 100- and 500-won {{notes were}} {{introduced}} by the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea.</b> The first issue of 1-, 5-, 10-, 50-, 100- and 500-won notes was printed in the UK by Thomas De La Rue.

25|$|A new central bank, the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea,</b> was {{established}} on 12 June 1950, and assumed {{the duties of}} Bank of Joseon.

In 1953, a series of banknotes was issued which, although it gave the denominations in English in won, were, in fact, the first issues of the hwan.|$|E

25|$|The won was {{introduced}} in 1902, replacing the yang {{at a rate of}} 1won = 5yang. In 1909, the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> was founded in Seoul as a central bank and began issuing currency of modern type. The won was equivalent to the Japanese yen and was replaced by the Korean yen in 1910. At the same time, Korean yen notes issued by Dai Ichi Ginko (First National Bank (of Japan), 株式會社第一銀行) also circulated.|$|E
25|$|On June 23, 2009, the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> {{released}} the 50,000-won note.

This note is the first Korean banknote to feature the portrait of a woman. The release of the 50,000-won note stirred some controversy among shop owners and those with visual impairments due to its similarity in color and numerical denomination with the 5,000-won note.|$|E
25|$|Until 1966, 10- and 50-hwan coins, revalued as 1 and 5 won, {{were the}} only coins in circulation.

40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} (FX) derivatives {{markets in}} the Korean won are comparatively thin and vulnerable to impaired functioning. During the crisis, Korea faced dislocations in its FX swap and cross-currency swap markets, so severe that covered interest parity (CIP) between the Korean won and the US dollar was seriously violated. Using {{a variation of the}} EGARCH model, we find that global market uncertainty - as proxied by VIX, the volatility index - was the main factor explaining the movement of deviations from CIP in the three-month FX swap market during the crisis period. The credit risk <b>of</b> Korean <b>banks</b> - as proxied by their credit default swap spread - was also a significant factor explaining deviations from CIP in the three-year cross-currency swap market before the crisis, while the credit risk <b>of</b> US <b>banks</b> was significant during the crisis period. The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea's</b> provision <b>of</b> funds using its own foreign reserves was not effective in reducing deviations from CIP, but the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea's</b> loans <b>of</b> the US dollar proceeds of swaps with the US Federal Reserve were effective. This is because the loans funded by swaps with the US Federal Reserve effectively added to Korea's foreign reserves and enhanced market confidence.

25|$|In 1982, the 500-won {{note was}} {{replaced}} by a coin. The following year, as part of its policy of rationalizing the currency system, the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> issued a new set of notes, as well as a new set of coins. Some of the notes' most notable features were distinguishable marks for the blind under the watermark and the addition of machine-readable language in preparation for mechanization of cash handling. They were also printed on better-quality cotton pulp to reduce the production costs by extending their circulation life.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> {{announced}} in early 2006 {{its intention to}} redesign the 10-won coin {{by the end of}} that year. With the increasing manufacturing price, then at 38 won per 10-won coin, and rumors that some people had been melting the coins to make jewelry, the redesign was needed to make the coin more cost-effective to produce. The new coin is made of copper-coated aluminium with a reduced diameter of 18mm, and a weight of 1.22 g. Its visual design is the same as the old coin. The new coin was issued on December 18, 2006.|$|E

40|$|My remarks concern {{monetary}} policymakers' {{opportunities and}} challenges {{in the face of}} the growing volume of international capital movements.

40|$|Credit {{procyclicality}} {{has recently}} {{been the focus of}} considerable attention, but what fuels the often excessive credit growth is rarely questioned. We investigate the relationship between the composition of banks' liabilities and their credit procyclicality. After examining the macroeconomic context where banks rely increasingly on wholesale funding (WSF), we estimate the effect of WSF on the banks’ credit growth using panel data for the commercial <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Korea</b> between 2000 : 1 and 2011 : 2. We find that a higher sensitivity of banks' WSF to the business cycle leads to an excessive response of credit growth to the business cycle, even with a low share <b>of</b> WSF on <b>bank</b> liabilities. This finding suggests that the regulation of banks’ WSF mechanism may contribute to financial stability through a <b>bank</b> credit channel <b>of</b> monetary policy. On the other hand, we find that overseas WSF has a more marked effect on credit procyclicality, which may additionally exacerbate the financial fragility of export-led emerging economies. ...|$|R
