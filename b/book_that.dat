As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children’s <b>books</b> <b>that</b> came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was always Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on Biblical inerrancy illustrates her fundamentalism. She criticized <b>books</b> <b>that</b> included scenes of death, characters who were insane, and representations of sexuality, as well as <b>books</b> <b>that</b> might frighten children. She typically praised <b>books</b> <b>that</b> encouraged intellectual instruction, such as Anna Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79).|$|R

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his <b>book</b> <b>that</b> researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E

5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a <b>book</b> <b>that</b> would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E

Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking <b>book</b> <b>that</b> for the first time brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the <b>books</b> <b>that</b> the Library Project "Give me five" uses accoring to their own project objective.

Some of the books are selected by librarians and some preschool teachers themselves have chosen. I have a in a thematic analysis examined if the books' themes meet the requirements of the project goals and if there is any difference on the <b>books</b> <b>that</b> preschool teachers chosen and the ones that the librarians have selected. I have in a image analysis investigated whether they have used <b>books</b> <b>that</b> challenge children's imagery, and if the books portray children's outer world. The result of my investigation was <b>that</b> the <b>books</b> meet the project goals but there were differences in levels and theme between the <b>books</b> <b>that</b> preschool teachers used and those librarians used. Secondly; there are opportunities to further tie the project to the pre-school's policies on discrimination and promote reading...|$|R

In fact, both Dorothy Rodgers and Dorothy Hammerstein had read the novel in 1944 and had urged their husbands to consider it as a possible subject for a musical.
