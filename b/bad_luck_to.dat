5|$|In Japan, {{strong belief}} in astrology {{has led to}} {{dramatic}} changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of Fire Horse. Adherents believe that women born in hinoeuma years are unmarriageable and bring <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices.

Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E

It {{was considered to be}} a <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> torture and kill a monk, whether friend or foe. A fortune teller then made a prediction, saying that Pu Tong Seal's descendants would suffer great losses for fourteen generations as a curse. Due to constant civil war, many lost their lives from both sides, and the Shan-Bama were also being buried at the graveyard called Kawl-Than.|$|E

25|$|In some circles, it is {{considered}} <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> depict a dragon facing downwards, as {{it is seen as}} disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky. Also, depictions of dragons in tattoos are prevalent as they are symbols of strength and power, especially criminal organisations where dragons hold a meaning all on their own. As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon on his skin, lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.|$|E
25|$|Concert-like {{performances}} are a prominent {{feature of the}} Ghost Festival in Singapore and Malaysia. Those live concerts are popularly known as Getai 'Koh-tai' by Hokkien-speaking people. They are performed by groups of singers, dancers and entertainers on a temporary stage that is set up within a residential district. The festival is funded by the residents of each individual district. During one of these 'Getai', it {{is known to be}} <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> sit on the front row of red seats, as they are there only for the Ghosts themselves. If anyone were to sit on them, they would become sick or similarly ailed.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit {{believe that}} {{the souls of the}} namesakes are one, so they {{traditionally}} refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (atiq), but also by kinship title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In Judaism, someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among Ashkenazi Jews it is also considered <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> take the name of a living ancestor, as the Angel of Death may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among Sephardi Jews). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the Gentile world.|$|E

25|$|A strong fady {{among the}} Antambahoaka, termed the fady kamamba, prohibits {{the raising of}} twins, {{particularly}} {{in the area around}} Mananjary. Economic and social pressures have led families in neighboring communities to also follow this practice. It is believed that twins will bring <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> the family that raises them and to the broader community. Consequently, if a woman gives birth to twins she is expected to abandon them in the wilderness to die of exposure; historically the children were strangled immediately after birth by the village sorcerer. An increasing number of families are unwilling to adhere to this taboo and have been ostracised by the community, typically being forced to leave their home village to live at the outskirts of another. This practice is regularly denounced by national and international bodies as contradictory to the United Nations' 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Madagascar is a signatory, but the custom is deeply rooted. Twins are forbidden from participating in the Sambatra festivities, are not allowed to join the annual ritual of preparing the king's paddy fields for planting, and are excluded both from the family tomb and from being considered a familial ancestor after their death. Local and international human rights organizations are partnering with the Malagasy government {{to bring an end to}} this practice.|$|E
500|$|In the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall, pasties were {{associated}} with [...] "knockers", spirits said to create a knocking sound that was either supposed to indicate the location of rich veins of ore, or to warn of an impending tunnel collapse. To encourage the good will of the knockers, miners would leave {{a small part of}} the pasty within the mine for them to eat. Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners, though fishermen believed that it was <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> take a pasty aboard ship.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford {{simultaneously}} {{retired from}} baseball and cricket in 1934. In his newspaper column, {{he said that}} he liked both sports equally. He felt that baseball gave a player more opportunities to perform: [...] "In cricket you may have the <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> get out early; which often means a blank afternoon. It is not so with baseball; you are in the game all the time." [...] Joe Clark, the author of History of Australian Baseball, said [...] "Ponsford is {{considered by many to be}} the best baseballer of his time in Australia." [...] The official program for the 1952 Claxton Shield—held in Perth—made a similar claim.|$|E

[...] Writing for Wired, Chris Kohler criticized the poor {{response}} of the controller's joystick and the lack of an RCA output. He said the release timing hurt its success; [...] "though its graphics were of better quality than most consoles on the market, it had the <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> be released in the same month as Nintendo’s world-changing Famicom, which had killer apps like Donkey Kong and could run circles around Sega’s hardware." [...] Of its legacy, Kohler said, [...] "Few have heard of it, even fewer have played it, and the games weren’t that great anyway." ...|$|E

At the time, the Washington {{correspondent}} for Sporting Life predicted that Dunlap would bring <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> his new team. He wrote: [...] "Fred is a great player, but the hoo-doo that seems to shadow him will make itself felt wherever he may go. There {{are a number of}} people in this vicinity who have watched his course with more than ordinary interest, and they do not hesitate to declare him a Jonah." [...] Dunlap appeared in only one game for the Giants and announced in July that he would play no more in 1890 and that he would spend the remainder of the summer at Atlantic City, New Jersey, with plans to return in 1891 [...] "and play the game of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Norman Wilner of MSN {{considered}} Licence to Kill {{the second}} worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying he [...] "got a raw deal. The actor {{who could have}} been the definitive 007... had the <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> inherit the role just as the series was at its weakest, struggling to cope with its general creative decline {{and the end of the}} Cold War". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying [...] "one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared". On a more positive note, Chuck O'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that it was a rare entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real.|$|E

500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx. I've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel." [...] Bonnema sued the department {{for the right to}} work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time she dressed in coveralls, and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman, she stated, [...] "I had a good disguise".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a score of}} 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", Season 3's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", Season 4's [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", and Season 5's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the <b>bad</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E
