50|$|Lehr's {{studies were}} {{interrupted}} by the American Civil War. When discharged, <b>in</b> 1865, <b>Lehr</b> was tired of the migratory life of teachers at the time, and felt compelled {{to do more with}} his teaching. <b>In</b> 1866 <b>Lehr</b> moved to Ada, Ohio and became the schoolmaster there. He negotiated to use the facilities after classes to teach a “select school” for those wishing education beyond that offered during the day. As his reputation grew throughout the area, the number of select school students increased, and <b>in</b> 1870, <b>Lehr</b> felt sufficiently well established to approach the citizens of Ada for funds to purchase land for a campus and an academic building. In August 1871, the Northwestern Ohio Normal School, later Ohio Northern University, was launched. While all this was going on, Lehr managed to find time to commute back to home to complete the requirements for his PhD degree at Mount Union College, graduating 10 years behind the class with which he had entered.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based simulation sys-tem {{for a glass}} annealing process. The long ovens, known as <b>lehrs,</b> <b>in</b> which annealing takes place are not well understood by their operators. In fact, only a few experts can predict {{the effects of a}} change <b>in</b> the <b>lehr</b> controls. Attempts to sim-ulate the behavior of the lehr using conventional methods have not been successful due to the size and complexity of the lehr. Our knowledge-based approach is capable of both simulating the glass temperature curve <b>in</b> an annealing <b>lehr</b> and planning the necessary lehr control settings to achieve a desired curve. It consists of two cooperating expert systems, one rule-based and the other frame-based. The system also includes a high-bandwidth graphics display which allows op-erators to interactively test control-setting changes and ask for the control settings which meet desired specifications. A description of the domain, a history of the development, and details of the design are all presented, along with lessons learned from the experience...|$|R

50|$|North Dakota Highway 13 has {{its western}} {{terminus}} in Emmons County with ND 1804 and travels east about thirteen miles before entering Linton and beginning a concurrency with US 83.
