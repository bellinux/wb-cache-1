5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their <b>belly</b> <b>feathers.</b> Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E
500|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} (Pterocles senegallus) is {{a species of}} ground dwelling bird in the family Pteroclididae. It is found in arid regions of northern and eastern Africa and across the Middle East and parts of Asia as far east as northwest India. It is a gregarious, diurnal bird and small flocks forage for seed and other vegetable matter on the ground, flying once a day to a waterhole for water. In the breeding season pairs nest apart from one another, the eggs being laid in a depression on the stony ground. The chicks leave the nest soon after hatching and eat dry seed, the water they need being provided by the male which saturates its <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> with water at the waterhole. The {{spotted sandgrouse}} is listed as being of [...] "least concern" [...] by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in its Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
500|$|The {{young are}} precocial and already covered in down when they {{emerge from the}} eggs. Soon after they are hatched the female leads the chicks {{to one of the}} many wadis that wind across the plains and there she teaches them to peck at and ingest seeds. It is four or five weeks before they are fledged and able to fly. Meanwhile, the problem of {{supplying}} them with water is solved by the male which has specially adapted, absorbent down on his belly. While at the waterhole he immerses himself in the water to saturate the plumage which absorbs a quantity that is sufficient for the chicks to last them until the following day. When he leaves the waterhole with his water-laden feathers, the male emits a repeated high-pitched [...] "queet - queet - queet" [...] calls. When the female and chicks pick up the sounds of his approach, they reciprocate, and by this means the male can find his family even when they have moved away from the nest. On his arrival he assumes an upright posture and raises his wings, displaying the wet <b>belly</b> <b>feathers.</b> This is the sign for the chicks to approach and stand underneath him with their beaks upturned and suck the fluid from between the feathers.|$|E
5|$|More specifically, the {{nominate}} subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts {{and throat}} {{with the face}} a darker grey-black. The feathers of the throat are longer, giving rise to hackles there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards the <b>belly,</b> the <b>feathers</b> are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.|$|R
50|$|The buff-tailed coronet {{has only}} slight sexual dimorphism. The female is scaled with white {{feathers}} mostly throughout the chin and throat, and {{some on the}} <b>belly.</b> Prominent <b>feather</b> colorations are iridescent green with darker wing tips, and buffy hues under the wing and tail feathers. On the face, there is an obvious white post ocular spot on each side. Puffy white “boots” are present at the thighs, an orange tuft at the shoulder, and a short, dark bill. Average size for a buff-tailed coronet is 13.2-13.5 cm with a bill length of 1.8-2 cm.|$|R
5000|$|The woodcreepers are {{generally}} fairly uniform in appearance. They {{range in size}} from the wedge-billed woodcreeper (13 cm) to the strong-billed woodcreeper (35 cm). Males tend to be slightly larger than females on average, but considerable overlap in size occurs in most species. Pronounced sexual dimorphism in size and plumage is rare. Bill size and shape accounts for much of the variation between the species. Bills can be straight or highly decurved, and can account for as much as a quarter of the length of the bird (as happens in the long-billed woodcreeper). The plumage is usually subdued and often brown, or sometimes rufous or other dark colours. Many species have patterns such as checking, spotting, or barring on their plumage. The feathers of the tail are rigid and are used for supporting the body when climbing tree trunks; the tail can support most of the body weight and birds that lose their tail find climbing difficult. Woodcreepers climb by flexing their legs and hopping up the trunk. The feet of the woodcreepers are also modified for climbing. The front toes are strongly clawed and toe IV is as long as toe III to increase the ability of the bird to grasp around branches. The legs are short but strong. Woodcreepers are also characterized by a <b>belly</b> <b>feather</b> growth pattern not found in any other birds.|$|R
50|$|Like other lapwings, they soak their <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> {{to provide}} water to their chicks {{as well as}} to cool the eggs during hot weather.They bathe in pools of water when {{available}} and will often spend time on preening when leaving the nest or after copulation. They sometimes rest on the ground with the tarsi laid flat on the ground and at other times may rest on one leg.|$|E
50|$|It is 14 - 15.5 cm long, and is {{the only}} sparrow with an olive back. It has a {{prominent}} brown eye streak and a brown-striped crown, with a buff breast, some white <b>belly</b> <b>feathers,</b> and a conical beak. The sexes are similar, while the juvenile is more buff with some streaking on the belly. The olive sparrow looks similar to the green-tailed towhee but is smaller and lacks a rusty cap.|$|E
50|$|Black stilts are a {{medium-sized}} (220 g) wader with extremely long pinkish-red legs, red eyes, distinctively black plumage, {{and a long}} slender black bill. Juveniles have a white breast, neck and head, with a black patch around the eyes, and black <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> that distinguish them from pied stilts. Black adult plumage appears in their first or second year. Black plumage may be an adaptation to “absorb heat better in the cold, windswept habitat of glacial riverbeds and lakeshores".|$|E
5000|$|It has a {{total length}} of {{approximately}} 75 cm. The head, neck and lower chest are buffish, the crown and nape are cinnamon, the upperparts and (often incomplete) chest-band are grey, the <b>belly</b> and flight <b>feathers</b> are black, and the wing-coverts are whitish (though not contrasting strongly with the grey upperparts). The bill, throat-wattle and bare skin {{around the eyes}} are blackish and the legs are red.|$|R
50|$|The Bradfield's {{hornbill}} (Lophoceros bradfieldi) is an African hornbill. It is {{a medium-sized}} bird, 50 - 57 cm in length, characterized by black back and wings {{and a white}} <b>belly.</b> The tip <b>feathers</b> of the long tail are white. Females are smaller than males and can be recognized by turquoise facial skin. The eyes are yellow and the beak is red. The beak is long and presents no casque.|$|R
50|$|The red-billed pigeon is mid or large-sized pigeon, at 30 - 37 cm {{in length}} and a weight of 230 - 425 g. It is mainly wine-purple, {{becoming}} browner on the back, and with a grey tail, lower <b>belly</b> and flight <b>feathers.</b> The bill is white with a red base, and the legs and eyes are red. Juvenile birds are duller than adults and the plumage is brown-tinged.|$|R
50|$|Measuring 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the black-cheeked gnateater is a {{small round}} bird with a short tail. It {{exhibits}} sexual dimorphism, as the male has distinctive coloured plumage and the female is a more overall brown in color. The male has a black face and cheeks with a contrasting orange crown and white throat. The upperparts are brownish and the underparts pale grey, the <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> more white and the flanks tending to buff. The female is more brown above with a white eyebrow and buff patch on the wings. It resembles the rufous gnateater.|$|E
50|$|It {{normally}} nests from June to November in the Western Cape and August to January elsewhere, but may nest at {{any time}} of the year. One of the pair will dowse its <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> and use the moisture to soften nesting material for easy shaping of the nest, while the other will bring the material to the nest. The female builds the cup-shaped nest of coarse vegetation, lined with animal hair, rootlets and other fine material. It is completed in 6 to 14 days, except when a nest is refurbished for a second clutch.|$|E
50|$|Its two {{or three}} eggs are not incubated, but are buried in warm sand, {{temperature}} control being achieved by the adult sitting on the eggs with a water-soaked belly to cool them. If the adult leaves the nest, it smooths sand over the eggs, though if it is frightened the job may be hasty. The chicks are precocial, and can run {{as soon as they}} are hatched and feed themselves shortly afterwards. The adults cool the chicks {{in the same way as}} with the eggs. The chicks may drink water from the adult's <b>belly</b> <b>feathers.</b> The adults bury the chicks in the sand temporarily if danger threatens.|$|E
50|$|They {{typically}} weigh between 28 and 34 g and {{are around}} 23 - 28 cm in length. Males are glossy black with a chestnut <b>belly</b> and white <b>feathers</b> on the rump and outer tail. Females are more greyish-brown, and are typically shorter than males. Both sexes {{have a black}} bill and pink feet. Juveniles have a greyish-brown colouration, {{similar to that of}} the females, with a blotchy or spotted chest.|$|R
5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are marked {{on the head and}} nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts. The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the <b>belly.</b> The <b>feathers</b> of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around the eye is dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|R
50|$|Males average 20.1 in (51 cm) long, while females average 22.1 in (56 cm); {{they are}} {{distinguished}} from the black caracara by larger size and plumage that is mainly black, with the <b>belly,</b> tibal <b>feathers,</b> and undertail feathers being white. Both their faces and throats are bare with a few black feathers scattered on the throat; the exposed skin is red. Both male and female red-throated caracaras are similar in appearance. Males have a wing length of 35.55 cm, a tail length of 24.96 cm, a bill length of 2.5 cm, and a tarsus length of 5.41 cm. Females have a wing length of 35.93 cm, a tail length of 25.31 cm, a bill length of 2.58 cm, and a tarsus length of 5.62 cm.|$|R

5000|$|The white-backed {{night heron}} is 50 - 55 cm in length {{with a black}} head and a short crest, or {{prominent}} feather display {{on the top of}} its head. The heron has large red eyes with white-ringed markings around them, and the lores, or the region behind the eye, are a pale yellow hue. The throat feathers are white, whereas the neck and breast are rufous, or a reddish-brown hue. There is a notable white triangular patch along the back formed by the white scapulars, or small feathers, on the shoulder of the bird. The <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> are a whitish-brown and the legs are yellow. [...] An immature heron can be identified by its streaked breast and the white spots on the upper-wing coverts. Chicks have an olive-brown down.|$|E
50|$|The male {{displays}} by grasping a stem {{of grass}} at one end, and hops or files to near the female. At once he sleeks down his feathers, stands upright with tail straight down, and jerks his head upwards a few times. He then leans forward, twists his tail towards the female and fluffs his flank and <b>belly</b> <b>feathers.</b> At this stage he usually drops the straw {{and begins to}} sing and dance. The flank and ventral feathers are not always fluffed out, {{and the intensity of}} the display probably depends on the relationship of the two birds. If the female seems receptive the male will attempt copulation. However, most displays come to an end before this final phase is reached. Successful mating is usually followed by a little bill fencing and mutual preening (Baptista and Horblit 1990).|$|E
50|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are marked {{on the head and}} nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts.

50|$|Beautiful {{sunbirds}} are tiny, only 10 cm long, {{although the}} breeding male's long tail adds another 5 cm. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, {{both of which}} are adaptations to their nectar feeding. The male has a black head, bright metallic green upper parts, scarlet breast bordered with yellow and black <b>belly.</b> The central <b>feathers</b> of the teal are greatly elongated. The female is brown above with yellowish underparts.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of {{approximately}} 75 cm. The neck is buffish, the upperparts are grey, the <b>belly</b> and flight <b>feathers</b> are black, {{and there is}} a large white patch in the wings. In flight, where the relatively short legs do not extend beyond the tail (unlike e.g. Eudocimus and Plegadis), the white patch forms a broad white band on the upperwing that separates the black remiges and the grey lesser wing-coverts. The bill and bare skin around the eyes are blackish and the legs are red.|$|R
50|$|However, when {{a female}} is near-by, the male may preface his display by flying about {{with a bit}} of nesting material. (Goodwin 1982) He will lower himself and edges along the perch and twists towards her. He will begin to sing with body upright, head pointed towards the bird. The head is held level or {{slightly}} downward, the throat is pumping and the weee song becomes pulsating. The flanks and <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> are fluffle out. In the final stage of the display, the head is stretched up fully, the bill is held wide open without any movement of the mandibles. And the head is turn from side to side. Then he edges towards her maybe with little hops with the intention to mount. There is no noticeable movement and the song is continual high-pitched trill. This is when the high extended peeeeeee part of the song is uttered.|$|E

50|$|This is a moderately-sized finch. Adult {{birds are}} 12.5 to 15 cm and span 20 to 25 cm. Body mass {{can vary from}} 16 to 27 g, with an average weight of 21 g. Among {{standard}} measurements, the wing chord is 7 to 8.4 cm, the tail is 5.7 to 6.5 cm, the culmen is 0.9 to 1.1 cm and the tarsus is 1.6 to 1.8 cm. Adults have a long, square-tipped brown tail and are a brown or dull-brown color across the back with some shading into deep gray on the wing feathers. Breast and <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> may be streaked; the flanks usually are. In most cases, adult males' heads, necks and shoulders are reddish. This color sometimes extends to the belly and down the back, between the wings. Male coloration varies in intensity with the seasons and {{is derived from the}} berries and fruits in its diet. As a result, the colors range from pale straw-yellow through bright orange (both rare) to deep, intense red. Adult females have brown upperparts and streaked underparts.|$|E
50|$|In {{juvenile}} plumage the head, {{neck and}} upper body are rusty brown with faint barring of light cream, head and back dark brown, upper wing-coverts white with buff tips, a narrow white {{bar on the}} bend of the wing, white tipping on the retrices and tail similar to adult but paler. First immature plumage resembles adults but individuals retain a dark buff colouration on the throat, lores, forehead and crown, mixed grey and rusty brown on the chest, light buff on the flanks and <b>belly,</b> with white <b>feathers</b> emerging on the supercilium and malar region.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a tiny}} bird, {{weighing}} only 2.4 to 2.6 g. All Mexican sheartails have a long, curved {{and black}} bill, a dull green crown and bronzy-green nape and upperparts. Males and females are sexual dimorphic. The male, which are 9 to 10 cm including the tail, have a white line behind the eye and a pink-purple throat with a white band below. His underparts are dull green, being clearer on median <b>belly</b> and <b>feathers</b> cover his undertail. The male's tail is long and deeply forked, usually held closed in repose. His inner tail are feathers green, the rest being black with cinnamon inner margins. Female, at 8.5 to 9 cm, has a whitish face with a blackish stripe behind the eye. Her throat, chest and belly are whitish with cinnamon tinges on the sides. The female has a shorter forked tail, the outer feathers of which are reddish with a subterminal black band and white tips. Immatures are similar to females.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{total length}} of {{approximately}} 75 cm. The head, neck and lower chest are buffish, the crown and nape are cinnamon, the upperparts and (often incomplete) chest-band are grey, the <b>belly</b> and flight <b>feathers</b> are black, and the wing-coverts are whitish (though not contrasting strongly with the grey upperparts). The bill, throat-wattle and bare skin {{around the eyes}} are blackish and the legs are red. The throat-wattle is smaller, the bill is shorter, the wing-coverts are greyer, the lower chest is paler and the cinnamon on the crown and nape is brighter and more extensive {{when compared to the}} black-faced ibis.|$|R

50|$|The {{peak time}} for egg {{production}} is early May, with some birds, particularly first-time breeders, laying {{later in the}} month or in June. The clutch size is normally three eggs; larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest. Egg size averages 41 x 31 mm, although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid. The average egg weight is 20.2 g, of which 5% is shell. The egg weight depends on how well-fed the female is, {{as well as on}} its position in the clutch. The eggs are cream, buff, or pale brown, marked with streaks, spots or blotches of black, brown or grey which help to camouflage them. Incubation is by both sexes, although more often by the female, and lasts 21-22 days, extending to 25 days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended; nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34 days. On hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> before returning to the eggs, thus affording the eggs some cooling. Except when the colony suffers disaster, 90% of the eggs hatch. The precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings, and like the eggs, is similar to the equivalent stage of the Arctic tern. The chicks fledge in 22-28 days, usually 25-26. Fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days, and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions. The young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents {{until the end of the}} breeding season, and beyond. Common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds, at least until the adults move further south in about December.Like many terns, this species is very defensive of its nest and young, and will harass humans, dogs, muskrats and most diurnal birds, but unlike the more aggressive Arctic tern, it rarely hits the intruder, usually swerving off at the last moment. Adults can discriminate between individual humans, attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers. Nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks; colonies can be wiped out by rats, and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present.|$|E
5000|$|Besides {{the female}} being larger, {{there is little}} {{external}} sexual dimorphism in the Eurasian eagle-owl although the ear tufts of males reportedly {{tend to be more}} upright than those of females. When an eagle-owl is seen on its own in the field, it is generally not possible to distinguish the individual’s sex. Gender determination by size is possible via in hand measurements. Reportedly, in some populations the female may be slightly darker on average than the male. The plumage coloration across at least 13 accepted subspecies can be highly variable. The upper parts may be brown-black to tawny-buff to pale creamy gray, typically showing dense freckling on the forehead and crown, stripes on the nape, sides and back of the neck, and dark splotches on the pale ground colour of the back, mantle and scapulars. A narrow buff band, freckled with brown or buff, often runs up {{from the base of the}} bill, above the inner part of the eye and along the inner edge of the black-brown ear tufts. The rump and upper tail-coverts are delicately patterned with dark vermiculations and fine wavy barring, the extent of which varies with subspecies. The underwing coverts and undertail coverts are similar but tend to be more strongly barred in brownish-black. The primaries and secondaries are brown with broad dark brown bars and dark brown tips, and grey or buff irregular lines. A complete moult takes place each year between July and December. The facial disc is tawny-buff, speckled with black-brown, so densely on the outer edge of the disc as to form a [...] "frame" [...] around the face. The chin and throat are white with a brownish central streak. The feathers of the upper breast generally have brownish-black centres and reddish-brown edges except for the central ones which have white edges. The chin and throat may appear white continuing down the center of the upper breast. The lower breast and <b>belly</b> <b>feathers</b> are creamy-brown to tawny buff to off-white with a variable amount of fine dark wavy barring, on a tawny-buff ground colour. The legs and feet (which are feathered almost to the talons) are likewise marked on a buff ground colour but more faintly. The tail is tawny-buff, mottled dark grey-brown with about six black-brown bars. The bill and feet are black. The iris is most often orange but is fairly variable. In some European birds, the iris is a bright reddish, blood-orange colour but then in subspecies found in arid, desert-like habitats, the iris can range into an orange-yellow colour (most closely related species generally have yellowish irises, excluding the Indian eagle-owl).|$|E
