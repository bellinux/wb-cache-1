30|$|Conventional {{treatments}} for OB are drug therapy, <b>bladder</b> rehabilitation <b>training,</b> and surgery. Drug treatment is based mainly on anticholinergic agents. The efficacy {{of these drugs}} is good, but often the patient cannot adhere to medication because of adverse reactions (Pelletier et al. 2009). <b>Bladder</b> rehabilitation <b>training</b> can take a long time, and often the effect is not satisfactory. Surgery is traumatic, is associated with complications, and is not accepted by some patients.|$|R
30|$|Causes of OB {{are mainly}} neurogenic: {{injury to the}} spinal cord, {{multiple}} sclerosis, or spinal meningocele. Treatment of neurogenic bladder is very challenging. Some methods have been used (e.g., drugs, <b>bladder</b> rehabilitation <b>training,</b> surgery) but outcomes have been barely satisfactory. Moreover, long-term treatment is expensive, so many {{patients and their families}} cannot adhere to treatment. Thus, more effective treatment methods for OB have been studied.|$|R
50|$|During a {{visit to}} a doctor's office, parents can be {{instructed}} in <b>bladder</b> retention control <b>training</b> by having their child drink more and more fluids during the day and delay urination for longer periods of time, attempting to strengthen bladder control. They are also encouraged to enforced hourly wakings for trips to the bathroom during the night and to develop a cleanup routine for the child (possibly including cleaning more than just the sheets), in addition to positively reinforcing dry nights (nights without urination incidents).|$|R
50|$|<b>Bladder</b> <b>training,</b> {{also known}} as {{scheduled}} voiding and bladder re-education is urinating at specific times of the day. It {{is used as a}} first line treatment of overactive bladder on mixed urinary incontinence.|$|E

40|$|For {{radiation}} therapy of cervical cancer, segmentation of the cervix {{and the surrounding}} organs are needed. The aim {{is to develop a}} fully automatic method for the segmentation of all relevant organs. Our approach is an atlas-based segmentation, with a registration scheme that is aided by statistical knowledge of the deformations that are to be expected. A statistical model that acts on the boundary of an organ is included as a soft constraint in a free-form registration framework. As a first evaluation of our approach, we apply it to the segmentation of the bladder. Statistical models for the <b>bladder</b> were <b>trained</b> on a set of manual delineations. Experiments on a leave-one-patient-out basis were performed, with the quality defined as the Dice similarity to the manual segmentations. Compared to a registration without the use of statistical knowledge, the segmentations are slightly, but significantly improved. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{practice}} of children's toilet training through interviews with parents and caretakers. Methods: A cross-sectional study of healthy children using a questionnaire applied to parents or caretakers of 100 consecutive children aged 3 to 6 years old. Results: 97 % {{of the children were}} home-trained by their mothers and 92 % of them used their intuition, previous experience with an older child and grandmothers' experience. Bowel and <b>bladder</b> toilet <b>training</b> started simultaneously in 84 % of the cases, whereas 41 % of the children mastered stool control earlier. Mothers with lower educational level and of social classes C, D and E initiated the training earlier and one of the related reasons was the cost of disposable diapers. Age in initiation or duration of toilet training was similar for boys and girls. Children presented most of the readiness symptoms for toilet training and {{only a small number of}} them used a seat reducer or a foot support. There was no increase in constipation prevalence after toilet training and there was no encopresis. Conclusions: Mothers were responsible for bowel toilet training and initiated it with no specialized help.

40|$|We {{developed}} nomograms {{to predict}} disease recurrence {{in patients with}} Ta, T 1 transitional cell carcinoma of the <b>bladder.</b> Thirty-eight <b>training</b> hospitals participated in this retrospective multicenter study. Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 1, 587 patients with newly diagnosed non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were enrolled in this study. Patients with prior histories of bladder cancer, non-transitional cell carcinoma, or a follow-up duration of less than 12 months were excluded. With univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, we constructed nomograms to predict disease recurrence, and internal validation was performed using statistical techniques. Three-year and five-year recurrence-free rates were 64. 3 % and 55. 3 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that age (hazard ratio [HR]= 1. 437, p< 0. 001), tumor size (HR= 1. 328, p= 0. 001), multiplicity (HR= 1. 505, p< 0. 001), tumor grade (HR= 1. 347, p= 0. 007), concomitant carcinoma in situ (HR= 1. 611, p= 0. 007), and intravesical therapy (HR= 0. 681, p< 0. 001) were independent predictors for disease recurrence. Based on these prognostic factors, nomograms for the prediction of disease recurrence were developed. These nomograms {{can be used to}} predict the probability of disease recurrence in patients with newly diagnosed Ta, T 1 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. They may be useful for patient counseling, clinical trial design, and patient follow-up planning...|$|R
50|$|Timed voiding {{programs}} involve {{establishing a}} schedule for urination. To do this a patient fills in a chart of voiding and leaking. From the patterns {{that appear in}} the chart, the patient can plan to empty his or her bladder before {{he or she would}} otherwise leak. Some individuals find it helpful to use a vibrating reminder watch to help them remember to use the bathroom. Vibrating watches can be set to go off at certain intervals or at specific times throughout the day, depending on the watch. Through this <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> exercise, the patient can alter their bladder’s schedule for storing and emptying urine.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{treatment}} {{is not always}} required. If {{treatment is}} desired pelvic floor exercises, <b>bladder</b> <b>training,</b> and other behavioral methods are initially recommended. Weight loss in those who are overweight, decreasing caffeine consumption, and drinking moderate fluids, can also have benefits. Medications, typically of the anti-muscarinic type, are only recommended if other measures are not effective. They are no more effective than behavioral methods; however, they are associated with side effects, particularly in older people. Some non-invasive electrical stimulation methods appear effective while they are in use. Injections of botulinum toxin into the bladder is another option. Urinary catheters or surgery are generally not recommended. A diary to track problems can help determine whether treatments are working.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{will usually}} be {{assessed}} {{using a combination}} of history taking, examination (including pelvic examination and assessment of prolapse using validated systems such as the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification POP-Q system) and assessment of quality of life impact using validated questionnaires, including the assessment of sexual function using Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire IUGA- Revised PISQ-IR. A bladder diary is often used to quantify an individual’s fluid intake, and the number of voids per day and night, as well as the volume the bladder can hold on a day-to-day basis. Further investigations might include urodynamics or a cystoscopy. Treatment usually starts with conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle training, fluid and food modification or <b>bladder</b> <b>training.</b> Drug therapies can be used for overactive bladder, which may include antimuscarinic drugs or beta 3 receptor agonists - both of these help to control the urgency that is the key component of overactive bladder. If medications fail, more invasive options such as injections of botulinum toxin to the bladder muscle, or neuromodulation are other options for symptom relief. Surgical treatments can be offered for stress incontinence and/or uterovaginal prolapse if pelvic floor muscle training is unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|PurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} standard and biofeedback <b>bladder</b> control <b>training</b> (BCT) on the resolution of dysfunctional elimination syndrome (primary outcome), and on the reduction of urinary tract infections (UTI) {{and the use of}} medications such as antibacterial prophylaxis and/or anticholinergic/alpha-blockers (secondary outcome) in girls older than aged least 5 years. Materials and Methods 72 girls, median age of 8 years (interquartile range, IQR 7 - 10) were subjected to standard BCT (cognitive, behavioural and constipation treatment) and 12 one-hour sessions of animated biofeedback using interactive computer games within 8 weeks. Fifty patients were reevaluated after median 11 (IQR, 6 - 17) months. Effectiveness of BCT was determined by reduction of dysfunctional voiding score (DVS), daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), constipation, UTI, nocturnal enuresis (NE), post void residual (PVR), and improvements in bladder capacity and uroflow/EMG patterns. ResultsBCT resulted in significant normalization of DUI, NE, constipation, bladder capacity, uroflow/EMG, while decrease of PVR didn't reach statistical significance. In addition, the incidence of UTI, antibacterial prophylaxis and medical urotherapy significantly decreased. There {{were no significant differences in}} DVS, DUI, NE, bladder capacity and voiding pattern at the end of the BCT and at the time of reevaluation. The success on BCT was supported by parenteral perception of the treatment response in 63. 9 % and full response in additional 15. 3 % of the patients. ConclusionCombination of standard and biofeedback BCT improved dysfunctional elimination syndrome and decreased UTI with discontinuation of antibacterial prophylaxis and/or anticholinergic/alpha-blockers in the majority of the patients. Better training results are expected in patients with higher bladder wall thickness as well as in those with vesicoureteral reflux, while presence of nocturnal enuresis may be a negative predictor of the training effect...|$|R
40|$|Walking is the unthinking {{transportation}} of daily life, supporting countless but essential trips within home and beyond, walking holds profound symbolic importance. When a person sustains {{spinal cord injury}} the most obvious functional limitation encountered is loss of ambulation. Conventional rehabilitation primarily provides compensatory strategy for accomplishing mobility and strengthening above the level of lesion. Recently new approach to facilitate locomotor recovery and bladder and bowel emptying have been explored,these include:- 1) Body weight support walking (BWS), 2) Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and 3) Interferential Therapy (IFT) To determine whether BWS training, FES and IFT have potential to improve walking function and bladder emptying in individuals with SCI, 20 subjects {{with spinal cord injury}} at the level of dorsolumber and lumbosacral regions were studied. Significant improvement in the muscle power of lower limbs and bladder control was seen in patients who received FES and IFT after the injury and at follow up of 6 months. Body support walking proved to be effective in early rehabilitation of patients with SCI.

MÉTODOS: Estudo de corte {{transversal}} em crianças sadias, aplicando-se um questionário estruturado para 100 responsáveis por crianças entre três e seis anos de idade. RESULTADOS: 97 % das crianças foram treinadas em casa pelas mães e 92 % delas utilizaram a intuição, a experiência com o filho anterior e o aprendizado com as avós. O treinamento do controle esfincteriano anal e vesical foi iniciado simultaneamente em 84 % dos casos, sendo o controle anal adquirido primeiramente em 41 % das crianças. As mães com escolaridade menor e das classes C-D-E iniciaram o treinamento mais precocemente, sendo um dos fatores relatados o custo das fraldas. Não houve diferença entre meninos e meninas para idade de início e duração do treinamento. As crianças apresentavam a maioria dos "sinais de prontidão" para o início do treinamento e, das crianças que foram treinadas no vaso sanitário, uma pequena parcela utilizou redutor e apoio para os pés. Não houve aumento significativo de constipação intestinal após o treinamento e não foram observados casos de encoprese. CONCLUSÕES: As mães foram as responsáveis pelo treinamento esfincteriano anal e o iniciaram sem auxílio especializado.

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find application of bioelectrical impedance analysis and anthropometry as interchangeable methods to assess body composition of sportspersons. Design: A 4 months long cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} at Sports Authority of India during pre-competition period. Method: 83 national and international level players from Sports Authority of India with age 18 - 25 years were selected as participants and body fat percentage was estimated using both the techniques following strict adherence to pre-measurement criteria. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all the parameters. Bland-Altman analysis was carried out to compare the methods. Result: Internal consistency of the data was confirmed by Pearson’s correlation value of 0. 739 at p≤ 0. 05. Mean body fat percentage from anthropometry came out to be 13. 08 ± 5. 00 and from BIA 14. 78 ± 9. 29. Mean difference between the body fat percent values between anthropometry and BIA was found to be 1. 70 ± 6. 53. Limits of agreement from Bland-Altman plot were found to be clinically significant with values from - 14. 51 to 11. 11 at 95 % confidence interval suggesting large discrepancies. Discussion: Based upon the findings of the study, it is not advisable to use anthropometry and BIA as interchangeable methods of body fat estimation however results need to be validated with further studies in future. Out of the two methods, BIA involves certain pre-measurement criteria like players falling in normal BMI ranges with emptied <b>bladder,</b> no vigorous <b>training</b> and food beverage intake before assessment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of flexible-dose solifenacin 5 / 10 mg with and without simplified <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS SOLAR (SOLifenacin Alone and with simplified bladder Re-training) was a multicentre, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study in patients with OAB. After a 2 -week, single-blind, placebo run-in, 643 patients were randomized to treatment with either solifenacin 5 mg once daily (od) alone (323) or 5 mg od combined with simplified <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> (320) for 8 weeks. At week 8, patients in both groups could request a dose increase to solifenacin 10 mg od for the remaining 8 weeks of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in {{the mean number of}} micturitions/ 24 h after 8 weeks. Secondary efficacy measures were the change in micturition frequency and other voiding diary variables at week 16. Patient-reported outcomes were also assessed, including patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Incontinence Quality of Life, and Treatment Satisfaction using a visual analogue scale score; tolerability was also assessed. RESULTS Solifenacin given alone was effective in improving all measures of OAB evaluated in the study. When simplified <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> was used combined with solifenacin there was a further significant improvement in micturition frequency at week 8, and this difference was maintained through to week 16. The use of simplified <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> with solifenacin also significantly improved treatment satisfaction at week 16 over the responses to solifenacin given alone. There {{was no significant difference between}} the treatment groups at week 16 in urgency, incontinence or other secondary variables measured. The most common adverse event reported was dry mouth in both treatment groups; there was a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events in the total study group. CONCLUSION Combined treatment with solifenacin and simplified <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> was more effective than solifenacin alone in reducing micturition frequency at weeks 8 and 16, and improving treatment satisfaction at week 16 in patients with OAB.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{efficacy}} of oxybutynin plus <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> in the treatment of detrusor instability in frail elderly patients living independently in the community. It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial of oxybutynin in 57 elderly patients (mean age 82. 2, SD 6. 06), with frequency and incontinence due to detrusor instability. After a 2 -week run-in period patients received a <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> and drug or placebo for the next 6 weeks. Outcome measures were changes in frequency and incontinence, recorded throughout on diary charts, and subjective evaluation of symptoms ('better'/'not better', and using a four-point scale 'cure ' to 'no change'). Oxybutynin was superior to placebo in reducing daytime frequency [95 % confidence interval (CI) of difference in change in frequencies totalled over 14 days was — 27. 0, — 6. 0; p = 0. 003] and in producing subjective benefit (at day 29 only), when 24 / 28 (86 %) patients on oxybutynin described benefit compared with 16 / 29 (55 %) on placebo (p = 0. 02). There was no difference between the groups in reduction of incontinent episodes. The median dose of oxybutynin titrated for therapeutic effect was 5 mg/day, and for placebo lOmg/day (CI of difference 0. 001, 5. 001; p = 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Urinary {{incontinence}} {{in women}} can be treated successfully by the general practitioner. However, {{little is known about}} the long-term effects of conservative treatment. AIM: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and <b>bladder</b> <b>training)</b> in female urinary incontinence. METHOD: A total of 88 women, aged between 20 and 65, who had participated in a controlled trial between 1987 and 1990, were contacted to participate in a five-year follow-up study. Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> followed by pelvic floor exercises. The outcome measures were a constructed scale for the severity of the incontinence, a seven-day bladder chart, and a questionnaire concerning patients' opinions. All patients were evaluated by an independent researcher. RESULTS: Compared with the one-year follow-up, the number of continent women remained the same, but a significantly greater number of patients worsened. Forty per cent of the women stayed in the same category of severity, while 45 % moved into the contiguous categories. The weekly frequency of wet episodes increased significantly, with a mean increase of 2. 65 episodes. Women with mixed incontinence were especially prone to relapse in the long-term. Compliance with the exercises had a positive influence on the outcomes, with 67 % of the women expressing satisfaction with the results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decline in the effect of conservative treatment in the long-term, the majority of the women are satisfied with their treatment. Patient compliance is the key to long-term success...|$|E

40|$|The {{mental state}} of 211 women {{attending}} a urodynamic clinic {{was assessed using}} questionnaires. Patients with genuine stress incontinence had scores comparable with other patients with longstanding physical complaints. Patients with sensory urgency were more anxious than those with genuine stress incontinence. Patients with detrusor instability were as anxious as patients with sensory urgency and in addition had {{higher scores on the}} hysteria scale. A subset of patients (roughly a quarter of the total) was identified, comprising members of all three diagnostic groups, for whom urinary symptoms rendered life intolerable. These patients were as anxious, depressed, and phobic as psychiatric inpatients, emphasising the serious psychological morbidity experienced by patients with urinary symptoms. Fifty patients with detrusor instability or sensory urgency entered a randomised trial comparing psychotherapy, bladder drill, and propantheline. The psychotherapy group significantly improved on measures of urgency, incontinence, and nocturia, though not on frequency. <b>Bladder</b> <b>training</b> was an effective treatment for frequency and patients became less anxious and depressed. There was a modest improvement in frequency of micturition in patients given propantheline. Frequency may be a learnt disorder which responds to the direct symptom oriented approach of <b>bladder</b> <b>training.</b> Patients with urgency and nocturia predominating might derive more benefit from psychotherapy...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} colposuspension on bladder function and urinary incontinence in girls with structural stress incontinence. A Burch colposuspension was performed in 26 incontinent girls for congenital bladder neck insufficiency (10), incontinence after urethrotomy (seven), hypospadias (five) and ectopic ureterocele (four). The indication for surgery was failure of conservative therapy (consisting of cognitive and biofeedback <b>bladder</b> <b>training,</b> physical therapy and/or antimuscarinic drugs in 23 children) and a severe anatomical defect of the bladder outlet in three. Colposuspension was combined with reconstruction of the distal urethra in three patients and of the bladder neck in seven. All girls had urodynamic tests before and after colposuspension. After surgery 14 of the 26 patients (54 %) were completely dry, four (15 %) had improved and eight (31 %) still had incontinence requiring pads. In 17 patients (65 %) additional conservative therapy was given and three (12 %) had additional surgery. After a median follow-up of 62 months, 65 % were completely dry, 19 % had improved and 15 % were incontinent. Of 25 patients who had recurrent urinary tract infections before colposuspension, 14 had none afterwards. Bladder overactivity in 10 patients before colposuspension resolved in five and de novo overactivity was detected in four. In a selected group of girls with structural urinary incontinence, Burch colposuspension can be used when medical treatment, cognitive and biofeedback <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> fail. It is reasonably effective for resolving incontinence and safe for bladder functio...|$|E
30|$|All {{patients}} underwent urodynamic evaluation, using Medtronics equipment, {{performed by}} our nurse practitioner in office, prior to surgery or medical treatment based on symptoms. Preoperatively, they also demonstrated urodynamic leakage with valsalva (VLPP) and low MUCP. They were asked, preoperatively, to decide their predominant symptom—stress or urge incontinence—or {{whether they were}} equally bothered by stress and urge incontinence. Women who found urge incontinence to be the predominant symptom were chosen for this study and offered either treatment with <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> and an anticholinergic drug or surgical treatment with TVT sling first. Before and after the TVT operations, the following objective variables were recorded: standardized stress test (three coughs with 300  ml bladder volume), residual urine, and maximum urinary flow.|$|E
40|$|Chronic prostatitis/chronic {{pelvic pain}} {{syndrome}} (CP/CPPS) is a debilitating condition, traditionally treated with antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and �-blockers. Pelvic floor tension myalgia is hypothesized to be {{a contributing factor}} in CPPS. Biofeedback training for CPPS {{is based on the}} principle that maximum muscle contraction prompts maximum muscle relaxation. Similar chronic pain conditions have been treated successfully with biofeedback-assisted techniques of neuromuscular reeducation. Preliminary study by our group has shown biofeedback, pelvic floor reeducation, and <b>bladder</b> <b>training</b> to be helpful in the treatment of CP/CPPS. Overall, 8 of 11 patients had improvement in either pain scores or their chronic prostatitis pain index scores. With no cure for CP/CPPS available, biofeedback and pelvic floor reeducation merit further evaluation in the treatment of this condition. UROLOGY 60 : 42 – 44, 2002. © 2002, Elsevier Science Inc. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is a debilitating condition affecting 8 % to 18 % of men. 1 – 4 Traditionally, this condition has been treated with antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and �-blockers. Pelvic floor tension myalgia has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in CPPS. 5, 6 Other chronic pain conditions, such as anal pain, 7 levator ani syndrome, 8 vulvar vestibulitis, 9 and chronic musculoskeletal pain, 10 have been treated successfully with biofeedback-assisted techniques of neuromuscular reeducation.
