5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, {{although there is}} the possibility that a self-inflicted injury may result in life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> favor of the tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to <b>be</b> <b>resolved.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{downturn}} in the aviation sector and ongoing disagreements between Julian Amery, the new Minister of Aviation and BOAC concerning writing off debt incurred buying and troubleshooting new British aircraft resulted in a further deterioration in relations between the airline and government. Amery commissioned an independent report into the financial performance of BOAC, undertaken by John Corbett. The ongoing disagreement about the funding arrangements for BOAC {{and the need for}} new Vickers VC10 aircraft would eventually <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> late 1963, when Slattery formally retired as chairman, though this was widely seen as a resignation; Slattery commented in 1964 that he had effectively been sacked.|$|E
5|$|According to Lucas and Sobus, {{the type}} species P. bugtiense {{from the late}} Oligocene of Pakistan {{includes}} junior synonyms such as B. osborni and P. zhajremensis. P. transouralicum, formerly Indricotherium, from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus. P. orgosensis, formerly Dzungariotherium, from the middle and late Oligocene of northwest China includes D. turfanensis and P. lipidus. P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name, but its exact position requires evaluation. P. prohorovi from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> relation to the other species; {{the same applies to}} proposed species such as I. intermedium and P. tienshanensis, as well as genera like Benaratherium and Caucasotherium. Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.|$|E

25|$|More {{problems}} and hard feelings arose from a Richmond-Chesterfield case {{which began in}} 1965; they were later used as prime examples of obstacles to regional cooperation as the state legislators have considered changes.

25|$|A {{resistor}} network {{that is a}} combination of parallel and series connections can be broken up into smaller parts that are either one or the other.

25|$|During the 65 {{years of}} its enforcement, a {{complete}} translation of the 1917 Code from its original Latin was never published. Translations were forbidden, partly to ensure that interpretive disputes among scholars and canonists concerning such {{a new type of}} code would <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> Latin itself and not in one of the many languages used in scholarship. More English-language research material exists relating to the 1917 Code than in any other language except Latin.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the launch}} scrub, Chairman of NASA's Mission Management Team LeRoy Cain noted that {{engineers}} would work {{to understand the}} hydrogen leak issue {{and come up with}} a solution to the problem. Cain said managers were hopeful that the issue could <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> time for the next available launch opportunity on 11 July 2009. Due to the delay of STS-127, managers noted that it was likely that the launch of STS-128 on 7 August 2009, would be pushed back slightly.|$|E
25|$|The papal nuncio to France conferred {{with the}} American {{ambassador}} in Paris, Benjamin Franklin, {{as to how}} the issue might <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> a way that would be acceptable to the United States. Franklin responded by saying that the official separation of Church and State in the United States did not permit the government to have any official opinion on who should govern American Catholics. He suggested privately that perhaps a French bishop might be given oversight of the small but growing Catholic community in the U.S.|$|E

25|$|A risk {{of ovarian}} {{stimulation}} {{is the development}} of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, particularly if hCG is used for inducing final oocyte maturation. This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation.|$|E
25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was {{to turn on the}} machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E

In the same press conference, he also mentioned issues within the dressing room that needed to <b>be</b> <b>resolved.</b> <b>In</b> the following days, allegations were made that he sent defamatory text messages to members of the South African dressing room, with Strauss and Flower said to be referred to within the messages.|$|E

25|$|Google has yet {{to receive}} {{permission}} to launch its Street View feature in India. The country is worried about Google’s plans to put Indian cities, tourist spots, hills and rivers in an application in which one can explore through 360-degree, panoramic and street level imagery because terrorists are using these maps to plan terrorist attacks in India. Official sources said after a detailed analysis by security agencies and defense forces feel that allowing Google to cover India would compromise the country’s security interest. Once the proposed Geo spatial Information Regulation Bill, 2016 comes into force, issues related to internet-based application would <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> India.|$|E
25|$|Organizationally, the Armenian nobility {{was headed}} by Grand Duke - metz ishxan or ishxanac ishxan in Armenian, who in some {{historical}} chronicles is also called metzametz. He was the marshal of Armenian nobility and had special privileges and duties. For example, {{in case of}} king's death {{and if there was}} no inheriting sepuh (crown prince), it was the grand duke who would temporarily take the responsibilities and perform the duties of the king until the issues of succession to the throne are resolved. In reality, however, the successions to the throne would be arranged in advance or would <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> the course of feuds and intestine strives.|$|E
25|$|It is 1660, {{just before}} the Restoration of the Monarchy. Sir George Vernon, a Royalist, is in a {{property}} dispute with his cousin, Rupert Vernon, a Roundhead (i.e., a supporter of Parliament). Sir George fears that this dispute will <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>in</b> favour of his cousin, who has strong ties to the current government, and that his family would lose Haddon Hall. To secure the estate's long-term future, Sir George has arranged a marriage between Rupert and his only surviving child, Dorothy Vernon. But Dorothy {{is in love with}} John Manners, the impoverished second son of the Earl of Rutland. Manners, who is also a Royalist, is of no use to Sir George, and he has forbidden their union.|$|E
