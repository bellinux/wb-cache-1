5|$|The Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry {{declared}} a State of Emergency in 17counties {{and described the}} outbreak as the worst natural disaster he had seen since becoming governor. On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed to borrow $200,000 to repair damages to their home or find a temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed to borrow up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed to borrow up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in federal grants.

The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has been paid for by FEMA.

25|$|Two series, 26 {{episodes in}} all {{were made for}} R.C.T.I. in 1996. It was the first sitcom of that style ever {{attempted}} in Indonesia. It was entitled Detak Detik and starred Mat Sola as the Jackie Gleason character. Art Carney rang the cast prior to production to give them his <b>best</b> <b>wishes.</b> It was decided to make Mat Sola a Silver Bird taxi driver as they had a bit more prestige in Indonesia. They left Nurbuat who mirrored Ed Norton as a sewerage worker. The chemistry worked well. They had to remove any references to alcohol as Indonesia is {{a country with a}} majority of Muslim population.|$|E

25|$|About 130 delegates were in {{attendance}} {{as the first}} conference of the Independent Labour Party was gavelled to order, including in addition to Hardie such socialist and labour worthies as Alderman Ben Tillett, author George Bernard Shaw, and Edward Aveling, son-in-law of Karl Marx. Some 91 local branches of the Independent Labour Party were represented, joined by 11 local Fabian Societies, four branches of the Social Democratic Federation, and individual representatives {{of a number of}} other socialist and labour groups. German Socialist leader Edward Bernstein was briefly permitted to address the gathering to pass along the <b>best</b> <b>wishes</b> for success from the Social Democratic Party of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Surviving crewmembers of Bismarck {{state that}} they {{received}} this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of Lütjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and {{that they may not}} reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted Lütjens' words to mean the Admiral did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. He spoke of the U-boats and Luftwaffe that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon Lütjens received messages of <b>best</b> <b>wishes</b> from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. Lütjens purportedly stuffed the paper into his pocket without comment.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my <b>best</b> <b>wishes</b> for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|On October 15, 2003, Schiavo's {{feeding tube}} was removed. Within a week, when the Schindlers' final appeal was exhausted, State Rep. Frank Attkisson and the Florida Legislature hastily passed [...] "Terri's Law," [...] giving Governor Jeb Bush the {{authority}} {{to intervene in the}} case. Governor Bush immediately ordered the feeding tube reinserted. Governor Bush sent the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to remove Schiavo from the hospice. She was taken to Morton Plant Rehabilitation Hospital in Clearwater, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted. She was then returned to the hospice. Part of the legislation required the appointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL), Dr. Jay Wolfson, to [...] "deduce and represent the <b>best</b> <b>wishes</b> and best interests" [...] of Schiavo, and report them to Governor Bush. Wolfson's report did not change Michael's role as her legal guardian and did not otherwise obstruct him legally.|$|E

500|$|In Chinese literature, {{ailanthus}} {{is often}} used for two rather extreme metaphors, with a mature tree representing {{a father and a}} stump being a spoiled child. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing <b>best</b> <b>wishes</b> to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write [...] "wishing your ailanthus and daylily are strong and happy", with ailanthus metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother. Furthermore, one can scold a child by calling him a [...] "good-for-nothing ailanthus stump sprout", meaning the child is irresponsible. This derives from the literature of Zhuangzi, a Taoist philosopher, who referred to a tree that had developed from a sprout at the stump and was thus unsuitable for carpentry due to its irregular shape. Later scholars associated this tree with ailanthus and applied the metaphor to children who, like stump sprouts of the tree, will not develop into a worthwhile human being if they don't follow rules or traditions.|$|E
500|$|There were no {{candidate}} debates, but Douglas and Nixon met {{twice on}} the campaign trail during the primary season. The first meeting took place at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, where Nixon waved a check for $100 that his campaign had received from [...] "Eleanor Roosevelt", with an accompanying letter, [...] "I wish it could be ten times more. <b>Best</b> <b>wishes</b> for your success." [...] The audience was shocked at the idea of Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of Democratic former president Franklin Roosevelt and known for her liberal views, contributing to Nixon's campaign. Nixon went on to explain that the envelope was postmarked Oyster Bay, New York, and that the Eleanor Roosevelt who had sent the contribution was Eleanor Butler Roosevelt, the widow of former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt's eldest son. The audience laughed, and Douglas later wrote that she had been distracted and gave a poor speech. A memo from Chotiner several days later noted that Boddy had failed to attend the function, and that Douglas wished that she had also not attended.|$|E
500|$|King Baudouin, {{representing}} Belgium, {{gave the}} first {{speech in which}} he praised the [...] "genius" [...] of his ancestor, King Leopold II, who begun the colonisation of the Congo on his own initiative in the 1880s. Baudouin depicted the end of colonial rule in the Congo as {{the culmination of the}} Belgian [...] "civilising mission" [...] and spoke of the close relations he hoped would be maintained between the two countries. The thousands of Congolese listening via loudspeakers outside the Palais were infuriated. Following the end of the King's speech, Kasa-Vubu gave a short and uncontroversial address thanking the King for his attendance and for his <b>best</b> <b>wishes.</b> Both speeches were applauded vigorously. In a change to the schedule, Joseph Kasongo, the President of the Chamber of Deputies who was presiding over the ceremonies, invited Lumumba to give an address as Lumumba had requested him to do so. The invitation came as a surprise to the audience, who had not expected Lumumba to take any part in the ceremony.|$|E
