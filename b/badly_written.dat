25|$|However, {{despite the}} fact that so many Shakespearean {{scholars}} believed the play to have been written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was <b>badly</b> <b>written</b> but asserted that Shakespeare did write it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare's authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including A.W. Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{immediately}} criticised the novel's decadence and homosexual allusions; The Daily Chronicle for example, {{called it}} [...] "unclean", [...] "poisonous", and [...] "heavy with the mephitic odours {{of moral and}} spiritual putrefaction". Wilde vigorously responded, writing {{to the editor of}} the Scots Observer, in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art – [...] "If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson." [...] He nevertheless revised it extensively for book publication in 1891: six new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of twenty two epigrams, such as [...] "Books are well written, or <b>badly</b> <b>written.</b> That is all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Whether {{this was}} the honest result of a war games {{exercise}} or just a fabrication by Schleicher to force Papen out of office {{is a matter of}} some historical debate. The opinion of most leans towards the latter, for in January 1933 Schleicher would tell Hindenburg that new war games had shown that the Reichswehr would crush both the Sturmabteilung and the Red Front Fighters and defend the eastern borders of Germany from a Polish invasion. The results of the war games forced Papen to resign in December 1932 in favor of Schleicher. Hindenburg was most upset at losing his favorite chancellor. Suspecting that the war games were faked to force Papen out, he came to bear a grudge against Schleicher. Hindenburg took the loss of Papen very <b>badly,</b> <b>writing</b> him a letter saying he wanted Papen to stay on as Chancellor and gave him the gift of an autographed photo of himself together with lines from a popular World War I song [...] "Once I had a comrade", which was the first time Hindenburg had ever given any sort of gift to the men who had served as Chancellor.|$|R

500|$|Critics heavily panned Grizzly Rage. Film {{historian}} Paul Mavis {{called the}} film [...] "a pathetically undernourished effort", feeling {{the film was}} plagued with a bad plot, bad acting, bad direction, and bad special effects. In comparing Grizzly, a 1976 natural horror film, and Grizzly Man, a 2005 documentary showing {{the life and death}} of amateur bear enthusiast Timothy Treadwell, he found it sorely lacking. Mavis states that it was a horror film that did not show anyone getting [...] "sliced, diced, munched on and stomped" [...] by the bear. He also heavily criticizes the film for not having any scenes where the bear is actually in the same frame as any of the actors, wondering if the actors and/or trainers were afraid something tragic would happen. As a whole, he recommended skipping the film. Film critic David Walker agreed. Like Mavis, Walker compared the film to the 1976 Grizzly and found it severely lacking. He also felt the plot was poorly conceived and was combined with a <b>badly</b> <b>written</b> script and uninteresting characters: ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1979 the Publications Appeal Board, on the {{recommendation}} of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, overruled the banning of Burger's Daughter. The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board [...] "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that [...] "t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [...]" [...] Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the Appeal Board told a press reporter, [...] "Don't buy —it is not worth buying. Very <b>badly</b> <b>written...</b> This is also why we eventually passed it."

500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably <b>badly</b> <b>written</b> script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E

500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{asserted}} that the austere, but captivating installment presented a [...] "glancing, chilled view" [...] of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal. To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the [...] "menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape" [...] by carefully approaching its most gruesome features. Puig noted a surfeit of [...] "stylistic flourishes" [...] and [...] "intriguing" [...] changes in the narrative, compared to the original film. In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called [...] "paradoxical position" [...] that was both [...] "immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the [...] "fabulously sinister entertainment" [...] surpassed the original film [...] "in every way". The film took two-and-a-half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: [...] "Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of [...] "brilliantly orchestrated" [...] anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the [...] "lumbering proceduralism" [...] that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the [...] "long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere". The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; [...] "Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was [...] "technically superb" [...] and [...] "superbly acted". In contrast, Kyle Smith of New York Post censured the film, calling it [...] "rubbish" [...] and further commenting that it [...] "demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, <b>badly</b> <b>written,</b> psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story {{so long as you}} allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis." ...|$|E
