5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia),</b> tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
500|$|Tylopilus tabacinus forms ectomycorrhizal {{associations}} with oaks, and fruit bodies are usually found solitarily, scattered, or in groups on sandy soil under oaks or in mixed oak-pine woods from July to September. In the United States, the mushroom is distributed from Florida north to Rhode Island, and west to Mississippi. It {{has also been}} collected from a montane cloud forest of Mexican <b>Beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> var. mexicana) {{in the state of}} Hidalgo, Mexico. The occurrence of the mushroom is [...] "occasional to fairly common". The varieties amarus and dubius are rare, known only from their original collection locations in Gainesville, Florida.|$|E
50|$|Scorias spongiosa is a {{sooty mould}} fungus that grows on aphid honeydew. It {{is a member}} of the Capnodiaceae family of ascomycete fungi. It is found only on American <b>beech</b> trees, <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scorias spongiosa is a {{specialist}} and grows {{exclusively on the}} honeydew formed by colonies of the beech blight aphid, Grylloprociphilus imbricator. This aphid is found only on one host plant, the American <b>beech</b> tree, <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia,</b> where it congregates on branches and twigs, creating copious amounts of honeydew that drip onto vegetation below. The large quantity of honeydew enables this fungus to grow to a large size, much bigger than other sooty mould fungi, which produce only a thin black layer {{on the surface of}} leaves. On tree trunks this fungus has been known to grow into a mass of hyphae as big as a football, but it is more usual for the agglomeration on branches or twigs to reach a diameter of about fifteen centimetres.|$|R
40|$|Specialist herbivores {{are thought}} to often enhance or {{maintain}} plant diversity within ecosystems, because they prevent their host species from becoming competitively dominant. In contrast, specialist herbivores are not generally expected to have negative impacts on non-hosts. However, we describe a cascade of indirect interactions whereby a specialist sooty mold (Scorias spongiosa) colonizes the honeydew from a specialist beech aphid (Grylloprociphilus imbricator), ultimately decreasing the survival of seedlings beneath American <b>beech</b> trees (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia).</b> A common garden experiment indicated that this mortality resulted from moldy honeydew impairing leaf function rather than from chemical or microbial changes to the soil. In addition, aphids consistently and repeatedly colonized the same large beech trees, suggesting that seedling-depauperate islands may form beneath these trees. Thus this highly specialized three-way beech-aphid-fungus interaction {{has the potential to}} negatively impact local forest regeneration via a cascade of indirect effects...|$|R
2500|$|In the Smokies, the {{northern}} hardwood canopies {{are dominated by}} yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and American <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia).</b> [...] White basswood (Tilia heterophylla), mountain maple (Acer spicatum) and striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), and yellow buckeye (Aesculus flava) are also present. [...] The northern hardwood understory is home to diverse species such as coneflower, skunk goldenrod, Rugels ragwort, bloodroot, hydrangea, and several species of grasses and ferns.|$|E
2500|$|The common English name {{hornbeam}} {{derives from}} the hardness of the woods (likened to horn) and the Old English beam [...] "tree" [...] (cognate with German Baum). The American hornbeam is also occasionally known as blue-beech, ironwood, or musclewood, the first from the resemblance of the bark {{to that of the}} American <b>beech</b> <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia,</b> the other two from the hardness of the wood and the muscular appearance of the trunk, respectively. The botanic name for the genus, Carpinus, is the original Latin name for the European species.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of soil {{fertility}} exists as evidenced by soil orders-Alfisols and Mollisols which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American <b>beech</b> (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia),</b> sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow {{with lower levels of}} nitrogen than are required by [...] "nitrogen- demanding" [...] white ash (Fraxinus americana), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and American basswood (Tilia americana). Hickories are considered [...] "soil improvers" [...] because their leaves have a relatively high calcium content.|$|E
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{reported}} a marked increase in American <b>beech</b> dominance (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> Ehrh.) relative to sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in late successional forests of North America. However, many factors have been proposed to explain this sudden shift in tree species composition. We investigated the microsite factors responsible for maple regeneration failure under maple-beech stands, focusing on both light availability and soil conditions. The survival and growth of maple seedlings planted in the natural soil and in pots with enriched soil were monitored for two years, as well as foliar nutrition and herbivory damages of natural seedlings. The results indicate that low light availability associated {{with the presence of}} beech is the primary factor leading to maple regeneration failures. Soil nutrient availability and foliar nutrition of natural seedlings did not differ between forest types. Yet, the results indicate that factors such as allelopathy and preferential herbivory on maple seedlings under beech could be superimposed effects that hinder maple regeneration. Under similar forests, a control of beech sapling abundance in the understory followed by selection cutting could be one way to promote and maintain maple populations in the longer term...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{reported}} divergent {{results on the}} effect of soil fertility and canopy opening on understory density and growth of sugar maple (AS; Acer saccharum Marsh.) and American <b>beech</b> (FG; <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> Ehrh.). The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of a gradient of canopy opening and soil fertility on the density and growth of AS and FG saplings in southwestern Quebec, Canada. We investigated 56 stands containing both AS and FG that were subjected to different disturbance history types (DHTs) (UF, unmanaged forest; PC, partial cut; and CC, clearcut) on various soil types. AS and FG absolute and relative sapling density varied greatly among the 56 stands; however, no significant effects of DHT, soil nutrient availability, or their interaction were found. Both species responded positively in terms of radial growth to canopy openings, with FG growth being slightly better than AS growth in PC stands compared with other canopy treatments. Contrary to our hypothesis, AS did not show significantly higher growth than FG following clear-cutting. These results do not support the idea that AS abundance and growth could be promoted by increasing the intensity of the canopy opening during harvest, at least on the generally acidic and base-poor soils that were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{nutrient}} {{pools and}} nitrogen dynamics in old-growth forests {{were compared with}} selectively logged stands and stands that were selectively logged and then burned approximately 100 years ago {{to test the hypothesis}} that land-use history exerts persistent controls on nutrient capital and nitrogen (N) transformation rates. We provide esti-mates of net N mineralization and nitrification rates for old-growth forests from the northeastern United States, a region in which few old-growth forests remain and for which few published accounts of mineralization rates exist. At the plot level, no ef-fects of the dominant tree species were observed on any measured soil properties or N-cycling rates. Effects of alternate disturbance histories were de-tected in soil carbon (C) and N pools. Old-growth forest soils had higher total C (67 Mgha 1) and N capital (3. 3 Mgha 1) than that of historically logged then burned soils (C 50 Mgha 1 and N Mgha 1), with intermediate values (C 54 Mgha 1 and N 2. 7 Mgha 1) in the stands that were historically logged. Despite these differences in C and N content, corresponding differences in Câ€“N ratio, net N mineralization rates, and net nitri-fication rates were not observed. The N concentra-tion in the green foliage of American <b>beech</b> trees (<b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia)</b> was also highest from canopy trees growing in old-growth stands (3. 0 %), fol-lowed by logged stands (2. 6 %), and lowest in the logged/burned stands (2. 2 %). These data suggest that some legacies of light harvesting on ecosystem processes may be detected nearly 100 years follow-ing the disturbance event. These results are dis-cussed in the context of how multiple forest distur-bances act in concert to affect forest dynamics.

50|$|<b>Beech</b> (<b>Fagus)</b> is a genus of {{deciduous}} {{trees in}} the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America. Recent classification systems of the genus recognize ten to thirteen species in two distinct subgenera, Engleriana and Fagus. The Engleriana subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the Fagus subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom {{on the underside of}} the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. Fagus japonica, Fagus engleriana, and the species F. okamotoi, proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus. The better known <b>Fagus</b> subgenus <b>beeches</b> are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. This group includes <b>Fagus</b> sylvatica, <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia,</b> <b>Fagus</b> crenata, Fagus lucida, Fagus longipetiolata, and Fagus hayatae. The classification of the European <b>beech,</b> <b>Fagus</b> sylvatica is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example Fagus taurica, Fagus orientalis, and Fagus moesica). Research suggests that beeches in Eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history, during the Miocene. The populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes, though genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species.|$|R

One of the major consequences of forecasted future climate change is the redistribution of plant life due to species migrations and extinctions in response to these changes. This has caused many scientists to {{look at the history of}} vegetation migrations to help understand future vegetation management strategies and biodiversity concerns. Our knowledge and understanding of past long-term species range changes is best understood from interpretations of the palynological record. This study reexamines paleopollen data from the World Data Center in conjunction with a recent chloroplastic DNA study of one temperate woody vegetation species, <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia.</b> The pollen percentage level of 0. 5 percent of total pollen is used to infer the presence of <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> at palynological sites. When assumptions about the suitability of this threshold are challenged, a different late-Pleistocene geography emerges for <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia.</b> A survey of all palynological sites in the North American pollen database for <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> pollen, in conjunction with supporting DNA evidence, indicates consistent patterns of more northerly refugial locations and different migration routes for <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> than currently accepted. Patterns of pollen deposition and DNA evidence reveal a possible refuge in the area of the northern Mississippi Embayment. There is as well evidence of refugia for and expansion of <b>Fagus</b> <b>grandifolia</b> mixed with boreal forest elements along the Appalachian Plateau, closer to the ice sheet margin than the Gulf Coastal Plain...|$|R
