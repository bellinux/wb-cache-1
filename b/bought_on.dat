There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day.

5|$|In March 2008, Kohli was <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> a youth {{contract}} by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000. He had an indifferent 2008 season, with a {{total of}} 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09. He fared slightly better in the second season in which he made a total of 246 runs at 22.36, striking at over 112, while his team made it as far as the final. In the 2010 season, Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his strike rate to 144.81.|$|E

5|$|Lea {{took him}} {{to one side and}} {{informed}} him of the charges, but Corder denied all knowledge of both Maria and the crime. A search of the house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> the day of the murder, some letters from a Mr Gardener, which may have contained warnings about the discovery of the crime, and a passport from the French ambassador, evidence which suggested that Corder may have been preparing to flee.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, probably for the relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.|$|E
5|$|By 1894 two Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} were in use: Huddersfield, works number 616, built 1876, and Earl Temple, works number 1249, built 1894. Huddersfield {{was bought}} second-hand and {{had originally been}} named Prestwich. Earl Temple, later renamed Brill No.1, was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered cab, and was bought new. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price, and thus Earl Temple was owned directly by the Earl and rented to the O Wotton No. 2, works number 1415, built 1899, was <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> 7 February 1899 to replace Huddersfield. All three were 0-6-0ST with inside cylinders. The decrepit Huddersfield was sold in 1901, {{and the other two}} Manning Wardle locomotives were sold in 1909.|$|E

5|$|The Master Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It {{struggled}} to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> {{the site where the}} Master Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, was a friend of Frances Grant who directed the Master School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|E
5|$|Those {{opposed to}} the new {{government}} began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept {{in the custody of}} Mortimer's son-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how well cared for Edward was; the records show luxury goods being <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the Lament of Edward II, was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminaries}} to the furnace's construction {{began in}} 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte, {{decided to sell}} off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte Furnace, a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch, as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were <b>bought</b> <b>on</b> August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace, which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the furnace. The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the furnace. The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and the furnace went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, the furnace had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000tons (27,200tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits, and the furnace was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of the furnace by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure.|$|E
