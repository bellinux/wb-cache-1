50|$|The Borda count {{has both}} a strong compromising {{incentive}} {{and a large}} vulnerability to <b>burying.</b> <b>Here</b> is a hypothetical example of both factors at the same time: if there are two candidates {{the most likely to}} win, the voter can maximize the impact on the contest between these candidates by ranking the candidate the voter likes more in first place, ranking the candidate whom they like less in last place. If neither candidate is the sincere first or last choice, the voter is using both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many different groups voters use this strategy, this gives a paradoxical advantage to the candidate generally thought least likely to win.|$|R
