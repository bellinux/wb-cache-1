But he would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> bright lights as Anaheim won the series in five games bolstered by strong {{defensive}} play and opportunistic scoring.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative pressure that sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E

5|$|Hata's major {{contribution}} to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ("The Nanking Incident"), published in 1986, {{which is a}} detailed study of the event based on Japanese, Chinese, and English sources that was later noted by historians such as Daqing Yang to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> impartial works of scholarship written on the massacre during the period. The book {{is known for its}} relatively low estimate of the death toll, which Hata put at up to 40,000 because he based the number of civilian killing on the work of Lewis S.C. Smythe who conducted survey of massacre in the immediate aftermass (War Damage in Nanking Area, Dec.1937 to March 1938, Urban and Rural Surveys) and also exclude Chinese soldiers. Hata's book is acknowledged as the first to discuss what might have caused the massacre, whereas previous books had focused only on the event itself. Hata argued that the Japanese Army's lack of military police and facilities to detain POWs, its ignorance of international laws, and the Chinese General Tang Shengzhi's decision to flee the city without formally surrendering, which left large number of plain-clothes soldiers within the civilian population which was followed by excessive mopping-up operations by the Japanese, among the factors which led to the slaughter.|$|E
5|$|The nominal gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew {{at an annual rate}} of 8 to 12 percent between 2002–03 and 2006-07. When Mayawati began her five-year tenure as chief minister from May 2007, the average annual state GDP growth rate between 2007–08 and 2010-11 shot up to 17 percent. In financial year 2011, UP’s state GDP was predicted to grow by 11 per cent. Thus, UP’s nominal GDP growth in these four years (2007–11) was almost the same as what the entire country clocked in that period. State’s per capita income went up by 136 per cent from about Rs 11,000 in 2007 to Rs 26,000 in 2011. UP continued to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> states with a revenue surplus and Mayawati has used this surplus to reduce the state’s fiscal deficit from 4 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to a budgeted figure of 2.97 per cent for the financial year 2011. Mayawati also ensured that the state’s indebtedness came down from 43 percent of state GDP in 2007-08 to 32 percent in 2011-12. Mayawati in her five years added about 4,000 MW of generation capacity to the state’s power sector. Mayawati also planned to create 7,000 MW more generation capacity by the end of 2012 for achieving her target is to make state a power-surplus state by 2017 for which the state is already executing power projects with a total capacity of 10,000 MW.|$|E

25|$|Collocation of a waste {{generator}} with a waste-to-ethanol plant {{can reduce the}} waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business.

For example, {{millions of tons of}} wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels.

25|$|During the 1950s, {{the site}} housed a {{research}} group that used radar to scan approaching thunder storms {{as far away}} as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning.

The installation consisted of a steel tower supporting a second-hand military radar set, several Quonset huts and box trailers, surrounded by a chain-link fence. Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the end of the long career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> who accurately forecast the path of the destructive Hurricane of September, 1938.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the aspects}} of grammar that Genie did and did not acquire aided {{linguists}} in determining which structures were more dependent on exposure to language. In particular, the auxiliary component of language had been known to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> children acquire at different rates depending {{on the amount of}} speech they heard. Genie's inability to master it supported the idea that its development and that of other similar systems of grammar is more sensitive than vocabulary or more basic grammar, such as word order or recursion, requiring a more conducive language environment to properly develop and having a more specific critical period. Linguists also noted the grammatical skills Genie acquired and used bore striking resemblance to the grammar of pidgin languages and the gesture systems deaf children invent when isolated from other deaf people, which contain certain aspects of language, such as vocabulary, recursion, and word order, but always lack other components such as auxiliary structures.|$|E
