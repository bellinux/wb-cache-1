5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 {{seconds left in the}} game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had <b>been</b> <b>down</b> four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E
5|$|In the divisional {{round of}} the playoffs, the Red Sox faced the Anaheim Angels in a best-of-five series. They won Game 1 largely thanks to a 7-run 4th inning, {{and went on to}} sweep the series. In the 7th inning of Game 3, with the Red Sox leading by 4, Vladimir Guerrero tied the game for the Angels with a grand slam. However, David Ortiz won the series with a game winning home run in the 10th. In the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox lost the first three games against the New York Yankees and were {{trailing}} in Game 4 when they began the 9th inning. Kevin Millar was walked by Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. Dave Roberts then came into the game to pinch run for Millar and stole second base. Mueller then singled to enable him to tie the game. Another game winning home run by Ortiz won the game for the Red Sox in the 12th inning. Ortiz' single in the 14th inning of Game 5 scored the winning run for the Red Sox, in what was the longest post-season game in baseball history. Despite having a dislocated ankle tendon, Schilling started Game 6 for the Red Sox. He pitched for seven innings, and allowed just one run, during which time his sock became soaked in blood. In the eighth inning, Yankees third baseman Rodriguez slapped a ball out of pitcher Arroyo's hand, allowing the Yankees to score a run. However, after a discussion the umpires called Rodriguez out for interference and canceled the run. Fans then threw debris onto the field in protest and the game was stopped for ten minutes. The Red Sox won the game and became the first baseball team to ever force a Game 7 after having <b>been</b> <b>down</b> 3 games to none. A 10–3 win in Game 7 brought the Red Sox to the World Series {{for the first time in}} 18 years.|$|E

In Graham Taylor's first match as England Manager (against Hungary), Barnes had appeared to be attacking positively and beating players and using the ball well.

25|$|On 16 July 2010, it was {{revealed}} that Kewell had rejected an approach from A-League side Gold Coast United in favour of staying in Europe. Galatasaray offered a new one-year contract, but it is believed that Kewell preferred a longer-term contract. On 19 July 2010, Galatasaray announced via its official website that the parties had agreed to a one-year extension of Kewell's contract. On 21 July, the details of Kewell's contract were revealed: he would receive a lump sum fee of €1.8million and a salary of €30,000 per match. It was also revealed that Kewell would wear number 99 for the 2010–11 season. Kewell scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in a 1–0 win against Gaziantepspor on 14 September 2010.

25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had <b>been</b> <b>down</b> for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E
25|$|At the French Open, Söderling, seeded 23rd, {{reached the}} fourth {{round of a}} Grand Slam {{for the first time}} after {{defeating}} Kevin Kim, Denis Istomin, and David Ferrer.

Women's tennis legend Martina Navratilova described the match {{as one of the greatest}} upsets in tennis history. His 6–2, 6–7(2–7), 6–4, 7–6(7–2) victory over the reigning world No. 1 made Söderling the first and, until 2015, only person to beat Nadal at the French Open and in a best of five-set match on clay. Two days later, facing 10th seed and two-time semifinalist Nikolay Davydenko, Söderling won 6–1, 6–3, 6–1 to reach his maiden major semifinal. Söderling made his first Grand Slam final, beating Fernando González 6–3, 7–5, 5–7, 4–6, 6–4 after having <b>been</b> <b>down</b> 0–30 and 1–4 in the final set, then reeling off the final five games of the set and match.

Lasting two hours and fifty minutes, commentators felt this match was worthy of a final. Henin approached the net forty-three times, winning thirty-five of those points. In the third round, she defeated No. 28 seed Alisa Kleybanova from Russia; where she made a comeback to win 3–6, 6–4, 6–2. In the fourth round she faced World No. 16 and fellow Belgian, Yanina Wickmayer, defeating her in three sets 7–6, 1–6, 6–3. She then defeated No. 19 seed Nadia Petrova in the quarterfinals. Henin won 7–6, 7–5 after having <b>been</b> <b>down</b> 0–3 in the second set.

25|$|On USC's next possession, Leinart {{drove his}} team into Texas territory, {{this time to}} the 25-yard line, before {{throwing}} an interception to Texas free safety Michael Griffin, {{who appeared to be}} out of the play but ran halfway across the field before making a leaping catch and barely staying in-bounds in the end zone. The turnover ended a second Trojans' drive with USC in scoring position. On the following Texas drive, Young connected with wide receiver Limas Sweed, who caught eight balls for 65yards on the day, for a key first down. Young then led his team with his legs, capping the drive by running 10yards before throwing a lateral pass to open running back Selvin Young, who ran for 12 more for the touchdown. The lateral, made after Young's knee had touched the ground, was not reviewed because of issues with the replay equipment. The game continued with a failed extra-point attempt by Texas, which, not knowing of the equipment issues, appeared to rush the kick to get the play off before the prior play could be reviewed. The NCAA football-officiating coordinator later asserted that Young's knee had <b>been</b> <b>down,</b> and expressed confusion about how the call had been handled.|$|E

He finished with figures of 5–69 as England couldn't reach the target and the game ended in a draw. In the following Test, Broad was pushed up the order to number 8 after Tim Bresnan was left out. Broad only managed one wicket in South Africa's first innings of 309. He then added 16 in England's first innings of 315.

25|$|At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company's {{location}} {{with the}} ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they {{hovered in the}} heavy rain just above the rubber trees near a small clearing. Because {{they were to be}} dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates—which were still banded with metal straps—were wrapped in blankets for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn, and the officer commanding Administration Company, Major Owen O'Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Riley was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Dohle was mentioned in despatches (MiD). Yet, without tools to cut the straps, the infantry had to smash the crates open using machetes or the butts of their rifles to get to the inner metal boxes. Under heavy fire Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, the Company Sergeant Major, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby's job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean in the mud and rain. The resupply retrieved the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had <b>been</b> <b>down</b> to their last 100 rounds, but with it complete the Australians resumed firing, forcing the Viet Cong back for a third time.|$|E
