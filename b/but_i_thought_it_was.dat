500|$|The {{recording}} engineer for the album, Brooks Arthur, [...] remembered the sessions in 2009: [...] "A cloud came along, {{and it was}} called the Van Morrison sessions. We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> closer to the type of music I wanted to put out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E
500|$|In the film, {{she plays}} Eli, a child vampire who {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} the main character, 12-year-old Oskar (played by Kåre Hedebrant). Oskar is frequently tormented by bullies. Eli initially tells Oskar to fight back, and rescues him in the end, killing three of the bullies in process. Because Eli {{is supposed to be}} an androgynous character in the film, director Tomas Alfredson decided to overdub Leandersson's voice with a less feminine one. [...] "Lina's voice is beautiful, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too high in pitch", he said. Eli's voice throughout the whole film was provided by Elif Ceylan. In an interview with Dagens Nyheter, Leandersson laughingly commented that [...] "it was actually nice to be dubbed, my voice sounds weird".|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing room, we could have done better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and you know better than me <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back." ...|$|E
500|$|The artists co-wrote [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] {{with its}} {{producers}} Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. The song was recorded and mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was released for digital download on February 1, 2011, {{and was sent}} to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on February 8. In an interview with Vibe magazine, Diplo revealed {{that when he was}} first asked to put the song together, he thought that [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was not for an official release, saying: [...] "I knew that I was working on something for a Chris Brown record, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for a mixtape... When I did the beat, I gave it to one of his writers. Then Busta Rhymes got on it and I was like, 'Okay, {{this is going to be}} a club record.' And then when Wayne got on it 'Look at Me Now' became a radio record. It just took off from there." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates liked them — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did you see that poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> life-changing." ...|$|E

500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the funniest thing {{at the time and}} it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gael García Bernal as Bartender/King of Ward 3, {{one of the}} film's villains. In {{defiance}} of the doctor's democratic efforts and election as leader of Ward 1, the bartender declares himself [...] "King of Ward 3" [...] and gains immediate popularity from his [...] "subjects" [...] by prioritizing food over his ward's community responsibilities such as burying the dead. He somehow obtains a revolver and uses it to bully the other wards by controlling the food supply. Meirelles followed the advice of Brazilian stage director Antunes Filho and changed the character from the novel by making him more ambiguous, explaining, [...] "In the book, he is really a mean guy, terribly evil from the beginning... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more interesting to have him be not evil but more like {{a child with a}} gun." [...] Bernal described the result of his character, [...] "I think the King is just very practical, very pragmatic. He appears cold because he is not an idealist and does not see hope, but he is a survivor, the same as all the others." [...] The doctor's wife kills him with a pair of medical scissors to the neck. His death marks the point when Ward 1 takes back control, with the doctor's wife's threat to kill one of the men from Ward 3 for every day her ward goes without food.|$|E

2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've heard so much about it. I thought it was really funny." [...] When asked if she should her in all the [...] "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: [...] "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!" ...|$|E
