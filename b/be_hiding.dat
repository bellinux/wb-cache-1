Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt that if he did not attend he could appear to <b>be</b> <b>hiding.</b> He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E

5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E
5|$|To get a lead {{on where}} Renard might <b>be</b> <b>hiding,</b> Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in {{exchange}} for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1889, a range detective {{from the}} Association named George Henderson accused Ella Watson, a local rancher, of {{stealing}} cattle from a fellow rancher {{by the name}} of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to arrest Ella before apprehending her husband, Jim Averell, as well. Both of them were subsequently hanged from a tree. This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West in which a woman was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future conflicts in the war. County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who would testify against the aggressors. One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Jim's nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shoot-out with unknown suspects, and was presumed to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell's, died {{on the day of the}} trial from poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Mate {{guarding}} tactics {{employed by}} males tend to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> the female from intrasexual threats; {{this could be}} not bringing the mate to social events in which other competing males may be present.

25|$|Having {{made clear}} that he wanted Dara to succeed him, Shah Jahan became ill with stranguary in 1657 and was closeted {{under the care of}} his {{favourite}} son in the newly built city of Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi). Rumours of the death of Shah Jahan abounded and the younger sons were concerned that Dara might <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> it for Machiavellian reasons. Thus, they took action: Shah Shuja prepared to contest the throne from Bengal, where he had been governor since 1637, while Murad did the same in his governorship of Gujarat and Aurangzeb did so in the Deccan. It is not known whether these preparations were made in the mistaken belief that the rumours of death were true or whether the challengers were just taking advantage of the situation.|$|E

It is later revealed that Snape had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt.

Harry still holds Snape partly responsible for Sirius' death, believing Snape's goading spurred Sirius into joining the battle.|$|E
25|$|The Isaaq clan was not {{the only}} target of {{violence}}. Many other Somali communities, such as the Umar Mahmud sub-lineage of Majeerteen also became the victims of the violence and war. A US Country Study handbook describes the Barre regime retaliation against the Umar Mahmud following a failed coup attempt in 1978 which resulted in 2,000 Umar Mahmuud civilians dying in Mudug. According to Rebecca Richards, the violence in the north and northwest was disproportionate but affected many communities, particularly Isaaq. The shelling, aerial bombing and associated mass deaths in many communities particularly targeted the members of the Isaaq clan, states Richards, and this systematic state violence was linked to the belief that these groups were obtaining assistance from the Ethiopian government. The harsh reprisals, widespread bombing and burning of villages followed every time there was an attack by SNM believed to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in Ethiopia.|$|E
25|$|As the Pacific War {{began in}} 1941, Japan worked to {{mobilize}} {{all of its}} puppet troops, including the Inner Mongolian Army, to fight its war. They played on Prince De Wang's desire to become the emperor of all of Mongolia by promising to eventually give him Outer Mongolia (controlled by the Soviet satellite state the Mongolian People's Republic at the time). He committed Mongolian Army and police units to assisting Japanese operations throughout northern China against guerrillas and bandits {{during the period from}} 1938 until the defeat of Japan in 1945. These operations often resulted in high civilian casualties due to the Mongol and Japanese troops attacking civilians living in the areas where the insurgents were known to <b>be</b> <b>hiding.</b> By that time, Japanese officers had total control over both the Mengjiang government and army. They forced the Prince to sign a decree stating that the Mongolian government had declared war on Great Britain and the United States in 1941.|$|E
