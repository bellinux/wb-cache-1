40|$|Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a cell surface protein, {{strongly}} associated with certain types of human carcinomas. Structural study of a CA IX-binding monoclonal antibody (mAb) M 75, complexed with its epitope peptide may contribute toward elucidation {{of the role of}} CA IX. Monoclonal antibody M 75 was obtained and proved to react excellently with native and denaturated CA IX. Using synthetic oligopeptides, the epitope of mAb M 75 was localized in the proteoglycan domain of CA IX, in the region of a tandem repeat and identified as amino acids PGEEDLP. The Fab fragment was obtained by papain cleavage. We obtained crystals of free <b>Fab</b> <b>M</b> 75 and <b>Fab</b> <b>M</b> 75 complexed with two different epitope peptides.

40|$|AbstractTranscription {{factors that}} drive non-neoplastic myelomonocytic {{differentiation}} are well characterized {{but have not}} been systematically analyzed in the leukemic context. We investigated widely used, patient-derived myeloid leukemia cell lines with proclivity for differentiation into granulocytes by retinoic acid (RA) and/or monocytes by 1, 25 -dihyrdroxyvitamin D 3 (D 3). Using K 562 (<b>FAB</b> <b>M</b> 1), HL 60 (<b>FAB</b> <b>M</b> 2), RA-resistant HL 60 sublines, NB 4 (<b>FAB</b> <b>M</b> 3), and U 937 (<b>FAB</b> <b>M</b> 5), we correlated nuclear transcription factor expression to immunophenotype, G 1 /G 0 cell cycle arrest and functional inducible oxidative metabolism. We found that myelomonocytic transcription factors are aberrantly expressed in these cell lines. Monocytic-lineage factor EGR 1 was not induced by D 3 (the monocytic inducer) but instead by RA (the granulocytic inducer) in lineage bipotent myeloblastic HL 60. In promyelocytic NB 4 cells, EGR 1 levels were increased by D 3, while Gfi- 1 expression (which promotes the granulocytic lineage) was upregulated during D 3 -induced monocytic differentiation in HL 60, and by RA treatment in monocytic U 937 cells. Furthermore, RARα and VDR expression were not strongly correlated to differentiation. In response to different differentiation inducers, U 937 exhibited the most distinct transcription factor expression profile, while similarly mature NB 4 and HL 60 were better coupled. Overall, the differentiation induction agents RA and D 3 elicited cell-specific responses across these common <b>FAB</b> <b>M</b> 1 -M 5 cell lines...|$|R

A monoclonal antibody (64 M 5) specific to a (6 - 4) photoproduct has been established and the corresponding single-chain antibody (64 M 5 sc-Fv) has been prepared. In this study, we characterized the ligand selectivities of 64 M 5 and 64 M 5 scFv using synthetic octadeoxynucleotides containing either a central cis-syn cyclo-butane thymine dimer (T[c,s]T), the (6 - 4) photoproduct of TpT (T[6 - 4]T), or its Dewar isomer (T[Dewar] T) by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Both 64 M 5 and 64 M 5 scFv recognized T[6 - 4]T, but not the other photoproducts. We synthesized several biotinylated oligonucleotides of different lengths containing (T[6 - 4]T) to analyze the effects of the antigen size on the binding rates of an antigen binding fragment (64 <b>M</b> 5 <b>Fab)</b> and 64 <b>M</b> 5 scFv by means of surface plasmon resonance.
