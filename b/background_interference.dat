Since lawsone shows many similarities with ninhydrin, the current reagent for latent fingerprint development, studies have been conducted to see if lawsone can be used in this field. As of now the research is inconclusive, but optimistic. Lawsone non-specifically targets primary amino acids, and displays photoluminescence with forensic light sources. It has a characteristic purple/brown coloration as opposed to the purple/blue associated with ninhydrin.Lawsone shows promise as a reagent for fingerprint detection because of its photoluminescence maximized at 640nm, which is high enough that it avoids <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> common for ninhydrin.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of auditory <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> on test performance on a group of schizophrenics as well as with a normal group and to ascertain if subgroups of each type could be differentiated on neuopsychological measures from the WMS-R particularly sensitive to left-hemispheric functions. There were 60 subjects, 30 normals and 30 schizophrenics, who volunteered to participate in the study. The schizophrenics, all hospitalized at Logansport State Hospital, had a diagnosis of chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia. The normals were students at Logansport High School enrolled in a senior psychology class. The research utilized a counterbalanced design in which subjects were administered items from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised in both a normal administration condition and in the presence of auditory background information provided by a prerecorded tape. The relationship between auditory <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> and diagnosis was examined using an analysis of variance (MANOVA) of the difference between means. The overall mean for groups did not differ significantly, F (1, 58) =. 087. No test was identified as being able to differentiate left-hemispheric functions for either group in either testing condition, F (4, 55) = 1. 09, p. 37. There also was no statistically significant difference between the test performance of males and females in the presence of auditory <b>background</b> <b>interference.</b> The results indicate that neither group evidenced much change in perfromance in the presence of auditory background information. This would suggest that the testing conditionn had little influence on test results. It also suggests that internal differences, as opposed to the external environment, contributed much more to the differences in test performance. The lack of significant differences on the subtests that are considered measures of left-hemispheric functioning may have been due to the significant cognitive impairments of the schizophrenics. The normals may have been more able to increase their attentional and concentration skills in the presence of auditory <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> so that no decreases in performance resulted.

40|$|Studying the {{problems}} of measuring tractor noises at the operator’s station using the drawbar test equipment at the Tractor Testing Laboratory was separated into two phases. The first of these two phases was concerned with the effect of noise being reflected from the front section of the test car and <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> due to noise generated by the test equipment. After {{it was determined that}} the noise generated by the test equipment did affect measurement of tractor noise, individual noise sources were isolated and studied which created the second phase. These sources included exhausting of compressed air, mechanical engine noise, transmission noise, and radiator cooling fan noise. Results from the test conducted to evaluate noise reflection from the front section of the test car indicated that this would not cause problems in measuring tractor noise. Studying the preliminary results indicated that noise generated by the drawbar test equipment did create excessive <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> in the octave bands above 4000 Hz. To correct this difficulty the exhaust air outlet used for small load adjustments was relocated from beneath the instrument cab {{to the rear of the}} test car. Relocating of this outlet solved the problem of high frequency <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> due to the fact that compressed air was muffled while traveling through flexible exhaust pipe and also the outlet was positioned a considerable distance from the operator’s station. The other sources of test equipment noise investigated were the compressed air outlet in the load unit exhaust system, radiator cooling fan, mechanical engine noise, and the load unit transmission. None of these sources caused excessive interference which would contribute to error in accurately determining tractor noise. An important fact that resulted from the studying of individual components was that a large reduction of noise at its source can be achieved but may result in little or no reduction of interference at the tractor operator’s station. Determination of the most efficient method of absorbing power with respect to generation of test equipment noise was also studied. The major cause of drawbar test equipment noise was the exhausting of compressed air from beneath the instrument cab. It was also concluded that consistent noise measurements could be obtained without regard to the <b>background</b> <b>interference</b> of campus traffic. Advisor:G. W. Steinbruegg...|$|E
