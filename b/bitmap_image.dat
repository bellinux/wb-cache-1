25|$|In 1974, the Arecibo Message, {{an attempt}} to {{communicate}} with potential extraterrestrial life, was transmitted from the radio telescope toward the globular cluster Messier 13, about 25,000 light-years away. The 1,679 bit pattern of 1s and 0s defined a 23 by 73 pixel <b>bitmap</b> <b>image</b> that included numbers, stick figures, chemical formulas and a crude image of the telescope.|$|E
25|$|Mode 7 was a Teletext mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast teletext (Ceefax). It also made the computer useful as a Prestel terminal. The teletext characters were generated on board, for use with monitors and TV sets without a Teletext receiver. Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its ASCII code, rather than its <b>bitmap</b> <b>image</b> as was needed for the other modes.|$|E

(short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier (courier), during a {{failed attempt to}} make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash {{by a man named}} Raven who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a <b>bitmap</b> <b>image</b> contained in the file which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research, positing connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture and the legend of Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.|$|E
25|$|For information, the {{uncompressed}} 24-bit RGB <b>bitmap</b> <b>image</b> below (73,242 pixels) {{would require}} 219,726 bytes (excluding all other information headers). The filesizes indicated below include the internal JPEG information headers and some metadata. For highest quality images (Q=100), about 8.25 bits per color pixel is required. On grayscale images, {{a minimum of}} 6.5 bits per pixel is enough (a comparable Q=100 quality color information requires about 25% more encoded bits). The highest quality image below (Q=100) is encoded at nine bits per color pixel, the medium quality image (Q=25) uses one bit per color pixel. For most applications, the quality factor should not go below 0.75 bit per pixel (Q=12.5), {{as demonstrated by the}} low quality image. The image at lowest quality uses only 0.13 bit per pixel, and displays very poor color. This is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaled-down size. A method for creating better quantization matrices for a given image quality using PSNR instead of the Q factor is described in Minguillón & Pujol (2001).|$|E
