500|$|In February 1971, after a one off {{performance}} at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs. [...] "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained. [...] "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where {{you come up with}} ideas and forget them, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> just so out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|York Park {{has often}} been criticised for its large playing surface, which is blamed for {{producing}} unattractive low-scoring football. Prior {{to the start of}} 2009, only 11 of 28 matches saw a score beyond 100 points. For a pre-season match in 2009, 13metres of width was removed from the outer wing [...] "in a bid to produce more attractive games." [...] Before the match, Groenewegen said, [...] "Because that outer wing was so wide, once they [...] chipped wide out there it was very easy for teams to flood back <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so far away from the goals." [...] The ground is also known for its strong wind, which hinders the accuracy of long-distance kicks that are propelled high into the air.|$|E

500|$|Wodehouse {{believed}} {{that one of}} the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that [...] "If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> born that way." [...] He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as [...] "making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proof reading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.|$|E
500|$|According to Swift, [...] "Back to December" [...] is {{an apology}} to a past lover {{in the form}} of a song, {{something}} that she has never done before. She continued, [...] "I've never felt the need to apologize in a song before. But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [...] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. And sometimes you learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> careless." [...] Critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend, The Twilight Saga actor Taylor Lautner, due, in part, to the lyrics [...] "your tan skin, your sweet smile", as well as the hidden lyrics in the booklet, which spelled out [...] "TAY." [...] Lautner confirmed these rumors while promoting the TV series Scream Queens in 2016. [...] "Back to December" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Speak Now on October 12, 2010 as a part of the exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store leading up to the album's release. [...] On November 15, 2010, the song was released as the second single from Speak Now.|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{suggested}} an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done {{in front of}} the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery conjured up by the words for [...] "In Flanders Fields", which inspired [...] "Poppy Day". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Day. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: [...] "The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: [...] "We wanted it all white <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> supposed to do it all black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it and so we had it nice and classic", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was {{the only part of the}} original design that survived.|$|E

Therefore, according to the group, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not that chatty, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> either doing the proper performance.

2500|$|Blanchett {{has spoken}} about {{feminism}} and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 {{that she was}} concerned that [...] "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" [...] was threatening women's role in society. She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: [...] "Honestly, I think about my appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about {{the golden age of}} Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> lit and made into a goddess.

2500|$|In early 2007, JR and Babe's tempestuous romance {{received}} notice by TV Guide's Daniel R.

Coleridge cited the marriage as dysfunctional and seemed perplexed as to why Babe would stay with a man who tried to kill her, and as he put it, [...] "verbally abuses her all the time". Havins addressed deeper issues about the coupling:I know. I asked if we could do a PSA (Public service announcement) for women in abusive relationships to get help, but that didn't happen. I was concerned about how viewers might be influenced by Babe saying, 'Oh, it's OK, JR, you only tried to kill me <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> drinking.'
