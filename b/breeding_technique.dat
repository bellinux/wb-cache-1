5000|$|Deep litter is {{an animal}} housing system, {{based on the}} {{repeated}} spreading of straw or sawdust material in indoor booths. An initial layer of litter is spread for the animals to use for bedding material and to defecate in, and as the litter is soiled, new layers of litter are continuously added by the farmer. In this fashion, a deep litter bedding can build up to depths of 1-2 meters. [...] "The usual procedure for built-up floor litter is to start with about 4 inches of fine litter material with additions of 1 to 2 inches later as needed without removal of the old. A depth of 6 to 12 inches is maintained by partial removals from time to time."

It {{was during the}} great depression that this field of study would take its biggest blow. With the economy at rock bottom labs were forced into selling many of their mice just to keep from shutting down. This necessity for funds all but stopped the continuation of these strains of mice. The transition for these laboratories to exporters of massive quantities of mice was one that was rather easily made if there were adequate facilities for their production on site. Eventually in the mid-1930s the market would return and genetics laboratories around the country resumed regular funding and thus continued in the areas of research they had started before the depression. As research into continued, so did the production of mice in places like Jackson Laboratory. Facilities like these were able to produce mice for research facilities around the world. These mice were bred with Mendelian <b>breeding</b> <b>technique</b> of which Little had implemented as standard practice around 1911.

In order to identify the conservation efforts, this ethnobotany study was aimed to determine traditional knowledge on the existence, economic value, utility, <b>breeding</b> <b>technique</b> and conservation of wood apple. The survey was conducted on a total of 102 local people from 10 sub-districts which were determined by proportionally stratified random sampling. Data were collected by questionnaires and individual interviews and then were analyzed descriptively. The results showed that all of respondents knew the figure of wood apple, but only 79. 50 % understood its status as an identity plant. Most of respondents (96 %) stated that the fruits have low economic value, 80. 39 % respondents have utilized ripe fruit as ingredients of beverages and stems as firewood. This utilization was only equal to 29. 72 % compared to the potential usability based on research results. It was concluded that the traditional knowledge about the existence, economic value, and <b>breeding</b> <b>technique</b> were good and on the contrary, the knowledge about the plant’s usability was bad.

40|$|Reverse {{breeding}} (RB) {{is a novel}} plant <b>breeding</b> <b>technique</b> {{designed to}} directly produce parental lines for any heterozygous plant, {{one of the most}} sought after goals in plant breeding. RB generates perfectly complementing homozygous parental lines through engineered meiosis. The method is based on reducing genetic recombination in the selected heterozygote by eliminating meiotic crossing over. Male or female spores obtained from such plants contain combinations of non-recombinant parental chromosomes which can be cultured in vitro to generate homozygous doubled haploid plants (DHs). From these DHs, complementary parents can be selected and used to reconstitute the heterozygote in perpetuity. Since the fixation of unknown heterozygous genotypes is impossible in traditional plant breeding, RB could fundamentally change future plant breeding. In this review, we discuss various other applications of RB, including breeding per chromosom...|$|E
