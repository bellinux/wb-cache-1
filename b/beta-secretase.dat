Focusing on neurological diseases, cathepsin B gene knockout studies in an epileptic rodent model have shown cathepsin B causes a significant amount of the apoptotic cell death that occurs as a result of inducing epilepsy. Cathepsin B inhibitor treatment of rats in which a seizure was induced resulted in improved neurological scores, learning ability and much reduced neuronal cell death and pro-apoptotic cell death peptides. Similarly, cathepsin B gene knockout and cathepsin B inhibitor treatment studies in traumatic brain injury mouse models have shown cathepsin B to be key to causing the resulting neuromuscular dysfunction, memory loss, neuronal cell death and increased production of pro-necrotic and pro-apoptotic cell death peptides. [...] In ischemic non-human primate and rodent models, cathepsin B inhibitor treatment prevented a significant loss of brain neurons, especially in the hippocampus.

In a non-transgenic senescence-accelerated mouse strain, which also has APP containing the wild-type <b>beta-secretase</b> site sequence, treatment with bilobalide, which is an extract of Ginko biloba leaves, also lowered brain Abeta by inhibiting cathepsin B. Moreover, siRNA silencing or chemically inhibiting cathepsin B in primary rodent hippocampal cells or bovine chromaffin cells, which have human wild-type <b>beta-secretase</b> activity, reduces secretion of Abeta by the regulated secretory pathway.Mutations in the CTSB gene have been linked to tropical pancreatitis, a form of chronic pancreatitis.|$|E

Other ADAM proteins, ADAM17 (also called TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme), ADAM9, and ADAM19 have also been identified as alpha secretases; extracellular expression of mutant ADAM9 (also known as MDC9 or meltrin gamma) lacking the membrane anchor domain has been suggested as one of many possible means of Alzheimer's prevention and treatment exploiting the alpha secretase pathway. Two distinct modalities of alpha-secretase activity have been observed in cells; constitutive activity occurs mainly at the cell surface [...] and is independent of regulatory mechanisms inside the cell, while regulated activity occurs mainly in the golgi and {{is dependent on the}} activity of protein kinase C.

40|$|Amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) is {{intimately involved in}} the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. <b>Beta-secretase</b> cleavage of APP {{is the first step}} in the amyloidogenic cleavage pathway that is enhanced in AD and generates amyloid beta peptides, the primary component of amyloid plaques. It is not clear how this enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP can lead to AD pathology, but research has indicated that defects in axonal transport may contribute to disease progression. Signs of axonal transport defects develop in AD and animal models of amyloid pathology well before amyloid plaques deposit. It remains unknown how increased <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage affects APP axonal transport and can lead to axonal defects. This thesis project shows that enhanced beta- secretase cleavage of APP impairs APP axonal transport in vitro and leads to axonal dystrophy in vivo, suggesting that disrupted axonal transport of APP might contribute to disease pathogenesis. First, I used a fluorescently-tagged version of the APP protein to show that 1) the familial AD (FAD) Swedish mutations at the <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage site of APP increase <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage and inhibit APP anterograde axonal transport, and 2) an opposing mutation at the <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage site decreases <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage and enhances APP anterograde axonal transport. Next, I used a gene-targeted mouse model to show that 1) FAD Swedish mutant APP expressed at endogenous levels can lead to axonal dilation in the cholinergic basal forebrain, and 2) axonal dystrophy develops in the absence of amyloid plaques. Taken together, these data suggest that amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, which is enhanced in AD, disrupts APP axonal transport and leads to axonal dystrophy before amyloid plaque formation, presenting a possible mechanism contributing to AD pathogenesi...|$|E

The catabolic pathways of human APP were studied 3 to 4 days after infection, when the equilibrium of APP production was reached. Although the expression of human wild type APP (WtAPP) by rat neurons induced the production of both extracellular and intraneuronal amyloid peptide (Abeta), Abeta was not detected in the culture medium of rat astrocytes producing human WtAPP. Because a low <b>beta-secretase</b> activity was previously reported in rodent astrocytes, we wondered whether modifications of the APP amino acid sequence at the <b>beta-secretase</b> clipping site would modify the astrocytic production of Abeta. Interestingly, rat astrocytes produced high amounts of Abeta after expression of human APP carrying a double amino acid substitution responsible for Alzheimer's disease in a large Swedish family (SwAPP). In both rat cortical neurons and astrocytes, the <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage of the human SwAPP occurred very early in the secretion process in a cellular compartment in which a different sorting of SwAPP and WtAPP seems unlikely.

Because <b>beta-secretase</b> {{is responsible for the}} amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, this prochelator strategy imparts disease specificity toward copper chelation not possible with general metal chelators.

40|$|The amyloid peptide is {{the main}} {{constituent}} of the amyloid plaques in brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. This peptide is generated from the amyloid precursor protein by two consecutive cleavages. Cleavage at the N terminus is performed by the recently discovered <b>beta-secretase</b> (Bace). This aspartyl protease contains a propeptide {{that has to be}} removed to obtain mature Bace. Furin {{and other members of the}} furin family of prohormone convertases are involved in this process. Surprisingly, <b>beta-secretase</b> activity, neither at the classical Asp(1) position nor at the Glu(11) position of amyloid precursor protein, seems to be controlled by this maturation step. Furthermore, we show that Glu(11) cleavage is a function of the expression level of Bace, that it depends on the membrane anchorage of Bace, and that Asp(1) cleavage can be followed by Glu(11) cleavage. Our data suggest that pro-Bace could be active as a <b>beta-secretase</b> in the early biosynthetic compartments of the cell and could be involved in the generation of the intracellular pool of the amyloid peptide. We conclude that modulation of the conversion of pro-Bace to mature Bace is not a relevant drug target to treat Alzheimer's disease. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{emerging}} approaches {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease aims at reducing toxic levels of Alphabeta-species through the modulation of secretases, namely by inducing alpha-secretase or inhibiting <b>beta-secretase</b> and/or gamma-secretase activities, or a combination of both. Although there is increasing evidence for the involvement of retinoids in Alzheimer's disease, their significance in the regulation of Alphabeta-peptide production remains unresolved. Our work concentrated on the regulation of all secretases mediated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), and supports the hypothesis that ATRA is capable of regulating them in an antiamyloidogenic sense at the levels of transcription, translation, and activation. Apart from increased alpha-secretase activity, we show a complex chain of regulatory events, resulting in impaired <b>beta-secretase</b> trafficking and membrane localization upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation by ATRA. Furthermore, ATRA demonstrates substrate specificity for beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) 1 over nonamyloidogenic BACE 2 in <b>beta-secretase</b> regulation, which probably promotes competition for amyloid precursor protein between ADAM 17 and BACE 1.

At present, {{little is known about}} the cellular pathways that control APP alpha- or <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage and thus A beta generation. To explore the contributory pathways in more detail we have recently employed an expression cloning screen and identified several activators of APP cleavage by alpha- or <b>beta-secretase.</b> Among them were known activators of APP cleavage, for example protein kinase A, and novel activators, such as endophilin and the APP homolog amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP 1). Mechanistic analysis revealed that both endophilin and APLP 1 reduce the rate of APP endocytosis and strongly increase APP cleavage by alpha-secretase. This review summarizes the results of the expression cloning screen in the context of recent developments in our understanding of the cellular regulation of APP alpha-secretase cleavage.

40|$|Formation of {{senile plaques}} {{containing}} the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) {{derived from the}} amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP is cleaved either by <b>beta-secretase</b> or by alpha-secretase to initiate amyloidogenic (release of Abeta) or nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, respectively. A key to understanding AD is to unravel how access of these enzymes to APP is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that lipid rafts are critically involved in regulating Abeta generation. Reducing cholesterol levels in N 2 a cells decreased Abeta production. APP and the beta-site APP cleavage enzyme (BACE 1) could be induced to copatch at the plasma membrane upon cross-linking with antibodies and to segregate away from nonraft markers. Antibody cross-linking dramatically increased production of Abeta in a cholesterol- dependent manner. Abeta generation was dependent on endocytosis and was reduced after expression of the dynamin mutant K 44 A and the Rab 5 GTP se-activating protein, RN-tre. This inhibition could be overcome by antibody cross-linking. These observations suggest the existence of two APP pools. Although APP inside raft clusters seems to be cleaved by <b>beta-secretase,</b> APP outside rafts undergoes cleavage by alpha-secretase. Thus, access of alpha- and <b>beta-secretase</b> to APP, and therefore Abeta generation, may be determined by dynamic interactions of APP with lipid rafts...|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) {{is a critical}} event {{in the formation of}} amyloid plaques which are composed of the 4 kDa amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Processing of APP occurs through a non-amyloidogenic pathway, mediated by initial alpha-secretase cleavage or through an amyloidogenic pathway via sequential cleavage by beta- and gamma-secretase enzymes, which produces Abeta peptides. Currently, the diagnosis of probable or possible Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) is primarily based on neuropsychological and neuroradiological assessment. Recent reports indicate that platelet <b>beta-secretase</b> activity is moderately increased in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To our knowledge platelet alpha-secretase activity has not yet been explored in this context and estimation of the ratio of the activities of alpha- and <b>beta-secretase</b> in platelets may represent a useful surrogate marker of the balance between the two pathways of APP metabolism and be of importance for the diagnosis of AD. We therefore considered it of interest to develop assays of platelet alpha- and <b>beta-secretase</b> activities suitable for such clinical investigations. Application of these assays to a Swedish population failed to uncover an effect of AD or MCI on individual platelet secretase activities or the secretase ratio.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by the degeneration and loss of neurons, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and the accumulation of extracellular senile plaques consisting mainly of beta- amyloid (A-beta). A-beta is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavage by proteases P- and gamma-secretase. Alternatively, APP may be cleaved within the A-beta region by alpha-secretase, preventing intact A-beta formation. Both the alpha- and <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavages result in the release of large soluble APP fragments called alpha- or beta-sAPP, respectively. The work presented in this thesis describes the processing and secretion of differentially cleaved APP. The purpose of the study were to investigate the <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage of APP. Paper 1 examined differentially cleaved APP as diagnostic markers for AD. It was concluded that soluble beta- secretase cleaved APP (beta-sAPP) levels in CSF do not change in AD, although soluble (alpha-secretase cleaved APP (alpha-sAPP) and total sAPP decreases. Paper 11 and 111 provided insights into the mechanisms of the alternative APP cleavages during apoptosis in two different cell systems. In a primary rat cortical culture system, calcium homeostasis and caspase actions proved to be important effectors of the <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage. Expression of the Arctic APP mutation in human neuroblastoma cells increased the vulnerability to cell death and modified beta-sAPP secretion, stressing the role of FAD mutations in apoptosis and APP processing. The localization and content of beta-sAPP in brain was explored in paper IV. Altered beta-sAPP staining pattems indicated abnormal processing and transport of APP in AD brain. In summary, (i) beta-sAPP in CSF, (ii) beta-sAPP secretion from apoptotic neurons and (iii) beta-sAPP in brain were analysed. The results indicated that altered processing and transport of APP takes place in AD and during apoptosis. Since APP processing is considered a key event in the pathological cascade leading to AD, the proteases that cleave APP and the regulation mechanisms of those proteases are prime therapeutic targets...|$|E

40|$|Aggregates of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) are {{the major}} {{component}} of the amyloid core of the senile plaques observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta results from the amyloidogenic processing of its precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), by beta- and gamma-secretase activities. If <b>beta-secretase</b> has recently been identified and termed BACE, the identity of gamma-secretase is still obscure. Studies with knock-out mice showed that presenilin 1 (PS 1), of which mutations {{are known to be}} the first cause of inherited AD, is mandatory for the gamma-secretase activity. However, the proteolytic activity of PS 1 remains a matter of debate. Here we used transfected Sf 9 insect cells, a cellular model lacking endogenous beta- and/or gamma-secretase activities, to characterize the role of BACE and PS 1 in the amyloidogenic processing of human APP. We show that, in Sf 9 cells, BACE performs the expected <b>beta-secretase</b> cleavage of APP, generating C 99. We also show that C 99, which is a substrate of gamma-secretase, tightly binds to the human PS 1. Despite this interaction, Sf 9 cells still do not produce Abeta.

40|$|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by amyloid plaques consisting of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. A beta is proteolytically derived from its precursor protein through cleavages by <b>beta-secretase</b> and <b>beta-secretase</b> complex comprising presenilins (PS, PS 1 /PS 2), nicastrin, APH- 1 and PEN- 2. PS 1 is also known to activate the PI 3 K/Akt cell survival pathway in ay-secretase-independent manner. The tumor suppressor PTEN, which antagonizes the PI 3 K/Akt pathway, has increasingly been recognized to {{play a key role}} in neural functions and its level found reduced in AD brains. Here, we demonstrate that the protein level of PTEN is dramatically reduced in cultured cells and embryonic tissues deficient in PS, and in the cortical neurons of PS 1 /PS 2 conditional double knockout mice. Restoration of PS in PS-deficient cells reverses the reduction of PTEN. Regulation of PTEN by PS is independent of the PS/gamma-secretase activity since impaired gamma-secretase by the gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment or due to nicastrin deficiency has little effect on the protein level of PTEN. Our data suggest an important role for PS in signaling pathways involving PI 3 K/Akt and PTEN that are crucial for physiological functions and the pathogenesis of multiple diseases.

40|$|As {{the main}} <b>beta-secretase</b> {{of the central}} nervous system, BACE- 1 is a key protein in the {{pathogenesis}} of Alzheimer's disease. Excessive expression of the protein might cause an overproduction of the neuro-toxic beta-amyloid peptide. Therefore, a tight regula-tion of BACE- 1 expression is expected in vivo. In addition to a possible transcriptional control, the BACE- 1 transcript leader contains features that might constitute mechanisms of translational regu-lation of protein expression. Moreover, recent work has revealed an increase of BACE- 1 protein and <b>beta-secretase</b> activity in some Alzheimer's disease patients, although a corresponding increase of tran-script has not been reported.

We also report an alternative splicing of the BACE- 1 transcript leader that reduces the number of upstream ATGs. Finally, we show that translation driven by the BACE- 1 transcript leader is increased in activated astrocytes independently of the splicing event, indicating yet another mechanism of transla-tional control.

Here, evidence for the noncoplanarity of the catalytic aspartates is provided by analysis of multiple explicit water molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of plasmepsin II, human <b>beta-secretase,</b> and HIV-protease. In the MD runs of plasmepsin II, the angle between the planes of the two carboxylates of the catalytic dyad is almost always in the range 60 degrees - 120 degrees, in agreement with the perpendicular orientation in the re-refined X-ray structure. The noncoplanar arrangement is prevalent also in the <b>beta-secretase</b> simulations, {{as well as in the}} runs with the inhibitor-bound proteases. Quantum-mechanics calculations provide further evidence that before catalysis the noncoplanar arrangement is favored energetically in eukaryotic aspartic proteases. Remarkably, the coplanar orientation of the catalytic dyad is observed in MD simulations of HIV-protease at 100 K but not at 300 K, which indicates that the noncoplanar arrangement is favored by conformational entropy.

40|$|A {{conclusive}} {{diagnosis of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{can be made}} only by correlating clinical findings and neuropathological studies of post-mortem tissues. Two leading neuropathological changes correlate with the diagnosis of AD: first, the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which accumulate in neuronal perikarya and are made of paired helical filaments (PHFs) containing the microtubule-associated protein tau; second, extracellular amyloid deposits {{in the form of}} diffuse or neuritic senile plaques which contain the amyloid peptide. In AD, NFTs can be easily visualized using antibodies recognizing the microtubule associated protein tau and are composed of bundles of PHFs. In the autopsy-derived AD brain, tau is hyperphosphorylated and more than 30 phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHF-tau proteins. The formation of NFTs is thought to be associated with a collapse of the microtubule network, disturbances of axoplasmic transports, synapse loss, neuritic atrophy, and neuronal death. Senile plaques are extracellular lesions which have been shown by electron micro-scopic studies to contain amyloid fibrils. Fibrils were isolated and a small 4. 2 kDa poly-peptide was purified from this material. The amyloid peptide found in amyloid deposits of AD is designated Abeta. Since the Abeta peptide is small and unlikely to be a primary translational product, it was predicted to arise from a larger precursor. In 1987, this amyloid peptide precursor (APP) was characterised from the analysis of a full-length cDNA encoding a primary translational product of 695 residues. This protein is synthetized by neurons as a 100 -kDa glycosylated transmembrane protein with a single membrane spanning domain. The use of cellular models has clearly identified two catabolic pathways for APP. A non amyloidogenic pathway, in which APP is cleaved by <b>beta-secretase</b> within the sequence of the amyloid peptide. This cleavage precludes the formation of the full-length Abeta found in the amyloid core of senile plaques. A second catabolic pathway of APP leads to the production of Abeta from its precursor. In this amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by <b>beta-secretase</b> at the N-terminus of Abeta. The C-terminal fragment of APP thus formed is in turn cleaved by <b>beta-secretase</b> to release the full-length amyloid peptide. In primary cultures of neurons over-expressing APP, the production of intraneuronal Abeta induces neuronal apoptosis. This neurotoxicity, which is not observed in epithelial cells, seems {{to be related to the}} formation of intraneuronal aggregates of Abeta 1 - 42. In AD, the specific inhibition of beta- or <b>beta-secretase</b> activities would decrease the production of Abeta from its precursor, in such a way that its relative concentration could be low enough to avoid the formation of aggregates. Molecules which can interact with Abeta in order to inhibit its aggregation are also being developed. Immunization against Abeta has also been tested in both animal models and clinical studies. Although these clinical studies had to be interrupted due to the development of T-lymphocyte meningoencephalitis in some patients, very preliminary results indicate that antibodies against Abeta slow cognitive decline in AD, and generate areas of neocortex devoid of senile plaques...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{pathology}} {{is characterized}} by beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Studies of autosomal dominant early-onset AD mutations suggest that beta-amyloid overproduction is sufficient to cause AD. Recently, the BACE gene, which encodes <b>beta-secretase,</b> the rate limiting enzyme in beta-amyloid formation, has been identified. Since this gene is a strong candidate gene for late-onset AD because of its function, we have characterized its genomic organization and identified two polymorphisms. Neither of these polymorphisms were associated with AD risk in genetic association studies comparing autopsy-confirmed late-onset AD cases and age-matched non-demented controls. Thus, we find no evidence that this locus influences risk for late-onset AD...|$|E
