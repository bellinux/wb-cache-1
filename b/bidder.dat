40|$|Abstract – In {{traditional}} auctions, it {{is often}} assumed that <b>bidders</b> are a homogenous group. However, since most online <b>bidders</b> are average consumers instead of professional <b>bidders,</b> we suspect that online <b>bidders</b> are a heterogeneous group. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the types of online <b>bidders</b> based on their real bidding behaviors in a popular auction site. A cluster analysis is employed and four types of online <b>bidders</b> are finally identified in a private value auction, namely, goal-driven <b>bidders,</b> experiential <b>bidders,</b> playful <b>bidders,</b> and opportunistic <b>bidders.</b> The profile and performance of each group are also discussed...|$|R

We {{find that a}} typical target is valued higher by strategic <b>bidders.</b> However, 22. 4 % of targets in our sample are valued higher by financial <b>bidders.</b> These are mature, poorly performing companies. We also find that (i) valuations of different strategic <b>bidders</b> are more dispersed and (ii) valuations of financial <b>bidders</b> are correlated with aggregate economic conditions. Our results suggest that different targets appeal to different types of <b>bidders,</b> rather than that strategic <b>bidders</b> always value targets more because of synergies...|$|R

I propose {{a model in}} which incremental bidding strategy arises out of equilibrium and weakly dominates proxy bidding strategy. When there is a 8 ̆ 5 xed ending time, late bidding can be a best response to some non-equilibrium strategies. Using the data collected from eBay auctions, I show that incremental <b>bidders</b> {{are more likely to}} win an item compared with proxy <b>bidders</b> and last-minute <b>bidders.</b> Incremental <b>bidders</b> who switch among auctions pay lower prices than proxy <b>bidders</b> and incremental <b>bidders</b> who stick to one auction. Further, the number of last-minute <b>bidders</b> decreases when there are more auctions running in parallel...|$|R
5|$|In the 2000s, Cloverleaf {{tried to}} sell Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested in the}} track, but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One <b>bidder</b> was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining <b>bidder</b> was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft was not one of the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling by the law. As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E

40|$|In a {{standard}} auction, <b>bidders</b> bid more aggressively {{when the number}} of <b>bidders</b> increases. However, Krishna and Rosenthal (1996, Games and Economic Behavior) show that when <b>bidders</b> have multiple-unit demand that generates positive synergies, <b>bidders</b> bid less aggressively as the number of <b>bidders</b> increases. The first objective {{of this paper is to}} offer experimental evidence on this seemingly counter-intuitive theoretical prediction. Following the model of Krishna and Rosenthal, we design a simultaneous second-price sealed-bid auction for two objects with two types of bidders: single-object and multiple-object demand <b>bidders.</b> Our results show that <b>bidders</b> bid less aggressively with increased competition. The second objective is to investigate the effect of offering global <b>bidders</b> the option of bidding for both objects as a package as well as submitting individual bids for each object. Controlling for bidders' valuations, we find that offering this option to global <b>bidders</b> increases allocative efficiency and sellers' revenue. ...|$|R

40|$|Electronic auctions have rapidly {{increased}} in popularity, but {{the consequences of}} switching to an electronic auction are unclear. In part this is because multiple changes occur {{at the same time}} so one can only observe the combined effect of these changes and not the effect of each separate change. For instance, electronic <b>bidders</b> face lower transaction costs, but also have less information about product quality and {{about the state of the}} market such as the number of <b>bidders.</b> In this paper, we report a study of bidding behavior at a large Dutch flower auction in which we are able to separate some of these effects. We compare electronic <b>bidders</b> with traditional <b>bidders</b> and when correcting for quality differences and seasonal effects, we find that they to bid lower on average than traditional buyers, as predicted by Bakos (1991, 1997). The electronic <b>bidders</b> were divided in two subgroups, internal <b>bidders</b> and external <b>bidders.</b> The external <b>bidders</b> had less product quality information and market state information than the internal <b>bidders.</b> This led the external <b>bidders</b> to not only bid significantly higher than the internal <b>bidders,</b> but in fact as high as the traditional <b>bidders.</b> Both these effects run counter to theoretical predictions and some possible alternative explanations are offered. In general, it highlights the importance of focusing the information flows that occur in a market. transaction costs;electronic auctions;market state information;product quality information...|$|R
5|$|Plans {{to build}} an {{interchange}} connecting to {{the north end of}} I-476 (the Blue Route) were made; the turnpike commission approved a contract to build the interchange in March 1989. That June, a losing <b>bidder</b> decided to challenge the turnpike commission, saying it violated female and minority contracting rules regarding the percentage of these employees that were used for the project. Under this rule, bidders were supposed to have at least 12 percent of contracts to minority-owned companies and at least 4 percent to female-owned companies. The losing <b>bidder</b> had 12.4 percent of the contracts to minority companies and 4.2 percent to female-owned companies while the winning <b>bidder</b> had 6.1 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. The turnpike commission decided to rebid the contract, but was sued by the original contractor. This dispute delayed the construction of the interchange. The contract was rebid in November 1989 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court permitted it. The interchange between I-476 and the turnpike mainline was completed in November 1992; the ramps to the Northeast Extension opened a month later. An official ribbon-cutting took place on December 15, 1992.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{estimate}} was passed within {{seconds of the}} auction opening. Six bidders pushed the price towards a million pounds and Tullie House was forced to drop out at £1.7 million. Two remaining bidders took the bid past £2 million; the winning <b>bidder,</b> an anonymous UK resident and fine art collector bidding by phone, paid a total of £2,330,468.75 including the buyer's premium and VAT. The outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the Treasure Act to be revised, though British Archaeology noted that {{the circumstances of the}} helmet's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act. It is still possible that the helmet could come into public ownership; if the winning <b>bidder</b> wishes to export it, an export licence would have to be applied for and if a temporary export bar was placed on it an opportunity could arise for funds to be raised by a public institution to purchase the helmet.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{existence}} of monotone equilibrium in first price auctions where <b>bidders</b> have a three-dimensional private type, i. e. their private values, degrees of risk aversion and initial wealth. Bidders' utility functions belong to the class of constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) or constant absolute risk aversion (CARA). The bidders' types are independent across <b>bidders,</b> while a <b>bidder's</b> private value, initial wealth and degree of risk aversion are allowed to be correlated. We show that a monotone equilibrium always exists in a general setting allowing for asymmetric <b>bidders.</b> Moreover, with symmetric <b>bidders,</b> a symmetric monotone equilibrium strategy must exist. A <b>bidder's</b> equilibrium strategy increases with bidders' private values and degrees of risk aversion.

First, we fully characterize the optimal auction in this non standard environment and in a very general set-up. We find that when informed <b>bidders</b> reveal “bad news” {{about the value of}} the good, the seller optimally awards the object to the uninformed <b>bidders.</b> Secondly, we show that the seller is better off in presence of uninformed <b>bidders</b> because this allows to lower the informational rents paid to the informed <b>bidders.</b> Last, we find that, with bi-lateral risk neutrality, the seller always awards the good to the uninformed <b>bidders</b> thereby keeping all the surplus.
