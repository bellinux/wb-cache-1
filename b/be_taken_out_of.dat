5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{foundations}} {{are located in}} confined spots adjacent to I-66 and the electrified third rail of the Orange Line, making access difficult. Dulles Transit Partners offered to inspect seven foundations that were easily accessible, but the FTA insisted that all foundations be tested. Dulles Transit Partners and MWAA agreed to test all foundations before the bridge piers were built upon them. This required {{the portion of the}} Orange Line between the West Falls Church and East Falls Church Metro stations to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service on weekends while the tests were conducted. The foundations were acceptable and the bridge construction proceeded using the existing foundations.|$|E

5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing {{the replacement of the}} bearings on all units within days.|$|E
5|$|With {{crew members}} and stevedores abandoning ship, it was {{realised}} by the dock authorities {{that there was}} a problem on board Fort Stikine. A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more fire engines to be sent for. Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre, initially only two engines were sent. Those on board Fort Stikine were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured blindly into the hold. With the arrival of the two fire appliances, there were now eleven hoses in use. Captain Oberst, of the Indian Army Ordnance Corps arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation. He {{was in charge of the}} explosives only after they had been landed. A meeting was held on board between the ship's officers, Oberst, and Commander Longmore of the Royal Indian Navy, the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay. It was stated by Oberst that Fort Stikine had explosives equivalent to 150 Blockbuster bombs on board and that the ship should be scuttled. Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded, but he doubted that the ship would sink in that condition. More fire appliances arrived, bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32. by 14:45, ammunition in № 2 hold was exploding. Colonel Sadler, the General Manager of the docks at Bombay, was sent for. He arrived at 14:50 and suggested that Fort Stikine should be removed from the docks, which would have required the use of tugs due to Fort Stikine being disabled. An argument developed and Colonel Sadler's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> port.|$|E

25|$|Catan: Oil Springs is an {{expansion}} by Erik Assadourian and Ty Hansen introduced in 2011 designed {{to draw attention}} to environmental issues. It is offered as a free download or for purchase from the Mayfair Games website. The scenario adds oil fields {{that can be used to}} make other resources and develop metropolises, but disasters can strike if too much oil is used. Oil can also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game, for victory points and to prevent disasters.|$|E

Once the SCRIP project is finished, the run-through tracks and tracks 13–14 will be in regular use (track 15 will be used for storage), resulting in a 40% increase in track capacity.|$|E

25|$|Under {{automatic}} operation, the on-train computer instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service until the fault is mended by technicians. If the whole TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track circuit system. The signals and track circuits only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E
