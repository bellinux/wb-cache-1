25|$|At {{the same}} time as the release of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V·Spec, Nissan {{released}} the R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 model. Changes made in the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, rear wiper, and <b>boot</b> <b>carpet.</b> The R33 GT-R V·Spec N1 received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine.|$|E
500|$|The chassis {{platform}} {{used for}} the C3 Picasso is {{a modified version of}} that in the Citroën C3 and the Peugeot 207, giving it a comparable wheelbase. The reuse of automobile platforms is commonplace, especially for Citroën because the Trnava plant builds the Peugeot 207 and the C3 Picasso. The parent company PSA Peugeot Citroën pools resources and manufacturing for some vehicles, and sometimes rebadges vehicles, combining design teams between two or more brands to create a shared product. The advantage is the designing and testing vehicles at a reduced cost for the participating brands, but creates multiple, identical-looking vehicles for the market, sometimes with minor styling differences. Examples include: the Fiat Scudo, Peugeot Expert and Citroën Dispatch, the Toyota Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1, and the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo. Citroën placed a contractual obligation on the manufacturers to use green materials for the C3 Picasso range. These comprise ≥11% of the [...] of polymers on the vehicle, including the mudguards, parcel shelf and <b>boot</b> <b>carpet.</b> Citroën recommends the vehicle is serviced at least every two years, or at every [...] for petrol models and [...] for the HDi diesel models.|$|E
2500|$|The Skyline GT-R 'N1' model (identified by {{the model}} code suffix [...] "ZN"), was {{introduced}} on 19 July 1991, and designed for home-market N1 racing {{with a total}} of 245 units eventually produced (118 of these are 'N1', 64 are 'V·Spec N1', and 63 are 'V·Spec II N1' - see below explanation of 'V.spec'). The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the 'Nismo' car's specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for 'N1' the air conditioning, sound system, and <b>boot</b> <b>carpet</b> were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. 'N1' cars also had reinforcing for the brake master cylinder and additional brake cooling ducts under the car. All 'N1' cars were delivered with a thin layer of colour code 326 [...] "Crystal White" [...] paint.|$|E

50|$|The Aircross {{features}} an upholstered fabric interior, with corduroy or leather options. The engine supports {{are designed to}} collapse downwards slightly in a front-end impact to prevent the engine from invading the cabin and injuring passengers. The C3 Aircross SX and Exclusive models have ABS, {{one of the few}} vehicles on sale in the Brazilian market with this feature. The C3 Aircross was designed with an obligation for green materials to be used where viable. 20 kg of the vehicle's polymers, include the parcel shelf, <b>boot</b> <b>carpet,</b> and partial use in the doors, are from natural fibres to meet this target.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} home to the Giltbrook Retail Park which has been {{developed}} due to the presence and popularity of IKEA, Decathlon and a Next store. In 2009-10 a whole retail park was built on the land next to IKEA, including Pets at home, Laura Ashley, Comet, BHS, <b>Boots,</b> and <b>Carpet</b> Right. Comet has now ceased trading, and been replaced by TK Maxx.|$|R
50|$|Automodello {{vehicles}} are finely detailed, especially their 1:8 scale reproductions which can cost thousands of dollars. Still, even their smaller offerings are intricate. The Cunningham C-3, for example, can be displayed with soft top or top <b>boot.</b> Its <b>carpet</b> is flocked and wire wheels have deeply laser cut spokes (McCourt 2014a, p. 16). Only 154 of the Cunninghams {{were made by}} Automodello.

50|$|While being {{questioned}} by police, Simms came under suspicion {{when he became}} extremely nervous. His car was impounded, and forensic scientists found traces of Helen's blood: spots {{of blood on the}} rubber sill of the boot and a bloodstain on the <b>boot</b> <b>carpet.</b> In the boot they also found an opal and pearl earring, later identified by Marie McCourt as one of a pair Helen had been given for her 21st birthday; she had been wearing the earrings on the day she vanished. Traces of her blood were also found in Simm's flat: on the carpet {{at the foot of the}} stairs leading to his apartment, on a bedroom carpet in his flat, on wallpaper in the bedroom, and splashed on wallpaper next to the outside door to Simm's accommodation, where police believe she was first attacked. In March, Helen's handbag, taupe coat, maroon scarf, navy trousers and green mittens were found on a riverbank in Irlam, about 20 miles away, in a black binliner proved to have been taken from a roll of them in Simms's pub. Fibres from trousers Helen wore for the first time on the morning of her disappearance were found on the stair carpet, landing carpet, and bedroom carpet of Simms' flat, indicating she was dragged upstairs after being attacked by him. A witness working in the pub's restaurant testified she heard dragging noises from above her during the time of the murder. Also found with her clothing was a length of electrical flex. This was similar to other lengths of flex found in Simm's flat, which he used in playing with his two dogs. The flex found at Irlam had dog toothmarks on it that were matched to Simm's dogs; it also had strands of human hair adhering to it that were matched to hairs from Helen McCourt's hair rollers. Police believe the flex was used to strangle her.|$|E
60|$|As he {{read the}} fatal figures, a mist swam before his eyes,--a sort of faintness came over him. It seemed {{for a moment as}} if his very life was sinking down through his <b>boots</b> into the <b>carpet.</b> He threw down the book hastily, and, turning, stepped through an open window into the garden, and walked quickly off.|$|R
50|$|The MkI Rialto {{series was}} {{available}} in three separate body styles: saloon, estate and van. The range consisted of basic specification with a vinyl interior and could be ordered {{with a list of}} choice optional extras, or GLS specification which came with a clock, FM/AM radio, voltage gauge, cloth covered seats with extra matching cloth covered areas on the interior, extra thick carpets with a <b>carpeted</b> <b>boot</b> area, GLS decals, leather steering wheel, spare wheel and radial tyres. All cars had a dark green dash with dark grey door cards.|$|R
6000|$|This fairy's gift {{would have}} pleased the queen, {{if she had}} {{believed}} in it, more than anything else, {{because she was so}} clever herself. But she took no notice at all; and the fairies went each to her own country, and none of them stayed there at the palace, where nobody believed in them, except the king, a little. But the queen tossed all their nice <b>boots</b> and caps, <b>carpets,</b> purses, swords, and all, away into a dark lumber-room; for, of course, she thought that they were all nonsense, and merely old rubbish out of books, or pantomime [...] "properties." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{they made}} the exclamation, the general, attired in full uniform for a ball, came darting in with such precipitancy that, {{hitching}} his <b>boot</b> in the <b>carpet,</b> and getting his sword between his legs, he came down headlong, and presented a curious little bald place on the crown of {{his head to the}} eyes of the astonished company. Nor was this the worst of it; for being rather corpulent and very tight, the general being down, could not get up again, but lay there writhing and doing such things with his boots, as there is no other instance of in military history.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a special}} version of the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Phantom Coupé, and Phantom Drophead Coupé for the Abu Dhabi market, built by Abu Dhabi Motors.

5000|$|GR Profile: 1294cc G1A, five doors. Intended as {{competition}} for such cars as the Austin Maestro HLE, the GR Profile used {{exactly the same}} G1A engine as the lower models in the range, but combined it with subtle aerodynamic improvements and lower rolling resistance tyres to reduce the drag coefficient of the car, with the brochure claiming a fuel economy improvement of 3 miles per gallon at a constant 75 mi/h km/h. The standard equipment list included an instrument lighting rheostat, a digital clock, an engine compartment undershield, a glovebox lamp, a <b>carpeted</b> <b>boot</b> and a boot light. Options included metallic paint, central locking, electric windows, and central locking. It was discontinued sometime in 1988, at {{about the time of}} the introduction of the GLX.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, TVR {{announced}} that the Griffith production was going to end. A limited edition run of 100 Special Edition (SE) cars were to be built to {{mark the end of}} production. Although still very similar to the previous Griffith 500 model, the SE had a hybrid interior using the Chimaera dashboard and Cerbera seats. Noticeably, the rear lights were different along with different door mirrors, higher powered headlights and clear indicator lenses. Some also came with 16-inch wheels. Each car came with a numbered plaque in the glove box including the build number and a Special Edition Badge on its boot. All cars also had a unique signature in the <b>boot</b> under the <b>carpet.</b> The SEs were built between 2000 and 2002, with the last registered in 2003. A register of the last 100 SEs can be found at TVR Griffith 500 SE Register.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 the 164 {{received}} a facelift including new rear and side lamps, a new grille and front bumper, new flush-mounted lift-type exterior door handles, new wing mirrors, {{and a new}} instrument cluster and dashboard which included air ducts. In 1974 the vent wings were eliminated from the front doors, and the 164 {{became one of the}} earliest cars to offer heated seats. A limited edition of the 164, the 164TE was made only in 1974 and only for 3 markets, Great Britain, Germany and Australia. The 164TE had extra accessories fitted as standard, being air conditioning, 4 speaker 8 track player with radio, headlight wipe/wash system, rear head rests and rear reading lamps and a fully <b>carpeted</b> <b>boot</b> with lighting. This more upmarket version was only available in 3 colours, being metallic light blue (colour 111), metallic copper (colour 105) and metallic teal (colour 115).|$|R
40|$|A nuclear {{disaster}} will not hit {{at the speed}} of a glacier melting. It will hit with a blast. It will not hit with the speed of the atmosphere warming but of a city burning. Clearly, the attention focused on nuclear weapons should be as prominent as that of global climate change. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California 20071 The threats to our planet – of climate change, poverty and war – can only be overcome by nations and the global com-munity working in cooperation – something not possible while nations maintain large and expensive militaries and threaten to destroy each other. Co-Presidents, Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, 20082 In the 1980 s nuclear weapons were one of the key is-sue occupying media, public and political attention. Those of us who were also warning about threats to human survival from climate change were ignored. A huge blanket of complacency smothered the climate-change issue. Today, the situation is the reverse. Cli-mate change is {{in the front seat of}} the global political vehicle and nuclear weapons are hidden away, forgot-ten under the <b>carpet</b> in the <b>boot.</b> The <b>carpet</b> of complacency over nuclear weapons is hard to fathom. There are more nuclear-armed States now than in the 1980 s. The possibility of non-State actors (terrorists) acquiring a nuclear explosive device (or manufacturing a crude one) is greater than ever before. There are both hot and simmering conflicts between nuclear-armed States and potential nuclear States, particularly in the Middle East and North-East Asia. Nuclear stockpiles remain sufficient to destroy the world many times over. Thousands of nuclear weapons are still on high alert, ready to be fired within minutes. Use of even a small fraction of nuclear weapons would create catastrophic climatic consequences that would dwarf those produced by carbon emissions. The Climate-Nuclear Nexus, a project of th...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} CH Series Chrysler {{was introduced}} in November 1971 replacing the Chrysler VIP as Chrysler’s competitor to the Ford Fairlane and the Statesman in the Australian prestige car market. It was offered in four-door Sedan and two-door Hardtop models. The Chrysler {{was based on the}} VH series Chrysler Valiant, utilizing the floorpan of the two-door Hardtop version. The 115 in wheelbase of the Chrysler was identical to that of the Valiant Hardtop and 4 in longer than that used on the Valiant Sedan. The Chrysler also differed significantly from the Valiant in external appearance, featuring a four headlight grille encircled by a chrome surround and a unique wrap-around horizontal tail-light assembly. The frontal styling was highly reminiscent of the 1971 US Dodge Coronet. A long list of standard luxury equipment items set the Chrysler further apart from the Valiant and included front disc brakes, power assisted steering, a push button radio with power antenna, a <b>carpeted</b> <b>boot,</b> tinted power operated windows and courtesy lighting which included adjustable reading lights for rear passengers. Considerable attention had also been taken to reduce Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) with the application of additional soundproofing material.|$|R
