40|$|AbstractThe {{pros and}} cons of various types of biomass dryers have been {{documented}} in this paper. Using dry biomass significantly reduces the cost of handling, transportation and pyrolysis. The main choices for drying biomass are rotary dryers, flash <b>dryers,</b> stationery <b>bed</b> <b>dryers</b> and fluidised <b>bed</b> <b>dryers.</b> The drying medium can be hot air, hot air mixed with steam, and/or superheated steam. A typical example for wood chip drying using a financial model is described, including the environmental performance. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions have been estimated for drying biomass. From this study, it is evident that increasing temperature will decrease drying time and increase throughput but not necessarily decrease the drying cost. This is due to higher energy use and higher cost of capital inputs such as loading/unloading and heat plant. Thus, low drying temperature can be used if throughput is not a key issue for an operation. The global warming potential of the biomass drying process 9. 2 kg CO 2 -e/t of oven-dry biomass. This assumes that wood waste is used as fuel and drying is on a moving belt dryer. If this dry biomass is used in a power station as fuel for steam boiler, there is a significant reduction potential of CO 2 emission from a typical black coal-fired power plant due to fuel switching. This assumes that trees are planted to produce this biomass sustainably. Environmental impacts of any dryer type should be considered for selection in addition to its traditional techno-economic performance...|$|R

40|$|Design {{and study}} of {{operational}} performance of convective industrial dryers are a strong indicator {{in the last}} stages of the selection procedure.

40|$|Fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>dryers</b> (FBDs) {{are used}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry to remove excess moisture from granule prior to tablet formation. As granule moisture content is reduced from its initial to final state, the velocity required to fully fluidize the granule decreases and the bed voidage decreases. The change in these fluidization properties are attributed to the decrease in the interparticle force load created by a reduction in liquid bridging as moisture is removed. During constant velocity drying, these fluidization properties result in a bubbling fluidization state, which evolves into a bubble coalescing regime as drying proceeds. This behaviour was identifiable using pressure fluctuation time-series analysis techniques. Distributor design studies using dry and wet granule in a conical fluidized bed suggest that the punched plate design limits bubble coalescence when compared to the perforated plate and Dutch weave mesh designs. Furthermore, the Dutch weave results in extensive segregation, which is undesirable from a fluidization perspective. Local drying hydrodynamic measurements using x-ray densitometry found that the punched and perforated plates generate a centralized bubbling core region during drying with a defluidized bed periphery. This fluidized core region grows as drying proceeds until the defluidized region disappears. Under the same operating conditions, a porous plate distributor creates extensive channelling and defluidization across the entire bed cross-section during the constant rate period of drying. These poor fluidization characteristics are a result of the porous plate introducing the gas into the bed as a fine dispersion. Lastly, the hydrodynamics associated with the conical vessel geometry improves the circulation and mixing patterns in fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>dryers.</b> This is especially the case in the entry region of the conical bed where the high inlet gas velocity prevents defluidization around the periphery of the bed. The straight walled geometry of the cylindrical bed resulted in defluidization in this area. As a result, the hydrodynamics associated with bubbling differ significantly between the geometries over the course of drying...|$|R

50|$|By the 18th century, salt-making {{technology}} {{was introduced in}} the locality using solar <b>bed</b> <b>dryers.</b> Over time, hundreds of hectares surrounding the old town were converted into salt beds. Later, clay tiles or gibak were brought down from Vigan to line the salt beds. This prevented the salt from coming into contact with the earthen ground.

However, the proposal was turned down due to incapability of the agency to provide technology needed for the job. She also had acquaintances from salt-making experts in a forum held at Pangasinan State University.
