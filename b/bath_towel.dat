25|$|Faint bloodstains in {{the main}} hallway of the {{apartment}} indicate {{at least one of}} the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked <b>bath</b> <b>towel</b> and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom. The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing. Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two machetes from the apartment, but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.|$|E
500|$|Aurora is {{voiced by}} American singer Mary Costa, who was 22 {{years old when}} she was cast as the {{character}} in 1952. Costa had grown up a fan of Disney films, the first of which she saw was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. As a child, Costa adored the film so much that she would imitate Snow White by parading around her house wearing a <b>bath</b> <b>towel</b> as a makeshift cape. Costa referred to her garnering the role of Aurora as simply a case of [...] "being {{in the right place at}} the right time." [...] The filmmakers had long been struggling to cast Aurora, having been searching for the right voice for the character for three years. Disney himself had been preparing to shelve the project less they find a suitable voice actress; he strongly believed that the same person should provide both the character's speaking and singing voices. Costa was attending a dinner party for the entertainment industry, to which she had been invited by a friend who was hoping to introduce her to influential people, where she performed the popular standard [...] "When I Fall in Love". The performance was heard by film composer Walter Schumann who, impressed by her vocals, approached Costa about possibly voicing Aurora and inviting her to audition the following morning. Despite her doubts that she would actually be cast, Costa agreed to audition mostly because she wanted to meet Walt Disney. Upon arriving at the studio the next day, composer George Bruns welcomed Costa by asking her to perform a bird call, which she did successfully. However, being from Knoxville, Tennessee, Costa's strong southern accent nearly prevented her from being cast until she proved that she could sustain a fake British accent for the entire film. The filmmakers likened the situation to English actress Vivien Leigh successfully feigning a southern accent for her role as Scarlet O'Hara in the film Gone With the Wind (1939). Within hours of her audition, Walt Disney himself contacted Costa via telephone to offer her the job, which she immediately accepted.|$|E

60|$|Somehow {{we forced}} that door open; {{it was not}} easy because it had jammed. Within the cabin, hanging {{on either side of the}} <b>bath</b> <b>towel</b> which had stood the strain nobly, {{something}} like a damp garment over a linen line, was Bastin most of whose bunk seemed to have disappeared.

"He had a {{peculiarity}} which I {{have noticed}} {{in a good}} many other men, that though he was always playing tricks with his own health, he was none the less very anxious about it, and was extremely fidgety if ever he had any trivial symptom. Being a tough, open-air fellow, who was always as hard as a nail, it was seldom that there was anything amiss with him; but at last the drink began to tell, and he woke one morning with his hands shaking and all his nerves tingling like over-stretched fiddle-strings. He had been dining at some very wet house the night before, and the wine had, perhaps, been more plentiful than choice; at any rate, there he was, with a tongue like a <b>bath</b> <b>towel</b> and a head that ticked like an eight-day clock.

60|$|At {{last the}} {{electric}} light really went out. I {{had looked at}} my watch just before this happened and wound it up, which, Bickley remarked, was superfluous and a waste of energy. It then marked 3.20 in the morning. We had wedged Bastin, who was now snoring comfortably, into his berth, with pillows, and managed to tie a cord over him--no, it was a large <b>bath</b> <b>towel,</b> fixing one end of it to the little rack over his bed and the other to its framework. As for ourselves, we lay down on the floor between the table legs, which, of course, were screwed, and the settee, protecting ourselves as best we were able by help of the cushions, etc., between two of which we thrust the terrified Tommy who had been sliding up and down the cabin floor. Thus we remained, expecting death every moment till the light of day, a very dim light, struggling through a port-hole of which the iron cover had somehow been wrenched off. Or perhaps it was never shut, I do not remember.|$|E

[...] "Take round bath towels," [...] he said; and presently the men behind us were offering--with inflexible dignity--"Port wine, Sir. <b>Bath</b> <b>towel,</b> Sir!" [...] Waulsort, with streaks of blackened water on his forehead, was suddenly reminded of a wet year when he had followed the French army manoeuvres. An animated dispute sprang up between him and Neal about the relative efficiency of the new French and German field guns. Wrassleton joined in and a little drunken shrivelled Oxford don of some sort with a black-splashed shirt front who presently silenced them all by the immensity and particularity of his knowledge of field artillery. Then the talk drifted to Sedan and the effect of dead horses upon drinking-water, which brought Wrassleton and Weston Massinghay into a dispute of great vigour and emphasis. [...] "The trouble in South Africa," [...] said Weston Massinghay, [...] "wasn't that we didn't boil our water. It was that we didn't boil our men. The Boers drank the same stuff we did. THEY didn't get dysentery." ...|$|E
