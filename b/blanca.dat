5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} {{near the center}} of <b>Blanca</b> occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds were not considered to be representative of the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and <b>Blanca</b> degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of <b>Blanca</b> maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of <b>Blanca</b> dissipated over open waters.|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with <b>Blanca</b> had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed <b>Blanca</b> to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Blanca</b> was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in Baja California in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May31, <b>Blanca</b> initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, <b>Blanca</b> rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. <b>Blanca</b> gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.|$|E

The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity.

5|$|The Barranca <b>Blanca</b> and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from Volcán Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya.

The Barranca <b>Blanca</b> ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice. The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca <b>Blanca</b> ignimbrite. It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Two-E {{formed from}} a broad area of low {{pressure}} on June 9. Six hours later the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm <b>Blanca.</b> This system developed a good outflow, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h). However, its circulation was not well-defined and a weakening trend began, and <b>Blanca</b> was downgraded to a depression on June 12. It lost its closed circulation shortly thereafter and was thus declared dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Blanca</b> {{remained}} {{far from}} Jalisco, large swells and rip currents {{produced by the}} hurricane claimed four lives. In Northwestern Mexico, watches and warnings were raised prior to the storm's landfall. <b>Blanca</b> caused generally light damage in the region, consisting of downed trees and power lines. Remnant moisture from the system spread across the Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, washing out roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Blanca</b> was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone during the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Forming {{out of a}} trough of low pressure on July6, <b>Blanca</b> was immediately classified a tropical storm roughly 420mi (675km) south-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. Later that day, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) as deep convection persisted around the center of circulation. Shortly after, the system began to weaken. Intermittent bursts of convection occurred on July7 before <b>Blanca</b> weakened to a tropical depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure system, devoid of shower and thunderstorms. The remnants were monitored by the National Hurricane Center for another day. Although the storm did not impact land as a tropical cyclone, its remnants produced unseasonable rains in southern California and moisture from the system contributed to flooding in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} {{a tropical}} storm, <b>Blanca</b> had already developed an eye-feature, though it {{not expected to}} develop into a hurricane. The storm maintained a general northwestward track throughout its existence due to a mid-level ridge well {{to the west of}} the circulation. Shortly after, a central dense overcast, a large area of deep convection, developed over the center of circulation and large banding features developed along the periphery of the cyclone. Late on July6, <b>Blanca</b> reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Although the storm had intensified, its overall structure had deteriorated, with cloud tops warming and convection shrinking.|$|E

Merwin visited La <b>Blanca</b> in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac-Ha. At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a brief description of the acropolis.|$|E
