5000|$|The gallery's {{most famous}} exhibition, War Babies, ran from May 29, 1961 to June 17, 1961. [...] It showed {{the work of}} Goode, Bell, Ed Bereal, and Ron Miyashiro, {{all of whom were}} born in the late 1930s and {{experienced}} World War II in their early childhood. [...] According to Hopkins, [...] "the exhibition title was selected by Goode to establish a birth point in time and to indicate a sense of post-war internationalism." [...] War Babies was one of the earliest racially integrated exhibitions and [...] "was a daring challenge to the prevailing norms and mores of postwar America and its underlying racial stereotypes and identity politics." [...] The participating artists played off the work of the nearby Ferus artists. [...] Goode contributed thickly painted images of stars along with a cardboard <b>box</b> <b>nailed</b> to the gallery wall, Miyashiro contributed paintings suggestive of sinister eroticism, Bereal contributed leather pouches that stank of oil, and Bell contributed a [...] "saddle painting". The mix of styles present in the exhibition was indicative of the fluidity of the Los Angeles art scene in the early 1960s.|$|R

With two quick outs in the home half of seventh and Florida down by one, sophomore Megan Bush stepped into the batter's <b>box</b> and <b>nailed</b> the scoreboard in left center with her 2-2 pitch, sending the game into extra innings.|$|R

50|$|In a {{competitive}} market, with many advertisers and many publications, defined prices and bid-based prices {{are likely to}} converge on the generally accepted value of an advertising action. This presumably reflects the expected sale value and the profit that will result from the sale. An item like a hotel room or airplane seat that loses all value if not sold may be priced at a higher ratio of sale value than an item like a bag of sand or <b>box</b> of <b>nails</b> that will retain its value over time.|$|R

D. <b>box</b> <b>nailed</b> to a pine trunk, these indicated that civilization still existed, but they were only melancholy blurs. She was in a cold enchantment. All of her was dead save the ability to keep on driving, forever, with no hope of the tedium ending. She was bewildered. She passed six times {{what seemed to be}} precisely the same forest clearing, always with the road on a tiny ridge {{to the left of the}} clearing, always with a darkness-stilled house at one end and always, in the pasture at the other end, a horse which neighed. She was in a panorama stage-scene; things moved steadily by her, there was a sound of the engine, and a sensation of steering, but she was forever in the same place, among the same pines, with the same scowling blackness between their bare clean trunks. Only the road ahead was clear: a one-way track, the foot-high earthy bank and the pine-roots beside it, two distinct ruts, and a roughening of strewn brown bark and pine-needles, which, in the beating light of the car's lamps, made the sandy road scabrous with little incessant shadows.|$|R
60|$|At {{one side}} of the room stood an escritoire, and from a lower drawer therein he took out a small <b>box</b> tightly <b>nailed</b> down. He forced the cover with the poker. The box {{contained}} a variety of odds and ends, which Pierston had thrown into it from time to time in past years for future sorting--an intention that he had never carried out. From the melancholy mass of papers, faded photographs, seals, diaries, withered flowers, and such like, Jocelyn drew a little portrait, one taken on glass in the primitive days of photography, and framed with tinsel in the commonest way.|$|R

50|$|Jawa 250 type 559 (known popularly as Panelk) was a {{standard}} motorcycle made by Jawa Motors from 1962 to 1974. It {{was preceded by}} the Jawa 250/353, and its successor was the Jawa 250/592. This was the first 250 cc model to be called Panelka. The Panelka series had the headlamp top nacelle stretched {{to the end of}} the handlebar with an oval speedometer instead of a circular speedometer on the headlamp top nacelle. For better security, the FAB switch box was used, whereas in the previous models a PAL switch <b>box</b> with <b>nail</b> type keys were being used.

50|$|When {{carpenters}} used to {{make their}} own mitre boxes, it was common to use a mitre box until its guide slots became worn and then make a new one out of scrap timber. There is still a case to be made for making one today; for example, if an odd size (say, 175mm) cornice is to be fixed, then a custom mitre box with a bottom board that is 175mm wide would ensure that the cornice sits true while the cuts are being made to it. The three pieces of timber that form the mitre <b>box</b> are <b>nailed</b> together, and the top steadying pieces are fixed with smaller panel pins. The angles are marked (at any angle, not necessarily 45 degrees) and the guide slots are cut with the same saw that will be used {{for the rest of the}} cutting.|$|R
