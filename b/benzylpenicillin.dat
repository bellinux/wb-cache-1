5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, <b>benzylpenicillin</b> sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
25|$|Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable {{than many}} other {{penicillins}} and can be given orally, in addition to parenteral routes. However, like methicillin, it is less potent than <b>benzylpenicillin</b> against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|People with {{positive}} cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes {{should be treated}} with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. The use of antibiotics will not alter cardiac involvement {{in the development of}} rheumatic fever. Some suggest the use of benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{diphtheria}} {{vaccine is}} effective for prevention and {{available in a}} number of formulations. Three or four doses, given along with tetanus vaccine and pertussis vaccine, are recommended during childhood. Further doses are recommended every ten years. Protection can be verified by measuring the antitoxin level in the blood. Treatment is with the antibiotics erythromycin or <b>benzylpenicillin.</b> These antibiotics may also be used for prevention in those who have been exposed to the infection. A surgical procedure known as a tracheotomy is sometimes needed to open the airway in severe cases.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Alexander Fleming [...] (6 August 1881 – 11 March 1955) was a Scottish physician, microbiologist, {{pharmacologist}} and botanist. His best-known discoveries are {{the enzyme}} lysozyme in 1923 and the world's first antibiotic substance <b>benzylpenicillin</b> (Penicillin G) from the mould Penicillium notatum in 1928, {{for which he}} shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain. He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, {{the use of}} {{vancomycin}} monotherapy {{was clearly}} documented in only three of 82 available cases in the literature. Prospective and retrospective studies attempting to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity have largely been methodologically flawed and have produced variable results. The most methodologically sound investigations indicate [...] the actual incidence of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is around 5% to 7%. To put this into context, similar rates of renal dysfunction have been reported for cefamandole and <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> two reputedly non-nephrotoxic antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|Pain and {{inflammation}} at {{the injection}} site is also common for parenterally administered benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> and, {{to a lesser}} extent, procaine <b>benzylpenicillin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "penicillin" [...] {{is often}} used generically to refer to <b>benzylpenicillin</b> (penicillin G, the {{original}} penicillin found in 1928), procaine <b>benzylpenicillin</b> (procaine penicillin), benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin</b> (benzathine penicillin), and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V). Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin have the same antibacterial activity as <b>benzylpenicillin</b> but act {{for a longer period}} of time. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is less active against gram-negative bacteria than <b>benzylpenicillin.</b> <b>Benzylpenicillin,</b> procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin can be given by intravenous or intramuscular injections, but phenoxymethylpenicillin can be given by mouth because of its acidic stability.|$|E
50|$|Penamecillin, an acetoxymethyl ester of <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> is a prodrug {{processed}} to <b>benzylpenicillin</b> by esterases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzyl{{penicillin}},</b> {{also known}} as penicillin G, is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. This includes pneumonia, strep throat, syphilis, necrotizing enterocolitis, diphtheria, gas gangrene, leptospirosis, cellulitis, and tetanus. It is not a first-line agent for pneumococcal meningitis. <b>Benzylpenicillin</b> is given by injection into a vein or muscle. Two long acting forms benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin</b> and procaine <b>benzylpenicillin</b> are available for use by injection into a muscle.|$|E
50|$|It is less {{active than}} <b>benzylpenicillin</b> (penicillin G) against Gram-negative bacteria. Phenoxymethylpenicillin has {{a range of}} {{antimicrobial}} activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{that is similar to}} that of <b>benzylpenicillin</b> and a similar mode of action, but it is substantially less active than <b>benzylpenicillin</b> against Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a form}} of {{penicillin}} {{which is}} a combination of <b>benzylpenicillin</b> and the local anaesthetic agent procaine. Following deep intramuscular injection, it is slowly absorbed into the circulation and hydrolysed to <b>benzylpenicillin</b> — thus it is used where prolonged low concentrations of <b>benzylpenicillin</b> are required.|$|E

50|$|The {{treatment}} of choice is a single dose of benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin</b> given by intramuscular injection, or a five-day to one-week course of either oral penicillin or intramuscular procaine <b>benzylpenicillin.</b> Erythromycin or doxycycline may be given instead {{to people who are}} allergic to penicillin. E. rhusiopathiae is intrinsically resistant to vancomycin.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is in the}} {{penicillin}} {{class of}} medications. It is slowly absorbed into the circulation, after intramuscular injection, and hydrolysed to <b>benzylpenicillin</b> in vivo. It is the drug-of-choice when prolonged low concentrations of <b>benzylpenicillin</b> are required and appropriate, allowing prolonged antibiotic action over 2-4 weeks after a single IM dose.|$|E
50|$|Phenoxymethylpenicillin is more acid-stable than <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> {{which allows}} it to be given orally.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{there are}} three main and {{important}} steps to the biosynthesis of penicillin G (<b>benzylpenicillin).</b>|$|E
50|$|Latersubgroup 2c was {{segregated}} {{from group}} 2 because these enzymes inactivate carbenicillin more than <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> with some effect on cloxacillin.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include pain at {{the site}} of injection, blood {{clotting}} problems, seizures, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. When used to treat syphilis a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer may occur. It is not recommended in those with a history of penicillin allergy or procaine allergy. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is relatively safe. Procaine <b>benzylpenicillin</b> is in the penicillin and beta lactam family of medications. It works via <b>benzylpenicillin</b> and results in bacterial death. Procaine makes the combination long acting.|$|E
5000|$|Subgroup 2d enzymes {{inactivate}} cloxacillin {{more than}} <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> with some activity against carbenicillin; these enzymes are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid, {{and some of}} them are ESBLs ...|$|E
50|$|Benzathine is a diamine {{used as a}} {{component}} in some medications including benzathine phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin.</b> It stabilises penicillin and prolongs its sojourn when injected into tissues.|$|E
50|$|Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable {{than many}} other {{penicillins}} and can be given orally, in addition to parenteral routes. However, like methicillin, it is less potent than <b>benzylpenicillin</b> against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Propicillin is a penicillin. Properties {{are similar}} to <b>benzylpenicillin</b> {{particularly}} used in streptococcal infections, not resistant to penicillinase. It is acid resistant {{and can be used}} orally as the potassium salt.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 Abraham {{reported}} that his N-phenylacetyl derivative of cephalosporin C {{was much more}} potent against Staphylococcus aureus strains than the parent compound. This derivative was later named Cephaloram, a cephalosporin analogue of <b>benzylpenicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ampicillin {{is able to}} {{penetrate}} Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. It differs from penicillin G, or <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> only {{by the presence of}} an amino group. That amino group helps the drug penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though its}} {{more common in}} the {{other parts of the body}} it can happen in the eyes and it {{presents}} with necrosis resulting from a rapidly progressing oedema. The treatment of choice is surgical debridement and parenteral <b>benzylpenicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|People with {{positive}} cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes {{should be treated}} with penicillin as long as allergy is not present. The use of antibiotics will not alter cardiac involvement {{in the development of}} rheumatic fever. Some suggest the use of benzathine <b>benzylpenicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The aminopenicillins are a {{group of}} {{antibiotics}} in the penicillin family that are structural analogs of ampicillin (which is the 2-amino derivative of <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> hence the name). Like other penicillins they contain a beta-lactam ring that {{is believed to be}} crucial to its antibacterial activity.|$|E
50|$|Procaine <b>benzyl{{penicillin}}</b> {{also known}} as penicillin G procaine, is an antibiotic useful {{for the treatment of}} a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is used for syphilis, anthrax, mouth infections, pneumonia, diphtheria, cellulitis, and animal bites. It is given by injection into a muscle.|$|E
50|$|When {{meningococcal}} {{disease is}} suspected, treatment must be started immediately {{and should not}} be delayed while waiting for investigations. Treatment in primary care usually involves prompt intramuscular administration of <b>benzylpenicillin,</b> and then an urgent transfer to hospital (hopefully, an academic level I medical center, or at least a hospital with round the clock neurological care, ideally with neurological intensive and critical care units) for further care. Once in the hospital, the antibiotics of choice are usually IV broad spectrum 3rd generation cephalosporins, e.g., cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. <b>Benzylpenicillin</b> and chloramphenicol are also effective. Supportive measures include IV fluids, oxygen, inotropic support, e.g., dopamine or dobutamine and management of raised intracranial pressure. Steroid therapy may help in some adult patients, but is unlikely to affect long term outcomes.|$|E
50|$|Benzathine <b>benzyl{{penicillin}},</b> {{also known}} as benzathine penicillin G, is an antibiotic useful {{for the treatment of}} a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is to treat strep throat, diphtheria, syphilis, and yaws. It is also used to prevent rheumatic fever. It is given by injection into a muscle.|$|E
