25|$|Originally <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> are {{eligible}} for kangaroo care include pre-term infants weighing less than , and breathing independently. Cardiopulmonary monitoring, oximetry, supplemental oxygen or nasal (continuous positive airway pressure) ventilation, intravenous infusions, and monitor leads do not prevent kangaroo care. In fact, <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> are in kangaroo care {{tend to be less}} prone to apnea and bradycardia and have stabilization of oxygen needs.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroo care or Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), {{sometimes}} called skin-to-skin care, {{is a technique}} of newborn care where babies are kept skin-to-skin with a parent, typically their mother. It is most commonly used for low birth-weight preterm <b>babies,</b> <b>who</b> {{are more likely to}} suffer from hypothermia, while admitted to a neonatal unit to keep the baby warm and support early breastfeeding.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{education}} has been seen in Madagascar's infant mortality rate. According to Maryanne Sharp and Ioana Kruse of the World Bank note that mothers who have finished their secondary education experience fewer than forty to {{fifty percent of the}} infant deaths experienced by women with less education. Younger women are also less likely to have <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> die while young. The average perinatal mortality rate has decreased since 2003.|$|E
25|$|Other main {{controversy}} {{issues of}} Malaysian National Service include the selection system {{where the government}} computer database system picks up the trainees randomly without even knowing about their social status. Some cases include poor teenagers who need to work for their living and young mothers with newborn <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were selected for the program, which are considered as inhumane. However, selected trainees with extraneous circumstances can send a letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.|$|E
25|$|Many {{experts have}} {{reported}} unintended and catastrophic {{side effects of}} breastfeeding promotion without sufficient patient education on the risks of low or delayed milk production. Although the onset of copious milk production typically begins on Day 3 postpartum, many mothers have risk factors {{that can lead to}} delay in this process. The Fed Is Best Foundation has brought to light stories of <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> have been permanently injured or killed by the push to avoid formula until a dangerous level of caloric deprivation occurs.|$|E

25|$|Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea, is the {{condition}} of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day. It often lasts {{for a few days}} and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> are breastfed, however, may be normal.|$|E
25|$|Stillbirths {{occurs when}} a fetus dies after 20 weeks of gestation. There {{are two types of}} stillbirth, {{including}} intrauterine death and intrapartum death. Intrauterine death {{occurs when a}} baby dies during late pregnancy. Intrapartum death, which is more common, occurs when a baby dies while the mother is giving birth. The cause of stillbirth is often unknown, but the rate of <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> are stillborn is higher in twins and multiple births. Caesareans or inductions are advised after 38 weeks of pregnancy for twins, because the risk of stillbirth increases after this time.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, baby formula {{manufactured}} by the German company Humana {{and sold in}} Israel under the brand Remedia caused severe vitamin deficiencies in babies. <b>Babies</b> <b>who</b> consumed the formula were hospitalized with cardiac and neurological symptoms. Three of them died, and at least twenty others were left with severe disabilities. An investigation revealed that the formula contained a much lower quantity of Thiamine than is needed for healthy infant development because of a manufacturing error. Humana's chief food technologist received a 30-month prison sentence for negligent manslaughter in February 2013 over the case.|$|E

25|$|Pre-term <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> {{are unable}} to {{manufacture}} surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they breathe out. Unless treated, this condition, called respiratory distress syndrome, is fatal. Basic scientific experiments, carried out using cells from chicken lungs, support the potential for using steroids {{as a means of}} furthering development of type II alveolar cells. In fact, once a premature birth is threatened, every effort is made to delay the birth, and a series of steroid injections is frequently administered to the mother during this delay in an effort to promote lung maturation.|$|E
25|$|Plant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milks (oat {{milk and}} rice milk), hemp milk, and coconut milk—are used {{in place of}} cows' or goats' milk. Soy milk {{provides}} around 7g of protein per cup (240mL or 8floz), compared with 8g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates and protein. Soy milk {{should not be used}} as a replacement for breast milk for babies. <b>Babies</b> <b>who</b> are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula, normally based on cows' milk or soy. The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF.|$|E
2500|$|Protein {{hydrolysate}} formulas contain protein that's {{been broken}} down into smaller sizes than are those in cow's milk and soy-based formulas. Protein hydrolysate formulas are meant for <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> don't tolerate cow's milk or soy-based formulas.|$|E

2500|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} this more extreme kind of False Self began to develop in infancy, as a defence against an {{environment}} that felt unsafe or overwhelming {{because of a lack}} of reasonably attuned caregiving. He thought that parents did not need to be perfectly attuned, but just [...] "ordinarily devoted" [...] or [...] "good enough" [...] to protect the baby from often experiencing overwhelming extremes of discomfort and distress, emotional or physical. But <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> lack this kind of external protection, Winnicott thought, had to do their best with their own crude defences.|$|E
