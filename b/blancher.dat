To this end we compute, over the period January 2004 –December 2012, a parsimonious and fully documented SLRI. We also investigate its statistical significance in explaining the level and variability of stock returns {{for a group of}} large international banks across the subprime and the Eurozone sovereign debt crises. Main findings are two: our more parsimonious SLRI is close to Severo’s but provides a stronger signal of liquidity stress and recovery episodes; we consistently fail to detect, within and across the two crises, a stable group of banks among the global systemically important ones listed by the Financial Stability Board...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{advances in}} understanding the molecu-lar and neural mechanisms of olfaction (Doty, 2003; Finger, Silver, & Restrepo, 2000), the functions of odor in the everyday life of humans remain little understood. For some scholars, the adaptive significance {{of the sense of}} smell in our own species has undergone an anatomical decline with the evolutionary sophistication of visual perception and cognition (Gilad, Wiebe, Przeworski, Lancet, & Pääbo, 2004; Rouquier, <b>Blancher,</b> & Giorgi, 2000). The human species is thus considered as “microsmatic”, i. e. having morphologically reduced olfactory structures, and hence poor olfactory function. However, other sources suggest that olfaction remains highly serviceable in multiple essential functions (Candau, 2000; Herz, 2002; Schaal & Porter, 1991; Shepherd, 2004). For example, acute perturbations or the chronic loss of smell greatly affect quality of life (e. g., the enjoyment of food, social partners and the general environment), and jeopardize the control of potentially unsafe circumstances (e. g., fire, cooking, cleanliness, disease; Hummel & Nordin, 2005; Tennen, Affleck, & Mendola, 1991; Van Toller, 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of frozen vegetables generally includes a heat treatment (a blanching) to denaturate cellular enzymes. The water used for cooling after this blanching is disinfected to prevent microbial growth {{and to ensure}} a microbiologically qualitative end product. In this study the possible influence of the disinfectants chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) and peracetic acid (PAA) on the vitamin C content of the processed vegetables was investigated. The vitamin C content was measured using a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) technique coupled with a fluorescence detector. Besides a decrease, resulting from the blanching of the vegetables, a concentration dependent effect was seen with peracetic acid. This effect was not noticed when using lower concentrations, e. g. 30 parts per million (ppm) of peracetic acid or 3 ppm chlorine dioxide. The major conclusion of our work is about spinach and we can conclude that {{it makes no sense}} to use concentrations higher than 40 ppm of peracetic acid in the cooling water of the <b>blancher</b> since this only results in a supplementary decrease of the vitamin C content and this without a substantial additional anti-microbial effect. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of growth}} and amylase production of Saccharomycopsis fibuligera were studied in a chemostat on a synthetic potato processing <b>blancher</b> water. Dilution rates (D) from 0. 101 to 0. 480 h− 1 were examined. A mathematical model based on the Monod equation was developed. The yield of cell mass from carbohydrates was constant and equal to 0. 84. The maximum specific growth rate and the Monod constant were determined to be 0. 596 h− 1 and 0. 226 mg/ml, respectively. An equation for the steady-state starch concentrations was empirically derived. The steady-state noncarbohydrate carbon levels rose linearly with D. Reducing sugars were the growth-limiting substrate, and their steady-state levels conformed to Monod kinetics. The yield of amylase from the cell mass (Yz) declined as D rose and was described by the equation Yz = (− 8. 005 D + 4. 076). The model predicted that the maximum production of cell mass should occur at D = 0. 35 h− 1 and the maximum production of amylase should occur at D = 0. 22 h− 1. The mathematical model presented agreed with the experimental results in its prediction of the steady-state level of reducing sugar, starch, cell mass, and amylase concentrations {{as well as the}} productivity of amylase...|$|E

For the whole group of the necessary equipment the principal schemes are designed, and the abrasive blender was tested during the experimental approbation to reveal the optimal design. The culinary fish pastes have already been produced in the enterprises in many countries for many years and they are particularly popular in Japan, Germany, Scandinavian and other country. In Poland the mixtures of fish pasted have become widely spread, and are used for production of portioned meals. These pastes may be blended into larger or smaller pieces. The aromatization process of such pastes is conducted with adding the liquid smoke, natural or synthetic fragrances. There is an increasing popularization of the use of flaxseed as a source of alpha-linoleic acid, high-quality protein, phenolics, fiber and minerals. Products with flax meal can be recommended for inclusion in the diet to make up for the deficit of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber. In this regard, it is appropriate to use the semi-finished product formulations for the respective housings extruded snack food. The results of the conducted research could be used in the production of domestic extruded snacks, which have the form of the cushions with vitaminized dough body and hydrobionts stuffing if setting the special extrusion modes...|$|E
40|$|The yeasts Candida utilis and Saccharomycopsis fibuliger were {{propagated}} as {{a source}} of single-cell protein in a continuous, mixed, aerobic, single-stage cultivation on <b>blancher</b> water generated during potato processing. A series of steady-state experiments based on a two-level factorial design, half-replicate modified with an intermediate experiment, was performed to determine the effect of pH, 3. 8 to 4. 8; dissolved oxygen, 42 to 80 % saturation; dilution rate, 0. 17 to 0. 31 h− 1; and temperature, 27 to 32 °C on the amount of carbon consumed, the rate of carbon consumption (Rc), the amount of reducing sugar consumed, the rate of sugar consumption (Rg), the amount of protein produced, the rate of protein production (Rp), the yield from carbon, and the yield from reducing sugar. The results were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression and Fisher's least significant difference test. Analyses showed that high dilution rates resulted in increased Rc, Rg, and Rp and indicated that a rate of 0. 31 h− 1 was below the critical dilution rate. A temperature of 32 °C increased the amount of carbon consumed by 34 %. A pH of 4. 3 to 4. 8 increased the amount of protein produced. The yield from carbon was constant, and the relatively high yield from reducing sugar indicated that other substrates were consumed. Dissolved oxygen was in excess at 42 % saturation and above. Since C. utilis predominated the mixed cultures and amylase production appeared to be limited, a single-stage fermentation lacked efficiency. The experimental design allowed preliminary optimization of major environmental variables with relatively few experiments and provided a basis for future kinetic studies...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{influential}} people in a child 2 ̆ 7 s life are the teachers who aid them in their transition into the education system and the complex social environment that it brings (<b>Blancher</b> 2 ̆ 6 Eisenhower, 2006). Children who display externalising behaviours early in childhood often experience greater difficulties than other children when entering school and throughout their education experience (Hinshaw, Lahey 2 ̆ 6 Hart, 1993; Liu, 2004). The student-teacher relationship established within the classroom and the disciplinary measures utilized by the teachers can have a profound impact on the child 2 ̆ 7 s development both academically and socially (Galen 2 ̆ 6 Underwood, 1997; Hamre 2 ̆ 6 Pianta, 2001). Interventions focusing on these areas within the classroom can be essential resources in assisting to redirect the externalising behaviour problems displayed by children before more severe disorders develop later in adolescence and adulthood (Gottfredson 2 ̆ 6 Hirschi, 1990; Moffitt, 1993). Children who display externalising behaviour problems often face difficulties in their academic and social development within the education system. Student-teacher relationships and teacher disciplinary techniques can be essential components of intervention strategies to redirect these externalising behaviours. This study used a crosssectional, correlational design to examine the influence of student-teacher relationships and teacher disciplinary techniques on students 2 ̆ 7 externalising behaviours. Results indicated student-teacher relationships as a significant predictor with closeness/warmth student-teacher relationships and intrinsic disciplinary techniques negatively correlating with externalising behaviours and conflict/negative interaction positively correlating with externalising behaviours. However, extrinsic disciplinary techniques unexpectedly negatively correlated with students 2 ̆ 7 externalising behaviours. Further research is needed on the relationships between student-teacher relationships and teacher disciplinary techniques...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn view of all {{the damage}} caused by {{flooding}} that has affected large numbers of regions throughout the world over the last ten years, urban areas appear to be little prepared for facing up to this type of catastrophe. Today, improving their resilience, i. e. their capacity to recover rapidly after flooding, appears to be a real issue at stake in societies' sustainable development. Due to their organization in the form of subsystems, the multiple aspects of their functions and the dynamics that drive them, these urban territories must be considered as complex systems. Within these urban systems, technical networks are physical links between inhabitants and the actors involved, the symbolic links of belonging to the same community, to the same organized territory (Lacoste quoted by Dupuy, 1991). As supports and even objects of interactions between the different sub-systems in the urban system and with the outside environment, they supply, unify and irrigate all the constituent elements of urban territories. In this way, networks participate in organizing and regulating the system by being the vector of relations between its different constituent elements. "Physically connecting the elements in the system unifies them and creates the network's operating conditions at the same time. In the same way, it makes a certain mode of operation and evolutions in the system possible" (Dupuy, 1984). This strategic position makes networks extremely influent in the dynamics of maintaining the global urban system. In turn, they can be generators of incidents by interrupting flows or vectors in the propagation of unforeseen turns of events. Therefore, characterizing their resilience to flooding may prove to be interesting in for providing a better understanding of urban resilience. In this context, we have decided to work on the resilience of waste management networks. Because they raise essential questions on sanitation and public health and because they often have a strong visual and psychological impact, these networks appear to be real issues at stake in crisis management. After flooding, the volume of waste generated is often significant and of a different sort (mixed, even polluted wet waste). Faced with this situation, waste management poses a real problem. What should be done with this waste? How should it be collected? Where can it be stored? How should it be processed? Who is in charge? Providing answers to these questions is all the more strategic inasmuch as post-flood waste is the visual sign of the catastrophe. As a result, cleaning up is populations' and local actors' first reflex in order to forget what has happened, but also in order to start up again as quickly as possible. Therefore, it would appear primordial to improve waste management networks' resilience to flooding (Beraud et al., 2010). First and foremost, improving the resilience of an organization requires understanding the way it operates in order to identify what dysfunctions it may contain. A methodology needs to be developed for this purpose, capable of analyzing a waste management network's way of operation under normal and crisis conditions. In this way, risks and potential dangers resulting from the urban system being flooded can be identified and the means of prevention for improving the waste management network's resilience to flooding can be brought out. Choosing the right methodology is not an easy task. Numerous methods of risk analysis exist. For the most part they are of industrial origin. As a result, it is not always easy to use them for studying social systems such as urban technical networks, as these systems possess characteristics that differ considerably from industrial systems. "Multiple responsibilities with regard to the design, build, operation and maintenance of networks, separated amongst numerous actors who do not regularly communicate together and share information" are, for example, one of the particularities of risk control in an urban environment (Prost, in <b>Blancher,</b> 1998). As a result, the way in which networks operate may appear to be extremely complex: the diversity and involvement of actors, different scales and territories to be taken into account, the issues at stake concerning the public service mission, catastrophic consequences, that are immediate and those with important repercussions when they are interrupted, etc. This complexity makes it extremely difficult to model urban networks (Maiolini, 1992), whereas applying methods used in the world of industry requires that models are created beforehand. Therefore, there are real methodology stakes in play when transferring these methods from industrial engineering to urban engineering. This article will present the methodology set up followed by initial results. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
