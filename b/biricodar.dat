50|$|<b>Biricodar</b> (INN, codename VX-710, {{marketed as}} the dicitrate salt under the trade name Incel) is a {{pharmaceutical}} drug released by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in 1999 to help treat ovarian cancer patients.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: VX- 710 (<b>biricodar,</b> Incel) restores drug sensi-tivity to P-glycoprotein (MDR 1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP 1) -expressing cells. This Phase II study {{evaluated}} the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, {{and efficacy of}} VX- 710 plus paclitaxel in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were refractory to prior paclitaxel therapy. Experimental Design: Eligible patients had paclitaxel-refractory disease defined as progressive disease after {{a minimum of two}} cycles of paclitaxel (weekly or 3 -week schedule) or relapsed/progressive disease within 6 months of prior paclitaxel therapy. Patients received 80 mg/m 2 pacli-taxel over 3 h starting 4 h after initiation of a 24 -h contin-uous i. v. infusion of 120 mg/m 2 /h VX- 710. Cycles were re...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of {{mammalian}} multidrug efflux, such as {{the plant}} alkaloid reserpine, are also active in potentiating antibiotic activity by inhibiting bacterial efflux. Based on this precedent, two novel mammalian multiple drug resistance inhibitors, <b>biricodar</b> (VX- 710) and timcodar (VX- 853), were evaluated for activity {{in a variety of}} bacteria. Both VX- 710 and VX- 853 potentiated the activity of ethidium bromide (EtBr), a model efflux substrate, against three clinically significant gram-positive pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Similar to reserpine, VX- 710 and VX- 853 directly blocked EtBr efflux in S. aureus. Furthermore, these compounds were effective in lowering the MICs of several clinically used antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, suggesting that VX- 710 and VX- 853 are representatives of a new class of bacterial efflux inhibitors with the potential for use in combination therapy...|$|E
40|$|Summary Clinical {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that both MDR 1 and MRP may {{play a significant role in}} the chemosensitivity and outcome of neuroblastoma. To clarify the nature of multidrug resistance (MDR) in this tumour a series of six neuroblastoma cell lines have been characterized with regard to P-glycoprotein, MRP and LRP expression using immunocytochemistry and expression of MDR 1, MRP, LRP and topoisomerase II genes using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). By RT-PCR, all lines expressed MRP, five expressed LRP and four expressed MDR 1, but protein levels of each of these were variable. Chemosensitization to a range of MDR-associated drugs (vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, taxotere, topotecan) and non-MDR-associated drugs (cisplatin, melphalan) by three modulating agents, cyclosporin A, PSC 833 and the novel <b>Biricodar</b> (VX- 710; Incelâ„¢), was evaluated using a colourimetric cytotoxicity assay (MTS). Alteration of daunorubicin efflux by these agents was evaluated using FACS analysis. Clonogenic assay was used to study the influence of these chemosensitizers on vincristine cytotoxicity. Marked sensitization to vincristine was observed in MDR 1 -positive lines, and a similar but less consistent effect was seen with taxotere, doxorubicin and etoposide. With MRP-positive, MDR-negative lines, only VX- 710 caused consistent sensitization. These data confirm MDR 1 and MRP expression as contributory factors in chemoresistance in neuroblastoma and indicate that VX- 710 may be a useful modulator of both mechanisms and worthy of clinical evaluation in this tumour. Although half of all children with neuroblastoma will be cured of their disease, there are still subgroups in whom the outlook remains poor. These include children with metastatic disease...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{classical}} protection mechanism of cancer cells involves an increased expression of drug efflux transport proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gP). P-gP is an ABC drug efflux transporter which is fisiologically express in many tissues such as the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) where it {{is involved in the}} protection of the CNS from potentially toxic agents. This protein is able to transport a wild structural different substrates, including many drugs used for a wild range of therapeutic applications. Therefore, the research of safe and effective P-gP inhibitors endowed of high selectivity and potency represent a great challenge in medicinal chemistry. In particular, the possibility to have selective molecules able to inhibit this protein could be useful to modulate the pharmacological behaviour of drugs including those used for chemo-therapy-resistant tumors. Up to now many agents modulating P-gP have been characterized including channel blockers, calmodulin antagonists, immunosuppressant and protein kinase inhibitors but all these compounds produced disappointing results in vivo because the use of high dose resulting in unacceptable toxicity. Some new drugs such as <b>biricodar,</b> tariquidar and elacridar have satisfactory inhibitory effects on P-gP. This latter displayed a high potency for P-gP transporter but it also inhibited breast cancer resistance protein (BCPR). On the basis of computational studies which suggested a general pharmacophore of a substrate/inhibitor of P-gP transporter, in which both a planar aromatic domain and a presence of a basic nitrogen atom within an extended side chain are described, we designed and synthesised new compounds. These molecules possessed a benzylethereal side chain substituted by aliphatic spacer of 2, 3, or 4 methylenes linked to an arylpiperazine nucleus. All the synthesized compounds have been tested in vitro to evaluated the inhibitor activity on Caco 2 cells in which P-gP is overexpressed and the best results have been obtained for compounds having a four methylene chain. Unfortunatelly, as expected, all arylpiperazine classes displayed hight serotoninergic 5 -HT 1 A and dopaminergic D 2 receptor affinities. In order to improve P-gP affinity and eliminate serotoninergic and dopaminergic activities some structural manipulations on these derivatives have been carried out such as the substitution of the aryl and arylpiperazine moieties with a methylic and tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleuses respectively. Besides new ligand series arylmethyloxyphenyl 1, 2, 3 were prepared by removing the alkylpiperazinic ring and linking arylmethyl groups directly to the phenoxyalkyl nucleous. Moreover the replacemant of the oxygen atom with a nitrogen one led to arylmethylaminophenyl 2 derivatives more potent than the oxygen-analogues, which behaved as elacridar but displayed a more simple structure. However, in N-methylpiperazine series the spacer length poorly influenced the P-gP inhibitory activity. On other hand, analogously to the arylpiperazine-derivatives, also within the tetrahydroisoquinoline-derivatives, the spacer elongation improved P-gP inhibitory activity. Since the limit of P-gP inhibitors such as elacridar is the poor selectivity toward other ABC transporters, in particular the BCRP pump, all the active compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit [3 H]-mitoxantrone, a specific BCRP substrate. The results showed that only arylmethylaminephenyl derivatives displayed a good BCRP inhibition activity. These results led us to consider the 2 -[(3 -methoxyphenylethyl) phenoxy]- fragment, present in the more selective P-gP inhibitors, the pivotal molecular basis to design novel P-gP inhibitors.
