25|$|The Cuts Like a Knife tour {{started in}} eastern Canada. In March, Adams started the American {{leg of the}} tour; after five months Adams had {{performed}} over 100 dates. He later joined the British progressive rock band Supertramp on their tour in North America. Though not featured on the album, drummer for the tour was the late Frankie LaRocka and the keyboard player was Johnny 'Blitz' Hannah. Adams then traveled to Vancouver where he played live in front of 30,000 fans. Later on he went to Europe for a six-week solo tour; one show (and subsequent band interview) was broadcast live on German TV and radio {{as part of the}} famous Rockpalast series. He played in six different countries. In November 1983, Adams went to Japan to start his own headline tour. By this time Adams had <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> 283 days. Adams supported The Police when they toured in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Following the Master of Reality {{world tour}} in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: [...] "The band started to become very {{fatigued}} and very tired. We'd <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> non-stop, {{year in and}} year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] was {{released}} as {{the fourth and}} final single from Shakira's eighth studio album, She Wolf (2009). [...] "Gypsy" [...] was written by Shakira, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, and produced by Shakira, Ghost, Lukas Burton and Future Cut. Written in a ballad-like form, the lyrics of the song describe life travelling on the road as a [...] "gypsy". Shakira explained the song, saying [...] "(The song represents my) way of living and seeing life. I've <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> since I was very young so that's where the gypsy metaphor comes from." [...] Musically, [...] "Gypsy" [...] is heavily influenced by Indian and Middle Eastern music, and features instrumentation from the mandolin, banjo, sitar and tabla. According to the music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Gypsy" [...] is a midtempo song written in the key of C major, with a metronome of 100 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from A3 to C5.|$|E
500|$|Morton {{questioned}} George Squires, {{who could}} not recall with absolute certainty the path he claimed his family took through the south of England while Canning was missing. [...] His sister Lucy was not called to the stand, as she was considered [...] "rather more stupid than her brother, and has not <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> since their coming to Enfield Wash". [...] Robert Willis, who had accompanied Squires to retrace the gypsy family's steps, was also called to testify; his evidence was judged as hearsay and ruled inadmissible. [...] As {{in the trial of}} Squires and Wells, the reliability of the prosecutor's witnesses was considered dependent upon their character. [...] Three men from Litton Cheney testified that they had seen the Squires family enter the village on 30December. [...] The three Abbotsbury men then stepped up and gave their evidence. [...] 39witnesses for the prosecution were heard on the first day alone; most of them establishing briefly the Squires family's alibi.|$|E
500|$|The San Jose Mercury News and the Connecticut Post both {{gave the}} show a mixed review, {{with the former}} saying it was [...] "decidedly subpar" [...] and latter saying [...] "the concert itself wasn't as {{captivating}} as past visits to the state." [...] The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Philadelphia Inquirer were unreserved in their praise, with the former saying Springsteen [...] "deliver a show that proves boomer-oriented rock 'n' roll can still tear it up" [...] and the latter saying Springsteen adapted to circumstances [...] "with an altered game plan that wisely plays to his strengths". [...] The Greensboro, North Carolina News & Record said that [...] "Springsteen and the E Street Band were received like conquering heroes during an exhilarating three-hour show that repeatedly drove the adoring, near-sellout crowd into fist-thrusting, sing-along frenzies." [...] The Globe and Mail said of the tour's sole Canadian show, [...] "an evening with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band still ranks as the epitome of the rock concert experience." [...] Rolling Stone said of the first leg's concluding New Jersey shows, [...] "Springsteen tours don’t usually hit highs like this until the end, but the band has essentially <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> since September of 2007." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening {{and there was no}} stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say he wanted to talk to Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't really seen that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E

2500|$|After the Winter Garden shows, however, Diamond {{announced}} that he needed a break, and he engaged in no more live performances till 1976. He used those four years {{to work on the}} score for Hall Bartlett's film version of Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull and to record two albums, Serenade and Beautiful Noise. He said years later, [...] "I knew I'd come back, but I wasn't sure when. I spent one year on each of those albums...I'd <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> six years. I had a son 2½ and I felt he needed me more than the audience did. So for four years I devoted myself to my son Jesse."
