40|$|The Kago deposit {{is a small}} deposit {{located at}} the {{southern}} tip of the Satsuma Peninsula of Southern Kyushu, Japan. It lies proximal to the well-known Nansatsu-type mineralisation province dominated by high-sulfidation type epithermal deposits. The deposit was heavily mined in the 18  th Century, largely for its relatively higher gold compared to that of surrounding and regional deposits. The Kago deposit is a typical low-sulfidation deposit, characterised by adularia-quartz veins, composed of electrum, Ag-tetrahedrite, polybasite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. Based on mine records, the grade ranged from 4. 1 to 13. 3  g/t Au and 2. 6 – 6. 6  g/t Ag. Alteration grades from low to high temperature argillic into a propylitic zone at the extremes of the vein exposures. Carbonate is absent. Fluid inclusion microthermometry reveals a typical temperature range of 220 – 240  °C with salinity of 0. 7 – 2. 6 NaCl eq. wt%. Electrum from high-grade ore ranges from 66 to 69  wt% Au. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age dating of adularia bearing colloform/crustiform and <b>brecciated</b> <b>veins,</b> suggests a mineralisation event from 4. 23 to 4. 0  Ma. δ 18 O of veined and silicified quartz ranges from + 4. 0 to + 18. 4 ‰. δ 18 OH 2 O of fluids in equilibrium with quartz, in the dominant range of measured fluid inclusion temperatures, ranges from − 6. 5 ‰ to − 0. 2 ‰. δ 34 S of pyrite has a narrow range from − 1. 8 to 2. 7 ‰. The deposit lies at the northern extent of the classic Nansatsu high-sulfidation epithermal area, in which a number of silicified bodies punctuate the region in a roughly semi-circular shape. The Kago deposit lies within the principle mineralisation age range of the high-sulfidation deposits, which range from 5. 5 to 3. 7  Ma. The structural displacement of the Kago deposit from the Nansatsu mineralisation and the differing host rocks has greatly influenced alteration, ore and rock-water interaction of the ore depositing fluids. Here we seek to establish the relationship that this extended mineral province has between the differing styles of mineralisation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, in Indonesia gold {{exploration}} activities  are {{not only}} focused along volcanic-magmatic belts, but also starting to shift along metamorphic and sedimentary terrains. The study area is located in Rumbia mountains, Bombana Regency, Southeast Sulawesi Province. This paper is aimed to describe characteristics of alteration and ore mineralization associated  with metamorphic rock-related gold deposits.   The study area is found the placer and  primary gold hosted by metamorphic rocks. The gold is evidently derived from gold-bearing quartz veins hosted by Pompangeo Metamorphic Complex (PMC). These quartz veins are currently recognized in metamorphic rocks at Rumbia Mountains. The quartz veins are mostly sheared/deformed, <b>brecciated,</b> irregular <b>vein,</b> segmented and  relatively massive and crystalline texture with thickness from 1 cm to 15. 7 cm. The wallrock are generally weakly altered. Hydrothermal alteration types include sericitization, argillic, inner propylitic, propylitic, carbonization and carbonatization. There some precious metal identified consist of native gold and ore mineralization including pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), cinnabar (HgS), stibnite (Sb 2 S 3) and goethite (FeHO 2). The veins contain erratic gold in various grades from below detection limit < 0. 0002 ppm to 18. 4 ppm.

Host rocks consist of an intrusive subvolcanic gabbro sill and mafic and felsic volcanic rocks formed in a volcano-sedimentary environment* This sequence was intruded by felsic and diabase dykes. Mineralization consists of native gold and chalcopyrite in <b>brecciated</b> quartz <b>veins,</b> formed as fracture-fillings, located in three subparallel shear zones cutting the gabbro, mafic and felsic volcanic rocks. Chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite and minor sphalerite are found in breccia interstices and in disseminations near the veins but are not spatially related to the gold mineralization. The gold is contained in quartz and albite. Textures show {{it was the last}} mineral to be deposited in the veins. A mineral identified as anhydrite is found in the 'main' shear and the mafic volcanic rock unit of the mine sequence. As anhydrite has not been found elsewhere in the region {{it may be possible to}} use its presence as a stratigraphie indicator. A hydrothermal lateral secretion origin is postulated for the deposit. Basic, reducing, carbonate and H 2 S-bearing fluids have the capability to transport the mineralization of the deposit and to produce the alteration noted in the host rocks.

40|$|International audienceThe Pala region, {{in southwestern}} Chad, {{belongs to the}} {{northern}} part of the Central African Pan-African Fold Belt. It is made up of greenschist-facies schists and is characterized by bimodal, mainly mafic, magmatism. This schist unit named Goueigoudoum Series is intruded by pre- to post-tectonic plutonic rocks dated between 737 and 570 Ma and dykes of quartz. Gold is mined artisanally from alluvial deposits and primary chalcopyrite-pyrite-bearing quartz <b>veins,</b> <b>brecciated</b> and silicified zones and shear zones. The majority of the mineralized shear zones and some quartz veins generally trend N-S to NNE-SSW or NW-SE and are interpreted as extensional shear fractures related to regional NE-SW-trending sinistral strike-slip shear zones. The geological context of the Pala region clearly indicates hydrothermal fluids formed along active continental margins during collisional orogenesis, and subsequent associated fluid migration typically occurred during strike-slip events. Although the origin of fluids may be varied (magmatic, metamorphic or meteoric fluids, Proterozoic seawater, or sedimentary basin formation waters), the distribution of the mineralizations along the granitoid intrusions suggests that magmatism played a major role in the dynamics of the mineralizing fluids...|$|R
40|$|For over a decade, {{the oldest}} {{evidence}} {{for life on}} this planet has been microfossils in the 3. 5 Ga Apex Chert in Western Australia. Recently, the biogenicity of these carbon-rich structures has been called into question through reanalysis of the local geology and reinterpretation of the original thin sections. Although initially described as a stratiform, bedded chert of siliceous clasts, the unit is now {{thought to be a}} <b>brecciated</b> hydrothermal <b>vein</b> chert. The high temperatures of a hydrothermal environment would probably have detrimental effects to early non-hyperthermophilic life, compared to that of a shallow sea. Conversely, a hydrothermal origin would suggest that if the microfossils were valid, they might have been hyperthermophilic. Apex Chert controversy. The Apex Chert microfossils were originally described as septate filaments composed of kerogen similar in morphology to Proterozoic and modern cyanobacteria. However new thin section analysis shows that these carbonaceous structures are not simple filaments. Many of the original microfossils are branched and have variable thickness when the plane of focus is changed. Hydrothermal alteration of organic remains has also been suggested for the creation of these strange morphologies. Another point of contention lies with the nature of the carbon material in these proposed microfossils. Kerogen is structurally amorphous, but transforms into well-ordered graphite under high pressures and temperatures. Raman spectrometry of the carbonaceous material in the proposed microfossils has been interpreted both as partially graphitized kerogen and amorphous graphite. However, these results are inconclusive, since Raman spectrometry cannot adequately discriminate between kerogen and disordered graphite. There are also opposing views for the origin of the carbon in the Apex Chert. The carbon would be biogenic if the proposed microfossils are indeed the remains of former living organisms. However, an inorganic Fischer- Tropsch-type synthesis is also a possible explanation for the formation of large-aggregate carbonaceous particles and could also account for the depletion of (13) C observed...|$|R
40|$|A complex Late Cretaceous {{suture zone}} between two {{distinct}} geological terranes is preserved in southern Cyprus {{in a series}} of erosional windows through Tertiary-Recent cover sediments. The two terranes are the Mamonia and Troodos Complexes, and the suture zone contains evidence of two major contractional tectonic events - primary north-northeast- and secondary west-southwest-directed thrusting. Delamination of the Mamonia Complex during juxtaposition against the Troodos Complex resulted in Mamonia rocks being thrust beneath and over the Troodos Complex Later west-southwest-directed back-thrusting resulted in imbrication of the Troodos Complex and also Mamonia rocks being thrust over Troodos rocks (Malpas et al., 1993). The serpentinite sheet containing magnesite mineralisation was tectonically emplaced from east to west over sheeted diabase dykes and lower- and upper pillow lavas during this latter contractional tectonic episode. [...] Magnesite deposits are found in a large sheet of serpentinised harzburgite in the Akamas Peninsula and trend north-south along a 5 km line adjacent to Tertiary limestone cover. The largest magnesite occurrence, the Magnisia mine, exhibits many clues to magnesite vein genesis prior to, and during, the tectonic emplacement of the serpentinite. Several temporally and spatially related generations of magnesite are identified. The magnesite deposits contain two distinct styles of mineralisation within the serpentinite, and have been divided into Zones i and II. Zone I encompasses veins and stockwork magnesite and Zone II contains nodular magnesite. Antitaxial magnesite veins have mineralised serpentinite along planes of weakness, encapsulating serpentinite fragments and exhibiting classic features associated with vein minerals formed in active shear zones, i. e. well developed median lines in <b>veins,</b> comb textures, <b>brecciated</b> <b>veins</b> recemented by further mineralisation and spalled wallrock lying parallel to the edges of vein walls. These veins are interpreted as having formed during emplacement of the serpentinite, and define the main phase of magnesite mineralisation. The magnesite veins and stockworks define Zone I style mineralisation. Voids within these magnesite veins have subsequently been filled by epigenetic calcite and dolomite, probably derived from solutions passing through the limestone cover above the deposits. A later generation of magnesite is present within sheared serpentinite above the veins and stockworks. This carbonate is present as a replacement style of mineralisation with magnesite nodules prominent in a sheared, carbonatised serpentinite matrix. This magnesite defines mineralisation of the Zone II type. [...] Petrographic examination and chemical analyses of magnesite and associated lithologies provides further clues to magnesite genesis in the Akamas area. Stable isotope analyses of magnesite, calcite and dolomite show two distinct populations of magnesite with a singular source of carbon, one precipitated around 165 °C (veins and stockworks) and the other around 40 °C (nodular magnesite). Calcite and dolomite from overlying karst sediments lie in an isotopic field comparable with typical marine carbonates. Trace element analyses of magnesite, calcite, dolomite, serpentinite and organic-rich sandstone samples indicate calcite, dolomite and serpentinite to be unlikely sources of carbon present within the magnesite. From isotope and trace element data, the source of carbon within the magnesite is likely decarboxylation of organic material. [...] A suggested model for magnesite formation would be as follows. Magnesite veins were formed during the initial disruption of the serpentinite, probably initiated by the production of CO₂ upon decarboxylation of organic-rich sediments underthrust beneath the serpentinite. The earliest magnesite <b>veins</b> were then <b>brecciated</b> by continued compressional tectonism and cemented by further cryptocrystalline magnesite precipitation. The serpentinite (including magnesite veins and stockworks) was eventuallv emplaced westward over gabbro and sheeted diabase dykes resulting in the formation of a prominent c-s shear fabric present {{at the base of the}} serpentinite. Thrusting also resulted in the formation of an intra-serpentinite shear zone which was mineralised by nodular magnesite, defining a later generation of magnesite formation. No magnesite veins are present in this shear zone. Isotope data suggest a similar source of carbon for both veins and nodules but veins were precipitated at elevated temperatures, while nodules were formed at lower temperatures. The magnesite nodules are most likely a result of remobilisation of vein material followed by precipitation as nodules in the overlying shear zone. [...] Recent precipitates of magnesite and dolomite around the study area may be the continuance of magnesite mineralisation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considered}} the geology, mineralogy, geochemistry, formation {{and evolution of}} the {{heavy rare earth element}} (HREE) mineralised Lofdal alkaline carbonatite complex (LACC), which is located on the Bergville and Lofdal farms northwest of Khorixas, in the Kunene Region of the Republic of Namibia.. Field methods used included mapping, ground and hyperspectral airborne geophysics, and sampling. Analytical techniques used were optical petrography and CL, XRF, ICP-AES, backscattered and secondary electron imaging, electron microprobe, LA-ICP-MS, leaching, as well as carbon and oxygen stable isotope determination. The LACC comprises a swarm of dykes, mainly calcite carbonatite but also dolomite and ankerite carbonatite dykes (classified into five types) and two newly discovered plugs of calcite carbonatite (‘Main’ and ‘Emanya’), with associated dykes and plugs of phonolites, syenites and rare mafic rocks. These all intrude into the Huab Metamorphic Complex basement rocks within a NE-SW shear zone over 30 km long. The main HREE host mineral is xenotime-(Y). It occurs in highly oxidised iron-rich calcite carbonatite dykes mantling and replacing zircon, associated with hematite, thorite and apatite, or associated with monazite-(Ce), synchysite-(Ce), and parisite-(Ce), replacing the fluorocarbonates; it also forms aggregates in ankerite carbonatite. Although xenotime-(Y) occurs throughout the paragenetic sequence, there is much evidence for hydrothermal fluid activity at Lofdal, altering the dykes, and taking xenotime-(Y) into <b>brecciated</b> carbonate <b>veins</b> in albitised country rock (fenite). Radiogenic (Sr, Nd-Sm, U-Pb) and C and O stable isotope studies confirm that the carbonatite, derived from an enriched mantle, {{is the source of the}} REE. Mineralisation was contemporaneous with carbonatite emplacement at 765 ± 16 Ma. Magmatic fluids > 300 °C were diluted with cool meteoric fluids. Abundant fluorite and carbonate indicate roles for F- and CO 32 - in addition to Cl- in REE transport. These ligands form the most stable complexes with HREE and since xenotime is soluble in concentrated alkali halide solutions, they could have preferentially transported and then deposited xenotime. Many of the features of Lofdal are common to other REE-rich carbonatite complexes but the xenotime-(Y) abundance is so far unique. The high amount of fluid activity in shear zones around the dyke swarm and probably a higher proportion of HREE in the original magmas seem to be the main differentiating features.

Increasing availability of seawater during dynamic recrystallization is reflected in depletions in 18 O, increasing abundance of amphibole of variable composition and metamorphic plagioclase of intermediate composition, and more complete coronitic or pseudomorphous static replacement of magmatic minerals. Downcore correlation of synkinematic assemblages, bulk-rock oxygen isotopic compositions, and vein abundance suggest that seawater is introduced into the crust by way of small cracks and veins that {{mark the end of}} the ductile phase of deformation. This "deformation-enhanced" metamorphism dominates the upper 180 and the lower 100 m of the core. In the lower 300 m of the core, mineral assemblages of greenschist and zeolite facies are abundant within or adjacent to <b>brecciated</b> zones. Leucocratic <b>veins</b> found in these zones and adjacent host rock contain diopside, sodic plagioclase, epidote, chlorite, analcime, thomsonite, natrolite, albite, quartz, actinolite, sphene, brookite, and sulfides. The presence of zircon, Cl-apatite, sodic plagioclase, sulfides, and diopside in leucocratic veins having local magmatic textures suggests that some of the veins originated from late magmas or from hydrothermal fluids exsolved from such magmas that were subsequently replaced by (seawater-derived) hydrothermal assemblages. The frequent association of these late magmatic intrusive rocks within the brecciated zones suggests that they are both artifacts of magmatic hydrofracture. Such catastrophic fracture and hydrothermal circulation could produce episodic venting of hydrothermal fluids as well as the incorporation of a magmatically derived hydrothermal component. The enhanced permeability of the brecciated zones produced lower temperature assemblages because of larger volumes of seawater that penetrated the crust. The last fractures were sealed either by these hydrothermal minerals or by late carbonate-smectite veins, resulting in the observed low permeability of the core...|$|R
40|$|Although Albania {{constitutes}} {{a relatively small}} country, it displays a unique petroliferous foreland fold-and-thrust belt (FTB) system. The Albanian fold-and-thrust belt and the Peri-Adriatic Depression are well documented by seismic reflection profiles, GPS reference points, potential data, wells and outcrops. The continuous Oligocene to Plio-Quaternary sedimentary record helps to constrain both the burial history of Mesozoic carbonate reservoirs, the timing of their deformation, and the coupled fluid flow and diagenetic scenarios. Since the mid- 90 's, the Albanian foothills were used as a natural laboratory {{to develop a new}} integrated methodology and work flow for the study of sub-thrust reservoir evolution, and to validate on real case studies the use of basin modelling tools aswell as the application of new analytical methods for the study of petroleum systems in tectonically complex areas. The integration of the interactions between petrographic and microtectonic studies, kinematic, thermal and fluid flow basin modelling, is described in detail. The main results of this collaborative study involving scientists from various European countries outline the benefits that any Earth Science project could gain in integrating various techniques and expertise, especially when dealing with sedimentary basins where both deep and shallow processes are involved. The objective of this PhD is to give {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms and timing of fracturing and fluid flow during the Albanides evolution. Results from structural analyses and petrographic investigations in three selected case studies, which are considered as reservoir analogues for neighboring reservoirs situated in the Ionian Zone, are presented. Their study allows to work out a three dimensional picture of the reservoir features and processes that control porosity and permeability. These analyses have been performed on cemented fractures in the Upper Cretaceous to Eocene deep water carbonates, considered as the best carbonatereservoir intervals in the Mediterranean zone. The results are subsequently replaced into the deformation history of the area in order to placethe different fluid migrations into their geological context. Albania represents a part of the widen Circum-Mediterranean Peri-Tethyan thrustbelts and {{constitutes a}} key area for the study of petroleum systems in foothills and thrust front domains (Van Geet et al., 2002). The Ionian tectonic zone corresponds to a foreland fold-and-thrust belt, characterised by a west verging thrusting over the Adriatic foreland. It corresponds to a complex tectonic assemblage, made up of thin-skinned allochthonous units, progressively emplaced during the Neogene deformations. The major décollement level consists of the Triassic evaporites and the major structural fault zones possess a NNW-SSE alignment. The tectonic evolution of the Albanides included a Middle LiassicLate Cretaceous phase of oceanic rifting accompanied by a passive margin formation and is divided into two major divisions: the internal and externalAlbanides. The external zone consists of two platform areas (Sazani andKruja), which are separated by the Ionian Basin, i. e. the area studied. This basin can be split into three belts: the Berati, the Kurveleshi and the Cika belts. It consists of Triassic evaporite-carbonate and Jurassic to Eocene carbonate sequences in a syn-rift and post-rift setting, covered by Lower Tertiary flysch and/or Neogene clastic deposits. The northern part of the Ionian Zone is marked by the Vlora-Elbasan transfer zone, along which most of the oil and gas fields occur in both carbonate and clastic reservoirs. Their storage is largely improved by the presence of a dual matrix/fracture porosity system. At this place, the Ionian Zone plunges below the Peri-Adriatic Depression (Roure et al., 1995). The first area studied is located near the hanging-wall of the Berati belt and is made up of Paleocene to Eocene pelagic carbonates. The fracturing of the reservoir interval has a pre-folding origin and relates to the regional flexuring in the foreland. The first recorded cement, postdating the burial stylolites development, has a meteoric signature, implying downward migration and the development of an earlier forebulge in theIonian Basin. This fluid, which precipitates at a maximum depth of 1. 5 km, is highly enriched in strontium with values up to 6960 ppm, attesting for important fluid-rock interaction with the Triassic evaporites, located in diapirs. From this stage, the horizontal tectonic compression increases and the majority of the fluid migrated under high pressure, characterised by <b>brecciated</b> and crack-seal <b>veins.</b> The tectonic burial increased up to 6 km due to the overthrusting that is pointed out by the increase of the precipitation temperature of the cements. Afterwards, upward migration of SO 42 -, Ba 2 + and Mg 2 +-rich fluids, which migrated probably along the décollement level, allow a precipitation in thermal disequilibrium. This period corresponds to the out-of-sequence development of the Berati belt from the Upper Miocene onward, implying the onset of its uplift. From shallower depth to the subsurface, the circulation of meteoric fluid likely develops a selective karstification. The second area studied is situated in the most western belt, i. e. the Cika belt, and consists of the Saranda anticline, characterised by a NNW-SSE oriented fold hinge. The core of the anticline is made up of Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous carbonates and the flanks consist of Upper Cretaceous to Eocene highly fractured deep marine carbonates. The fracturing of the reservoir interval in the Cika belt has also a pre-folding origin,associated to the flexuring of the foreland during the Lower to Middle Oligocene (Nieuwland et al., 2001). The next fracturing stages are associated to the folding of the area and the subsequent cementations record its progressive burial, indicated by an increase of the O-isotopic signatures from - 1 to - 13  V-PDB, which is directly related to the increase of the precipitation temperature. This period is also characterised by the development of a conjugated system of tectonic stylolites. From the Serravalian onward, the thrusting phase implies the uplift of the anticline towards the subsurface and the erosion of the Oligocene flysch and theNeogene molasse. The last stage corresponds to the emersion of the anticline and the migration of meteoric fluid into the carbonate system through re-opened fractures. A last tectonic reactivation implies the overthrusting of the western flank on the eastern side. During the Albanide FTB development, no overpressuring period has been recorded in the Sarandaarea. Moreover some fluids, which migrated during the folding, contain non-euhedral barite, likely originated from the Neogene molasse. This likely suggests downward migration. The Kremenara anticline, located in the northern part of the Kurveleshibelt at the vicinity of the Vlora-Elbasan transfer zone, has the particularity to demonstrate oil seeps in a dual matrix-fracture porosity system. This anticline is characterised by a NNE-SSW oriented fold hinge, which does not describe the specific NNW-SSE orientation of the main structural features occurring in the Ionian Basin. Here, the main fracturing stages have a post-folding origin and the fractures relate mainly to twomain principal stresses  1, oriented N 110 ° and N 70 °. This area studied is characterised by an early folding and the migration of meteoric fluid, which precipitated non-luminescent calcite cement. The post-folding stage is characterised by a second burial stage, caused by an increase of the sedimentary overburden, and the development of two main overpressuring regimes. The latter compressions are pointed out by the occurrence of crack-seal and <b>brecciated</b> <b>veins,</b> which respectively relate to N 110 °- and N 70 °-oriented compressions. An interaction with an evaporitic interval has also been suggested by the positive O-isotopic signature of the crack-seal veins. From the Serravalian, the N 70 °-oriented compression developed NNW-SSE transversal faults, which compartmentalise the anticline. Then, an E-W compression generated an overthrusting of the anticline towards the south-west. This period is likely associated to the out-of-sequence development of the Berati belt. The reorientation of thecompression during the last stage may be associated to the vicinity of the Vlora-Elbasan transfer zone (Swennen et al., 1998). The Kremenara anticline was not buried deeply, since the Kurveleshi belt has been upliftearly in the Albanide development. This is in agreement with the O-isotopic signatures, which plot down to - 5  V-PDB, and is close to the signature of the Upper Cretaceous to Eocene host-rocks. The fluid flow modelling allowed to reconstruct the hydrocarbon generation and migration but also to trace the changes in the water flow through time (origin, migration pathways and velocity). The third utility consists of determining the evolution of the overpressuring periods through time and space and then to correlate them to the overpressuring periods determined by studying the fracture-fillings. This will help to place the diagenetic evolution in the tectonic evolution of the FTB. The main results of the hydrocarbon fluid flow modelling show that the Upper Cretaceous-Eocene carbonate reservoirs in the Ionian zone have been charged from the Tortonian onward, and that meteoric fluid migration should have intensely biodegraded the hydrocarbon in place. Concerning the migration paths, it has been demonstrated that the thrusts act principally as flowbarriers in Albania, mainly due the occurrence of evaporites (non-permeable), except in the foreland, where they do not occur. The results of the modelling demonstrate that the water migrations are dominantly vertical during the flexure of the foreland. Then the increase of the sedimentary overburden and the thrusting of the units imply upward water migration under high pore fluid pressure. The development of a high topographicrelief caused large downward and lateral meteoric flow migration, whichare characterised by higher velocities. From the thrusting phase onward, the faults act as flow barriers, due to the occurrence of evaporites along the décollement levels and compartmentalise the reservoir interval. nrpages: 188 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The Moonlight deposit {{is a recent}} discovery peripheral to the Pajingo mine, located in the Drummond basin, North Queensland. The study has addressed ores and host rock in four drillcores from {{the upper part of}} the epithermal mineralization at Moonlight to determine the mineralogical and geochemical character of the mineralisation and associated alteration. Sampling was focussed on high-grade and sulfide-rich intervals. The chosen approach gave particular focus to the speciation, textures and distribution of precious metals at Pajingo and the implications of the different pyrite textures and mineral chemistry, with respect to both conditions of ore formation and the role of pyrite as a gold carrier. Moonlight ore is largely located within altered andesites and <b>brecciated</b> epiclastic rocks. <b>Veins,</b> marked by coarse chalcedony crosscut the epiclastics. There is evidence for a sinter above the ores, indicating formation within a sub-basin and for propylitic and argillic alteration alongside the dominant silicification. Pyrite from both high- and low-grade sulfide-bearing intersections was analysed by laser-ablation inductively-coupled mass spectroscopy. It was found to contain an average of 69. 8 ppm Au, suggesting that ‘invisible gold’ in pyrite contributes significantly to the overall gold balance, even if it is subordinate to visible gold. Au:Ag ratios in analysed electrum varied from 60 : 40 to 40 : 60, suggesting that there is some considerable risk of slow-floating Ag-rich electrum. Silver is present as native silver, acanthite (Ag 2 S), naumannite (Ag 2 Se), polybasite [(Ag,Cu) 6 (Sb,As) 2 S 7][Ag 9 CuS 4], pyragarite (Ag 3 SbS 3) and minor hessite (Ag 2 Te), as well as in solid solution and/or inclusions in pyrite. Pyrite textures observed in the study are diverse and indicate that the epithermal system that generated the Moonlight deposit was complex and possibly multi-phase. Variation in assemblages and mineral chemistry implies substantial evolution in the physicochemical parameters of the ore -forming fluid during the life of the hydrothermal system. LA-ICPMS element mapping of a complex, zoned pyrite grain showed a core enriched in Co, Ni and Sb; onto this is superposed As, Au. Resorption and overgrowths indicate that the pyrite has been reworked. A characteristic ‘dirty’, feathery pyrite is of replacement origin and may have pseudomorphed chlorite that resulted from an earlier propylitic alteration. No direct evidence was found to substantiate the working mine model in which high-grade ‘bonanza’ veins are predicted at depth, however observations of lithologies from the level investigated in this study are consistent with the model. The high Ag content of the Moonlight ores, together with a distinct base metal presence (sphalerite, tetrahedrite) could mean that the Moonlight system is more distal to the fluid source than Vera-Nancy and was possibly formed at somewhat cooler temperatures on the flank of the main volcanic system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the diagenetic history of dual (i. e. matrix and fracture) porosity reservoir lithologies in Cretaceous to Eocene carbonate turbidites of the Ionian fold and thrust belt, {{close to the}} oil-producing centre of Fier-Ballsh (central Albania). The first major diagenetic event controlling reservoir quality was early cementation by isopachous and syntaxial low-Mg calcite. These cements formed primarily around crinoid and rudist fragments, which acted as nucleation sites. In sediments in which these bioclasts are the major rock constituent, this cement can make up 30 % of the rock volume, resulting in low effective porosity. In strata in which these bioclasts are mixed with reworkedmicrite, isopachous/syntaxial cements stabilized the framework, and matrixporosity is around 15 %. The volumetric importance of these cements, their optical and luminescence character (distribution and dull orange luminescence) and stable isotopic signal (delta(18) O and delta(13) C averaging respectively; - 0. 5 parts per thousand VPDB and + 2 parts per thousand VPDB) all support a marine phreatic origin. Within these turbidites and debris flows, several generations of fractures alternated with episodes of cementation. A detailed reconstruction of this history was based on cross-cutting relationships of fractures and compactional and layer-parallel shortening (LPS) stylolites. The prefolding calcite veins possess orange cathodoluminescence {{similar to that of}} the host rock. Their stable isotope signatures (delta(18) O of - 3. 86 to - 0. 85 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of - 0. 14 to + 2. 98 parts per thousand VPDB) support a closed diagenetic rock-buffered system. A similar closed system accounts for the selectively reopened and subsequently calcite-cemented LPS stylolites (delta(18) O of - 1. 81 to - 1. 14 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of + 1. 52 to + 2. 56 parts per thousand VPDB). Within the prefolding <b>veins,</b> <b>brecciated</b> host rock fragments and complex textures such as crack and seal features resulted from hydraulic fracturing. They reflect expulsion of overpressured fluids within the footwall of the frontal thrusts. After folding and thrust sheet emplacement, some calcite veins are still rock buffered (delta(18) O of - 0. 96 to + 0. 2 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of + 0. 79 to + 1. 37 parts per thousand VPDB), whereas others reflect external (i. e. extraformational) and thus large-scale fluid fluxes. Some of these veins are linked to basement-derived fluid circulation or originated from fluid flow along evaporitic decollement horizons (delta(18) O around + 3. 0 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C around + 1. 5 parts per thousand VPDB). Others are related to the maturation of hydrocarbons in the system (delta(18) O around - 7. 1 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C around + 9. 3 parts per thousand VPDB). An open joint system reflecting an extensional stress regime developed during or after the final folding stage. This joint system enhanced vertical connectivity. This open joint network can be explained by the high palaeotopographical position and the folding of the reservoir analogue within the deformational front. The joint system is pre-Burdigalian in age based upon a dated karstified discordance contact. status: publishe...|$|R
