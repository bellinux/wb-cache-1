25|$|Founder Steve Sullivan {{grew up in}} Los Gatos, California, and {{enrolled}} at the University of California, Berkeley in 1975, intending to major in rhetoric. He earned money as a busboy at Chez Panisse. While riding his bike through England during a summer trip to Europe he bought English Bread and Yeast Cookery, Elizabeth David's 1977 book on <b>breadmaking</b> and bread history. Excited by the book, and wanting to recreate the bread he had enjoyed in Paris, he began experimenting with baking for himself. In 1979, when ChezPanisse's then-supplier, the Cheese Board Collective, could {{not keep up with}} its demands, Sullivan became the restaurant's in-house breadmaker. However, his <b>breadmaking</b> and the restaurant's food preparation were both competing for the restaurant's limited physical space. In 1983 he left, with the restaurant's encouragement, to open his own company, Acme. Jeremiah Tower, then head chef, encouraged Sullivan to study <b>breadmaking</b> at Narsai David's bakery. He and wife Susan launched Acme with approximately $180,000 of seed capital, half funded by Doobie Brothers guitarist Patrick Simmons through a leaseback arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in <b>breadmaking</b> and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and {{converts}} it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern <b>breadmaking</b> techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E

25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and <b>breadmaking)</b> because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E
500|$|While {{wine was}} the most common table {{beverage}} in much of Europe, {{this was not the case}} in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated. Those who could afford it drank imported wine, but even for nobility in these areas it was common to drink beer or ale, particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages. In England, the Low Countries, northern Germany, Poland and Scandinavia, beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes and age groups. By the mid-15th century, barley, a cereal known to be somewhat poorly suited for <b>breadmaking</b> but excellent for brewing, accounted for 27% of all cereal acreage in England. However, the heavy influence from Arab and Mediterranean culture on medical science (particularly due to the Reconquista and the influx of Arabic texts) meant that beer was often heavily disfavoured. For most medieval Europeans, it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine, lemons and olive oil. Even comparatively exotic products like camel's milk and gazelle meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts. Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities. In 1256, the Sienese physician Aldobrandino described beer in the following way: ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{were other}} {{examples}} of monasteries replacing earlier hermitages – notably Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, founded by the powerful FitzAlan family, also in the 12th century. However, William's family were only fairly minor landowners and, although he gave generously from what he had, the priory was not well-endowed at the outset. He was able donate {{some of his own}} tenants at West Bromwich. He also gave various geographically-defined resources, not all of them now recognisable. There was Wavera in Handsworth – perhaps a water feature like a pond or weir; an assart or patch of farmland taken from the royal forest, called Ruworth; Duddesrudding; an area of land between Petulf Greene and the main road, apparently adjacent to the donation at Handsworth; [...] a puteum – generally a well but possibly a pit - at West Bromwich; a watermill at Grete - by Greets Green, the other side of West Bromwich. William also granted the monks tithes of his own household's production – their <b>breadmaking,</b> hunting, mills, bread, ale, and ferculorum – of the very platters of food cooked in his kitchens table.; and wood for burning and building. A very valuable grant to the monks was pasture in all seasons and for whatever animals they wished in the manor of West Bromwich. The most important endowment was the block of land on the eastern side of West Bromwich parish, along the boundary with Handsworth, which formed the kernel of the priory's estates. The monks exercised manorial jurisdiction over the estates, with the right to hold a manorial court like other landowners.|$|E

50|$|During the American Civil War (1861-1865), {{the demand}} for {{portable}} and quickly-made food was high, while skilled labor for traditional <b>breadmaking</b> was scarce. This encouraged the adoption of bread which was rapidly made and leavened with baking soda, instead of yeast. The shortage of chemical leaveners in the American South during the Civil War contributed to a food crisis there.|$|E

50|$|In <b>breadmaking,</b> {{local custom}} favours {{the use of}} durum wheat, bread flour and barley bread. For bread made with yeast (called criscituni) and cooked on an oven stone, Brindisi bakers use bundles of olive {{branches}} to give the bread a particular scent. One type of traditional bread is made with olives (called puccia). It is made with a much more refined wheat flour than for ordinary bread, to which are added black olives.|$|E
50|$|Barley {{bread is}} a type of bread made from barley flour derived from the grain of the barley plant. In the British Isles it is a bread which dates back to the Iron Age.

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age, about 12,000 years ago, {{humanity}} entered a period of increasing technological sophistication. For reasons that are still disputed, many of the large mammals hunted by humans became extinct, driving the development of new food sources: <b>breadmaking</b> considerably predates this period, but people in Mesopotamia now began cultivating wild cereal and pulses. Dogs had been domesticated over thousands of years; nomadic shepherding became possible through domestication of goats, sheep, horses, camels and cattle.|$|E

50|$|A mill was at Matching Hall by 1350. Windmill {{field in}} 1624 lay {{south of the}} lane leading to Matching Hall. In 1843 there were two {{windmills}} in the parish. One, belonging to John Selwin, lay about ¼ mile east of his mansion of Down Hall. Matching mill lay about 700 yds south of Housham Hall. The Down Hall mill had gone by 1874. This closely matches the rise of industrial <b>breadmaking</b> in the country. Matching Mill, a post mill, continued to trade until the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|Grain drying is {{an active}} area of {{manufacturing}} and research. The performance of a dryer can be simulated with computer programs based on mathematical models that represent the phenomena involved in drying: physics, physical chemistry, thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer. Most recently computer models {{have been used to}} predict product quality by achieving a compromise between drying rate, energy consumption, and grain quality. A typical quality parameter in wheat drying is <b>breadmaking</b> quality and germination percentage whose reductions in drying are somewhat related.|$|E
