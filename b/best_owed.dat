40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the role played by}} {{imagination}} in the Transcendental Deduction argument from Kant’s Kritik der reinen Vernunft, focusing particularly on the differences between the 1781 and 1787 editions. My aim is to put into question the starting point of Heidegger’s interpretation presented in Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik. In contrast I will provide a construal of both editions,according to which it is actually in the second edition where Kant reached a proper understanding of the autonomy of imagination in the argument. If the first edition <b>best</b> <b>owed</b> such an important role on this faculty, it is because Kant still had not distinguished sharply between the subjective and the objective dimensions of its activity in the process of knowledge, as would be remarkably revealed if one were to pay a close attention to Kant’s «aesthetic project» in the 1780 ’s. In contrast, in the 1787 edition, Kant focused only on the determining activity of imagination qua transcendental, as long as the Deduction is to prove merely the objective validity of knowledge. Against Heidegger, I claim that such exclusio of the subjective and sensible dimension of imagination in the Kritik der reinen Vernunft {{is due to the fact}} that in 1787 Kant had found a new place to tackle this question with in the general frame work of the critical foundation of metaphysics, namely, the Kritik der Urteilskraft...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} entitled, “Design of Multifunctional Magnetic Nanostructures for Targeted Delivery of Anticancer Drugs” is an {{embodiment of}} the investigations aimed at developing multifunctional magnetic nanoparticles intended for administration of some leading anticancer drugs and simultaneous monitoring of the treatment by imaging techniques. The possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications of these multifunctional nanosystems have been explored in vitro. The thesis has been divided into seven chapters. Monodispersed amine functionalized MFe 2 O 4 (M= Co, Mn, Ni) spherical nanoassemblies of size 35 - 50 nm have been prepared following simple solvochemical approach. The synthesis was accomplished by refluxing metal chloride precursors in ethylene glycol in presence of sodium acetate and ethanolamine. Due to large surface area, high density of amine groups and good aqueous dispersion stability these ferrites may serve as potential materials in biomedical application. Further, CoFe 2 O 4 made by this method was conjugated to anticancer drug methotrexate or doxorubincin, marker molecule folic acid and a fluorescent marker molecule rhodamine isothiocyanate to develop a multifunctional nanoparticle. These drug loaded particles shows combined advantages of superparamagnetism, receptor mediated endocytosis and pH sensitive drug release behavior. Magnetic mesoporous amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles with a size of 62 nm and abundant – COOH groups on the surface have been prepared by a simple method. The presence of high surface area and large number of carboxylate groups, facilitate the incorporation of platinum pharmacophore cis-diaquadiamine platinum (II), folic acid and rhodamine isothiocyanate within its porous network. The cytotoxicity and internalization efficiency of these nanocarriers have been evaluated on folate receptor overexpressed HeLa cells. These drug loaded nanoagents exhibit elevated cytotoxicity and induce apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore development of theranostic mesoporous hollow silica nanospheres having therapeutic and diagnostic functions has been established. The internal space of the hollow spheres was utilised to clutch the hydrophobic anticancer drug pemetrexed and superparamagnetic CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles while the external surface was chemically modified to graspthe platinum pharmacophore CDDP [cis-diaquadiamino platinum (II) ], the marker molecule folic acid and the fluorescent dye RITC. Magnetic hollow spheres loaded with multiple therapeutic cargoes as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity as compared to individual drugs. Simple inexpensive magnetic mesoporous carbon-based multimodal theranostic nanoagent <b>best</b> <b>owed</b> with magnetic targeting, T 2 contrast behavior, fluorescence imaging, high loading and controlled release of the anticancer drug doxorubicin has been developed. Due to surface modification with carboxylic acid groups the nanoparticles are highly stable in aqueous buffer.

The Cantabrian canned anchovy is world-renowned owing to its handmade and traditional manufacture. The canning process generates huge amounts of several food wastes, whose suitable management can contribute to benefits for both {{the environment and the}} economy, closing the loop of the product life cycle. Life cycle assessment methodology was used in this work to assess the environmental performance of two waste management alternatives: Head and spine valorisation to produce fishmeal and fish oil; and anchovy meat valorisation to produce anchovy paste. Fuel oil production has been a hotspot of the valorisation of heads and spines, so several improvements should be applied. With respect to anchovy meat valorisation, the production of polypropylene and glass for packaging was the least environmentally friendly aspect of the process. Furthermore, the environmental characterisation of anchovy waste valorisation was compared with incineration and landfilling alternatives. In both cases, the valorisation management options were the <b>best</b> <b>owing</b> to the avoided burdens associated with the processes.

30|$|First, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the three message density approximation considered in Section 4. As evidenced by Figures 6 and 7, codes designed by using the mode-matched approximation gives the maximum output mutual information from a SCF node. In order to compare the three approximation methods on the basis of code performance, in Figure 8, we present the probability of decoding error of codes designed using each of these methods. Here, the correlation parameter α and the channel noise variance σ 2 are identical to those used in Figure 7 (for which the density of outgoing messages from SCF nodes is bi-modal). These results confirm that the mode-matched approximation tends to yield the <b>best</b> codes, <b>owing</b> to the skewed nature of the pdf of the output messages from SCF nodes.

Methods: Fumed silica, bentonite (BN), hydrotalcite (HT), MCM- 41, Na-Y, mordenite (MOR) and SAPO- 34 were used at different adsorbent-to-metal ion ratios. Two predominant species of Cr were considered including chromate and hydrogen chromate ions. Results: Both HT and Na-Y adsorbed the toxic bichromate ions more favorably than other sorbents. Overall, the efficiency of the Cr removal followed the sequence of HT > SAPO- 34 > MOR > MCM- 41 > Na-Y > silica > BN. Because of its surface chemistry, HT with an uptake of 65. 2 mg/g showed the highest toxic abatement among the seven adsorbents investigated under the acidic conditions, followed by the microporous materials SAPO- 34 and MOR with uptakes of 41. 2 and 41. 0 mg/g, respectively.
