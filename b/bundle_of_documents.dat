40|$|Research {{solutions}} in life science are <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>documented</b> knowledge (i. e., a manual) and materials provided by commercial firms to help scientists with their experiments. This study builds on existing research on post-adoptive usage {{to understand why}} some scientists {{are more likely to}} make modifications-personalization, customization, invention changes (including making add-ins and using existing functions for novel purposes) -to a research solution after their adoptions. By examining the different modification behaviors of 1908 scientists over a sixteen-year period, the authors find that the likelihood of users in making modifications are positively impacted by their diverse range of usage experience, early usage status, and collaborative support from the scientific community. While expertise can {{have a positive impact on}} the personalization and customization modifications, it has an inverted U-shaped relationship with invention changes. Interestingly, the effects from the characteristics of a research solution are mixed. For example, ease of use can negatively impact on a user's likelihood to make personalization and customization modifications or create add-ins, but it is positively linked to the likelihood in applying existing functions for novel purposes.

60|$|I might fill many {{pages with}} {{instances}} of this diseased American appetite for English soil. A respectable-looking woman, well advanced in life, of sour aspect, exceedingly homely, but decidedly New-Englandish in figure and manners, {{came to my}} office with a great <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> at the very first glimpse of which I apprehended something terrible. Nor was I mistaken. The bundle contained evidences of her indubitable claim to the site on which Castle Street, the Town Hall, the Exchange, and all the principal business part of Liverpool have long been situated; and with considerable peremptoriness, the good lady signified her expectation that I should take charge of her suit, and prosecute it to judgment; not, however, on the equitable condition of receiving half {{the value of the}} property recovered (which, in case of complete success, would have made both of us ten or twenty fold millionaires), but without recompense or reimbursement of legal expenses, solely as an incident of my official duty. Another time came two ladies, bearing a letter of emphatic introduction from his Excellency the Governor of their native State, who testified in most satisfactory terms to their social respectability. They were claimants of a great estate in Cheshire, and announced themselves as blood-relatives of Queen Victoria,--a point, however, which they deemed it expedient to keep in the background until their territorial rights should be established, apprehending that the Lord High Chancellor might otherwise be less likely to come to a fair decision in respect to them, from a probable disinclination to admit new members into the royal kin. Upon my honor, I imagine that they had an eye to the possibility of the eventual succession of one or both of them to the crown of Great Britain through superiority of title over the Brunswick line; although, being maiden ladies, like their predecessor Elizabeth, they could hardly have hoped to establish a lasting dynasty upon the throne. It proves, I trust, a certain disinterestedness on my part, that, encountering them thus in the dawn of their fortunes, I forbore to put in a plea for a future dukedom.|$|E

40|$|Ohara had {{traditionally}} supplied {{forest products}} to downtown Kyoto prior to World War II. A number <b>of</b> historical <b>documents</b> concerning {{the history of}} forestry and forest lands in Ohara are available. Previous articles have introduced some <b>of</b> these <b>documents,</b> which related to (l) the production and sale of firewood from the Edo Period to the early Meiji Period, (2) Kimura Sohemon, governor of the forests in Ohara through the Edo Period {{and the beginning of}} the Meiji Period, and (3) the transfer of forest ownership to temples in Ohara throughout the Edo Period. This article (4) introduces 19 historical documents related to forest management by Kimura Sohemon, magistrate of Gonyubokuyama, who managed forests in Ohara through the Edo period. The forest management work of Sohemon and his staff is partially revealed through these documents. In this article (4), the documents are presented in chronological order, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>document</b> 19, for which the date is unknown. Documents 1 - 4, 6, 7, 10, II, and 17 resemble databases on the forests governed by Sohemon, which are referred to as Gonyubokuyama. Most documents related to Ohara refer to the same eight villages, but in these forestry-related documents, an additional village, Kodeishi, is sometimes included as well. The area included in these databases varies: document 4 includes all nine villages <b>of</b> Ohara; <b>documents</b> 1 - 3, 7, 10, and II include Shorinin Temple, which is one of the two major temples in Ohara; and documents 6 and 17 include the Onagase village. These documents generally include the name of the forest; the forest owner's name; and the northern, southern, eastern, and western boundaries of the forest. Some documents also mention a sort of forest-related tax. This tax is presented for each forest unit as a number <b>of</b> <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> firewood Kuroki). <b>Documents</b> 8 and 9 are reports submitted to Sohemon from the Shorinin Temple. The content of both reports is related to landslide damage incurred in Gonyubokuyama and the countermeasures practiced by the forest owner. Documents 12 - 14 are indirectly related to forest management works. Documents 12 and 13 include brief explanations of the historical development of the tax levied in <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> firewood. <b>Document</b> 14 is a charcoal-production agreement made between nine villages. The document mentions that residents of the village of Kodeishi asked Sohemon for permission to produce charcoal. Document 18 suggests that it was necessary for a villager to obtain permission from Sohemon if he wanted to sell his house and lands when forest lands were involved. Documents 5, 15, 16, and 19 are partially related to the cutting activities in Gonyubokuyama. In document 5, some woods in Gonyubokuyama were needed for construction materials, and some people including Sohemon's staff planned to visit the Gonyubokuyama. Documents 15 and 16 are memoranda related to cutting activities in Gonyubokuyama, and document 19 refers to standing trees in and around Gonyubokuyama. These documents reveal that the relationship between forest owners and Sohemon was not limited to the payment of a tax levied in <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> firewood and the management of registered standing trees. Instead, the role of Kimura Sohemon in forest management in Ohara appears to have been similar, to some degree, to that of the current forest administration office...|$|R

40|$|This {{review reports}} {{findings}} from the peer review panel (‘the Panel’) assessment of the Tonkin & Taylor Ltd (2015) report: Coastal Hazard Assessment – Stage Two (‘the Report’). The Panel were asked to address four overarching questions in this review (‘the Review’), covering both the science and legal context of the report. These were (i) Does the report represent good science?; (ii) Are the findings still relevant in terms of new research?; (iii) Has the report taken account of relevant statutory policy documents in providing technical or expert advice (refer to Appendix E GHD TOR as a guide) ?; and (iv) Is the report and its findings appropriate for its intended purpose - to inform planning for future land use decisions (all referred to as Appendix E GHD <b>Bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>Documents</b> for full purpose statements) ? The Panel found that the Report’s purpose went beyond the technical assessment of areas subject to coastal hazards as required under Policy 24 of the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement (2010) (‘NZCPS’). Requiring mapping suitable {{to be included in}} the district plan should have required draft mapping. Such a technical exercise constitutes the first scientific stage in the process of eventually producing maps which are suitable for inclusion in the Proposed Christchurch Replacement District Plan (CRDP). This technical stage should be followed by adaptive planning and application of a precautionary approach identified in Policies 3, 25 and 26 NZCPS before such maps are finalised. Notwithstanding, the Panel finds that the Report could, and should, constitute a suitable and robust technical basis on which to proceed towards the next stage of development of coastal hazard maps for the district of Christchurch after recommended modifications are made. This Review outlines recommendations for work that should be completed before the results of the Report are used to inform the next stages in establishing coastal hazard provisions for the CRDP. We also make suggestions for future work that could be incorporated into the first reassessment of the coastal hazard zones (planned to occur in around 10 years’ time). To be clear, the recommendations are the only work that the Panel indicates needs to be done now. Positive aspects of the Report included spatial data as requested by CCC on areas susceptible to coastal hazards, including the future timeframes of 2065 and 2115. It included the coastal settlements located on unconsolidated shorelines within CCC’s jurisdictional boundaries. The Report also gave close attention to the documents that are directly relevant to an exercise of this technical kind, namely MfE (2008 b) (shortly to be updated), and Ramsay et al (2012). The Report met with what might be considered truncated time frames for a technical exercise encompassing coastal erosion and inundation over many open coast and harbour sites. The Report did not consult the community, nor was this within its Terms of Reference. Community consultation is not a requirement in Table I of the Ramsay et al (2012) good practice guide for this technical stage but rather is a requirement for the subsequent adaptive planning stage. Page 1 of 75 The Report was based on a single IPCC scenario RCP 8. 5, which is commonly used in hazard assessments. However, the subsequent adaptive stage of coastal hazard zone mapping will benefit from considering a range of scenarios. Thus, the Panel recommends that additional work is conducted to produce coastal hazard assessments for more than one IPCC scenario. Regarding the open coast Coastal Erosion Hazard Zones (CEHZ), the Panel endorses a probabilistic approach, but recommends that the analysis use more appropriate probability distributions than the triangular distributions used in the Report. The open coast CEHZ is also dependent on the Waimakariri River sediment supply. The Panel recommends that the open coast CEHZ is reassessed for a range of sediment budget scenarios - with the current ‘no change’ scenario forming the middle scenario. This can readily be done with the probabilistic modelling approach. In assessing the Coastal Inundation Hazard Zone (CIHZ) for the Open Coast (New Brighton, Sumner, Taylors Mistake) and for the harbour environments of Lyttelton and Akaroa, overall the Panel conclude that the simple ‘building block bathtub’ approach used is acceptable. In assessing the harbour CIHZ, however, the Panel acknowledges that the assumption that all components concurrently reach extreme values is conservative. The Panel suggests that the likelihood of concurrence of extreme waves and coincidence of peak wave setup and wind setup be investigated for inclusion in the next (i. e. ‘ 10 years’ into the future) reassessment. For the Avon- Heathcote Estuary and Brooklands Lagoon CIHZ, TUFLOW hydrodynamic modelling is used in the Report, but does not consider the effects of river baseflows and concurrent rainfall. The Panel suggests that river baseflows and rainfall, and the influence of climate change on them, be incorporated in the next reassessment. The indicated coastal erosion hazard zone CEHZ for all harbour sites is not a robust indication of the likely erosion hazard for these specific areas. The Panel recommends that they are re-assessed with more attention to detail and on-ground inspections. The ‘high tide translation’ method approach should not be used and only the ‘equilibrium profile’ values considered. The Report acknowledged the occurrence of ground elevation changes with the earthquakes and appropriately uses the 2011 LiDAR survey for baseline ground elevations. The Report did not assess earthquake-induced changes in groundwater depths and should not do so as this separate exercise is in the area of responsibility of EQC. NZCPS Policy 24 (1) (a) -(h) is the only NZCPS provision relevant to a technical exercise at the first stage in identifying the coastal environment potentially affected by coastal hazard risk and the likely effects of climate change including sea level rise. It was not identified in the Tonkin & Taylor Terms of Reference for the Report, and should have been. Page 2 of 75 NZCPS Objective 5 and other relevant policies – Policy 3 Precautionary approach, Policy 25 Subdivision, use and development in areas of coastal hazard risk, and Policy 27 Strategies for protecting significant existing development from coastal hazard risk, and its consequences, are all relevant to the next stages of providing mapping of such areas to a sufficient standard {{to be included in the}} CRDP – stages and mapping to be defined with the involvement of the community and stakeholders. An evaluation required under s 32 RMA is only undertaken after information provided by CCC and other experts are brought together to further inform the community, stakeholders and CCC officials on such matters as cost, benefit and the other issues identified in Appendix B. This is to inform through a process of adaptive management the evaluation report for CCC to approve under s 32 sometime in the future. The hazard maps generated from the results of the Report should be withdrawn for now until the final mapping is concluded. The hazard lines may end up being reinforced after this stage but in the meantime the Coastal Hazard Zones (CHZ) formerly established by ECan may suffice as an interim measure for the open coast, but these do not apply to most of the harbour coasts. Overall, it is recommended that CCC and ECan work more closely together to develop such information resources as are needed for the coastal hazard assessment and community considerations of adaptive management pathways as part of an integrated approach to coastal management...|$|E

[...] As well as forming the basis for two BBC documentaries, [...] "Deadly Legacy" [...] (broadcast 14 April 1993) and [...] "An Acceptable Level of Death" [...] (14 April 1994) and two BBC Radio 4 programmes, [...] "The Shocking Story of Asbestos" [...] (6 October 1993) and [...] "Asbestos and the Third World" [...] (13 October 1993), the documents provided crucial information to lawyers in the U.K. who had previously been told that such information was no longer kept, and also revealed how early the company had known about the real risks <b>of</b> asbestos.

Previously, this definition of relevance has been related to the matching between resources and query terms but recently the emphasis is shifting towards a more personalised model based on the relevance of a particular resource for one specific user. We introduce our system, Fetch, which adopts this concept within an information-seeking environment specifically designed to provide users with means to describe a long-term multifaceted information need. By taking advantage {{of the way in which}} users <b>bundle</b> together groups <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> representing a particular topic, query languages as we know them can be taken to a higher and more useful level of abstraction. The agent personalises the search experience by using this information to formulate queries with the aim <b>of</b> returning <b>documents</b> relevant to the user’s information need. In this paper we report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use based on information collected in the pilot evaluation. 1...|$|R
