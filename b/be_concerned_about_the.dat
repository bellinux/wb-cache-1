5|$|Meanwhile, in 2004 the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board {{conducted}} a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before. The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons, the CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven, and the Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion killed one, prompting the report. Their report showed that between 1980 and 2005, there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries. The Board found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and {{made a number of}} recommendations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. These had been partly implemented by 2008.

5|$|From 1936 on, several admirers {{tried unsuccessfully}} to persuade Sorabji to record Opus clavicembalisticum. Given that Sorabji had not {{recorded}} any of his works, and {{that none of them}} had been published since 1931, his friends and admirers began to <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fate of his output. The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday (1912–1997), who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades. In the early 1950s Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music. Sorabji received the letter in 1953, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas (just over £127). Holliday's perseverance and closeness to Sorabji did, however, eventually change Sorabji's attitude, and several recordings were made in Sorabji's house between 1962 and 1968. Holliday also helped with the WNCN broadcast of Sorabji's music in 1970 (which took place without Sorabji's consent). Their friendship ended in 1979 as a result of disagreements about some of Sorabji's decisions.|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared to <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that {{can be applied to the}} benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

25|$|While {{a public}} {{authority}} may have fulfilled {{the legal and}} factual conditions {{required in order to}} properly exercise its statutory power, it may be deemed to have acted illegally if it makes its decision in a manner that contravenes administrative law rules. Under this category of judicial review, the courts' basic approach is to inquire if a decision-maker has taken into account all relevant considerations that it is required to take into account, and disregarded the irrelevant ones in making its decision. If it is satisfied that the decision-maker has done so, then the decision will stand, subject to other administrative law rules having been satisfied. The emphasis here is not on the body's decision itself, but on certain aspects of the reasoning process by which the decision was reached. Such an approach is consistent with the fundamental idea of judicial review that courts should not <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> merits of a decision, but instead, only with its legality.|$|E

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Saakadze {{and the death of}} Shah Abbas I in 1629, Teimuraz {{proceeded}} to strengthen his authority in eastern Georgia. He instigated Zurab of Aragvi to murder Semayun Khan, an Iranian-appointed rival king of Kartli in 1630, and then had Zurab assassinated, thereby getting rid of them both. By the early 1630s, Teimuraz I had gained more or less stable control of both Kartli and Kakheti. Determined to eliminate the Safavid hegemony over Georgia, Teimuraz sent his ambassador, Niciphores Irbachi, to Western Europe and requested the aid from Philip IV of Spain and Pope Urban VIII. However, the rulers of Europe were too involved in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) to <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fate of a small Caucasian kingdom, and nothing came of this mission, the publication of the first Georgian printed book Dittionario giorgiano e italiano ("Georgian-Italian Dictionary"; Rome, 1629) by Stefano Paolini and Niciphores Irbachi being the only result of this embassy.|$|E
25|$|With no {{significant}} opposition from Italy, Hitler proceeded with Anschluß, the annexation of Austria in 1938. Germany later claimed the Sudetenland, a province of Czechoslovakia inhabited mostly by Germans. Mussolini {{felt he had}} little choice but to help Germany to avoid isolation. With the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Fascist regime began to <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> majority ethnic German population in Southern Tyrol and whether they would want to join a Greater Germany. The Fascists were also concerned about whether Italy should follow National Socialist antisemitic policies in order to gain favor from those National Socialists who had mixed feelings about Italy as an ally. In 1938, Mussolini pressured fellow Fascist members to support the enacting of antisemitic policies, but this was not well taken as a number of Fascists were Jewish and antisemitism was not an active political concept in Italy. Nevertheless, Mussolini forced through antisemitic legislation even while his own son-in-law and prominent Fascist Count Galeazzo Ciano personally condemned such laws. In turn for enacting the extremely unpopular antisemitic laws, Mussolini and the Fascist government demanded a concession from Hitler and the National Socialists. In 1939, the Fascists demanded from Hitler that his government willingly accept the Italian government's plan to have all Germans in South Tyrol either leave Italy or be forced to accept Italianization. Hitler agreed and thus the threat to Italy from the South Tyrol Germans was neutralized.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), an {{industry}} committee on standardization, developed {{a system of}} designating spectral responses.

Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned [...] "S-numbers" [...] (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today.

No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.|$|E
