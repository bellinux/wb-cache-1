50|$|A beating net, {{also known}} as beating sheet, beat sheet or <b>beating</b> <b>tray,</b> is a device used to collect insects.It {{consists}} of a white cloth stretched out on a circular or rectangular frame which may be dismantled for transport. The <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> is held under a tree or shrub and the foliage is then shaken or beaten with a stick. Insects fall from the plant and land on the cloth. They can then be examined or collected using a pooter. Advanced beating trays have a conical net, a screen, a sleeve and a choke which can be released letting the insects fall into a container. The insect beating net was devised by George Carter Bignell.|$|E

Samplings {{were made in the}} springs of 2003 and 2004 (October), and autumns of 2004 and 2005 (May), using a <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> method, along two trails of the park. Sampling effort (hours x collectors) in the quantitative collections totaled 153 hours. Two-hundred mirid specimens of 50 species were collected. The most abundant mirid was Prepops setosipes (Reuter, 1910), representing 23 % of the collected individuals, followed by Collaria capixaba Carvalho & Fontes, 1981 (10. 5 %) and Tropidosteptes cribratus (Stål, 1860) (7 %), the latter recorded in all sampling periods. The highest abundance was observed in the springs of 2003 and 2004, with 53 and 78 individuals, respectively. Rarefaction method showed that estimated species richness was higher in autumn/ 2004 than in the other sampling periods, and higher along Yucumã than in Garcia trail. Besides a higher species richeness, Yucumã had more exclusive species than Garcia trail. The percent of species represented by one or two specimens in quantitative samplings (singletons and doubletons) was 60 %. Additional samplings including hand collection, random <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> and light trap collections added 20 species not recorded in the quantitative samplings...|$|E
40|$|Insects are {{essential}} to tropical ecosystems functioning. In semi-arid regions, the increase in abundance and/or activity (e. g. reproduction and foraging behavior) of insects is usually associated with climatic variables. The present study investigates which climatic variables are best predictors of insect abundance {{in an area of}} Caatinga in northeastern Brazil. Individuals were sampled for 24 months using Malaise and pitfall traps, and <b>beating</b> <b>trays.</b> A total of 58925 individuals belonging to 20 insect orders were collected. The most abundant orders were Hymenoptera, Diptera, Collembola and Coleoptera. Most orders studied showed a clear maximum abundance in the rainy season. Rainfall and humidity were the best predictors of insect abundance in the Caatinga. However, no climatic variable could explain Psocoptera and Blattodea variance in abundance/activity. Our results suggest that climatic changes associated with rainfall patterns in the Caatinga may affect ecosystem processes and services that depend direct or indirectly on insect abundance/activity...|$|R

In the laboratory all the traps were checked and the collected bugs were then counted. During both years chemical treatments were performed. Adults of A. melanocephalus began to move from the wintering sites to the host plants in March. Adults were always recorded during monitoring; but in 2007, despite the chemical treatments, a clear increase in the bug population was observed. All the bugs collected were 3, 374, and 7, 614 in 2006 and 2007, respectively, showing a poor effectiveness of the chemical measures applied. An effective method to contrast the arrival of the adults inside the houses may be pruning trees and thinning the foliage.

40|$|The coreoid fauna from Neotropics {{is poorly}} known, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} community studies. Aiming at contributing to this knowledge, a two-year study was carried out at Parque Estadual do Turvo, Municipality of Derrubadas, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to evaluate the composition, abundance and species richness of Coreoidea. Samplings were conducted in the springs of 2003 and 2004 (October), and autumns of 2004 and 2005 (May), using <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> method, along two trails of the park. Sampling effort (hours X collectors) totaled 153 h. A total of 282 individuals of Coreoidea were collected, distributed in 28 species of Alydidae, Coreidae and Rhopalidae. The most abundant species was the coreid Cebrenis supina Brailovsky, representing 16 % of the collected individuals, followed by the rhopalids Jadera aeola (Dallas), and Harmostes sp., with 12. 1 % and 11. 7 %, respectively. The estimated richnesses by Chao 1, Chao 2, Jackknife I and Jackknife 2 indicated that the observed richness corresponds to 70 % to 80 % of the expected for the area. The estimated richness through rarefaction was significantly higher in spring 2003 and autumn 2004 than in the other periods. There was no significant difference, however, between spring of 2003 and autumn of 2004, and between spring of 2004 and autumn of 2005, for the same parameter. Yucuma and Garcia trails did not differ significantly for the estimated richness. Singletons and doubletons represented 32. 1 % of the recorded species.

To ensure assessment {{of the majority of}} potential habitats, seven collecting techniques were used, resulting in 466 individuals from 28 species. Each upland site provided 16 - 18 species. Flooded forest habitat was undersampled, and only five species were recorded. From the seven collecting methods employed, litter manual sorting resulted in the highest number of species per sample, and <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> the highest ratio of individuals per sample.

40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in scorpion activity were investigated during a 24 month period {{in an area}} of Caatinga (dryland) vegetation in the state of Paraíba, Brazil. The total number of scorpions captured was correlated with climatic variables and prey abundance. Scorpions were captured monthly using pitfall traps; their potential prey was captured using malaise, <b>beating</b> <b>trays</b> and pitfalls. A total of 104 scorpions were captured, representing four species: the bothriurids Bothriurus asper (Pocock, 1893) (n = 74; 71. 2 %) and B. rochai (Mello-Leitão, 1932) (n = 20; 19. 2 %), and the buthids Rhopalurus rochai (Borelli, 1910) (n = 4; 3. 8 %) and Tityus stigmurus (Thorell, 1876) (n = 1; 1. 0 %). The sex ratios (male:female) of the two most abundant species were 14 : 1 for B. asper and 7 : 1 for B. rochai. The abundance of scorpions captured was significantly correlated with precipitation, real evapotranspiration, and abundance of invertebrates (mainly insects). Scorpion activities, especially those of B. asper and B. rochai, may be closely related to their reproductive cycles. Reproduction apparently reaches its maximum when there is an abundance of food, which in the Caatinga is strongly associated with rainfall patterns...|$|R

Since 2008, the species has been observed foraging and breeding in the fire-altered area. To verify whether food resources can explain the Black-eared Miners’ presence in habitat consisting of early seral stages, we examined if a link could be found between the foraging behaviour of the Black-eared Miner and its invertebrate food resources. Foraging behaviour of Black-eared Miners was sampled opportunistically using focal observations. All potential invertebrate food resources were sampled using micro-pitfalls, malaise traps, <b>beating</b> <b>trays,</b> sweep nets and active searches. Black-eared Miners devoted significantly more time to foraging in long unburned (hereafter referred to as unburned) rather than in recently burned habitat. No differences in invertebrate abundance, species richness or diversity were found between burned and unburned habitats. However, differences in community composition between habitats were found. Lerp, which is a sugary protective covering of particular insect larvae, is an important food source for the Black-eared Miners, and was found more in the unburned natural habitat. We found that Black-eared miners may be more adaptable than previously thought when it comes to utilization of burned habitat.

Spiders were collected in ten weekly sessions from last week of July to September 2012, using sweep nets and <b>beating</b> <b>trays.</b> A total of 663 individuals belonging to 28 species distributed among 11 families were found in the conservancy. The Oxyopidae was the most abundant (n = 230) representing 35 % of all spiders sampled, followed by Philodromidae (n = 140) with 21 %, Thomisidae (n = 124) with 19 %, and Salticidae (n = 87) with 13 %. The most abundant species was an Oxyopidae Oxyopes sp (n = 186) representing 28 % of the total, followed by a Philodromidae Philodromus sp (n = 120) with 18. 1 %, a Salticidae Salticidae sp (n = 82) with 12. 4 %.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{survey of the}} spider fauna in natural and artificial forest gap formations at Porto Urucu, a petroleum/natural gas production facility in the Urucu river basin, Coari, Amazonas, Brazil is presented. Sampling was conducted both occasionally and using a protocol composed of a suite of techniques: <b>beating</b> <b>trays</b> (32 samples), nocturnal manual samplings (48), sweeping nets (16), Winkler extractors (24), and pitfall traps (120). A total of 4201 spiders, belonging to 43 families and 393 morphospecies, were collected during the dry season, in July, 2003. Excluding the occasional samples, the observed richness was 357 species. In a performance test of seven species richness estimators, the Incidence Based Coverage Estimator (ICE) was the best fit estimator, with 639 estimated species. To evaluate differences in species richness associated with natural and artificial gaps, samples from between {{the center of the}} gaps up to 300 meters inside the adjacent forest matrix were compared through the inspection of the confidence intervals of individual-based rarefaction curves for each treatment. The observed species richness was significantly higher in natural gaps combined with adjacent forest than in the artificial gaps combined with adjacent forest. Moreover, a community similarity analysis between the fauna collected under both treatments demonstrated that there were considerable differences in species composition. The significantly higher abundance of Lycosidae in artificial gap forest is explained by the presence of herbaceous vegetation in the gaps themselves. Ctenidae was significantly more abundant in the natural gap forest, probable due to the increase of shelter availability provided by the fallen trees in the gaps themselves. Both families are identified as potential indicators of environmental change related to the establishment or recovery of artificial gaps in the study area...|$|R

40|$|Frankliniella schultzei Trybom (Thysanoptera:Thripidae) is an {{important}} flower pest of avocado crop (Persea americana Mill) at Taita Hills in South-eastern Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro in North-eastern Tanzania. However, its geographical distribution is not known in the East African avocado cropping systems. In order to generate the spatial data of the common blossom thrips (Frankliniella schultzei), a survey {{was carried out in}} smallholder avocado orchards along altitudinal gradient (900 - 1800 m. a. s. l.) of Taita Hills and Mount Kilimanjaro using a white coloured <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> and camel brush. Once the specimens of thrips were taxonomically verified, the abundance data was tabulated into three altitudinal zones, namely; lowland (900 - 1199 m. a. s. l.), sub-montane (1200 - 1499 m. a. s. l.) and montane (1500 - 1799 m. a. s. l.). Frankliniella schultzei was recorded in all altitudinal zones of both transects with mean abundance being highest at Taita Hills (5. 4) compared to Mount Kilimanjaro (0. 9). However, abundance of the pest was greater in cooler highlands (> 1200 m. a. s. l.) than warmer lowland areas (< 1200 m. a. s. l.) of both transects.

40|$|Avocado, Persea {{americana}} Miller (Lauraceae), is {{an important}} fruit crop cultivated by small-holder farmers along Afrotropical highlands of Taita Hills in South-eastern Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro in Northern Tanzania. The small-holder farmers in these East African regions generate substantial food and cash from avocado fruits. However, the avocado crop is faced with challenges of infestation by insect pests such as the common blossom thrips (Frankliniella schultzei Trybom) which feeds on pollen and floral tissue thereby reducing productivity of the trees. Moreover, there is no information describing distribution patterns of Frankliniella schultzei and associated weather in East African avocado orchards {{despite the fact that}} small-scale farming is dependent on rainfall.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{composition}} of the spider fauna of riparian forests is insufficiently known. These forests, adjacent to both aquatic and terrestrial environments, are recognised as having important ecosystem functions. We compare the {{composition of}} spider assemblages of four riparian forests in different drainage basins, along with their microhabitats (edges and forest interior), {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Sampling was carried out in the riparian forests of the following rivers: Piratini, municipality of Arroio Grande; Camaquã, municipality of Cristal; Sinos, municipality of Parobé, and Maquiné, municipality of Maquiné. Two samples per season were collected in two years, by sampling the tree-shrub strata with a <b>beating</b> <b>tray,</b> following fixed transects. There were six transects per drainage basin, two per microhabitat: grassland edge, forest interior and river edge. Overall, 42, 057 spiders were sampled (juveniles: 79 %; adults: 21 %). Among the adults (8, 851 individuals), we identified 440 species. Similarity analyses (ANOSIM) indicated that the araneofauna {{composition of the}} four drainage basins differ in their quantitative (Morisita) and qualitative (Simpson) similarity indexes. There were no differences in composition among microhabitats. The composition of the Maquiné River basin was the most distinct, possibly due to a greater influence of the Atlantic forest on it and a greater dominance of the Linyphiidae Sphecozone personata (Simon, 1894) (SIMPER analysis, contribution to dissimilarity: 12. 15 %). Differences in spider composition on large spatial scales most likely reflect regional variations in a number of environmental factors, and result in each area having in increased importance in terms of conservation...|$|E
40|$|The Araneidae is a speciose family {{including}} web-spinning spiders {{that are}} very abundant in various terrestrial ecosystems. Several studies demonstrate that changes in vegetation surrounding rivers, streams and brooks affect the associated araneofauna. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare differences found in diversity (abundance and richness), composition and phenology of Araneidae spiders sampled in different habitats in four riparian forest catchments in southern Brazil. Samples were taken from riparian forests in four rivers of Rio Grande do Sul State: Piratini, Camaqu&# 227;, Sinos and Maquin&# 233; rivers, each in a different hydrographic basin. Samples were taken twice seasonally on each basin during two years, sampling the araneofauna of the tree-shrub strata with <b>beating</b> <b>tray.</b> Six transects were employed on each basin, two per habitat: edge with grassland, forest interior and river edge. Araneids totalled 20 genera and 65 species. Comparing riparian forests significant differences are found. Spider abundance differed among riparian forests as well as species richness. Overall, Piratini river riparian forest had the higher abundance and richness for Araneidae; the lower values were in Sinos river forest. The stronger degradation and fragmentation of the riparian forests of Sinos river probably influenced the results, with human disturbance gradients associated negatively to web building. We present data on the diversity of these spiders, which were very abundant in the riparian forest interior and very rich in species in the grassland/riparian forest edge. Species composition also differs among the studied habitats (the above plus river/riparian forest edge).

30|$|In {{order to}} collect {{the maximum number of}} spiders from every {{ecological}} stratum of each habitat, different active techniques and innovative methods such as traps were used (Vedel et al. 2011). Active techniques consist of sampling spiders using a sieve for filtering the soil and the leaf litter, a triangular sweep net for catching spiders inhabiting the low vegetation from 10 cm to 1.5 m, a <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> to collect individuals living from 1.5 m to 2.5 m in the higher vegetation and by hand to collect visible spiders on trunk or on silk webs. The innovative methods were Malaise traps and window pane traps, normally used to catch insects, which were recognized as efficient at collecting spiders (Vedel et al. 2011). Because of the heterogeneity of the sampling and the initial aim of the study, which was only {{to increase the number of}} spider species found, rigorous standardized protocol (Vedel and Lalagüe 2013) was applied only at only the sites Nouragues (wet season), Nouragues (dry season), Crique Baggot, La Trinité, Saül and Savane Roche Virginie. The sampling effort is an equal mix of the active techniques described above where one unit represents one hour of an active sampling technique. For the two Gentry plots spiders were collected only by traps (six window pane traps and six Malaise traps on each site) over a six months period (dry season). At the Mont Itoupe site, six window pane traps and six Malaise traps over one month (dry season) were used to collect spiders. At the Piste des compagnons site, two Malaise traps were placed over a two month period (dry season). Therefore, because of this non-standardization of sampling effort and methods, only a global estimation of total number of species was statistically feasible and no advanced biodiversity studies on spiders (Feest & Cardoso 2012; Cardoso et al. 2009) were possible.|$|E

A temperatura média, insolação e umidade relativa correlacionaram com nonacosano foliar que, por sua vez, esteve associado com o aumento populacional de pulgões. Foi observada uma tendência na redução de pulgões e de tripes com o aumento da pluviosidade total. A mosca-branca pode ser uma praga prejudicial em regiões produtoras de couve de maior temperatura e de menor pluviosidade. Em regiões onde se tem maior incidência de pulgões (regiões de temperatura moderada) deve-se escolher um genótipo com baixo conteúdo foliar de cera. Inimigos naturais, especialmente o parasitóide Adialytus spp., podem ser agentes de controle da população de pulgões em couve...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © ECOGRAPHY 2005. This article explores {{patterns}} of insect herbivore {{distribution in the}} canopy of the Laurisilva forests on seven islands in the Azores archipelago. To our knowledge, {{this is one of}} the first extensive studied of this type in tree or shrub canopies of oceanic island ecosystems. One of the most frequently debated characteristics of such ecosystems is the likely prevalence of vague, ill-defined niches due to taxonomic disharmony, which may have implications for insect-plant interactions. For instance, an increase in ecological opportunities for generalist species is expected due to the lack of predator groups and reduced selection for chemical defence in host plants. The following two questions were addressed: 1) Are specialists rare species, and insect herbivore species randomly distributed among host plant species in the Azores? 2) Are the variances in insect herbivore species composition, frequency and richness explained by host plants or by regional island effects? We expect a proportional distribution of herbivore species between host plants, influenced by host frequency and distinct island effects; otherwise, deviation from expectation might suggest habitat preference for specific host tree crowns. Canopy <b>beating</b> <b>tray</b> samples were performed on seven islands, comprising 50 transects with 1 to 3 plant species each (10 replicates per species), giving 1320 samples from ten host species trees or shrubs in total. From a total of 129 insect herbivore species, a greater number of herbivore species was found on Juniperus brevifolia (s= 65) and Erica azorica (s= 53). However, the number of herbivore species per individual tree crown was higher for E. azorica than for any other host, on all islands, despite the fact that it was only the fourth more abundant plant. In addition, higher insect species richness and greater insect abundance were found on the trees of Santa Maria Island, the oldest in the archipelago. Insect species composition was strongly influenced by the presence of E. azorica, which was the only host plant with a characteristic fauna across the archipelago, whereas the fauna of other plant crowns was grouped by islands. The great insect occurrence on E. azorica reflects strong habitat fidelity, but only four species were clearly specialists. Our findings indicate a broadly generalist fauna. The simplicity of Azorean Laurisilva contributed to the understanding of insect-plant mechanisms in canopy forest habitats...|$|E
