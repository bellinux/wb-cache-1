500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to <b>believe</b> <b>in.</b> <b>That</b> was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|E
500|$|The novelization {{suggests}} that the shark may be acting {{under the influence of}} a vengeful voodoo witch doctor (who has a feud with the Brody family), and the shark's apparent revenge has magical implications. Therefore, the witch doctor is the 'revenge' and the shark is his tool. This also explains the strange psychic connection Ellen and the shark have with each other. The plot was deleted as it strayed too far away from the plot of the killer shark. However, {{at one point in the}} theatrical version, Michael Brody says, [...] "Come on, sharks don’t commit murder. Tell me you don’t <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> voodoo." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elsewhere, {{he spoke}} of the {{nonsense}} of higher mathematics and [...] "probability" [...] theory, after he read Angoff's article for Charles S. Peirce in the American Mercury.

2500|$|Steve Spurrier's {{skills as}} a young {{baseball}} player caused a local businessman to talk the Reverend Spurrier into coaching the Little League team sponsored by his business so that his son {{would be on the}} squad. The younger Spurrier has often repeated an anecdote about playing baseball on a team coached by his father. [...] "How many of you believe that it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game, that counts?" [...] the elder Spurrier once asked his players. When some raised their hands, he told them, [...] "Well, I don't <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> saying. If they're keeping score, we're going to play to win." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hellman countered her star: [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> fine, lovable little Republic of Finland that {{everyone}} gets so weepy about. I've {{been there and}} it seems like a little pro-Nazi Republic to me." [...] Bankhead, who loathed both Nazism and Communism, was outraged and thought Hellman a moral hypocrite. Hellman had never been to Finland, and Bankhead, as did the rest of the cast, suspected she refused the benefit due to a fanatical devotion to Soviet Russia. As a result of the feud, Hellman, who did not like being questioned and was used to getting her way, and Bankhead, who was always outspoken and hated being crossed when she knew she was morally right, became enemies.|$|E
2500|$|Bernie Sanders opposes {{guest worker}} {{programs}} {{and is also}} skeptical about skilled immigrant (H-1B) visas, saying, [...] "Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies. These firms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and other countries." [...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have {{to do everything we can}} to create millions of jobs.|$|E
2500|$|The persona, he argues, is a mask for the [...] "{{collective}} psyche", a {{mask that}} 'pretends' individuality, so that both {{self and others}} <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> identity, {{even if it is}} really no more than a well-played role through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the [...] "persona-mask" [...] as a complicated system which mediates between individual consciousness and the social community: it is [...] "a compromise between the individual and society as to what a man should appear to be". But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a character mask in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) {{the true nature of the}} individual. The therapist then aims to assist the individuation process through which the client (re)gains his [...] "own self" [...] – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the persona, and from the power of unconscious impulses.|$|E

2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot {{have any idea of}} where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but where is it really going?" [...] That is precisely the kind of question that is scientifically meaningless. That {{is the nature of the}} world we live in. That is the quantum mechanical universe.The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official YouTube channel. Caltech also posted on YouTube a series of short videos made by Blinn to demonstrate the show's computer animation at SIGGRAPH conferences.|$|E
