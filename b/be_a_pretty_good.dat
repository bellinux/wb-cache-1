[...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized Rachel's actions in the episode, and felt that: [...] "Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bona fide triple-threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna to the rest of Glee." ...|$|E

500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} episode a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select 25 critical reviews—of 67, signifying generally favorable reviews. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter found it promising because [...] "it is reminiscent of better-of-the-sexes charm". USA Todays Robert Bianco said, [...] "what Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the pilot 7.6 out of 10, calling it [...] "a lackluster pilot that promises to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> series". Tim Goodman of San Francisco Chronicle remarked that despite [...] "some flaws in it—mostly from a clash of tones—it still overdelivers on creativity, creepiness, fine acting and burgeoning character development". Chicago Sun-Times Misha Davenport called it an [...] "update of The X-Files {{with the addition of}} terrorism and the office of Homeland Security.|$|E

[...] She suggested using the television medium's [...] "most engaging traits", including high production values, sophisticated writing, and quality film and animation, to reach the largest audience possible. [...] In the words of critic Peter Hellman, [...] "If [...] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?" [...] Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewers—including their parents and older siblings, who tended to control the television set. [...] To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included, which, as Lesser reported, [...] "may turn out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences". [...] Cooney also believed cultural references and guest appearances by celebrities would encourage parents and older siblings to watch the show together.|$|E
