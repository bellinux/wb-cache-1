5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> reveal her true identity, since Russians were not popular in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E
5|$|On Henry's {{death in}} December 1135, Pain {{attended}} the king's funeral. Pain {{was an early}} supporter of King Stephen, although he was said initially to have <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> appear at Stephen's court {{for fear of being}} confronted by those he had oppressed. Nevertheless, Pain was with the new king by early January 1136, when he witnessed one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at Reading. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king. Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136. The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.|$|E

When she was eleven, {{she and her}} family made their first visit to Nashville, Tennessee in pursuit of a record deal, though nothing came out of it. Swift was judged and neglected by record labels for being too young. In regards to the labels which rejected her, she said, [...] "I can understand. They <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> put out a 13-year-old. They <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> put out a 14-year-old. Then they <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> put out a 15-year-old. Then they were nervous about putting out a 16-year-old. And I'm sure if I hadn't signed with Scott Borchetta of Big Machine Records, everybody would <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> put out a 17-year-old." ...|$|R

25|$|Michelle Ann Fowler (also Holloway) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Susan Tully {{from the first}} episode in 1985 until the character's departure in 1995. In December 2016, it was announced Michelle would be returning to the show after 21 years, with actress Jenna Russell taking over the role making her first appearance on 24 December 2016. In her first stint Michelle made some huge mistakes during her time in Albert Square mainly through having a habit of choosing the wrong men and her stubborn nature meant that she rarely accepted help or listened to good advice. Being determined and outspoken, she has never <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> defend herself or her beliefs. Since the recast to Russell in 2016, Michelle's storylines have revolved around her having had an illegal relationship with her student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor) in America, a love triangle involving her niece Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), crashing her car into the local chip shop and being stalked by Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey).|$|E
500|$|Betty's two passions in {{life are}} darts and food. Playing darts brings out her {{competitive}} side, and she enjoys beating her male customers. Cyril frequently protests when Betty attempts to diet, as he prefers her [...] "homely and comfortable" [...] figure. Ultimately, Betty stops trying to lose weight, stating: [...] "I had to [...] between losing a few pounds or losing my marital partner. If my Cyril had wanted to marry a skinny rabbit he'd have married one." [...] Betty breaks down when Cyril dies from a heart attack, with Little noting that: [...] "Cyril had been the stabilizing force in Betty's life, and without him she relied heavily on her job and friends at the Rovers – she couldn't face life alone at home". Little has observed that Betty [...] "has a finely tuned {{sense of right and}} wrong and has never <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> stand up for her beliefs", citing Betty's shock at being mugged in 1982, and calling the NSPCC to report a female neighbour whose children were left outside until nightfall while their mother entertained her boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Coffin began {{sheltering}} fugitive {{slaves in}} his Indiana {{home during the}} winter of 1826–27. Word of Coffin's activities quickly spread throughout the community. Although many had previously <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> participate, some of his neighbors joined the effort after seeing his success at avoiding problems. The group formed a more formal route to move the fugitives from stop to stop until they reached Canada. Coffin referred to the system as the [...] "mysterious road" [...] and as time progressed the number of escaping slaves increased. Coffin estimated that, on average, he helped one hundred escape annually. The Coffin home became the convergent point of three major escape routes from Madison and New Albany, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Ohio. On some occasions when runaways gathered at his home, two wagons were required to transport them further north. Coffin moved the escaping slaves to the next stops along the route during the night. Coffin had numerous collaborators. In Madison, George DeBaptiste's barber shop was a key nerve center in the 1830s and 1840s.|$|E

500|$|Secret Service agents {{initially}} {{rushed to}} respond. Snipers scanned the South Lawn, {{looking for an}} assailant. A supervisor then decided that the noises were backfires from a nearby construction site and told the agents, [...] "No shots have been fired... stand down", {{to the surprise of}} several officers. According to Carol D. Leonnig, agents who thought the building had been fired upon [...] "were largely ignored", with one reporting she had <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> doubt her superior's assertion. By the end of the night, it was confirmed that a shooting had occurred, although the Secret Service believed that gunfire was not aimed at the White House, but rather {{was the result of a}} gang fight nearby. A Secret Service dispatcher called emergency services and gave incorrect descriptions of both vehicles and suspects; police were told to look for two black men on Rock Creek Parkway. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. The evidence was only noticed when a housekeeper discovered broken glass and pieces of cement on the Truman Balcony around midday on November 15.|$|E

2500|$|TEPCO admits for {{the first}} time that it had failed to take {{stronger}} measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. TEPCO's internal reform task force, led by company President Naomi Hirose, said in a report TEPCO had feared efforts to better protect nuclear facilities from severe accidents such as tsunamis would trigger anti-nuclear sentiment, interfere with operations or increase litigation risks. TEPCO could have mitigated the impact of the accident if it had diversified power and cooling systems by paying closer attention to international standards and recommendations, the report said. TEPCO also should have trained employees with practical crisis management skills rather than conduct obligatory drills as a formality, it said. In the internal report TEPCO said that before the accident it had <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> consider the risk of such a large tsunami as the one in March 2011 which hit Fukushima, fearing admissions of risk could result in public pressure to shut plants down. [...] "There were concerns that if new countermeasures against severe accidents were installed, concern would spread in host communities that the current plants had safety problems," [...] the report said. TEPCO said in the report that [...] "severe accident measures" [...] were taken in 2002, which included [...] "containment venting and power supply cross-ties between units," [...] but additional measures were never put in place. [...] TEPCO added that taking such measures could also add to [...] "public anxiety and add momentum to anti-nuclear movements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Across that {{threshold}} I had <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> cross, things {{suddenly seemed}} so very simple. There {{was but a}} single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. [...] I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. [...] God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. [...] To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. [...] Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. [...] The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me {{no matter what it}} might bring. [...] The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. [...] But it no longer depressed me. [...] I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.|$|E
