It is possible that I may get into trouble. I hope that I shall not do so, but it is as well to be prepared for any emergency that might happen. If, then, I do not return, you are to look to Colonel Herrara for orders. When the French enter Oporto, which I am certain they will do as soon as they attack it, you may gather your men at this end of the <b>bridge,</b> <b>cover</b> the retreat, and repulse all efforts of the French to cross. As soon as those attempts have ceased, you will march with the two regiments for Coimbra, and report yourselves to the officer commanding there. Here are my despatches to the general, in which I have done full justice to your bravery and your conduct. Here is also a note to the officer commanding at Coimbra. I have spoken to him about your conduct, and have asked him to allow you to continue with the Portuguese until an order is received from Sir John Cradock. I have given Colonel Herrara a duplicate of my despatches and official orders, in case you should be killed." ...|$|E

50|$|The Grabber {{featured}} a bolt-on 34+1/2 in neck similar to Fender basses and shared a similar body shape with the Ripper. The Grabber {{also had a}} V-shaped headstock like the Gibson Flying V guitar. A distinctive feature of the Grabber was its adjustable pickup, which could be positioned by the player to simulate a neck or bridge pickup position, or in between, to provide further tonal variation. The pickup was brighter than the traditional Gibson style humbuckers. The Grabber had one volume and tone control each, and a removable <b>bridge</b> <b>cover.</b> The Grabber was originally built with a thin, maple body, but it was changed to alder in 1975. 1975 was a peak year for Grabber sales, with 2,637 units sold, due largely to its high-profile use by Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. The Grabber was available in wine red, ebony, natural, walnut and white finishes. It was discontinued in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|Typical modern Telecasters (such as the American Standard version) {{incorporate}} several details {{different from}} the classic form. They typically feature 22 frets (rather than 21) and truss rod adjustment is made at the headstock end, rather than the body end, which had required removal of the neck on the original (the Custom Shop Bajo Sexto Baritone Tele was the only Telecaster featuring a two-octave 24-fret neck). The three-saddle bridge of the original has been replaced with a six-saddle version, allowing independent length and height adjustment for each string. The long saddle bridge screws allow {{a wide range of}} saddle bridge positions for intonation tuning. The stamped metal bridge plate has been replaced with a flat plate, and the removable chromed <b>bridge</b> <b>cover</b> (often called the [...] "ashtray" [...] for its secondary use) has been discontinued for most models; it improved shieldingbut prevented players from muting strings at the bridge and made it impossible to pick near the saddles to produce the characteristic Telecaster 'twang'.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the instrument was to appeal to upright bass players. The original Jazz Bass had two stacked knob pots with volume and tone control for each pickup. Original instruments with this stacked configuration are highly valued in the vintage guitar market. In late 1961 it received three control knobs: two controlling the volume of each pickup and one the overall tone. Despite this new feature, many stacked knob models were made until about 1962. Another feature the initial models had were the [...] "Spring Felt Mutes", which were present on basses from 1960 until 1962. The purpose of those mutes was to dampen the overtones and the sustain, and were screwed in place between the bridge and aft pickup. Those felt mutes were not a tremendous success, and were replaced by a cheaper, more simple foam mute glued underneath the <b>bridge</b> <b>cover</b> as {{was used by the}} Precision Bass from 1963 onwards. Over the following years as the use of mutes gradually declined both the Precision and Jazz Bass models eventually began to be produced without bridge/tailpiece covers.|$|E
