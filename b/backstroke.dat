5|$|At the 2001 National Championships, with Krayzelburg not competing, Peirsol {{qualified}} for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in the 100-meter <b>backstroke,</b> the 200-meter <b>backstroke,</b> and the 4×100-meter medley relay. Peirsol's time in the 200-meter <b>backstroke</b> was the second-fastest ever, with only Krayzelburg's world record faster. At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won gold in the 200-meter <b>backstroke</b> {{with a time of}} 1:57.13, a championship record.|$|E
5|$|Cielo started {{competing}} in <b>backstroke.</b> In the region at the time, Guilherme Guido stood {{out as the}} opponent to beat. Guido defeated Cielo repeatedly in freestyle, while Cielo won the <b>backstroke</b> events. However, at a certain point, Guido began to lose to freestyle opponents, and began {{competing in}} <b>backstroke</b> events. He defeated Cielo, who then decided not swim <b>backstroke</b> anymore. At age 15, Cielo attended a series of trainings in Florida, USA, and returned home, willing to defeat Guido. When Cielo and Guido were reunited in a 100m freestyle contest, Guido fell behind and lost. From then on, Guido focused on <b>backstroke,</b> reversing positions with Cielo.|$|E
5|$|Murray Rose and Ian Thorpe {{have both}} won the 400m {{freestyle}} twice, while Kieren Perkins and Grant Hackett {{have won the}} 1500m freestyle twice. David Theile has won the 100m <b>backstroke</b> twice, the only Australian to have won a <b>backstroke</b> event. All were won consecutively.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli took up {{swimming}} {{due to his}} asthma, {{and quickly}} came to prominence. Selected to represent Australia at the 1973 World Championships, he came sixth in the 200m <b>backstroke</b> {{at the age of}} 16. He won his first Australian titles in 1974 in the 100m <b>backstroke</b> and 200m butterfly and went on to the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, where he won his first major international race, the 100m <b>backstroke,</b> and took silver in the 200m <b>backstroke.</b> In 1975, Tonelli won his only individual medal at global level, a silver in the 200m <b>backstroke</b> at the World Championships in Cali, Colombia. In 1975, Tonelli enrolled at the University of Alabama in the United States, studying and competing in the collegiate sport system. He was selected in both <b>backstroke</b> events for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, but struggled and missed the medals in both events. During his stay in America, Tonelli set times that would have placed him among the world's leading swimmers, but he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaches of discipline.|$|E
5|$|Two {{swimmers}} represented Bermuda at the Beijing Olympics: Kiera Aitken and Roy-Allan Burch. Aitken {{participated in}} the women's 100meter <b>backstroke,</b> and Burch swam the men's 100meter <b>backstroke.</b> Neither advanced past the preliminary round.|$|E
5|$|After enrolling at Alabama, Tonelli's parents {{paid for}} him to return home for the 1976 Australian Championships, which were the {{selection}} trials for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Tonelli won the 100m <b>backstroke</b> {{in a time of}} 58.35s but was relegated to silver in the 200m event by Mark Kerry. Along with Kerry, Tonelli was selected for both <b>backstroke</b> events and the 4200m freestyle relay.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 IPC Swimming World Championships 25 m in Rio, Hill {{won gold}} in the 100 metre <b>backstroke</b> in a new record time of 59.30, {{gold in the}} 100 metre {{butterfly}} in a new record time of 57.04 and bronze in the 100 metre freestyle in 54.66. At the 2010 IPC Swimming World Championships, Hill finished fifth in the 100 metre <b>backstroke</b> in 1:04.65.|$|E
5|$|At the 4th ASEAN ParaGames, Yip {{finished}} {{first in the}} women's 150metres individual medley, clocking 4minutes 56.34seconds.

The 22nd International German Paralympic Swimming Championships saw her set a world record of 2minutes 10.09seconds in the 100metres <b>backstroke</b> heats; in the finals, she was awarded the gold medal {{with a time of}} 2minutes 08.09seconds, bettering her own world record.|$|E
5|$|Cole is {{classified}} in the S9 category in swimming due to her amputation, a classification that also includes swimmers who have joint restrictions in one leg and those with double below-knee amputations. She began competitive swimming in 2003 and, at the 2006 IPC Swimming World Championships in Durban, she won a silver medal in the women's 100m <b>backstroke</b> S9 event. Also in 2006 Cole won the 100m <b>backstroke</b> at the Telstra Australian Swimming Championships. Cole qualified for the Australian Paralympic Swim Team in 2008 and, in the same year, attended the Beijing Paralympics where she won a silver medal in the Women's 100m Butterfly S9 event and bronze medals in the 400m Freestyle and 100m <b>Backstroke</b> events.|$|E
5|$|Irene Prescott was {{the sole}} swimmer in the {{delegation}} of Tonga. She competed in two events, the 50– and 100m backstrokes. Prescott took a time of 33.52 to complete her preliminary heat of the 50m <b>backstroke</b> and finished in 18th place, not high enough to ensure a berth in the final. She was also eliminated in the preliminary heat of 100m <b>backstroke</b> after ranking 13th {{with a time of}} 1:13.42.|$|E
5|$|Kerry had {{improved}} {{to such an}} extent that by November 1975, his times in the 200m <b>backstroke</b> had dropped from around 2m 10s to around 2m 3.0s, ranking him third in the world. As a result of his strong performances in the pool, Kerry retired from surf racing. Kerry made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships, winning the 200m freestyle and <b>backstroke</b> events in 1m 54.33s and 2m 3.58s respectively, as well as the 4200m freestyle and the 4100m medley relays for New South Wales, leading off both relays. Aged 16, Kerry won selection for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in the 100m and 200m <b>backstroke,</b> the 200m freestyle, the 4200m freestyle relay and the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
5|$|After her {{freshman}} season, Andrews {{transferred to}} the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition in 1982 and 1983. As a Gator, she was an eleven-time SEC champion, including the 50-yard <b>backstroke</b> (twice), 100-yard <b>backstroke</b> (twice), 200-yard <b>backstroke,</b> and six relays. She was a three-time NCAA champion (twice in the 400-yard medley relay, and once in the 200-yard medley relay), and received a total of eighteen All-American honors. The Gators won the 1982 NCAA women's team championship, and the Gators' winning 400-yard medley relay team of Andrews, Amy Caulkins, Michele Kurtzman and Kathy Treible set a new American national record {{in the event of}} 3:40.99. Andrews, together with teammates Kurtzman, Treible and Tracy Caulkins, won the NCAA 400-yard medley relay event again in 1983, and the Gators placed second overall at the NCAA championship tournament.|$|E
5|$|Andrews {{qualified}} {{to represent the}} United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where she won two gold medals. She gained her first gold in the women's 100-meter <b>backstroke,</b> narrowly edging fellow American Betsy Mitchell by eight one-hundredths (.08) of a second – about five inches – for a final time of 1:02.55. It {{was the first time}} she had ever beaten Mitchell. She earned her second gold by swimming the lead-off <b>backstroke</b> leg for the first-place U.S. team in the women's 4×100-meter medley relay event, sharing the honors with her American teammates Tracy Caulkins (breaststroke), Mary T. Meagher (butterfly), and Nancy Hogshead (freestyle), and clocking a winning time of 4:08.34. Her split time of 1:04.00 was slower than her gold-medal time in the individual 100-meter <b>backstroke,</b> but her teammates made good the difference to win and set a new American record in the event.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, Hill {{finished}} {{fifth in}} the 100 metre <b>backstroke</b> in 1:05.52, 12th in the 100 metre butterfly in 1:03.25, 15th in the 100 metre freestyle in 59.80 and 17th in the 50 metre freestyle in 26.84.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships, Glasgow, Scotland, she {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} Women's 100m <b>Backstroke</b> S13, sixth in the Women's 100m Breaststroke SB13 and seventh in the Women's 50m Freestyle S13 and Women's 200m Individual Medley SM13.|$|E
5|$|Clarke became {{affiliated}} with the Yeronga Park Club in 2011 {{in an effort to}} make the Paralympic Games, and switched coaches, taking on Rick Van Der Zant as her new coach. The 2011 Australian national championships saw her win six golds in seven events, including the 100m freestyle, 100m <b>backstroke,</b> 100m breaststroke, 100m butterfly and 200m individual medley. She competed in the inaugural 2011 Para Pan Pacific Championships, where she finished first in the S14 200m freestyle event, and at the 2011 Can-Am Swimming Open, in which she posted first-place finishes in the 100m <b>backstroke</b> and 200m freestyle events.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of his career, McKee set six American records (short course 200- and 400-yard {{individual}} medley, 400-yard medley relay; long course 100- and 220-yard <b>backstroke,</b> 200-yard individual medley).|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Tonelli won the 100m <b>backstroke,</b> 200m <b>backstroke</b> and 200m {{butterfly}} {{events at}} the Australian Championships. Although he won more individual titles {{than in the previous}} year, his times were slower; he completed the distances in 59.70s, 2m 10.50s and 2m 10.00s respectively. Tonelli was also part of the Queensland team that successfully defended their medley relay title. Tonelli was thus selected for the 1975 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. He qualified fastest for the 200m <b>backstroke</b> final and had planned to pursue an aggressive strategy to attack from the start. However, he was advised to swim conservatively {{in the first half of}} the race by Australian coach Terry Gathercole so that his main rivals Matthes and John Naber would not be able to draft behind him in the early stages. The tactic backfired and Tonelli ended with the silver medal. He had swum faster in the second half of the racesomething exceedingly rare in top-level swimming and an indication of strategic errorand felt that he had too much unused energy left at the end of the race. Tonelli vowed that from then on, he would always back his judgment and race strategy.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m <b>backstroke,</b> but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m <b>backstroke.</b> His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E
5|$|In Montreal, Tonelli came eighth fastest {{in every}} {{round of the}} 100m <b>backstroke.</b> He came second in his heat {{in a time of}} 58.53s, making him the eighth of sixteen qualifiers for the semifinals. He then scraped into the 100m final as the slowest qualifier0.01s ahead of fellow Australian Glenn Patchingafter {{finishing}} fourth in his semifinal in a time of 58.14s. He came eighth in the final in a time of 58.42s and did not threaten the medals; Naber of the United States won in a time of 55.49s. As Kerry outpaced Tonelli to finish seventh in the event, he was selected ahead of Tonelli for the <b>backstroke</b> leg in the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
5|$|Jared Heine {{competed in}} the men's 100 meter <b>backstroke</b> and {{finished}} third in his heat, placing forty-third in the standings. The medals in the event went to swimmers from the United States, Russia, and Australia.|$|E
5|$|She has muscular {{dystrophy}} and competes in the S3 category for the physically impaired. Since 2005, she has won medals in international competitions {{such as the}} World Wheelchair and Amputee Games, Japan Paralympic Swimming Championships and International German Paralympic Swimming Championships. At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, she {{won a gold medal}} in the 50metres <b>backstroke</b> and a silver medal in the 50metres freestyle, setting world records in both events. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics, she won a gold medal in the 100metres S2 <b>backstroke,</b> setting a world record for that event, and another for her 50 m split.|$|E
5|$|She was a co-captain of the Australian {{team at the}} 1996 Summer Paralympics, {{where she}} competed in six {{individual}} events and two relay events in the S8 class, winning five gold medals, four individual and one team, one silver medal and one bronze medal. She set world records at the 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta in the 200m medley and the 400m freestyle swimming events. She also set personal bests in the 100m <b>backstroke</b> and 100m freestyle. Her world record time in the 400m freestyle was 5:11.47, her 100m <b>backstroke</b> time was 1:23.43, and her 100m freestyle time was 1:12.08.|$|E
5|$|Sonia Akter and Anik Islam {{were the}} two Bangladeshi swimmers. Akter entered three events, the 50m butterfly, 50m <b>backstroke</b> and 50m breaststroke. She {{completed}} her preliminary heat of the 50m butterfly in 32.78 seconds, finishing in 19th place, not high enough to secure {{a place in the}} final. She was also eliminated in the preliminary heat of the 50m <b>backstroke,</b> ranking 22nd with a time of 36.00 seconds in the heats. She did not start in the preliminary heat of the 50m breaststroke. Anik Islam swam in the 50m and 100m butterfly. He finished the 50m butterfly in a time of 26.97 seconds, ranking 14th, and the 100m butterfly in 58.41 seconds, ranking 12th.|$|E
5|$|Tao {{participated in}} the 25th Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane, Laos. On 10 December 2009, she took the gold in the 200metres <b>backstroke</b> {{in a time of}} 2 minutes 17.12 seconds. Three days later, she was part of the winning 4 x 100metres medley relay team with Roanne Ho, Shana Lim and Quah Ting Wen, and on 14 December she broke her own 2005 Games record in the 200metres {{butterfly}} in a time of 2minutes 13.49seconds. As she chalked up five wins, including the 100metres <b>backstroke</b> and butterfly events, these were her most successful Games to date.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli {{arrived in}} Moscow facing a heavy schedule: he was {{nominated}} in the 100m freestyle, <b>backstroke</b> and butterfly, the 200m <b>backstroke</b> and the 4100m medley and the 4200m freestyle relays. Tonelli came third in his heat of the 100m freestyle to qualify fourth {{with a time of}} 52.04s. However, he swam slower in coming fifth in his semifinal in a time of 52.17s to miss the final by 0.26s. Overall, he was ranked 10th, but if he repeated his Australian record of 51.80 set at the selection trials, he would have come sixth.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli was {{selected}} for the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he had his first medal success at international level. He won gold in the 100m <b>backstroke,</b> where he won his heat comfortably before setting a Games record of 59.65s in the final. Tonelli was second behind Cooper in the 200m <b>backstroke,</b> finishing {{in a time of}} 2m 9.47s, more than three seconds in arrears. He claimed a silver in the 4100m medley relay as Australia were thwarted by Canada despite setting a national record, and was eliminated in the heats of the 200m butterfly.|$|E
5|$|Yip {{participated in}} the 2016 Summer Paralympics. On 10 September 2016, Yip swam in the finals of the 100 m <b>backstroke,</b> S2 class; her time of 2:07.09 was a new S2 world record, earning her a Paralympic gold medal. Her 59.38 split for the first 50 m of the race was also a new S2 world record; in both cases she overwrote her own world leading times. Her medal was Singapore's first at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. On 16 September, Yip won her (and Singapore's) second gold medal of the 2016 Games, {{this time in the}} 50 m <b>backstroke</b> finals, S2 class with a time of 1:00.33.|$|E
5|$|Yip {{started her}} 2008 Summer Paralympic Games {{campaign}} by breaking another world record, clocking 57.04seconds in the women's 50metres freestyle heats. However, she was narrowly beaten by Mexican swimmer Patricia Valle in the finals, clinching {{a silver medal}} {{with a time of}} 57.43seconds. In the women's 50metres <b>backstroke</b> heats, she posted a time of 57.92seconds, taking two seconds off her own world record. She then swam the women's 50metres <b>backstroke</b> finals in a time of 58.75seconds to win the gold medal. After she returned to Singapore, the president conferred Yip a state medal, the Meritorious Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|At the 1972 Olympics, McKee {{garnered}} {{a second}} silver {{medal in the}} men's 200-meter individual medley (2:08.37), again finishing behind gold medalist Larsson, who set a new world record in the event (2:07.17). He also placed fifth in {{the final of the}} men's 200-meter <b>backstroke</b> (2:07.29).|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Hill {{finished}} {{seventh in}} the 100 metre <b>backstroke</b> in 1:04.97 and equal eighth in the heats 100 metre butterfly with Australia's Sean Russo in 1:01.61. In the swim-off, Russo defeated Hill with each posting times of 1:01.24 and 1:02.72 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 21 {{countries}} won medals, leaving {{two countries}} without a medal, and 18 of them won {{at least one}} gold medal. Andorra and Lebanon did not win any medal. Athens Olympics silver medallist in 200metre freestyle, Federica Pellegrini of Italy made a new world record in the 400metres freestyle event. Spanish swimmer Aschwin Wildeboer Faber set a new world record in 100metres <b>backstroke.</b>|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{regarded}} by swimming analysts as a medal chance, {{but were not}} seen as the main threatsSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts had the silver medallists in the 100m <b>backstroke</b> and breaststroke, Viktor Kuznetsov and Arsens Miskarovs respectively, and their butterflyer Yevgeny Seredin had come fifth in his 100m event. Their freestyler Sergey Koplyakov later came fourth in the corresponding 100m event. The British boasted Duncan Goodhew, the 100m breaststroke gold medallist, and Gary Abraham, who had placed fifth in the 100m <b>backstroke.</b> Sweden's butterflyer Pär Arvidsson and backstroker Bengt Baron had won their respective 100m events and their freestyle swimmer Per Holmertz would win silver in the 100m a few days later. Their weakest swimmer was the breaststroker Peter Berggren, who came ninth in the 100m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Brooks later came seventh in his 100m freestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Evans was Australia's only medallist in the corresponding individual event, winning bronze in the breaststroke. Kerry had been eliminated in the 100m <b>backstroke</b> semifinals, while Tonelli was the Australian champion in the 100m freestyle and <b>backstroke</b> but was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer; the nation {{did not have an}} entrant in the 100m butterfly. Adding to the pressure was Australia's failure to win any gold medals in any sport at the 1976 Olympics. This meant that the public were still awaiting their first gold since the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Coming into the Olympics, Australia was ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.|$|E
5|$|Elliott is an S8 {{classified}} swimmer who {{was ranked}} {{first in the}} world in the S8 50m <b>backstroke</b> in 2012. She is a member of Nuswim Swimming Club, started swimming when she was six months old, and commenced competitive swimming in 2009. She made her national team debut that same year at the Youth Paralympic Games, where she won five gold medals.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, she {{won eight}} gold and two silver medals at Australian Disability Age Group Nationals, and {{competed in the}} International Paralympic Swimming World Championships, where she {{finished}} second with a personal best time of 1:11.13 in the S14 100m <b>backstroke</b> event. She also finished fourth in the 200m freestyle and fifth in the 100m breaststroke.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{trained by}} his mother, Kerry enjoyed success in {{swimming}} and surf lifesaving as a teenager. His swimming career progressed to senior Australian standards after {{he switched to}} the tutelage of John Rigby and moved to Queensland. He made his debut at the 1976 Australian Championships and promptly won the 200m freestyle and <b>backstroke</b> events to win selection for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal {{at the age of}} 16. At the Olympics, Kerry reached the final in two events, coming seventh and fifth in the 100m and 200m <b>backstroke</b> respectively. Kerry was disappointed with his performances, but they attracted the attention of American coach Doc Counsilman, who invited Kerry to swim under him at the Indiana University. Kerry set Australian records while in the United States, but his international career hit trouble when he was expelled from the 1978 Commonwealth Games team for breaking a curfew.|$|E
