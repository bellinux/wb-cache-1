30|$|In Pakistan, {{evidence}} from empirical studies provides mixed results. For example, studies by Shabbir and Ahmed (1994) reveal {{a positive and}} significant relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and inflation, and an indirect relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and money supply. They further argue that inflation is not only linked to <b>budget</b> <b>deficits,</b> but that the deficit is primarily funded through bank borrowing and ultimately seigniorage. However, findings by Mukhtar and Zakaria (2010) reveal a different picture for Pakistan; they do not find significant long-run connection between inflation and <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> Instead, inflation {{is related to the}} money supply, yet no causal relationship is found between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and money supply. In Tanzania, Ndanshau (2012) find no causal effect from <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> upon inflation; instead, Granger causality is observed running from inflation to <b>budget</b> <b>deficits.</b> On the other hand, in Nigeria, Oladipo and Akimbobola (2011) find a unidirectional causation running from <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to inflation.|$|R

In this study, the relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and current account deficits in Turkey for 1950 - 2005 period is examined with annual data by using recently developed time series econometric tecniques such as the cointegration analysis and Granger Causality Test. In cointegration analysis, it is found that thereis a long run relationship between <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and current account deficits.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} three {{sources of}} the fluctuations in real interest rates {{during the past three}} decades: changes in <b>budget</b> <b>deficits,</b> changes in tax rules, and changes in monetary policy. The evidence indicates that <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and monetary policy have had a strong influence on the level of long-term interest rates but fails to identify any effect of changes in corporate tax rates and investment incentives. The analysis shows that it is projected future <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> rather than the current level of the actual or structural deficit that influence long-term interest rates. Each percentage point increase in the five-year projected ratio of <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> to GNP raises the long-term government bond rate by approximately 1. 2 percentage points while the ratio of the current deficit to GNP (either actual or structural) has no significa effect. The specific parameter estimates imply that the increase in projected <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> was responsible for about two-thirds of the rise in the interest rates between 1977 - 78 and 1983 - 84. ...|$|R

5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E

On one hand, the share of resources owned or {{controlled by the government}} must be shrunk {{in order to create a}} favorable environment for the development of the market economy.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> on private {{investment}} is an unsettled issue. If <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> {{are to be}} financed by borrowing, interest rates must rise so that capital markets can reach equilibrium. High interest rates, in turn, result in a decreased investment, hence the crowding-out effect. On the other hand, if <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> help boost economic growth, investors could become more optimistic and decide to invest more, hence the crowding-in effect. Finally, if an increase in deficits due to tax cuts today is to be matched by tax increases in the future, interest rates and investment may not change. In this paper we employ cointegration analysis and data from nine European countries to test the impact of <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> on private investment. budget deficits; crowding-in; crowding-out; private investment; European Union; fiscal policy; government budgets. ...|$|R
