5|$|They move {{deeper into}} the woods {{the next day and}} locate what appears to be an old {{cemetery}} with seven small cairns and set up camp nearby. Later that night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E
5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D. Clark), an {{experienced}} big game hunter and tracker from England {{who specializes in}} hunting man-eating tigers. Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance {{and that he will}} start his hunt for the tiger when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the tiger, it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters. She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the tiger, one being killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt blowing the patrol car horn, she runs <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> but the Tiger has already killed him. Meanwhile, Roy encounters Graham in the woods and they discuss the tiger. When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the Tiger, Graham tells him that he must because it can't chose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people. They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing {{to the scene of the}} National Guard attack. When he arrives, he explains how the tiger attacked the guardsmen and deputy.|$|E

25|$|An unnamed trail, but {{referenced}} {{and marked}} in the DRNA maps, is a trail {{that could be}} termed Trail #11 for referential purposes. It was located midway on Trail #9 (that is, about 0.2 mile west of PR-546) and headed north to Trail #5. It met Trail #9 at a point about 0.2 mile west of PR-546. This trail was about 0.3 mile long. It served the double purpose of acting as a nature trail {{while at the same}} time it connected Trails 5 and 9, thus making for a shortcut from Trail #5 <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> parking area via Trail #9. DRNA considers this unnamed trail a part of (an offshoot of) Trail #5.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on November 22, 1994 on MTV. It was also part of VH1's relaunching promotional campaigns, where the channel used the video in its trio of 30 second commercials titled [...] "The New VH1". The commercial showed a couple in a vintage porsche pulling {{in front of an}} ATM cash machine. The man makes a transaction while the woman looks at VH1 playing at a store, showing [...] "Take a Bow". When the man turns <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> the woman is gone and can be seen inside the video alongside Madonna, while the singer appears in the car, and utters the tagline: [...] "The new VH1... It'll suck you in". According to Abbey Konowitch, who worked on Madonna's Maverick Records, the singer had a long history with MTV and VH1, and hence was eager to participate in the campaign when asked by VH1 president John Sykes. For filming the commercial, the cloths worn in the video had to be flown in from the different designers. Madonna was also impressed by the technology used in the commercial for transposing the woman and herself together.|$|E
500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{returns from}} jury duty and learns that, in his week-long absence, his {{co-workers}} {{were forced to}} make up for his vacancy, suffering setbacks and inconveniences in the process. Jim reveals to the camera that, while he was called for duty, he was dismissed at noon and headed home to Pam (Jenna Fischer) and their two children; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took {{the rest of the week}} off to help take care of their children. To appease his interested co-workers, Jim fabricates numerous details of his jury duty, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) becomes suspicious when Jim mistakenly refers to a food truck franchise Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) ate at during his jury duty as a [...] "restaurant". Dwight accuses Jim of lying about jury duty and extracts from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) a promise to fire Jim if he proves he is correct. Ashamed, Jim privately admits his guilt to Andy, who insists that they keep the matter a secret so that he will not be held to his promise to fire Jim. However, Dwight increases his attempts to prove Jim's guilt, and Jim finally decides to defy Andy's orders and tell his co-workers the truth rather than wait for Dwight to inevitably expose him. While this angers most of the employees, Dwight is thrilled at the confession and demands that Andy keep his promise to fire Jim. Andy refuses, so Dwight tries to contact Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, CeCe and Phillip, to present pictures that CeCe drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, the children begin crying loudly, creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control, forcing them to take them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Realizing the stress that having young children causes, the office workers, ultimately, forgive Jim for his behavior and even suggest he leave early to help Pam, which he does.|$|E

50|$|When the key {{is turned}} in the {{ignition}} cylinder, <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> computer transmits a radio signal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transponder circuit. The circuit has no battery; it is energized by the radio signal itself. The circuit typically has a computer chip that is programmed to respond by sending a coded signal <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> computer. If <b>the</b> circuit does not respond or if the code is incorrect, the engine will not start. Many <b>cars</b> immobilize if <b>the</b> wrong key is used by intruders. Chip Keys successfully protect cars from theft in two ways: forcing the ignition cylinder won't start <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and <b>the</b> keys are difficult to duplicate. This is why chip keys are popular in modern cars and help decrease car theft.|$|R

2500|$|Sutcliffe {{assaulted}} {{a prostitute}} {{he had met}} whilst searching {{for a woman who}} had tricked him out of money. He left his friend's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, {{as if he had been}} running. He told his friend Trevor Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, [...] "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and got in it".|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E
2500|$|George escapes, swims to shore, suspiciously confronts campers {{on his way}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and {{eventually}} drives to the Vickers' lodge. There, he tries to relax, but is increasingly tense. He says nothing to anyone about having been on the lake, or about what happened there. Meanwhile, Alice's body is discovered, and her death is treated as a murder investigation almost from the first moment, while an abundant amount of evidence and witness reports stack up against George. Just as Angela's father approves Angela's marriage to him, George is {{arrested and charged with}} Alice's murder. Though the viewer knows that the planned murder in fact turned into an accidental drowning, George's furtive actions before, and after, Alice's death condemn him. His denials are futile, and he is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Near the end, he confesses to the priest in his cell that, although he did not kill Alice, he didn't act as to save her, during the few dramatic moments when he could have, because he was thinking of Angela. Then, the priest states that, in his heart, it was murder.|$|E
