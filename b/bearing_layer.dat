30|$|This paper {{discussed}} the liquefaction-induced {{damage to buildings}} {{that occurred during the}} Meinong earthquake. From site investigations, we determined that the formations of the liquefied sites always exhibit a very soft clay layer below the saturated sandy soils. The foundation load is mainly supported by the sandy soils and a preshear (deviatoric) stress existing in the foundation soil of the footing before earthquake. The soil is easier to reach the failure state due to the additional shear force and the generation of the excess pore water pressure triggered by the earthquake excitation and cause large settlement and deformation. During the shaking of the earthquake, the excess pore water pressure is generated and decreased the strength of the saturated sandy soils. When the softened sandy soils beneath the spread foundation cannot bear the deviatoric stress induced by the loading of the surface building as well as the additional shear force due to the seismic loading, the foundation <b>bearing</b> <b>layer</b> will be squeezed out laterally and upward. Then, the foundation load is transferred to the soft clay beneath the saturated sandy soils, which induces more settlement of the building. Note that if the weight of the surface building is uneven like the case shown in Fig.  4, the differential settlement can be observed in case of the foundation <b>bearing</b> <b>layer</b> being liquefied during earthquakes.|$|E

Much remains unknown about vivianite formation, the factors controlling its occurrence, and its relevance for P burial during early sediment diagenesis. To study the occurrence of vivianite and to assess its relevance for P binding, surface sediments of two hydrologically contrasting waters were analysed by heavy-liquid separation and subsequent powder X-ray diffraction. In Lake Arendsee, vivianite was present in deeper sediment horizons {{and not in the}} uppermost layers with a sharp transition between vivianite and non-vivianite <b>bearing</b> <b>layers.</b> In contrast, in lowland river Lower Havel vivianite was present in the upper sediment layers and not in deeper horizons with a gradual transition between non-vivianite and vivianite <b>bearing</b> <b>layers.</b> In both waters, vivianite occurrence was accompanied by the presence of pyrite (FeS 2). Vivianite formation was favoured by an elevated iron availability through a lower degree of sulphidisation and was present at a molar ratio of total sulphur to reactive iron smaller than 1. 1, only. A longer lasting burden of sediments by organic matter, i. e. due to eutrophication, favours the release of sulphides, and the formation of insoluble iron sulphides leading to a lack of available iron and to less or no vivianite formation. This weakening in sedimentary P retention, representing a negative feedback mechanism (P release) in terms of water quality, could be partly compensated by harmless Fe amendments...|$|R
