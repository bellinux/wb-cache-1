5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy {{he is going to}} die {{in a couple of weeks}} and makes Guy promise he will not tell Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating away into the sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

Prior to filming, Foster met with the fallen serviceman's family and friends to understand the person he would be portraying. [...] "It was such a rich opportunity {{to listen to the}} Axelsons talk about their son. Their generosity and inclusiveness with me was so touching and open.

500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV, Beyoncé stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation to the next one. She concluded, [...] " [...] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be." [...] For {{the music of the}} album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased [...] "the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.|$|E

He learns that the legislators are all wealthy donkeys and that the seats in Parliament are bought and paid for. Satis states that in England, [...] "Members are elected because they represent most faithfully the opinions of their constituents." [...] The king's mother and grandmother enter holding a baby (the king's great grandmother). Thinking that Satis looks 74, ask him where his nurse is. He replies that he's not so old at all, only 52. He tells the king's mother that she is pretty, and she leaves in a huff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} of Bahá'í law is firmly placed on individual conscience, understanding and reasoning. The Bahá'í laws {{are not considered}} as binding to anyone until they become a Bahá'í, and becoming a Bahá'í is not conditional on a person's level of adherence to the laws; an individual is expected to gradually apply laws on a personal basis. Bahá'ís are expected to follow the laws not because they will be punished for breaking them, but instead <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> Bahá'u'lláh and that they fear God. [...] The teachings of the Bahá'í Faith state that individuals are answerable to God. [...] The observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual, but some laws may be enforced to a degree by Bahá'í institutions, {{by the loss of}} Bahá'í administrative rights, if they bring the Bahá'í community into public disrepute.|$|E

2500|$|The author {{describes}} techniques {{by which}} {{masculine and feminine}} types of the third sex (tritiya-prakriti), as well as women, perform fellatio. The Second Part, Ninth Chapter of Kama Sutra specifically describes two kinds of men that we would recognize today as masculine- and feminine-type homosexuals but which are mentioned in older, Victorian British translations as simply [...] "eunuchs." [...] The chapter describes their appearances – feminine types dressed up as women whereas masculine types maintained muscular physiques and grew small beards, moustaches, etc. – and their various professions as masseurs, barbers and prostitutes are all described. Such homosexual men were also known to marry, according to the Kama Sutra: [...] "There are also third-sex citizens, sometimes greatly attached {{to one another and}} with complete faith in one another, who get married together." [...] (KS 2.9.36). In the [...] "Jayamangala" [...] of Yashodhara, an important twelfth-century commentary on the Kama Sutra, it is also stated: [...] "Citizens with this kind of homosexual inclination, who renounce women and can do without them willingly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> one another, get married together, bound by a deep and trusting friendship." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{eventually}} get together but writers planned to create fresh relationship dramas for the pair. Zosia {{is happy with}} her relationship and wants to plan their future. She asks for a key to Oliver's flat but she is met with optimism from him. Then a pregnant patient Melissa Peters (Faye McKeever) arrives on Darwin ward. She recalls having a one-night stand with Oliver and claims he is the baby's father. They later find out Melissa has lied and Oliver is not the father. But the scenario damages Zosia and Oliver's relationship. When Zosia is named in the local newspaper as having bipolar disorder she is eager to prove it will not effect her surgical abilities. As her senior Oliver decides to pull rank and have her removed from a major operation. When she finds out the truth she ends their relationship. Arfwedson {{said that it was}} [...] "very sad" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> each other, but Zosia cannot move on from his betrayal. She believed Oliver made the correct decision, describing her character's mood as [...] "explosive" [...] and [...] "not in a good place". She is [...] "most hurt" [...] that Oliver spoke to his colleague, Specialist registrar Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) privately about her state of mind, rather than discuss it with her first. Arfwedson {{thought it would be a}} [...] "shame to lose" [...] the on-screen romance as they have a [...] "a lovely partnership". Zosia decides to give Oliver another chance. She tracks him down to a bar but finds him drunken and kissing staff nurse Cara Martinez (Niamh Walsh). The actress described Zosia's shock [...] "As far as Zosia's concerned that really is the end for them. It’s very sad." ...|$|E

No; it's <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do <b>love</b> each other that their faults are such a mutual torment. If they were indifferent, they wouldn't mind each other's faults.

Many people believed that Shakespeare was the greatest play-wright who ever lived, also a fine poet.

6000|$|THE LIFE. If the {{literature}} of a people springs directly out of its life, then the stern, barbarous life of our Saxon forefathers would seem, at first glance, to promise little of good literature. Outwardly their life was a constant hardship, a perpetual struggle against savage nature and savage men. Behind them were gloomy forests inhabited by wild beasts and still wilder men, and peopled in their imagination with dragons and evil shapes. In front of them, thundering at the very dikes for entrance, was the treacherous North Sea, with its fogs and storms and ice, but with that indefinable call of the deep that all men hear who live long beneath its influence. Here they lived, a big, blond, powerful race, and hunted and fought and sailed, and drank and feasted when their labor was done.

60|$|Those {{that this}} Editor has in mind, {{from one of}} whom indeed he {{obtained}} the history printed in these pages, belong to a quite different category, men of small means often, who collect old things, {{for the most part}} at out-of-the-way sales or privately, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>love</b> them, and sometimes sell them again because they must. Frequently these old things appeal, not because of any intrinsic value that they may have, not even for their beauty, for they may be quite unattractive even to the cultivated eye, but rather for their associations. Such folk love to reflect upon and to speculate about the long-dead individuals who have owned the relics, who have supped their soup from the worn Elizabethan spoon, who have sat at the rickety oak table found in a kitchen or an out-house, or upon the broken, ancient chair. They love to think of the little children whose skilful, tired hands wrought the faded sampler and whose bright eyes smarted over its innumerable stitches.|$|E
