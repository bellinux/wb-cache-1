40|$|International audienceChecking satisfiability of {{temporal}} constraint networks involves infinite variables domains. We explore a solution based upon finite partitions of infinite domains. Though a straightforward partition {{results in a}} sound and complete <b>backtrack,</b> its extension to forward checking is not complete. Using bi-intervals, we obtain sound and complete <b>backtrack</b> and forward checking algorithms. Moreover, we show that bi-intervals used in a hybrid algorithm which also instanti- ates constraints improve <b>backtrack</b> efficiency...|$|R
5|$|Intuitively, the {{algorithm}} follows all chains of inference after making {{each of its}} choices. This either leads to a contradiction and a <b>backtracking</b> step, or, if no contradiction is derived, {{it follows that the}} choice was a correct one that leads to a satisfying assignment. Therefore, {{the algorithm}} either correctly finds a satisfying assignment or it correctly determines that the input is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on <b>backtracking</b> or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers commended the game's {{emphasis}} on discovery and freedom, but criticized its technical issues, in-game navigation, and endgame <b>backtracking.</b> They likened the game's rotation mechanic to the 2D–3D shifts of Echochrome, Nebulus, Super Paper Mario, and Crush. Fez won awards including the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Eurogamer 2012 Game of the Year.

5|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration.

5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo's top seller {{during the}} 1999 holiday season, with 2.3 million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics award for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game's exceptional size and length, but criticized {{its emphasis on}} item collection and <b>backtracking.</b> Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare's 1998 predecessor, Banjo-Kazooie, despite Donkey Kong 64 mandatory memory add-on. The game's camera controls also frustrated reviewers. Critics felt that the game {{did not meet the}} revolutionary potential of Donkey Kong Country, but remained among the best 3D platform games on the console.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of <b>backtracking</b> and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E

While local search algorithms {{have been shown to be}} particularly useful for random instances of SAT, recent <b>backtrack</b> search algorithms have been used for solving large instances of SAT from real-world applications.

In addition, during the last decade, a much better understanding of problem hardness, typical case complexity, and <b>backtrack</b> search behavior has been obtained. One example of a recent insight into <b>backtrack</b> search concerns so-called heavy-tailed behavior in randomized versions of <b>backtrack</b> search. Such heavy-tails explain the large variance in runtime often observed in practice. However, heavy-tailed behavior does certainly not occur on all instances. This has led to a need for a more precise characterization of when heavy-tailedness does and when it does not occur in <b>backtrack</b> search. In this paper, we provide such a characterization. We identify di#erent statistical regimes of the tail of the runtime distributions of randomized <b>backtrack</b> search methods and show how they are correlated with the "sophistication" of the search procedure combined with the inherent hardness of the instances. We also show that the runtime distribution regime is highly correlated with the distribution of the depth of inconsistent subtrees discovered during the search. In particular, we show that an exponential distribution of the depth of inconsistent subtrees combined with a search space that grows exponentially with the depth of the inconsistent subtrees implies heavy-tailed behavior...|$|R
