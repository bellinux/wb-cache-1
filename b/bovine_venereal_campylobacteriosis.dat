40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> <b>campylobacteriosis</b> in the Lake Chad Basin of Nigeria was investigated using an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{for the detection of}} IgA antibodies specific to Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis in vaginal mucus (n = 66). IgA antibodies specific to C. fetus subsp. venerealis were detected in 7 (11 %) vaginal mucus samples. All but one of the IgA-positive samples originated from cows belonging to herds with a history of abortion and infertility which suggested an association between antibody detection and poor herd fertility. It was concluded that <b>bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> <b>campylobacteriosis</b> is prevalent in the Lake Chad Basin of Nigeria and its contribution to reduced reproductive performance in cattle herds may be grossly underestimated {{in this part of the}} world...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> <b>campylobacteriosis,</b> {{caused by}} Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv), is {{regarded}} as one of the major threats to the cattle industry around the world. Abortion and infertility are two important reproductive problems in cows infected with C. fetus subsp. venerealis. Reports on the presence of Cfv are scarce in the cattle, in Iran. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the presence of Cfv in the reproductive tract of dairy cattle either slaughtered in Shiraz abattoir or dairy herds with a history of infertility and abortion, and further to identify and differentiate this micro-organism in dairy cattle in Fars, south of Iran. A total of 95 smegma samples from the preputial cavity and the fornix of the cervical opening were collected using scraping method from bulls (n = 34) and cows (n = 61) in addition to eight samples of commercially bull frozen semen. Smegma samples were then cultured for isolation of Cfv and then the extracted DNA was examined for the presence of Cfv using an optimized multiplex PCR assay. None of the frozen semen samples examined were positive for Cfv. However, out of 95 smegma samples, thirteen animals (12. 6 %) were found positive for Cfv consisting of 3 males and 10 females. In conclusion, the results of the current study clearly confirmed the presence of Cfv using PCR in the slaughtered cattle and dairy farms with a history of poor fertility and abortion in Fars, Iran...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> <b>campylobacteriosis</b> (BVC) is a {{venereal disease}} causing {{infertility}} in cows due to early embryonic loss. Caused by Campylobacter fetus subsp venerealis (Cfv), which {{lives in the}} preputial crypts of older asymptomatic carrier bulls and the vagina of carrier cows. Diagnosis of the disease is difficult {{as it is a}} fastidious organism to culture and the serological methods which have been developed to diagnose BVC, exhibit substantial cross-reactivity with Campylobacter fetus subsp fetus (Cff), due to the close genomic and phenotypic relationship of the two subspecies. Definitive differentiation between Cfv and Cff requires molecular biology techniques. In New Zealand, Cfv was last isolated in 1993 and suspected again in 2001 / 2002 after the use of a recently-developed IgA ELISA test that claimed to be 98. 5 % specific for Cfv. A nation wide study showed that there was no relationship between the test's results and the reproductive performance of the herds. Most of the positive results obtained were false probably due to cross-reactions with Cff The lack of positive isolations of Cfv raised questions about the sensitivity of the isolation methods used. Five experiments were undertaken. Experiments 1 - 3 examined the microbiological methods that are used to isolated Cfv. Results indicated that the optimal samples and culture conditions were preputial washes or scrapes from bulls, or vaginal washes (20 ml PBS) from cows, enriched in Lander's medium for three days before subculture onto blood agar. All cultures need to be undertaken under microaerophilic conditions. These experiments also addressed the reliability of the IgA ELISA for animals managed according to the husbandry conditions that prevail in New Zealand. Results showed that {{there was a great deal}} of within- and between- animal variation in ELISA values and that there was substantial cross reactivity with Cff. (ICC ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 03 depending on the Group and all heifers challenged with Cff became positive to IgA ELISA). In consequence, the test appears to be of limited diagnostic value in situations where cattle may be cross contaminated with Cff. Experiment 4 evaluated a PCR method for identification of Cfv in preputial washings that had been inoculated with small numbers of the organism, whilst Experiment 5 used the same method to attempt to identify Cfv in preputial washings or scrapings that had been collected from experimentally-infected bulls. Positive results were obtained with as little as 880 Cfv cells/ml of preputial wash after samples had been concentrated by centrifugation and filtration (5 μm and 0. 8 μm pore size filters). The PCR also detected the presence of Cfv in two bulls, 48 h after infection. It was concluded that the IgA ELISA test is unlikely to be suitable for use in New Zealand, due to the risk of cows being contaminated with Cff from the sheep with which they are co-managed. Microbiological identification, whether through PCR or culture and isolate, although difficult, remains the definitive diagnostic method. If the presence of the disease in New Zealand is to be confirmed or refuted, careful and methodical collection of samples from animals, whose history suggests the possibility of the condition, will be required...|$|E
40|$|Host {{parasite}} {{relationships in}} the female genital tract were studied in <b>bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> vibriosis by investigating agglutinin production and alterations in superficial antigens of the bacterium {{during the course of}} infection in two heifers. Cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) steamed cell agglutinins were shown to appear earlier and remain at consistently higher levels than whole-cell agglutinins. Whole-cell agglutinin titers fluctuated much more than steamed cell titers, suggesting possible changes in whole-cell antigens. Marked antigenic variation was demonstrated in successive monthly CVM isolates from the two heifers by agglutination tests with rabbit antisera of various specificities. Some changes in CVM antibody specificity during the infection were noted also. Antigenic variation in the bacterium was proposed as a mechanism for maintenance of the asymptomatic cervicovaginal carrier state in the presence of antibody...|$|R
40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus are {{important}} extracellular protozoans that cause, respectively, human and <b>bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> diseases. Trichomonads are extracellular parasites that primarily inhabit the genital tracts of the mammalian hosts where they overcome the mucus barrier and parasitize mucosa by contact-dependent or contact-independent cytotoxicity. Transient immunity is usually {{achieved by the}} host after clinical infection. At present, vaccination in cattle reduces infection rates and reproductive wastage in affected herds. After vaccination, immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels increase in systemic circulation while immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels rise in the vagina. Only moderate protection is conferred by means of vaccination. Future vaccine development strategies are needed for cattle to enhance the antigenic component or use adjuvant that strongly activates the innate immune response to produce safe and potent vaccines.

40|$|Data were {{gathered}} for 117 cats from 89 catteries {{at an international}} cat show to examine prevalence and risk factors for feline Tritrichomonas foetus and Giardia infection. Prevalence of T. foetus was 31 % among cats (36 out of 117) and catteries (28 out of 89) based on results of fecal smear examination (5 out of 36), fecal culture in modified Diamond’s medium (9 out of 36), fecal culture in In Pouch TF medium (20 out of 36), or PCR amplification of the ribosomal RNA gene from feces with T. foetus-specific primers (34 out of 36). Catteries in which T. foetus was identified {{were more likely to}} have had a recent history of diarrhea, historical diagnosis of coccidia infection in adult cats, and a decreased number of square feet of facility per cat. Evidence did not exist for the ongoing transmission of T. foetus by water, food, or contact with other species. Tritrichomonas foetus was recently identified as a cause of large-bowel diarrhea in domestic cats (6, 7, 10, 15, 16). Based on morphology and sequence identity of rRNA, feline T. foetus is indistinguishable from <b>bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> T. foetus and porcine enteric Tritrichomonas suis (1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18). The origin of T. foetus and the prevalence of infected cats are unknown. We thus performed an epidemiological study of feline T. foetu...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a serological assay for detection of (l) an erythrocyte-adhering molecule(s) shed by the <b>bovine</b> <b>venereal</b> pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus and (II) serum antibodies to this antigen(s) in exposed cattle. Sera from exposed and unexposed cattle were tested {{for their ability}} to induce complement-mediated lysis of bovine erythrocytes that had been previously incubated overnight at room temperature in pH-adjusted supernatants of T. foetus culture media. Eight of 180 serum specimens from six groups of presumably unexposed cows or heifers showed a positive (> or = 1 : 2) hemolytic titer (specificity = 95. 6 %). Thirteen of 14 females in two experimentally infected groups showed a positive hemolytic titer following infection (sensitivity = 94 %). In experimentally infected heifers, there was little correlation (r 2 = 0. 33) between serum hemolytic titers with respect to shed antigen and titers obtained in serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in which whole T. foetus served as the antigen. Serum hemolytic titers rose 3 to 4 weeks sooner than did previously described vaginal mucus immunoglobulin G 1 or immunoglobulin A titers with respect to whole-cell antigen or TF 1. 17 subunit antigen, respectively. Among 14 chronically infected bulls, only 6 (43 %) showed a positive hemolytic titer. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to show a specific serological response in the host to an in vitro-shed antigen(s) of T. foetus and suggests a useful diagnostic test for potentially exposed herds...|$|R
