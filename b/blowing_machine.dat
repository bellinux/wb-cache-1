25|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{glass bottle}} <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> was an automatic model introduced in 1905. The machine, {{operated by a}} two-man crew working 12-hour shifts, could produce 17,280 bottles in 24 hours, compared to 2,880 bottles made by a crew of six men and boys working in a shop for a day. The cost of making bottles by machine was 10 to 12 cents per gross compared to $1.80 per gross by the manual glassblowers and helpers.|$|E
500|$|The glass <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> used by American Window Glass {{factories}} {{was created}} by Pittsburgh resident John H. Lubbers, and he continued to contribute improvements to the machine over the next decade. [...] By using the Lubbers machine, human glass blowers were replaced with a machine operator paid 30 percent of the glass blower wage. The machine was also five times more productive than the human blowers. It could make windows four times as large because a larger cylinder was extracted from the tank of molten glass. [...] Thus, the highest–paid skilled workers in the United States were considered obsolete. In the case of Hartford City, machines replaced most of the human glass blowers by 1908.|$|E

500|$|After the acquisition, the Hartford City Glass works {{became known}} as plant number 3 of the American Window Glass Company. The plant {{employed}} 450 people in 1901. [...] As natural gas supplies in Indiana became depleted, many manufacturers moved or did not survive. [...] The major plants of the American Window Glass successfully changed energy sources from natural gas to gas made from coal. [...] The company also had a technological advantage. Instead of using a glass blower, American Window Glass plants extracted molten glass with a machine. The machine, which was not immediately utilized at all American Window Glass plants, {{was known as the}} Lubbers <b>blowing</b> <b>machine.</b> Refinements to the machine and glass-making process were made at the Hartford City works by plant manager Harry G. Slingluff. Production records for the entire company were set at the Hartford City plant in 1905 and 1907—using the Lubbers machines.|$|E

50|$|A step beyond {{mechanization}} is automation. Early production machinery, such as {{the glass}} bottle <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> (ca. 1890s), required a lot of operator involvement. By the 1920s fully automatic machines, which required much less operator attention, were being used.|$|E

50|$|Blowing {{machines}} are classified {{with regard to}} the diameter of the cable they can handle and the type of drive system (track feeder, roller feeder, belt feeder or blowing heads without feeders). The optical fiber cable <b>blowing</b> <b>machine</b> are of 2 types.|$|E
50|$|The {{biggest impact}} of early mass {{production}} was in manufacturing everyday items, {{such as at}} the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which electrified its mason jar plant in Muncie, Indiana, USA around 1900. The new automated process used glass <b>blowing</b> <b>machines</b> to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. Electric mixers replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 day laborers for moving heavy loads across the factory.|$|R

50|$|Between the Panic of 1907 and World War I, the GBBA {{found itself}} struggling. Employment (and membership) dropped sharply due to bad {{economic}} conditions. As {{more and more}} states and large cities adopted Prohibition laws, the need for bottles fell drastically, causing even more unemployment and membership losses for the union., Mechanization worsened the unemployment situation, as companies developed procedures that allowed molten glass to flow directly from the furnace into the molding and <b>blowing</b> <b>machines.</b> By 1920, the hand blower and hand-operated glass-making machine were nearly eliminated. Although the union had organized 95 percent of worksites employing hand-blown or hand-operated machines, it had but a single contract at an automated company.|$|R

This is because the company Terxo manufactures these bottles for Emmi too. In addition, the injection molding and injection <b>blow</b> molding <b>machine</b> manufacturer Ganahl, who has produced the corresponding tools for Terxo and Medisize, also manufactures such bottles by themselves. This means that there are three companies in the canton of Zurich, which all supply the same customer with the same product.|$|R
