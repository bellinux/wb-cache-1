5|$|It would <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> 200 {{years before}} the active principles, quinine and other alkaloids, of cinchona bark were isolated. Quinine, a toxic plant alkaloid, is, in {{addition}} to its anti-malarial properties, an effective muscle relaxant, as the modern use for nocturnal leg cramps suggests (corroborating its use for shivering by the Peruvian Indians).|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations are known to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E

5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the core is thought to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate {{a substantial amount of}} the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would <b>be.</b> <b>Nearly</b> all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Mather's {{requests}} concerning the new charter were rejected, but William and Mary allowed Mather to nominate the colony's Lt. Governor and council members. The monarchs appointed Phips {{as the first}} royal governor, with Increase Mather's approval, under a newly issued colonial charter for the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The charter greatly expanded the colony's bounds, including not just the territories of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but also those of the Plymouth Colony, islands south of Cape Cod including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, and the present-day territories of Maine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. It also expanded the franchise to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> universal (for males).|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> impossible.|$|E

5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Wales won the Home Championship and then, in 1910 – {{with the}} {{inclusion}} of France – the first Five Nations. In 1911, Wales took the first Five Nations Grand Slam by winning all their matches in the Five Nations; France were heavily defeated by Wales at St Helens in 1910 (49–14) and Ivor Morgan scored two tries in the match. It would <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> forty years before they achieved a Grand Slam again. England's defeat of Wales at Cardiff in 1913 was Wales' first home loss {{to one of the}} Home Nations since 1899, and their first home loss to England since 1895. The Great War came in 1914 and rugby was suspended for the duration.|$|E

5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is a {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius {{constellation}} that is host to the planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb. The star is estimated to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> 20,000 light years away and approximately one fifth {{the mass of the}} Sun, although large confidence intervals exist, reflecting the uncertainties in both the mass and distance. The star drew the attention of astronomers when it became the lens of gravitational microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387L, in which it eclipsed a background star and created distorted caustics, an envelope of reflected or refracted light rays. Analysis of the caustic events and of follow-up observational data led to the planet's discovery, which was reported in February 2011.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May, an {{immediate}} vigil and protest {{was launched in}} light of international reports of the shelling of Tamil civilians in the Sri Lanka Army-declared safe zone in which 378 civilians had been killed, while protesters claimed it to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> 3,000. The protest began on Spadina Avenue but abruptly spread past police cordons onto the Gardiner Expressway, a busy freeway in the city, bringing all vehicular traffic to a halt. The protesters, including {{women and children in}} strollers, said they would not stop blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka. Police subsequently shut-down the Gardiner Expressway and Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, causing heavy traffic congestions throughout other Toronto streets and highways.|$|E
5|$|Philip DeGuere, whose {{credits include}} the TV series Alias Smith and Jones, {{developed}} a script {{in the late}} 1970s for Universal, who planned to film it initially as a six-hour mini-series for CBS Television, and later as a two- or three-hour telemovie for ABC. However, Universal discovered that its contracts with Arthur C. Clarke - some of which dated back to 1957 - were out of date. These contractual difficulties were resolved in 1979 and DeGuere worked with legendary comic book artist Neal Adams on preproduction drawings and other material. The project had Clarke's approval. However Universal decided that the budget required would <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> $40 million and they were only prepared to spend $10 million, so the movie was not made.|$|E
5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to <b>be</b> <b>nearly</b> fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
