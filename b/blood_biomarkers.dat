40|$|A robust <b>blood</b> <b>biomarker</b> is {{urgently}} needed to facilitate early prognosis for those {{at risk for}} Alzheimer's disease (AD). Redox reactive autoantibodies (R-RAAs) represent a novel family of antibodies detectable only after exposure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, plasma or immunoglobulin fractions to oxidizing agents. We have previously reported that R-RAA antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) are significantly decreased in the CSF and serum of AD patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). These studies were extended to measure R-RAA aPL in serum samples obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Serum samples from the ADNI- 1 diagnostic groups from participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and HCs were blinded for diagnosis and analyzed for R-RAA aPL by ELISA. Demographics, cognitive data at baseline and yearly follow-up were subsequently provided by ADNI after posting assay data. As observed in CSF, R-RAA aPL in sera from the AD diagnostic group were significantly reduced compared to HC. However, the sera from the MCI population contained significantly elevated R-RAA aPL activity relative to AD patient and/or HC sera. The data presented in {{this study indicate that}} R-RAA aPL show promise as a <b>blood</b> <b>biomarker</b> for detection of early AD, and warrant replication in a larger sample.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> have a {{positive}} association with stroke outcome, but adding <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) did not significantly improve its discriminatory ability. We investigated the association of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score with unfavourable functional outcome (defined as a 30 -day modified Rankin Scale [mRS] ≥ 3) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and examined whether the addition of <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> (troponin I [TnI], fibrinogen, C-reactive protein [CRP]) affects the model discriminatory ability. METHODS: We conducted an observational single-centre study of consecutive patients with AIS. All patients were admitted to hospital within 24 hours from the neurological symptoms onset. RESULTS: Of 240 patients (mean age 70. 0 ± 8. 9 years), unfavourable 30 -day outcome occurred in 92 (38. 3 %). Patients with mRS ≥ 3 were older {{and more likely to}} have atrial fibrillation or other comorbidities (all p 0. 09 µg/L). Compared with each of these biomarkers, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score had significantly better predictive ability for poor stroke outcome (c-statistic for CRP, Fibrinogen and TnI was 0. 853; 95 %CI, 0. 802 - 0. 895, 0. 848; 95 %CI, 0. 796 - 0. 891, and 0. 792; 95 %CI, 0. 736 - 0. 842, all p 0. 05).

40|$|Intakes of {{the highly}} {{unsaturated}} fatty acids (HUFA, ≥ 20 Carbons, ≥ 3 double bonds) eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3, DHA) greater than 0. 25 g/d are currently recommended for health benefits. Targets for omega- 3 <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> have also been proposed based on associations with protection against coronary heart disease mortality. The relationship between diet intakes and <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> is not well defined, particularly {{differences between men and}} women. North American intakes and <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> of EPA and DHA are typically below recommendations and targets. To address this disparity, adherence to dietary advice strategies to increase EPA + DHA intake was investigated over one year. Adherence was sustained up to 12 weeks and long-term adherence was well characterized by the % of DHA in erythrocytes. For women, n- 3 HUFA <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> increased following nutraceutical or combined strategy dietary advice but not seafood or functional food advice. To assist in the assessment of EPA + DHA intakes, food sources of EPA and DHA in Canada were incorporated into a semi-quantitative, nutrient-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and validated. The FFQ is an adequate tool for estimating habitual EPA and DHA intake and ranking Canadian adults by their intakes. The blood biomarker response to recommended intakes of 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 g/d EPA + DHA was also characterized in adult men and women. Blood n- 3 HUFA biomarkers increased in a dose-dependent manner and aligned with blood targets associated with primary cardiac arrest risk reduction. Sex differences in the DHA:EPA ratio in blood observed with low intakes at baseline disappeared following 0. 25 g/d EPA + DHA. These findings are applicable towards informing achievable dietary guidelines for EPA + DHA intake and improving measurement of EPA + DHA intake in relation to blood n- 3 HUFA biomarkers...|$|E

40|$|Omega- 3 fatty acids, {{particularly}} docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicospentaenoic acid (EPA), {{are important}} mediators for cardiovascular disease, fetal/infant development, neurological disorders and inflammatory diseases. Supplementation and washout studies {{are important for}} future research on the physiological effects of omega- 3 fatty acids and for determination of the proper washout period for future cross-over studies. In this study, omega- 3 fatty acid <b>blood</b> <b>biomarker</b> comparisons are made for the n- 3 HUFA score (% of n- 3 HUFAs in total HUFAs) and omega- 3 index (sum of EPA + DHA) in plasma, erythrocytes, whole blood and a novel finger-tip prick blood method (FTPB) of analysis. This FTPB method of fatty acid analysis is further tested to determine the potential for its use in fatty acid analysis. In addition, gender differences in response to omega- 3 fish oil supplementation are analyzed in all four blood fractions. Nine males and seven females were supplemented with 8 fish-oil capsules per day (providing 3. 2 g/day EPA and 1. 6 g/day DHA) for four weeks, followed by an eight-week omega- 3 washout period. Venous plasma, erythrocyte and whole blood samples were collected during weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12 and FTPB samples were collected weekly during supplementation and washout fatty acid analysis was performed. EPA and DHA incorporation is lowest in magnitude in erythrocytes relative to all other blood fractions. Omega- 3 <b>blood</b> <b>biomarker</b> comparisons demonstrate that the n- 3 HUFA score is a more reliable measure across all blood fractions compared to the omega- 3 index. In addition, the n- 3 HUFA score demonstrates no differences (p > 0. 05) between FTPB and whole blood analysis, providing evidence to support its usefulness {{as a tool for}} fatty acid analysis. However, differences (p 0. 05) in males across all blood fractions. Furthermore, a gender effect (p 0. 05) between genders. Washout results in a return of levels towards baseline, however, baseline levels are not fully reached. Furthermore, while gender differences do begin to reform during washout, these differences are not significant (p > 0. 05). In conclusion, omega- 3 fatty acid responses, particularly DHA:EPA ratio, demonstrate significant gender differences that may be related to differences in long-chain PUFA synthesis pathways between males and females. In addition, the n- 3 HUFA score may be a more valuable omega- 3 <b>blood</b> <b>biomarker</b> than the omega- 3 index, as the n- 3 HUFA score displays more consistent levels across all blood fractions. Finally, the FTPB method of analysis may be a useful tool in the measurement of fatty acid composition, however, some microwave methylation problems do exist, specifically in the phospholipid class of lipids...|$|R

We are therefore eager to advance early and rapid diagnosis, prognosis and optimal risk stratification, as well as secondary prevention. In this context, <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> may improve patient care, as they have already done in other fields in the past, for example, troponin T/I in patients with heart attacks, natriuretic peptides in patients with heart failure or PCT (procalcitonin) [2] in patients with pneumonia. In the setting of acute stroke, a blood biomarker can be any quantifiable entity that reflects the manifestation of a stroke-related process. The most fruitful implementation of stroke biomarkers is in areas where information from traditional clinical sources is limited. There may be markers, for example, to guide risk stratification, reveal stroke aetiology, identify patients who may benefit most from interventions, monitor treatment efficacy, and recognise the risk of short-term complications or unfavourable long-term outcomes. For this review we focus on <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> that could help distinguish the underlying aetiology of an ischaemic stroke. Stroke {{tends to be a}} much more heterogeneous condition than ischaemic heart disease, which is caused by atherosclerosis {{in the vast majority of}} cases. Causes of stroke include small and large vessel disease, cardioembolism, dissections, and rare vasculo- and coagulopathies, among others. Because of this heterogeneity among stroke patients, it is clear that a monolithic approach to stroke prevention or secondary prevention is not warranted. Aetiological classification is important specifically because prognosis, risk of recurrence and management options differ greatly between aetiological subtypes. Considering that today up to 30 % of stroke patients still cannot be classified into a specific subtype [3], the ability to improve aetiological classification to direct prevention methods at the underlying mechanism would be of greatest interest. For this review we collected data from studies, on aetiological <b>blood</b> <b>biomarkers</b> in ischaemic stroke patients, listed in PubMed up to October 2014.
