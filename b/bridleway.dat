5|$|Stannah at Legburthwaite is the {{starting}} point for the <b>bridleway</b> to Sticks Pass, from which Helvellyn can be approached along the main ridge track from the north.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a <b>bridleway</b> and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E
5|$|Several {{possible}} routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A <b>bridleway</b> winds up the fellside, over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.|$|E
50|$|The section from West Meon {{south to}} the Eastleigh to Fareham line is open to walkers, cyclists and horse riders and uses {{existing}} public <b>bridleways</b> and some newly created permissive <b>bridleways.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{park has}} {{designated}} <b>bridleways</b> and cycle paths. [...] These are shown on maps and noticeboards displayed near the main entrances, {{along with other}} regulations that govern use of the park. The <b>bridleways</b> are special {{in that they are}} for horses (and their riders) only and not open to cyclists like normal <b>bridleways.</b> Cycling is allowed only on main roads, the Thames Cycle Route through the centre of the park (10mph), and on the Tamsin Trail (the shared-use pedestrian–cycle path that runs close to the park's perimeter).|$|R
50|$|There are footpaths, cycle {{paths and}} <b>bridleways</b> around the lake.|$|R
5|$|The town {{is served}} by Whitby railway station which is the {{terminus}} of the Esk Valley Line from Middlesbrough operated by Northern. It was formerly the northern terminus of the Whitby, Pickering and York Line, and in 2007 the North Yorkshire Moors Railway began a summer service between Pickering and Whitby operated by steam locomotives. The Scarborough and Whitby Railway following a scenic route along the coast was built in 1885 requiring construction of the red brick Larpool Viaduct across the Esk Valley into Whitby. The line closed {{as a result of}} the Beeching axe in 1965 and the trackbed is used as a footpath, <b>bridleway</b> and by cyclists. The Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway had a station at Whitby West Cliff and ran close to the cliffs to the north of the town. It opened in 1883 and closed in 1958.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} undeveloped {{line from}} Lewes to Sheffield Park has been safeguarded as a <b>bridleway</b> and footpath.|$|E
25|$|Other local {{destinations}} for walkers {{and mountain}} bikers include Lantern Pike (also accessible from Little Hayfield), a prominent {{hill to the}} north west of the village traversed by the Pennine <b>Bridleway.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1,800m {{of public}} {{rights of way}} and <b>bridleways</b> have been diverted.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of public {{footpaths}} and <b>bridleways,</b> including Cramble Cross.|$|R
50|$|It does {{encompass}} some tarmac road riding but {{is mainly}} on <b>bridleways</b> and paths.|$|R
25|$|All ascents end via {{the short}} walk from the <b>bridleway</b> at Iron Keld to the summit, but starts can be made at Skelwith Bridge, High Park, Oxen Fell, Yew Tree Tarn, Tom Gill, Tarn Hows or Knipe Fold.|$|E
25|$|The Pennine Way passes {{six miles}} (10km) east of Burnley; the Mary Towneley Loop, {{part of the}} Pennine <b>Bridleway,</b> the Brontë Way and the Burnley Way offer riders and walkers clearly signed routes through the {{countryside}} immediately surrounding the town.|$|E
25|$|Eagle Crag {{is usually}} climbed from Stonethwaite; {{it can be}} {{combined}} with the higher fells of High Raise and Ullscarf {{as well as the}} nearby Sergeant’s Crag. A direct ascent of the fell seems to be impossible when it is viewed from the Stonethwaite valley, with vertical walls of crags seemingly barring the way. However, a route can be found through the crags to attain the summit directly. Descents by this route are not recommended because of the dangerous crags which cannot be seen from above. An easier ascent follows the <b>bridleway</b> up Greenup Gill; this well-blazed trail is part of Wainwright’s Coast to Coast Walk. The route leaves the <b>bridleway</b> at height of 330metres and attains the fell by cutting back on itself and climbing steep grassy slopes to the summit.|$|E
5000|$|From the Forest of Marston Vale, NCR 51 takes {{residential}} roads, tracks, and <b>bridleways</b> to Cranfield ...|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{situated}} within the Dartmoor National Park. Three <b>bridleways</b> converge on Ditsworthy Warren House, {{and so it}} is a popular place for leisure users of Dartmoor, such as ramblers, letterboxers and geocachers, horseriders and mountain bikers. There is no vehicular right of way to the house, and apart from access on the <b>bridleways,</b> the land immediately surrounding the house is not open to the public.|$|R
5000|$|The parish {{is served}} {{by a number of}} {{footpaths}} and <b>bridleways</b> across the fields and open spaces as well as through the woods. These paths and <b>bridleways</b> can be enjoyed by walkers and nature lovers, and are an important resource for the Parish. There {{are a number of other}} paths and [...] "cut-throughs" [...] allowing pedestrians to move freely around the Parish, away from motorised traffic.|$|R
25|$|Most of the Pennine Way is {{on public}} footpaths, rather than bridleways, {{and so is}} not {{accessible}} to travellers on horseback or bicycle. However, a roughly parallel Pennine <b>Bridleway</b> is also open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.|$|E
25|$|The zoo is {{bisected}} by {{a public}} <b>bridleway,</b> Flag Lane. For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants' Bridge), drivable by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only crossing place within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and mobility scooters, called Bats' Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone, has improved the ability of visitors to circulate.|$|E
25|$|Standedge can be {{accessed}} by bus on the 184 service between Huddersfield and Manchester via Oldham. The service is run by First Greater Manchester and there are bus stops {{on each side of}} the road near the summit of Standedge (at the crossing of the Pennine Way and Pennine <b>Bridleway).</b> The buses are hourly Monday to Saturday daytime and run every two hours on Sunday daytimes.|$|E
50|$|Parts of the {{trackbed}} {{and those}} of neighbouring lines have been turned into public footpaths and <b>bridleways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Offa's Dyke Path {{passes through}} the village and there are various {{footpaths}} and <b>bridleways</b> for walker, cyclist and horse rider.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "bridleway" [...] is {{a highway}} {{that does not}} permit vehicles. Some <b>bridleways</b> also debar the driving of cattle.|$|R
25|$|Launchy Gill {{does not}} provide access to the open fell, the forest fence being a {{substantial}} barrier, but from further south at the Dob Gill car park the <b>bridleway</b> to Watendlath {{can be used to}} gain the main ridge between Ullscarf and High Tove, before striking north to the summit. If making for Armboth Fell from the west, webbed feet may be found useful after rain.|$|E
25|$|Todmorden is {{situated}} alongside the Pennine Way, Pennine <b>Bridleway,</b> Mary Towneley Loop and Calderdale Way and is popular for outdoor {{activities such as}} walking, fell running, mountain biking and bouldering. Its attractions include canals and locks, a park containing a sports centre, an outdoor skateboard park, tennis courts, a golf course, an aquarium/reptile house and a cricket ground. There are wooded areas around the town and cafés and restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Ullscarf is {{bordered on}} the west by the Greenup valley, with steep but mainly grassy slopes, the chief {{exception}} being Lining Crag. This impressive rock face is prominent in views up the valley, standing right beside the <b>bridleway.</b> From above however it is reached via a shallow grassy saddle and makes a fine viewpoint or picnic spot. A number of gills run down this western side of Ullscarf.|$|E
50|$|The {{village and}} its {{surroundings}} have many public footpaths and <b>bridleways</b> attracting walkers to the Emley Village Trail and other walks.|$|R
50|$|While many sunken lanes are now metalled, {{some are}} still unsurfaced green lanes, {{typically}} now designated as either <b>bridleways</b> or byways.|$|R
2500|$|... "Green Chain Walks" [...] are signposted {{footpaths}} {{that run}} through or link the green spaces. Some are also <b>bridleways</b> or cycle routes.|$|R
25|$|The Manchester and Birmingham Railway {{opened a}} line through Poynton in 1845 which today forms {{part of the}} London–Manchester main line. The station on this line, offers local {{services}} to Manchester and Macclesfield. The Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway was opened in 1869, with stations at Higher Poynton and Middlewood. Since its closure in 1970, the line has {{been converted into a}} footpath and <b>bridleway</b> called the Middlewood Way.|$|E
25|$|Hayfield is {{a popular}} walking and {{mountain}} biking centre; {{as well as being}} a traditional starting point for the ascent of Kinder Scout (traversed by the Pennine Way), the village lies directly on the Pennine <b>Bridleway</b> long-distance route (part of which follows the Sett Valley Trail). The village contains a high number of public rights-of-way, as well as bridleways, a legacy of the pre-industrial days, when they provided the only ways {{in and out of the}} area.|$|E
25|$|Ascents {{from the}} west begin at Swirls or Thirlspot. The Old Pony or White Stones Routes to Helvellyn {{can be used to}} give a start before {{branching}} off to White Side. Alternatively a more direct path from behind Fisher Place makes straight for the summit. From Glenridding in the east a <b>bridleway</b> zig-zags up beside Kepple Cove to reach the ridge not far from the top. It is also possible to take a direct (and steep) line direct from Brown Cove Dam.|$|E
5000|$|Parts of the {{trackbed}} in {{the vicinity}} of [...] and those of neighbouring lines have been turned into public footpaths and <b>bridleways.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The BHS Access and Rights of Way {{department}} {{works to}} improve the <b>bridleways</b> network throughout England, Scotland and Wales. It has created the 'National Bridleroute Network' of long distance equestrian routes, incorporating <b>bridleways,</b> byways and minor roads, which it has called 'bridleroutes'. [...] This work {{is supported by a}} network of national committees and regional groups. The BHS is consulted about proposed legislation, government planning guidance, Definitive Maps and road schemes, and has influenced and continues to influence legislation.|$|R
