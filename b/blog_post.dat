5|$|Golem Arcana was {{announced}} in July 2013 in a <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> on developer Harebrained Schemes' website. The <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> indicated that the studio would return to Kickstarter to fund the game, and {{that most of the}} studio's staff would continue to work on their other project, Shadowrun Returns, while a few would be split off to work on Golem Arcana. The Kickstarter campaign was launched on 10 September 2013 and ran until 15 October 2013, with a funding goal of $500,000. Backers could get the base game by pledging at the $55 Kickstarter reward tier.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the traditions}} that have {{occurred}} within the film, such as anthropomorphic animals and easter egg crossovers between movies that have been spotted by fans, a <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> entitled The Pixar Theory was published in 2013 by Jon Negroni to make the belief {{that all of the}} characters within the Pixar universe were related.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to explore the {{critical}} thinking demonstrated within student teacher <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> as student teachers discussed and reflected in an online community of practice during their student teaching experiences, and to determine the critical thinking demonstrated within student teaching <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> as the <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> related to the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) standards. The objectives of the thesis were to: (1) determine the frequency and the average level of critical thinking exhibited by Iowa State University agricultural education student teachers’ reflections through <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> in an electronic community of practice, (2) determine the relationship, if any, {{between the number of}} <b>blogs</b> <b>posted</b> by each student teacher and the average level of critical thinking displayed by student teachers within the <b>blog</b> <b>posts,</b> (3) determine the frequency in which student teacher <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> related to the ten InTASC standards, and (4) determine the relationship, if any, between the average level of critical thinking displayed within student teacher <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> and the frequency with which those <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> related to the InTASC standards. Twenty-one agricultural education student teachers at Iowa State University comprised the convenience sample during the fall of 2013 and spring 2014. Provisional coding and simultaneous coding were utilized to analyze student teacher blog posts; frequencies, percentages, and Spearman’s rho were calculated. Overall, student teacher <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> were at the lower-order levels of critical thinking. Student teachers did not utilize blogging and the community of practice in a manner that has recently been researched to enhance critical thinking skills. There was no relationship between the number of <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> a student teacher posted and that student teacher’s average level of critical thinking. Student teachers’ <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> most often related to Professional Development and Ethical Practices and related to Content Knowledge least often. The average level of critical thinking demonstrated per InTASC standard decreased with {{an increase in the number}} of <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> that related to that standard. It is recommended that the University supervisors continue to facilitate student teachers throughout the student teaching experience. University supervisors should incorporate rubrics and question prompts to assist as student teachers provide meaningful feedback to their peers and develop critical thinking skills. It is also important to gain student teachers’ perspectives when coding to ensure that the researcher is coding consistently with student teachers’ <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> discussions in a community of practice. A weekly focus group would help ensure truthful, rich data. Finally, it is recommended that further research be done to add to the baseline results obtained in this study...|$|R

5|$|In July 2009, some of Twitter's {{revenue and}} user growth {{documents}} were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll.

The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54billion in revenue, US$111million in net earnings, and 1billion users. No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.|$|E

5|$|Far Harbor was {{developed}} by Bethesda Game Studios and was announced {{three months after the}} official release of Fallout 4—alongside , , and teasers of other upcoming expansions—in a <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> on February 16, 2016.. The expansion was released on May 19, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Of the first three expansions, Far Harbor added the largest landmass, and was consequently sold at a higher price. It also added new dungeons (self-contained quest locations), quests, creatures, and other miscellaneous features. The expansion was included in the Fallout 4 season pass, a collection of all the expansion packs. Because of the large amount of additional content, the price for the pass was increased from US$30 to $50.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2005, {{a report}} on Anime News Network {{mentioned}} a possible live-action Last Exile film.

On July 8, 2009, a concept art image was leaked on the Internet but was removed at the request of filmmakers. However, as of 2013, there has been no new news about the Live-action film, suggesting it has been canceled.|$|E
5|$|Sega first {{announced}} Sonic Colors in a <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> on May 26, 2010. Demo {{versions of}} the game were playable at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010, Gamescom, the Penny Arcade Expo, and the Tokyo Game Show. On November 4, 2010, Sega held a Sonic Colors-themed ice-skating event at Bryant Park in New York City. BradyGames also published an official strategy guide, which launched alongside the game. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted multiple Sonic titles with sub-average Metacritic scores to increase {{the value of the}} brand. Sonic Colors was first released in PAL regions on November 11, 2010, followed by a North American release on November 16, 2010 and in Japan on November 18, 2010. People who pre-ordered the Japanese version of the game received a special card compatible with the arcade game Rekishi Taisen Gettenka, allowing Sonic to appear in the game. Those who who pre-ordered the game through GameStop in North America received a Sonic shaped hat. A special edition was also sold in Europe, featuring figurines of Sonic and the Wisps.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{preliminary}} altmetric study of scientific bloggers and how they use different social media (i. e. blogs, social bookmarking systems, and Twitter) for scholarly communication, information dissemination, and creation of visibility. We analyzed linking behavior in <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> and tweets, number of comments assigned to <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> and share of publications found in social bookmarking systems. Results show that heavy tweeting and blogging do not result in large numbers of followers and comments, tweets and <b>blog</b> <b>posts</b> contain lots of URLs and self-citations, and share of publications found in social bookmarking systems varies between different platforms...|$|R
5|$|The {{series has}} gained a strong {{popularity}} in not only Japan but also throughout the world. For instance, coverage of the anime appeared {{on the front page}} of the Hong Kong free newspaper am730 on May 27, 2013, concerning its popularity within Hong Kong as well as in China and Taiwan. However, the series also attracted criticism: the South Korean Electronic Times magazine accused Attack on Titan of having a militaristic message that serves Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's political leanings; while the series also resonated with Hong Kong youths who saw the invading Titans as a metaphor for mainland China. Hong Kong media commentator Wong Yeung-tat praised Isayama's style and the versatility of Attack on Titans setting, which opens itself to readers' various interpretations. In 2013, after media linked to a 2010 <b>blog</b> <b>post</b> by Isayama indicating that the design of the character Dot Pixis was based on the Imperial Japanese General Akiyama Yoshifuru, an Internet flame war about the general's war record (e.g. allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur) ensued on his blog and included death threats to the author. Because many of the threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors, it is believed that they were written by people outside of Japan.|$|E
