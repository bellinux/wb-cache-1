The scatterometer sensor is conceived as one of several sensors for the Navy Remote Ocean Sensing System (NROSS) Satellite Program. Deliverables requested were to include a final report with appropriate sketches and block diagrams showing the scatterometer design/configuration and a budgetary cost for all labor and materials to design, fabricate, test, and integrate this hardware into a NOAA-D satellite bus. This configuration consists of two (2) hardware assembles - a transmitter/receiver (T/R) assembly and an integrated electronics assembly (IEA). The T/R assembly as conceived is best located at the extreme {{opposite end of the}} satellite away from the solar array assembly and oriented in position to enable one surface of the assembly to have unobstructed exposure to space.

50|$|The {{principle}} can {{be shown}} by an early special purpose seismometer.

While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local earthquake - such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further re-analysis was performed in the 1980s using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.|$|R
40|$|Plumes {{of dense}} shelf water cascade down {{continental}} slopes {{in many parts}} of the world's oceans and provide a mechanism for shelf-ocean exchange. In this paper a nonlinear process-orientated theory is developed and used to examine the dynamics of cascading. The theory is formulated in terms of a " 11 / 2 -layer" model and incorporates <b>bottom</b> topography, <b>earth</b> rotation, internal and bottom friction, and entrainment as well as externally imposed pressure gradients. The theory occupies a niche between the stream tube class of model (which considers only bulk properties of a plume) and the full three-dimensional primitive equation approach. The model provides useful insights into the complex interplay between the controlling forces, and it allows one to recover the shape and trajectory of dense plumes as well as the three-dimensional flow field inside the bottom layer. Asymptotic limits are investigated and lead to several basic results. A typical thickness of a fully developed plume is found to be twice the bottom Ekman layer scale, corresponding to reported observations. The relative importance of downslope density-driven cascading and downslope drainage forced by interior currents is assessed. It is found that vertical mixing always assists downslope plume propagation, while an interior current may assist or inhibit cascading. The model is applied to some recent observations at the Hebridean shelf edge west of the British Isles and is used to infer the characteristics of an observed cascade. The model could also be applied to double frontal currents such as the Mediterranean outflow...|$|R
60|$|So we {{went along}} by the hurrying brook, which fell over little cascades in its haste, never looking once at the primroses that were glimmering all along its banks.

As I talked to Emily I became dimly aware of a whiteness over the ground. She exclaimed with surprise, and I found that I was walking, in the first shades of twilight, over clumps of snowdrops. The hazels were thin, and only here and there an oak tree uprose. All the ground was white with snowdrops, like drops of manna scattered over the red earth, on the grey-green clusters of leaves. There was a deep little dell, sharp sloping like a cup, and white sprinkling of flowers all the way down, with white flowers showing pale among the first inpouring of shadow at the <b>bottom.</b> The <b>earth</b> was red and warm, pricked with the dark, succulent green of bluebell sheaths, and embroidered with grey-green clusters of spears, and many white flowerets.

Other flower companies are glad; stately barbaric hordes of bluebells, merry-headed cowslip groups, even light, tossing wood-anemones; but snowdrops are sad and mysterious. We have lost their meaning. They do not belong to us, who ravish them. The girls bent among them, touching them with their fingers, and symbolising the yearning which I felt. Folded in the twilight, these conquered flowerets are sad like forlorn little friends of dryads.|$|R

They followed, tugging at the hand-sleigh, while nearer and nearer came the roaring march of the ice. At last the fields round them cracked and starred in every direction, and the cracks opened and snapped like the teeth of wolves. But where the Thing rested, on a mound of old and scattered ice-blocks some fifty feet high, there was no motion. Kotuko leaped forward wildly, dragging the girl after him, and crawled {{to the bottom of}} the mound. The talking of the ice grew louder and louder round them, but the mound stayed fast, and, as the girl looked at him, he threw his right elbow upward and outward, making the Inuit sign for land in the shape of an island.

The smashing and rebound of the floes as they grounded and splintered marked the borders of it, and a friendly shoal ran out to the northward, and turned aside the rush of the heaviest ice, exactly as a ploughshare turns over loam. There was danger, of course, that some heavily squeezed ice-field might shoot up the beach, and plane off the top of the islet bodily; but that did not trouble Kotuko and the girl when they made their snow-house and began to eat, and heard the ice hammer and skid along the beach. The Thing had disappeared, and Kotuko was talking excitedly about his power over spirits as he crouched round the lamp. In the middle of his wild sayings the girl began to laugh, and rock herself backward and forward.|$|R

40|$|A {{common type}} of water storage {{structures}} is the embankment reservoir and levees. But, during the 19 th century, numerous embankment dams failed in Europe and North-America (Table 1 - 1, Fig. 1 - 1). The two most common causes of failures were dam overtopping and cracking in the earthfill. The former was often caused by inadequate spillway facility. The latter resulted {{from a combination of}} bad understanding of basic soil mechanics, poor construction standards, and piping at the connection between <b>bottom</b> outlet and <b>earth</b> material. In recent years, the design floods of a number of dams were re-evaluated and the revised flows were often larger than those used for the original designs. In many cases, the occurrence of the revised design floods would result in dam overtopping because of the insufficient storage and spillway capacity of the existing reservoir. In recent years, a number of overtopping protection systems were developed for embankments and earthfill dams. These include concrete overtopping protection systems, timber cribs, sheet-piles, riprap and gabions, reinforced earth, Minimum Energy Loss weirs, embankment overflow stepped spillways and the precast concrete block protection systems developed by the Russian engineers. After a brief discussion of the embankment overtopping breach process, several overflow protection systems are presented and detailed in the next paragraphs...|$|R
40|$|Seismological {{observations}} reveal highly anisotropic patches at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>Earth's</b> lower mantle, {{whereas the}} bulk of the mantle has been observed to be largely isotropic(1 - 4). These patches have been interpreted to correspond to areas where subduction has taken place in the past or to areas where mantle plumes are upwelling, but the underlying cause for the anisotropy is unknown-both shape-preferred orientation of elastically heterogenous materials(5) and lattice-preferred orientation of a homogeneous material(6 - 8) have been proposed. Both of these mechanisms imply that large-strain deformation occurs within the anisotropic regions, but the geodynamic implications of the mechanisms differ. Shape-preferred orientation would imply the presence of large elastic (and hence chemical) heterogeneity whereas lattice-preferred orientation requires deformation at high stresses. Here we show, on the basis of numerical modelling incorporating mineral physics of elasticity and development of lattice-preferred orientation, that slab deformation in the deep lower mantle can account for the presence of strong anisotropy in the circum-Pacific region. In this model-where development of the mineral fabric (the alignment of mineral grains) is caused solely by solid-state deformation of chemically homogeneous mantle material-anisotropy is caused by large-strain deformation at high stresses, due to the collision of subducted slabs with the core-mantle boundary...|$|R

All depth estimates {{must be carefully}} performed and assessed using tectonic framework, geological and shallow as well as deep geophysical evidence, and heat flow modeling, especially in the cases where high values of heat flow are inferred based on magnetic bottoms lying within the upper and middle crust (Ravat et al. [2007]). Abraham et al. ([2014]) took these precautions and suggestions into consideration, and efforts were thoroughly made to examine and compare results with independent data. They also added that their depth to the <b>bottom</b> of magnetic <b>earth's</b> crust was assumed CPD, placing our results within acceptable norms in magnetic depth study (e.g., Trifonova et al. [2009]). In many cases, the approximation of the bottom depth of magnetic earth's crust, generally accepted to concur with the CPD, causes ambiguity, because it is unclear which particular value should be accepted as Curie point. Because of this uncertainty, Trifonova et al. ([2009]) compared the calculated magnetic bottom's depth to the results from geothermal modeling in depth and some paleomagnetic investigations. It would also be better to seek an external confirmation through other related geophysical results such as the various relevant parameters {{that contribute to the}} surface heat flow and seismic determinations of thickness and interpretations of tectonic setting (Ravat et al.

The phase change from an orthorhombic Mg-perovskite to a CaIrO 3 -type bearing assemblage in a pyrolitic mantle composition was also observed at P= 125 GPa, which corresponds to the same mantle depth as the seismic discontinuity. The phase boundary between the orthorhombic Mg-perovskite and CaIrO 3 -type bearing assemblage was determined to be P (GPa) = 124 (F 4) + 0. 008 (F 0. 005) (T 2500) (K) using gold as a pressure calibrant. This transition boundary indicates that the temperature at a depth of 2700 km is about 2600 K, and the adiabatic temperature gradient in the lower mantle is estimated to be 0. 31 K/km. The partition coefficients and the effect of some elements on the phase equilibrium between the orthorhombic MgSiO 3 perovskite and CaIrO 3 -type MgSiO 3 were estimated from ab initio calculations. Our experimental and theoretical results indicate that the DW layer consists of a CaIrO 3 -type bearing assemblage which is likely to have significant effect on the chemical and thermal evolution of the Earth’s mantle...|$|R
