40|$|In many accelerators, {{cylindrical}} pick-ups {{are used}} to measure transverse <b>beam</b> <b>positions.</b> Theoretically, signals from these pick-ups are related to infinite power series of the <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> but, in practice, only finite number of terms are considered and the position measurements degrade when a beam {{is far from the}} center of a pick-up.

We first describe {{the calculation of}} the BPM pickup signals as nonlinear functions of <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> using Greens reciprocity theorem with a two-dimensional formalism. We then describe the incorporation of these calculations into our <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> measurements by inverting the nonlinear functions, giving us <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> {{as a function of}} the pickup signals, and how this is also used to improve our calculation of the betatron phase advance.

40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS) {{storage ring}} rf <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> {{monitors}} (BPMs) are {{impacted by the}} presence of beam-excited transverse electric (TE) modes. These modes are excited in large-aperture vacuum chambers and become trapped between the bellow end flanges. The TE modes are vertically oriented and are superimposed on the TEM <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> signals, corrupting the BPM measurements. Erroneous step changes in <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> measurements and systematic intensity dependence in the vertical plane have been traced to these modes, placing a fundamental limitation on vertical <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> stabilization. Experiments were conducted suppressing these modes on a test vacuum chamber. These experiments were simulated with Mafia [1] and Microwave Studio [2], confirming experimental results.

40|$|Many modern light {{sources are}} {{operating}} in top-off injection mode or are being upgraded to top-off injection mode. The storage ring always has the stored beam and injected beam for top-off injection mode. So the BPM data is {{the mixture of}} both <b>beam</b> <b>positions</b> and the injected <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> cannot be measured directly. We propose to use dedicated wide band BPM electronics in the NSLS II storage ring to retrieve the injected beam trajectory with the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> monitor (BPM) has the capability to measure bunch-by-bunch <b>beam</b> <b>position.</b> Similar electronics {{can be used to}} measure the bunch-by-bunch beam current which is necessary to get the injection <b>beam</b> <b>position.</b> The measurement precision of current needs to be evaluated since button BPM sum signal has position dependence. The injected beam trajectory can be measured and monitored all the time without dumping the stored beam. We can adjust and optimize the injected beam trajectory to maximize the injection efficiency. We can also measure the storage ring acceptance by mapping the injected beam trajectory...|$|R

40|$|<b>Beam</b> <b>position</b> {{monitors}} (BPM) for synchrotron light storage rings usually {{consist of}} beam pickup electrodes, coaxial relays and a narrowband receiver. While accurate, these systems are slow and of limited {{use in the}} commissioning of an accelerator. A <b>beam</b> <b>position</b> monitor is described which {{is intended to be}} a principal diagnostic during debug and routine run-ning of a storage ring.
