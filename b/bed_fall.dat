[...] Walter tries {{to go to sleep}} but hears his friend Delbert in the {{apartment}} above jumping on his bed. Walter decides to have just one more jump himself, but instead keeps jumping higher and higher until the floor starts to crack. He and his <b>bed</b> <b>fall</b> into Miss Hattie’s apartment where he lands in her plate of spaghetti and meatballs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bed</b> <b>fall</b> of {{the river}} is gentle for the first 72 km. After that point the river bed falls rapidly with a clear over fall of 183 km at Magod and is popularly known as The Magod Falls. Afterwards river runs in deep gorges with a steep bed falls. The Souda (the {{tributary}} of Bedhi River) joins the river after the falls. The Ganagavalli village is 11 km away from the Ankola town and 4 km from Belambar {{one of the other}} new resort areas of the Uttar Kannada district. Gokarna town is 4 km away in the other direction on Gangavalli road. The river flows through Dharwad and Uttar Kannada districts. The river has dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests along its path.|$|E
50|$|No Jumping on the Bed! is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Tedd Arnold. Published in 1987, it marked the first of the many children's books that Arnold was to both write and illustrate. No Jumping on the Bed! won the 1988 International Reading Association/Children's Book Council Children's Choice Award, the Georgia Children's Picture Storybook Award in 1990, and the Volunteer State Book Award in 1992. The book is aimed at 4-7 year olds and written in humorous rhyming prose, similar in style to that of Dr. Seuss whom Arnold acknowledges as a major influence on his work. It tells the story of Walter, a little boy whose father has told not to jump up and down on his bed. Walter dreams that he has ignored his father's warning with disastrous results. He and his <b>bed</b> <b>fall</b> through all seven floors of his apartment building, taking with them all the neighbors in the floors below.|$|E

60|$|The moonbeams {{came through}} two deep and narrow windows and showed a spacious chamber richly {{furnished}} in an antique fashion. From one lattice {{the shadow of}} the diamond panes was thrown upon the floor; the ghostly light through the other slept upon a <b>bed,</b> <b>falling</b> between the heavy silken curtains and illuminating the face of a young man. But how quietly the slumberer lay! how pale his features! And how like a shroud the sheet was wound about his frame! Yes, it was a corpse in its burial-clothes.|$|R

5000|$|Nicolas Baudin Island {{was formed}} between 6000 and 7700 years ago {{following}} {{the rise of}} sea levels {{at the start of}} the Holocene. [...] The island’s geology consists of a basement of a granite associated with the Gawler Craton and which is bare of any remnants of overlying layers of rock. [...] The island’s north side drops into water of at least a depth of 15 m while its west side drops to depth of 20 m. The sea <b>bed</b> <b>falls</b> to a depth of 50 m about 2.2 km to the west of the island.|$|R
50|$|From {{its source}} {{down to its}} {{junction}} with the Yamuna, the Chambal has a fall of about 732 m. Of this, around 305 m is within the first 16 km reach from its source. It falls for another 195 m in the next 338 km, where it enters the gorge past the Chaurasigarh Fort. During the next 97 km of its run from the Chaurasigarh Fort to Kota city, the <b>bed</b> <b>falls</b> by another 91 m. For {{the rest of its}} 523 km run, the river passes through the flat terrain of the Malwa Plateau and later the Gangetic Plain with an average gradient of 0.21 m/km.|$|R

50|$|The barred sand bass diet {{includes}} crabs, octopus, squid, {{and small}} fishes. The adults aggregate and spawn during warmer months. The eggs are free floating. The striped young appear in southern California nearshore areas and eelgrass <b>beds</b> during <b>fall</b> and winter.|$|R
50|$|An infant bed is {{typically}} used {{after it is}} no longer safe to leave the baby in a bassinet. They have a lower center of gravity, more mass, a broader base of support and can hold a larger baby than a bassinet. Infant beds are more stable than bassinets and as such become desirable when a baby can roll, transferring inertia with their actions; a bassinet may tip, an infant bed won't without concerted effort. Around two or three years of age children are able to defeat their confinement and should be moved to a toddler bed to prevent an injurious fall while escaping their <b>bed</b> (<b>falls</b> account for 66% of emergency room admissions due to infant beds in the United States.).|$|R
25|$|The Kuntipuzha River drains {{the entire}} 15km {{length of the}} park {{from north to south}} into the Bharathapuzha River. Kuntipuzha River divides the park into a narrow eastern sector of width 2 {{kilometers}} and a wide western sector of 5 kilometers. The river is characterized by its crystal clear water and perennial nature. The main tributaries of the river, Kunthancholapuzha, Karingathodu, Madrimaranthodu, Valiaparathodu and Kummaathanthodu originate on the upper slopes of {{the eastern side of the}} valley. The river is uniformly shallow, with no flood plains or meanders. Its <b>bed</b> <b>falls</b> from 1,861 m to 900 m over a distance of 12km, the last 8km being particularly level with a fall of only 60 m. Kuntipuzha is one of the less torrential rivers of the Western Ghats, with a pesticide-free catchment area.|$|R
60|$|About {{your place}} I shall {{try to find}} my way above, an {{interesting}} exploration. Imagine me, as I go to <b>bed,</b> <b>falling</b> over a blood-stained remorse; opening that cupboard in the cerebellum and being welcomed by the spirit of your murdered uncle. I should probably not like your remorses; I wonder if you will like mine; I have a spirited assortment; they whistle in my ear o' nights like a north-easter. I trust yours don't dine with the family; mine are better mannered; you will hear nought of them till 2 A.M., except one, to be sure, that I have made a pet of, but he is small; I keep him in buttons, {{so as to avoid}} commentaries; you will like him much--if you like what is genuine.|$|R

30|$|We devised 26 non-fall and 15 fall {{scenarios}}, {{where some}} fall scenarios have several variants (e.g., fall backward or forward). The test subjects were not instructed {{on how to}} perform the falls exactly and were told to just fall as they think they would in a real-life situation. Scenarios included most of the common ways a person can fall: tripping or stumbling, slipping, fainting (no hands), collapse (drop attack), arising from a <b>bed</b> and <b>falling,</b> arising from a chair and falling (including grabbing a table or chair to try and prevent the <b>fall),</b> missing the <b>bed</b> and <b>falling</b> on the ground, {{sitting on the edge}} of a chair and falling down, hitting a closet and falling, rolling out of bed, walking and losing balance, dizziness, and falling when picking up something. Due to safety reasons, we did not record more dangerous scenarios, such as falling down the stairs.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{analyses}} the bifurcations of limit cycles in {{open and}} loop reverse flow reactors. The {{open loop system}} consists of a reactor where the flow direction is periodically forced whereas in the closed loop system, the flow inversion is dictated by a control law which activates when the temperature {{at the edge of}} catalytic <b>bed</b> <b>falls</b> below the set-point value. We performed the bifurcation analysis of the open loop system as the switch time is varied and we constructed the solution diagram through the application of continuation technique. Many Naimark-Sacker bifurcations leading to quasi-periodic regimes have been found on the limit cycles branches. Finally, we compared these limit cycles with those of the closed loop system where the flow inversion is dictated by a control system which acts if the temperature measured at the edge of reactor falls below a set-point value. 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
50|$|Things {{start to}} get wrong for Belikov when {{somebody}} draws a caricature of him in galoshes, with Varenka on his arm. By this he is horrified and totally thrown off his balance. Then one day he spots Varenka and her brother, cycling. Disgusted and frightened with how low teachers can fall in giving bad examples to pupils, he goes to visit Kovalenko to warn him of dire consequences of such behaviour. The later tells him off, calling him 'a sneak', and, after Belikov threatens to report on him to the school authorities, promptly sends him rolling down the stairs. Belikov lands safely at the bottom, but, by chance, Varenka is there and, finding the picture terribly funny, she bursts with wild laughter. Belikov returns home, removes the portrait of his beloved from the table, goes to <b>bed,</b> <b>falls</b> ill and in a month's time, dies.|$|R

50|$|Westcombe {{finds in}} the opening title {{sequence}} of a fedora being blown off its <b>bed</b> of <b>fallen</b> leaves in the forest, a subtle homage to Jean-Pierre Melville's 1962 French crime film, Le Doulos, which ends with the gangster protagonist’s final fate underlined wistfully by the shot of his fedora coming to rest, alone in the frame, in the dirt of the forest floor.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a desperate}} need for {{effective}} {{mental health services}} for prisoners and ex-prisoners einstitutionalisation in Australia has seen the number {{of public and private}} psychiatric hospital <b>beds</b> <b>fall</b> from 30 000 in the early 1960 s to 8000 today. The population of Australia doubled during this time. There is no doubt that many people with serious mental illness are not being managed well in the community. 1 Some mental health researchers, 2 - 4 as well as the popular press, argue {{that there has been a}} recent related transmigration of people from psychiatric beds to remand centres (which house prisoners who have been charged with an offence but not yet convicted) and prisons. Australian remand centres often contain more seriously mentally ill people than general hospital mental health inpatient units. However, it is unclear whether the apparent rise in prevalence of mental illness among prisoners reflects a genuine increase or an improvement in detectio...|$|R

When Neil does not try to take {{advantage}} of the situation, she reveals her joke and they proceed with dinner. At her urging, they go to a Media Giant store - his corporate competitor - and hide in a closet until after the employees lock up for the night, then they switch a bunch of DVDs into the wrong cases and knock over some displays while fleeing. The next day, they spy on the Media Giant and see an employee talking to a police officer. Later, police detectives drop by Gumshoe Video to question Neil about the Media Giant break-in. Once they have completely scared him, Violet appears and she and the [...] "cops" [...] begin laughing hysterically at the ruse. A flummoxed Neil secretly trails Violet back to her house, where they end up in <b>bed,</b> <b>falling</b> in love. The following morning, they go for a romantic swim.|$|R

60|$|No more {{tender and}} devoted nurses {{could be found}} than the rough women, who hushed their voices, and stole with quiet feet around the little <b>beds,</b> letting <b>fall</b> many a silent tear when the {{sufferer}} asked for little things, for tea or lemonade, which there were no means to purchase, or when the doctor {{shook his head and}} said that good food and not medicine was needed.|$|R

50|$|Cross bedding forms during {{deposition}} on the inclined {{surfaces of}} bedforms such as ripples and dunes, and {{indicates that the}} depositional environment contained a flowing medium (typically water or wind). Examples of these bedforms are ripples, dunes, anti-dunes, sand waves, hummocks, bars, and delta slopes. Cross-bedding is widespread in many environments. Environments in which water movement is fast enough and deep enough to develop large-scale <b>bed</b> forms <b>fall</b> into three natural groupings: rivers, tide-dominated coastal and marine settings.|$|R

50|$|To {{access the}} upper falls, one must {{scramble}} {{up the right}} side of Tip Toe Falls. (The left side is more wet and mossy, and is thus more dangerous to climb.) After walking upstream along the <b>bed</b> of <b>Fall</b> Creek, the upper falls is found on the left of the canyon, obscured by several fallen trees. If trying to get there, one must be careful as mosquitos are commonly found there, especially around the month of April.|$|R
