For sound welds with full penetration, the proper welding conditions were chosen and the cross-sectional bead shape, tensile strength, hardness profile and micro-structure were evaluated for each case.

A side-viewing probe is particularly advantageous in the small diameter, confined geometries of arteries.

A rigorous testing scheme was developed which included a test matrix and a set of criteria that were used in the optimization process. Two probes for diffuse reflectance and one for fluorescence measurements were built based on the result from the testing scheme.

S 121 -S 126 Objectives: The aim of {{this work}} is to report some cases of {{surgical}} removal of hyperkeratotic lesions of the oral cavity with the CO 2 laser. Background: Hyperkeratosis is an abnormal thickening of the stratum corneum caused by increased deposition of keratin, and its histopathologic features show wide variations. These changes are significant because they determine different biologic behavior. Several techniques are used to treat these lesions, including scalpel incision, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, photodynamic therapy, and some drugs. The use of surgical lasers has been proposed as an effective way of treating such lesions safely. The CO 2 laser is the most used laser on the oral cavity because of its affinity for water and high absorption by the oral mucosa. Several benefits {{of the use of}} the CO 2 laser are reported in the literature in regard to surgical procedures carried out on the oral cavity. Patients and Methods: All patients had histopathologic diagnosis of hyperkeratosis and mild epithelial dysplasia and were routinely prepared for surgery under local anesthesia. The surgical procedures were carried out <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser (Sharplan 20 C; Laser Industries, Tel Aviv, Israel, λ 10, 600 [*]nm, 2 [*]mm, CW/RSP).

At the end of the surgery, the beam was used in a defocused manner to promote better hemostasis. Neither sutures nor dressings were used after the surgery. No medication but mouthwashes was prescribed to all patients in the postoperative period.

40|$|Regenerated fiber Bragg grating (RFBG) is a temperature-resistant grating {{fabricated}} from {{a standard}} fiber Bragg grating using high temperature annealing treatment. It {{is well known}} for its economic production and high temperature sustainability in which the operating temperature of the developed RFBG can be as high as the maximum annealing temperature. It is believed that stress relaxation is one of the contributing factors to the thermal regeneration process. Exploiting the benefits of CO 2 laser in terms of dynamic temperature control and focused heating zone, thermal regeneration of RFBG based on CO 2 laser annealing has been successfully demonstrated for the first time. The ensuing cooling process after the post-fabrication annealing treatment is the controlling parameter for the modification of thermal stress in the fiber. After an isothermal annealing treatment followed by a slow cooling process, the Bragg wavelength of the RFBG was red-shifted. This modification is reversible by repeating the annealing treatment followed by a rapid cooling process. It is repeatable with different cooling processes in the subsequent annealing treatments. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} thermal stress modification in the fiber core by means of manipulation of glass transition temperature with different cooling rates. This finding is important for accurate temperature measurement of RFBG in dynamic environment. Furthermore, the thermal stress relaxation study was extended to birefringence modification in regenerated grating in polarisation maintaining fiber (RGPMF) <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser annealing technique. After conducting a post-fabrication isothermal annealing procedure followed by a slow cooling process, the birefringence of the RGPMF has been increased.

The birefringence modification is reversible by re-annealing with a subsequent rapid cooling process. This finding is useful for the study of the birefringence modification, operation range, sensitivity, and accuracy of PMF or PMF-related fiber components.

40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{catalytic conversion}} of syngas (H 2 + CO) into {{a blend of}} methanol and higher alcohols, an attractive way of producing fuels and chemicals. This route {{has the potential to}} reduce the oil dependence in the transport sector and, with the use of biomass for the syngas generation, produce CO 2 -neutral fuels. Alkali promoted MoS 2 -based catalysts show a high selectivity to higher alcohols, {{while at the same time}} being coke resistant, sulfur tolerant and displaying high water-gas shift activity. This makes this type of catalyst especially suitable for being used with syngas derived from biomass or coal which typically has a low H 2 /CO-ratio. This thesis discusses various important aspects of higher alcohol synthesis using MoS 2 -based catalysts and is a summary of four scientific papers. The first part of the thesis gives an introduction to how syngas can be produced and converted into different fuels and chemicals. It is followed by an overview of higher alcohol synthesis and a description of MoS 2 -based catalysts. The topic alcohol for use in internal combustion engines ends the first part of the thesis. In the second part, the experimental part, the preparation of the MoS 2 -based catalysts and the characterization of them are handled. After describing the high-pressure alcohol reactor setup, the development of an on-line gas chromatographic system for higher alcohol synthesis with MoS 2 catalysts is covered (Paper I). This method makes activity and selectivity studies of higher alcohol synthesis catalysts more accurate and detailed but also faster and easier. Virtually all products are very well separated and the established carbon material balance over the reactor closed well under all tested conditions. The method of trace level sulfur analysis is additionally described. Then the effect of operating conditions, space velocity and temperature on product distribution is highlighted (Paper II). It is shown that product selectivity is closely correlated with the CO conversion level and why it is difficult to combine both a high single pass conversion and high alcohol selectivity over this catalyst type. Correlations between formed products and formation pathways are additionally described and discussed. The CO 2 pressure in the reactor increases as the CO conversion increases, however, CO 2 influence on formation rates and product distribution is to a great extent unclear. <b>By</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 -containing syngas feed the effect of CO 2 was studied (Paper III). An often emphasized asset of MoS 2 -based catalysts is their sulfur tolerance. However, the use of sulfur-containing feed and/or catalyst potentially can lead to incorporation of unwanted organic sulfur compounds in the product. The last topic in this thesis covers the sulfur compounds produced and how their quantity is changed when the feed syngas contains H 2 S (Paper IV). The effect on catalyst activity and selectivity in the presence of H 2 S in the feed is also covered. QC 20150115 </p...|$|E

Samples irradiated in air showed remarkable Mw and Mn reduction and Tg value reduction due to radiation-induced chain scission reactions. Higher stability was observed for samples irradiated and stored under vacuum. EPR spectra showed that the presence of PEG units in multiblock copolymer chains leads to: (a) decrease of the radiolytic yield of radicals and (b) decrease of the radical trapping efficiency and faster radical decay rates. It can be concluded that the presence of oxygen during the irradiation process and the storage phase significantly increases the entity of irradiation-induced damage...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} attention {{in the past few decades}} due to their unique, size-dependent properties. In order to use these nanoparticles in devices or sensors effectively, it is important to maintain uniform properties throughout the system; therefore nanoparticles need to have uniform sizes - or monodisperse. In order to achieve monodispersity, an extreme control over the reaction conditions is required during their synthesis. These reaction conditions such as temperature, concentration of reagents, residence times, etc. affect the structure of nanoparticles dramatically; therefore when the conditions vary locally in the reaction vessel, different sized nanoparticles form, causing polydispersity. In widely-used batch wise synthesis techniques, large sized reaction vessels are used to mix and heat reagents. In these types of systems, it is very hard to avoid thermal gradients and to achieve rapid mixing times as well as to control residence times. Also it is not possible to make rapid changes in the reaction parameters during the synthesis. The other drawback of conventional methods is that it is not possible to separate the nucleation of nanoparticles from their growth; this leads to combined nucleation and growth and subsequently results in polydisperse size distributions. Microfluidics is an alternative method by which the limitations of conventional techniques can be addressed. Due to the small size, it is possible to control temperature and concentration of reagents precisely as well as to make rapid changes in mixing ratios of reagents or temperature of the reaction zones. There have been several microfluidic reactors - (microreactors) in literature that were designed to improve the size distribution of nanoparticles. In this work, two novel microfluidic systems were developed for achieving controlled synthesis of nanoparticles. The first microreactor was made out of a chemically robust polymer, polyurethane, and it was used for low temperature nanoparticle synthesis. This microreactor was fabricated <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>CO</b> 2 -laser printer, which is an inexpensive method for fabricating microfluidic devices and it is a relatively fast way compared to other fabrication techniques. Iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis was demonstrated using this reactor and size distributions with a standard deviation of 10 % was obtained. The second microreactor presented in this work was designed to produce monodisperse nanoparticles by utilizing thermally isolated heated and cooled regions for separating nucleation and growth processes. This microreactor was made out of silicon and it was used to demonstrate the synthesis of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Size distributions with less than 10 % standard deviation were achieved. This microreactor also provides a platform for studying the effects of temperature and residence times which is very important to understand the reaction kinetics of nanoparticle synthesis. In this work, two microfluidic techniques for retrieving nanoparticles from the microreactors were also discussed. The first method was based on trapping the aqueous droplet phase inside the microchannel and the second method was utilizing a micropost array to direct droplets from the oil solution to the pure water. As a final step, a printing technique was used to print nanoparticles synthesized inside the microreactors for future applications. This ability is important for achieving smart surfaces that can utilize the properties of nanoparticles for sensing applications in the future...|$|E

40|$|Long-period fiber {{gratings}} (LPFGs) {{are written}} <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of <b>a</b> focused <b>CO</b> 2 laser beam to notch periodically {{on the surface}} of optical fibers. Temperature characteristics of the CO 2 -laser-notched LPFG are investigated in detailed to develop its sensing applications. It is shown that, for such LPFG, temperature sensitivity of resonant wavelength can be increased by creating deeper notches. The coupling from the fundamental core mode to a cladding mode in the LPFG can be enhanced by increasing the ambient temperature. The polarization-dependent loss (PDL) of the LPFG depends strongly on the ambient temperature. Such unique temperature characteristics can be used to solve the cross-sensitivity problem between the temperature and the tensile strain. So, the LPFG is a promising temperature sensor based on the wavelength modulation, on the intensity modulation and/or on the PDL modulation. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Styrenewas grafted onto {{ultrahigh}} molecularweight polyethylene powder (UHMWPE) <b>by</b> gammairradiation <b>using</b> <b>a</b> 60 <b>Co</b> source. Compression moulded {{films of}} selected pre-irradiated styrene-grafted ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE-g-PS) were post-sulfonated to the sulfonic acid derivative (UHMWPE-g-PSSA) {{for use as}} proton exchange membranes (PEMs). The sulfonation was confirmed by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The melting and flow properties of UHMWPE and UHMWPE-g-PS are conducive to forming homogeneous pore-free membranes. Both the ion conductivity and methanol permeability coefficient increased with degree of grafting, but the grafted membranes showed comparable or higher ion conductivity and lower methanol permeability than Nafion 117 membrane. One UHMWPE-g-PS membrane was fabricated into a membrane 2 ̆ 013 electrode assembly (MEA) and tested as a single cell direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). Low membrane cost and acceptable fuel cell performance indicate that UHMWPE-g-PSSA membranes could offer an alternative approach to perfluorosulfonic acidtype membranes for DMFC.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CVR is {{a measure}} of {{cerebral}} hemodynamic impairment. A recently validated technique quantifies CVR <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> precise <b>CO</b> 2 vasodilatory stimulus and BOLD MR imaging. Our aim was to determine whether preoperative CO 2 BOLD CVR predicts the hemodynamic effect of ECIC bypass surgery in patients with intracranial steno-occlusive disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients undergoing ECIC bypass surgery for treatment of intracranial stenosis or occlusion were recruited. CVR was measured preoperatively and postoperatively and expressed as %Delta BOLD MR signal intensity per mm Hg Delta PetCO(2). Using normative data from healthy subjects, we stratified patients on the basis of preoperative CVR into 3 groups: normal CVR, reduced CVR, and negative (paradoxical) CVR. Wilcoxon 2 -sample tests (2 -sided, alpha = 0. 05) were used to determine whether the 3 groups differed with respect to change in CVR following bypass surgery. RESULTS: The group with normal preoperative CVR demonstrated no significant change in CVR following bypass surgery (mean, 0. 22 %+/- 0. 05 % to 0. 22 %+/- 0. 01 %; P=. 881). The group with reduced preoperative CVR demonstrated a significant improvement following bypass surgery (mean, 0. 08 %+/- 0. 05 % to 0. 21 +/- 0. 08 %; P CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative measurement of CVR <b>by</b> <b>using</b> CO 2 BOLD MR imaging predicts the hemodynamic effect of ECIC bypass in patients with intracranial steno-occlusive disease.
