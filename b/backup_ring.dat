50|$|The {{system can}} {{automatically}} optically track targets {{and provide the}} gunner with an alert when the target is within range. The gunner can also manually aim the guns, using either the optical system or an external <b>backup</b> <b>ring</b> sight provided {{on the outside of}} the turret. The system has a reaction time of around 10 seconds when in radar search mode, and six seconds in optical mode. The vehicle also provides a simulator function for training.|$|E
50|$|In November 2013, Rhodes {{announced}} on Twitter {{that she would}} be returning to WWE. She retained the ring name Eden Stiles and resumed her role as a ring announcer, first appearing on NXT. In February 2014, Eden began a video blog, which ran until January 2015 and was published on the WWE website. In October 2014, Eden became the regular ring announcer and backstage interviewer for SmackDown and Main Event. In late-March 2015, Eden made her pay-per-view ring announcing debut at WrestleMania 31, as well as becoming the <b>backup</b> <b>ring</b> announcer for Raw, while Lilian Garcia was recovering from surgery. On May 24, 2016, Rhodes was granted her release from WWE, just days after her husband Cody Rhodes also requested his release.|$|E
5000|$|PBI resin is molded via a {{sintering}} process that was jointly developed by Hoechst Celanese (North Carolina, USA) and Alpha Precision Plastics, Inc. (Houston, Texas, USA). Molded PBI resin {{is an excellent}} candidate for high strength, low weight material. Since it has the highest compressive strength, 58 ksi, of any available, unfilled resin and other mechanical properties such as a tensile strength of 23 ksi, a flexural strength of 32 ksi, a ductile compressive failure mode and the relatively low density of 1.3 g/cm3. [...] Moreover, its thermal and electrical properties also make it a well known thermoplastic resin. The PBI resin comprises a recurring structural unit represented by the following figure.According to the Composite Materials Research Group at the University of Wyoming, PBI resin parts maintain significant tensile properties and compressive strength to 700 F. PBI resin parts are also potential materials for the chemical process and oil recovery industries which have demands of thermal stability and chemical resistance. In these areas, PBI resin has been successfully applied in demanding sealing, for instance, valve seats, stem seals, hydraulic seals and <b>backup</b> <b>rings.</b> In the aerospace industry, PBI resin has high strength and short term high temperature resistance advantages. In the industrial sector, PBI resin's high dimensional stability as well as retention of electrical properties at high temperature make it used as a thermal and electrical insulator.|$|R
50|$|Focus {{indication}} {{also came}} in the form of a green hexagonal in-focus light-emitting diode (LED) flanked by two red arrowhead shaped, out-of-focus, turning direction LED indicators visible at the bottom of the viewfinder. If both red LEDs lit, the ME F could not determine correct focus. In that case, the 35mm-70mm lens had a <b>backup</b> manual focus <b>ring.</b>|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{peer-to-peer}} applications require efficient group communication. However, current {{techniques for}} group communication are not optimal for peer-to-peer networks, {{which do not}} have group communication methods themselves. This paper presents the novel multiring topology, {{which is designed to}} meet requirements of high performance group communication in peer-to-peer networks. It improves data communication by applying several concepts: building overlay networks for each topic, a topology consisting of multiple <b>rings,</b> <b>backup</b> links and dual mode links. Experimental results provide evidence for improving performance and scalability of peer group communication. 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{diaphragm}} compressor is {{a variant of}} the classic reciprocating compressor with <b>backup</b> and piston <b>rings</b> and rod seal. The compression of gas occurs by means of a flexible membrane, instead of an intake element. The back and forth moving membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism. Only the membrane and the compressor box come in touch with pumped gas. For this reason this construction is the best suited for pumping toxic and explosive gases. The membrane has to be reliable enough to take the strain of pumped gas. It must also have adequate chemical properties and sufficient temperature resistance.|$|R
50|$|His wife, Richa (Urmila Matondkar), {{uses her}} phone (which she has kept in her pocket) to dial a random number for help, and she accidentally rings Sandy (Zayed Khan). Richa tells Sandy everything, and he agrees to help her. He goes to find her, and rescue her, {{and as he}} finds he needs <b>backup,</b> he <b>rings</b> his girlfriend Sanjana (Tanushree Dutta). By the time Sandy rescues her son, Bobby, and Richa, Sid has already reached the hotel, {{the place of the}} soon-to-be murder of the Prime Minister. There Kabir is being helped by Rohan (Aashish Chaudhary), a rogue MI5 officer in the {{assassination}} attempt. Richa comes with Sandy to meet Sid. But She is forcibly taken by Rohan to the room from where Sid has to be use a sniper rifle to do the murder. Sandy hides in the bathroom, where he overhears that this plot is the brainchild of Raj, the Prime Minister's son and the Deputy Chief of her party. He is doing this to become the PM while also using the potential sympathy votes of her murder to win the next elections. Sandy gets captured by Kabir's men but escapes and runs to the room where Rohan is holding Richa and Sid.|$|R
5000|$|Officer Walker spots Omar in a {{convenience}} store. Omar realizes Walker is waiting outside {{for him and}} hides his gun in a refrigerator. Walker stops Omar and, as he waits for <b>backup,</b> pockets a <b>ring</b> Omar is wearing—the same ring that Omar took from Marlo Stanfield during his robbery of Marlo's poker game. When Omar talks back, Walker brutally pushes him into the wall and knocks him over. When Omar claims that Walker is being unfair {{as there is no}} charge against him, Walker informs him that he is facing a murder charge. Colicchio and McNulty arrive on the scene, where Colicchio mocks Omar for not having his shotgun with him. McNulty then explains he is being arrested on a robbery/murder warrant. Officer Santangelo arrives with the wagon, and Omar asks McNulty for a phone call before he is taken in. McNulty gives him his own personal cell phone and dials Butchie for him. Butchie reassures Omar that he will pay his bail and offers him support even when Omar tells him there will be no bail because the charge is murder. Santangelo playfully mocks McNulty as being a [...] "Democrat" [...] for aiding Omar.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{performance}} and post flight condition of the STS- 28 redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) nozzles is presented in this document. Applicable discrepancy reports (DR's) and process departures (PD's) are presented in section 5. 0. The nozzle component program team (NCPT) performance evaluation and the redesign program review board (RPRB) assessment is included in section 6. 0. The STS- 28 nozzle assemblies were flown on the RSRM fifth flight (Space Shuttle Columbia). The nozzles were a partially submerged convergent/divergent movable design with an aft pivot point flexible bearing. The nozzle assemblies incorporated the following features: (1) RSRM forward exit cone with snubber assembly; (2) RSRM fixed housing; (3) structural <b>backup</b> outer boot <b>ring</b> (OBR); (4) RSRM cowl ring; (5) RSRM nose inlet assembly; (6) RSRM throat assembly; (7) RSRM forward nose and aft inlet ring; (8) RSRM aft exit cone assembly with linear-shaped charge (LSC); (9) RTV backfill in joints 1, 3, and 4; (10) use of EA 913 NA adhesive in place of EA 913; (11) redesigned nozzle plug; and (12) carbon cloth phenolic (CCP) with 750 ppm sodium content. The RSRM fifth flight test objectives are as follows: (1) verify that flexible bearing seals operate within the specified temperature range; (2) verify that flexible bearing maintained a positive gas seal between its internal components; (3) inspect flexible bearing for damage due to water impact; (4) verify performance of the nozzle liner; (5) verify that nozzle parts are reusable; (6) verify through flight demonstration and a postflight inspection that the flexible bearing is reusable; (7) verify by inspection the remaining nozzle ablative thicknesses; and (8) verify the nozzle performance margins of safety...|$|R
