5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but teething problems ensured that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E
25|$|Barrett had a {{tremendous}} impact on the developing field of social work and on services for women and children. Under her leadership, the NFCM became an established social service organization that provided a wide spectrum of services to women. The mission initiated activities that many now consider essential services for women and children. Florence Crittenton homes pioneered women-oriented policies in the areas of health care, employment for women, and children's rights. The organization campaigned for equality for women and for recognition of women's needs... Despite differences in class and race with most of their clients, FC volunteers tried to emphasize gender identity.... It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> a group of women had the resources to duplicate Crittenton efforts.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E

[...] Despite the adverse publicity, Bottomley was returned by the electors of Hackney South {{at each of the}} two 1910 general elections; his tactics included recruiting men in boots tipped and heeled with iron, who marched outside his opponent's meetings and rendered the speeches inaudible. In June 1910 he founded the John Bull League, with a mission to promote [...] "commonsense business methods" [...] into government; readers of the magazine could join the League for a shilling (5p) a year. Although still nominally a Liberal, Bottomley had become a trenchant critic of his party, and often aligned himself with the Conservative opposition in attacking Asquith's government.|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{said that}} the episode and [...] "Black Light Attack!"

Canning said that despite the Tracy character not having too much screen time here [...] "his bits were funny, and his idea to add a woman to his entourage {{had a lot of}} potential", and noted that Liz/Randy's plot ended [...] "brilliantly" [...] when the story crossed over to Jenna/James Franco's storyline. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave it a positive review writing it was a [...] "good episode", and [...] "ot one of the best but it still had enough funny situations", and thanked NBC for broadcasting two episodes. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons remarked that the two episodes were terrific, and what stood out from both airings [...] "was how much serialized plot these two eps covered... For a show that's usually so episodic, it was an interesting—totally successful—change of pace." ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson joined Jervis's fleet off Cape St Vincent, and {{reported}} the Spanish movements. Jervis {{decided to give}} battle and the two fleets met on 14 February. Nelson found himself towards {{the rear of the}} British line and realised that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> he could bring Captain into action. Instead of continuing to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders and wore ship, breaking from the line and heading to engage the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun San Josef, the 80-gun San Nicolas and the 130-gun Santísima Trinidad. Captain engaged all three, assisted by [...] which had come to Nelson's aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides which left both Captain and Culloden badly damaged, Nelson found himself alongside San Nicolas. He led a boarding party across, crying [...] "Westminster Abbey or glorious victory!" [...] and forced her to surrender. San Josef attempted to come to the San Nicolas’s aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile. Nelson led his party from the deck of San Nicolas onto San Josef and captured her as well. As night fell, the Spanish fleet broke off and sailed for Cadiz. Four ships had surrendered to the British and two of them were Nelson's.|$|E

Integration with the American white Masons was not imminent. Since they were unable to attain integration, the blacks concentrated on recognition from white Masons that black Masonry, descending from Prince Hall of Massachusetts, was legitimate and not [...] "clandestine". That it had received its charter from the English Grand Lodge and was thus entitled to all Masonic rights such as intervisitation between black and white lodges without prejudice.

2500|$|As a Republican congresswoman {{representing}} {{an affluent}} Democratic district {{in an increasingly}} Democratic state, Morella faced a succession of increasingly strong Democratic challengers. [...] While she managed to fend them all off (even in the big Democratic years of 1992, 1996, and 1998), the low popularity of the Republican-controlled Congress gradually undermined her. She tried to portray herself as giving her district {{a place at the}} table, but over time, Morella's Democratic opponents claimed that a vote for Morella was a vote to keep Tom DeLay and other Republicans unpopular to district voters in power. It was virtually taken for granted that Morella would be succeeded by a Democrat if she retired.

[...] Roger Kaplan of Policy Review wrote in 1999 that the novel [...] "in many ways invented a genre in fiction…. The use of a racy intrigue, if {{possible}} involving both sex and foreign policy, is what characterizes the contemporary form. Forty years on, Advise and Consent is the only book of this genre that a literary-minded person really ought to read." [...] Richard L. Neuberger reviewed the novel for The New York Times in 1959, writing that [...] "rarely has a political tale been told with such vivid realism" [...] and calling the book [...] "one of the finest and most gripping political novels of our era." [...] Conversely, Pamela Hansford Johnson of the New Statesman called Advise and Consent [...] "politically repellent and artistically null with a steady hysterical undertone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1728, the Swiss {{traveller}} César de Saussure {{noted in}} his journal {{the frequency with which}} he saw cricket being played while he was making his journeys across southern England. He referred to county matches [...] "as a commonplace". If they were a commonplace, they were also keenly contested to the point where winning teams would proclaim their county's superiority. It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the actual words [...] "county championship" [...] are used but {{there is no doubt that}} the concept of a champion county existed in the 1720s, if not sooner. In August 1728, a game reported as [...] "11 of each county" [...] between Sussex and Kent was won by Kent. The teams were organised by Gage (Sussex) and Stead (Kent). Stead's team had earlier won two games against the Duke of Richmond's XI (also representing Sussex) and their victory over Gage's XI was reported as [...] "the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex".|$|E
2500|$|The {{advent of}} practical, {{widespread}} portable ultrasonography (point-of-care ultrasonography) {{in the late}} 1990s to early 2000s led some physicians to ask how soon it would be before stethoscopes would become obsolete. Others answered that they thought {{the relationship of the}} various tools (stethoscopes and digital devices) would change but that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> stethoscopes were obsolete. A decade later, in 2016, the same two sides of the coin were still recognized. One cardiologist said, [...] "the stethoscope is dead", but a pediatrician said, [...] "We are not at the place, and probably won't be for a very long time", where stethoscopes were obsolete. One consideration is that it depends on the segment of health care (emergency medical services, nursing, medicine) and the specialty. [...] "Stethoscopes retain their value for listening to lungs and bowels for clues of disease, experts agree." [...] But for the cardiovascular system, [...] "auscultation is superfluous", one cardiologist said. Thus, it could be that cardiology in the secondary and tertiary care settings may abandon the stethoscope many years before primary care, pediatrics, and physical therapy do.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of their new-found success and status, the couple formed a production company, [...] "Gloria Films", producing the comedy Three Husbands with Eve Arden and Ruth Warwick, and the film noir the Scarf starring John Ireland and Mercedes McCambridge. [...] Unfortunately, Caspary and Igee forgot {{the first rule of}} finance, [...] "never use your own money", and had put all their own funds and savings into the company. [...] Their films were contracted to United Artists, and when United Artists went into bankruptcy and restructuring in 1950, the films of Gloria Films were tied up in litigation and the couple lost everything. [...] Many small production companies went bankrupt as a result of United Artists' troubles – Caspary could not afford to, as she would have lost future royalties for works she had already written and any payments for reprints of her books. [...] Igee was devastated at the loss, he would never get to be the bread winner of the couple. [...] In December, Caspary drove to MGM and sold them a story treatment for $50,000 dollars, with a 50% advance. [...] In January she sold them another for $45,000 and in February sold one to Paramount for $35,000.

2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speech was}} lauded {{in the days}} after the event, and was widely {{considered}} the high point of the March by contemporary observers. James Reston, writing for The New York Times, said that [...] "Dr. King touched all the themes of the day, only better than anybody else. He was full of the symbolism of Lincoln and Gandhi, and the cadences of the Bible. He was both militant and sad, and he sent the crowd away feeling that the long journey had been worthwhile." [...] Reston also noted that the event [...] "was better covered by television and the press than any event here since President Kennedy's inauguration", and opined that [...] "it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> [...] forgets the melodious and melancholy voice of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. crying out his dreams to the multitude." [...] An article in The Boston Globe by Mary McGrory reported that King's speech [...] "caught the mood" [...] and [...] "moved the crowd" [...] of the day [...] "as no other" [...] speaker in the event. Marquis Childs of The Washington Post wrote that King's speech [...] "rose above mere oratory". [...] An article in the Los Angeles Times commented that the [...] "matchless eloquence" [...] displayed by King—"a supreme orator" [...] of [...] "a type so rare as almost to be forgotten in our age"—put to shame the advocates of segregation by inspiring the [...] "conscience of America" [...] with the justice of the civil-rights cause.|$|E
