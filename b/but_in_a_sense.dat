25|$|Market size can {{be given}} {{in terms of the}} number of buyers and sellers in a {{particular}} market or in terms of the total exchange of money in the market, generally annually (per year). When given in terms of money, market size is often termed market value, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> distinct from market value of individual products. For one and the same goods, there may be different (and generally increasing) market values at the production level, the wholesale level and the retail level. For example, the value of the global illicit drug market for the year 2003 was estimated by the United Nations to be US$13 billion at the production level, $94 billion at the wholesale level (taking seizures into account), and US$322 billion at the retail level (based on retail prices and taking seizures and other losses into account).|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1998, Funder {{described}} delayed gratification as a [...] "mixed bag". He concluded: [...] "Participants who {{exhibited the}} most delay {{were not just}} 'better' at self-control, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> they seemed unable to avoid it. [...] Delayers are in general smart and well-adjusted, but {{they also tend to}} be somewhat overcontrolled and unnecessarily inhibited." ...|$|E
2500|$|Determination. A sign {{depends on}} its object {{in such a way}} as to {{represent}} its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something as a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word [...] "determine" [...] not in a strictly deterministic sense, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of [...] "specializes," [...] bestimmt, involving variable amount, like an influence. Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination. The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object as the sign is related to the object, hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{standard}} {{definition of}} ultrashort pulse.

2500|$|The Union of Utrecht had {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} conscience, {{but this did}} not imply freedom of worship. Except for the Dutch Reformed Church, public worship by other denominations was usually restricted with more or less severity, and membership of the privileged church {{was supposed to be}} a prerequisite for holding public office (though this rule was often honored in the breach, even as far as Catholic office holders in the Generality Lands were concerned). This policy of supremacy of the Public Church was, however, never enforced consistently, either in the different parts of the country, or over time. In general, a policy of de facto toleration predominated, even when legal prohibitions were in force. This went against the grain of the Calvinist diehards, who constantly insisted on official suppression of competing faiths, going back to the Contra-Remonstrant controversy of 1618. Their Remonstrant opponents had come to defend religious toleration after their own suppression, and though Remonstrant regents had been ousted at the time, this political point of view remained in favor with the Holland regents, unlike their colleagues in most other provinces. The debate continued to flare up from time to time. The flap over the Holland public prayers was just one of many instances. What makes it interesting is that such debates were usually not over doctrinal matters, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> about [...] "public order." [...] Also, they tended quickly to widen to debates over unsettled constitutional matters, like the provincial-supremacy claim of the Holland regents.|$|E
