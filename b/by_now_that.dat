The film's producer, David O. Selznick, had briefly romanced Arthur in the late 1920s when they both were with Paramount Pictures. Arthur re-united with {{director}} Frank Capra and Stewart for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), with Arthur cast once again as a working woman, this time one who teaches the naive Mr. Smith the ways of Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|Another general {{problem is}} the chronological {{relation}} of the huge statues to Sardinian bronze figurines (Sardinian: brunzittos / Italian: bronzetti), whose date is also presently highly debated: several scholars in fact maintain, <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> the production of bronzetti began already between 1100 and 1000 BC as the stratigraphy of the Funtana Coberta site shows; the publication of data relating to the excavation of the giants' grave of Orroli, not far from multi–towered nuraghe Arrubiu, corroborate previous studies at Funtana Coberta, confirming heavily that the bronze figurines date back to Bronze Age and not from Early Iron age, as some scholars have believed until now: in an undisturbed archaeological context, in fact, bronze figurines dating from the 13th to the 12th century BC have been discovered.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile in the Capital, the {{situation}} is close to panic. Everyone knows <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Gorbovsky's Tariel II cannot take them all to space and that the nearest to Rainbow spaceship that can won't make it in time. Plans like burrowing a huge underground cave under the Capital {{to hide from the}} Wave, or jumping over it, or diving under it (in the southern ocean) are desperately developed. At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, but everyone agrees that this is the best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets.|$|E

500|$|... "Praise You In This Storm" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics following {{the release of}} Lifesong. Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today said [...] "it's vertical in focus and a typical-sounding power ballad, but it's {{not hard to imagine}} people latching on to its powerful Job-like expression of faith and hope.". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised it as [...] "sonic" [...] and called it a [...] "passionate and emotional worship experience". Brian Mansfield of USA Today felt that the song's lyric [...] "I was sure <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> You would have reached down and wiped our tears away/Stepped in and saved the day/But once again, I say 'Amen,' and it's still raining" [...] would resonate with listeners.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics show Madonna's {{interest}} in her Roman Catholic upbringing, as the song theme is about a girl who admits to her father that she is pregnant and refuses {{to have an abortion}} or give up the baby for adoption despite what her friends are telling her to do. It is constructed in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third and final chorus. At the beginning, she addresses her father directly, asking him to talk to her as an adult, [...] "You should know <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I'm not a baby". The transition to the chorus employs a more dramatic voice with a higher range, ending nearly in cries as she sings the word [...] "Please". Leading to the chorus, Madonna switches to a pleading voice, singing the song's main hook in a high tone. During the bridge, the song features a Spanish-inspired rhythm, one of the earliest examples of the influence that Hispanic music had on Madonna's musical style.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>that,</b> well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime. Based on tonight's sharp-eyed, keen-witted Treehouse of Horror XXII - funnier, faster and more fright-worthy than last year's dud, thankfully - there's a lot of ink left in the old ink pot yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of Living History were mixed, with {{a typical}} {{evaluation}} commending the chapters describing her early life, decrying the overly lengthy later treatments of relatively mundane events as First Lady, and criticizing {{the lack of}} candor in the sections covering controversial episodes, including those surrounding her husband and the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Observers later noted the difference in how Clinton portrayed her upbringing with Carl Bernstein's profile of Clinton's father Hugh Rodham in his 2007 book A Woman in Charge. Bernstein also wrote in A Woman in Charge, [...] "It is an understatement <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> [...] {{has been known to}} apprehend truths about herself and the events of her life that others do not exactly share.
