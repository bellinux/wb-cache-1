5|$|As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the {{information}} on Wennerström, but it proves worthless. Salander hacks into Wennerström's computer and presents Blomkvist with evidence of Wennerström's crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article that ruins Wennerström, who flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerström's <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>and,</b> travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerström is found murdered. Salander reveals to her former guardian Holger Palmgren that she {{is in love with}} Blomkvist. On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him with his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger (Robin Wright). She discards the gift and rides away.|$|E

5|$|Individual {{contributions}} made up {{the most}} of the campaign cash that Tancredo received, making up about 97% of his total pocketbook. PAC contributions were comparably low, producing only around $75,500, of the $1,311,869. He granted himself $200 for the campaign and received no federal funding. $88,457 of his money came from interest from the campaign's <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>and</b> loans from outside sources. It {{should be noted that the}} majority of Tancredo's funds were not disclosed during the campaign As of September 30, 2007 the campaign raised $3,538,244 and spent $3,458,130, leaving only $110,079 cash on hand.|$|E
5|$|Ao {{allegedly}} set up shell companies {{a network}} of secret bank accounts in Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands {{with the help of}} friends and family members to launder bribe money.

The total deposits {{in more than a dozen}} Hong Kong bank accounts under his father's name exceeded HK$157 million as of December 2006. The three family members pleaded not guilty, claiming Ao Man-long opened the bank accounts for them. All family members were sentenced to prison terms by a decision of the Macau Court of Second Instance on 30 October 2008.|$|E

Pacheco claimed that Ramiro Pacheco was the legitimate son of Bueno and requested a DNA test to verify it. The lawyers sent legal notices to Olave, her lawyer Miguel Angel Pierri and Gozalo stating that none of the assets of Bueno's estate could be used or spent until it was decided which one of the parties would inherit them.|$|E

25|$|So {{when the}} {{government}} spends, the treasury debits its operating account at the central bank, and deposits this money into private <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> (<b>and</b> hence into the commercial banking system). This money adds to the total deposits in the commercial bank sector. Taxation works exactly in reverse; private bank accounts are debited, and hence deposits in the commercial banking sector fall.|$|E

25|$|Some spammers {{argue that}} most of these costs could {{potentially}} be alleviated by having spammers reimburse ISPs and persons for their material. There are three problems with this logic: first, the rate of reimbursement they could credibly budget is not nearly high enough to pay the direct costs , second, the human cost (lost mail, lost time, and lost opportunities) is basically unrecoverable, and third, spammers often use stolen <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>and</b> credit cards to finance their operations, and would conceivably do so to pay off any fines imposed.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of access}} to {{financial}} services {{is a serious problem}} {{for the majority of the}} population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds <b>bank</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>and</b> fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. Microfinance, however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to medium-term credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.|$|E
25|$|Islamic extremists in Indonesia {{have been}} {{targeted}} by police as terrorists in the country. Police may either capture or kill dissidents. Cases of police corruption with hidden <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>and</b> retaliation against journalists {{who attempt to}} uncover these cases have occurred such as in June 2012, when Indonesian magazine Tempo had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on August 31, 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into {{a crowd of people}} protesting the death of a local man in police custody. Five people were killed and 34 injured. History of violence goes back to the military-backed Suharto regime (1967–1998), from which Suharto seized power during an anti-Communist purge.|$|E

25|$|A Code of Personal Status {{was adopted}} shortly after {{independence}} in 1956, which, among other things, gave women full legal status (allowing {{them to run}} and own businesses, have <b>bank</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>and</b> seek passports under their own authority). The code outlawed the practices of polygamy and repudiation and a husband's right to unilaterally divorce his wife. Further reforms in 1993 included a provision to allow Tunisian women to transmit citizenship {{even if they are}} married to a foreigner and living abroad. The Law of Personal Status is applied to all Tunisians regardless of their religion. The Code of Personal Status {{remains one of the most}} progressive civil codes in North Africa and the Muslim world.|$|E
25|$|Singapore had {{problems}} with political corruption. Lee introduced legislation giving the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) greater power to conduct arrests, search, call up witnesses, and investigate <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>and</b> income-tax returns of suspected persons and their families. Lee believed that ministers should be well paid {{in order to maintain}} a clean and honest government. On 21 November 1986, Lee received a complaint of corruption against then Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan. Lee was against corruption and he authorized the CPIB to carry out investigations on Teh but Teh committed suicide before any charges could be pressed against him. In 1994, he proposed to link the salaries of ministers, judges, and top civil servants to the salaries of top professionals in the private sector, arguing that this would help recruit and retain talent to serve in the public sector.|$|E
25|$|Since {{their faith}} is not officially {{recognized}} by the state, they {{were not allowed to}} use it on their national identity cards. Without valid identity cards Bahá'ís encounter difficulty registering their children in school, opening <b>bank</b> <b>accounts,</b> <b>and</b> establishing businesses. On 16 December 2006, after only one hearing, the High Court of Egypt ruled against the Bahá'ís, stating that the government would not recognize their religion in official identification cards. The ruling left Bahá'ís unable to obtain ID cards, birth certificates, or death certificates. However, on January 29, 2008 Cairo's court of Administrative Justice, ruling on two related court cases, ruled in favour of the Bahá'ís, allowing them to obtain birth certificates and identification documents, so long as they omit their religion on court documents. The ruling accepted the compromise solution offered by the Bahá'ís, allowing for them to obtain identification papers without the Bahá'í Faith being officially recognized.|$|E
