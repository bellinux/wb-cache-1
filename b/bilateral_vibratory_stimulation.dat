40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} in vitro <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> of human tonsillar mononuclear cells (TMCs). Methods. Fourteen IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT) and 12 CT patients with no renal pathology were enrolled. Group A TMCs were collected after 24 hours of culture and used to determine baseline levels. TMCs in groups B, C, D, E, and F were exposed to <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (60 [*]Hz) for 0 (as the control group), 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Results. Baseline concentrations of B-cell-activation factor (BAFF) and IgA 1, BAFF mRNA expression, and aberrant O-glycosylation IgA 1 level {{were higher in the}} IgAN group as compared to that in the CT group, and all increased after <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Baseline mRNA expressions of core β 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase (C 1 GALT 1) and core β 1, 3 GalT-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) were lower in the IgAN group; the levels decreased further after <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Conclusion.

The current gold standard of treatment is drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in RLS. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> pads, sham pads, and drugs approved by the FDA for use in RLS. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and clinical trial websites to identify the relevant randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled or sham-controlled studies. Fifteen studies including a combined total of 3455 patients with at least moderately severe primary RLS met our search criteria. Efficacy was defined as the standardized mean difference in sleep improvement between treatment and controls. Safety was assessed by comparing the odds ratios of any adverse events and adverse events leading to study withdrawal between treatment and control subjects. Results: Improvement in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep inventory scores from baseline was significantly greater in patients treated with <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> pads than in those receiving sham pads (Hedges&# 39;s g, standardized mean difference − 0. 39, P ≤ 0. 02). There was no difference in improvement in sleep scores between patients treated with <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> pads (− 0. 39) and those receiving an approved RLS drug (− 0. 44, P > 0. 70). The risk of any adverse event or withdrawal because of an adverse event was not significantly different between patients treated with <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> pads and those assigned to sham pads (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 2. 16 [P > 0. 14] and 1. 39 [P > 0. 80], respectively). The odds ratios for patients reporting any adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal were not significantly different between patients treated with <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> pads (2. 16 and 1. 39, respectively) and those who received approved RLS drugs (2. 11 [P > 0. 89] and 2. 07 [P > 0. 82], respectively, mixed-effects model).

40|$|The {{method of}} neuromuscular {{facilitation}} {{in attempt to}} increase the muscular strength in patients with nervous diseases is applied {{in the field of}} rehabilitation. However, the term is not quite suitable since the physiological meaning is obscure. The author used the H-reflex especially that evoked by <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation,</b> to study the mechanism of the neuromuscular facilitation. 1) Painr touch and vibration are used as stimuli. These stimuli, when applied on the posterior surface of the thigh or on the foot sole, increased the amplitude of the H-reflex in some instances depending upon the intensity of the stimuli, but they uniformly decreased its amplitude when applied on the other parts of the lower extremity. This phenomenon may well relate to the withdrawal reflex mechanism. 2) <b>Vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> upon Achilles tendon caused the diminution of the Hreflex, which is assumed to be depended upon the hyperpolarization of alpha motoneurons as well as the inhibition by way of group II, Ib, and other fibers. 3) After ceasing the <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation,</b> the suppressed H-reflex gradually recovered its amplitude to surpass its original amplitude, and then, through the period of variable length, returned to the stable status quo ante. The duration of the post vibratory effect was proportional to the frequency and duration of vibration. 4) The reciprocal inhibition was observed in the antagonist. The vibration applied to the muscles of the upper extremity, either brachial biceps or triceps, gave facilitatory effect on the H-reflex of the soleus. This effect was most marked when the stimulation was applied to the ipsilateral brachial biceps. 5) In case of spastic paresis, the motor disturbance due to spasticity can be improved by reciprocal inhibition of the spastic muscle induced by <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> of its antagonists. However, such stimulation increased the motor disturbances in cases of extrapyramidal and cerebellar diseases. Therefore, the <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> can be utilized for both diagnosis and treatment of motor disturbances...|$|R

We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to study brain activity to <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> and voluntary movements of body parts above and below the lesion. No response to <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the hand was observed in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) hand area, which was conversely recruited during tongue movements that normally evoke responses only in the more lateral face area.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> from powered-toothbrushes as a noninvasive and nonpharmacological method of reducing pain caused after initial archwire placement and to compare it with other common modalities of management. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial included 75 patients of age 13 – 25 years, scheduled for fixed mechanotherapy. Patients were divided into five groups: Control, placebo multivitamin, paracetamol, chewing-gum (Cg), and powered-toothbrush. After placement of 0. 016 ″ Nickel Titanium initial archwire (upper/lower) in each patient, the discomfort perceived at 2 h, 6 h, bedtime, 24 h, 2 days, 3 days, and 7 days were marked individually using Wong-Baker (0 – 5) and numeric (0 – 10) pain rating scales. Kruskal–Wallis test, Friedman test, unpaired t-test were used for statistical analysis. Results: <b>Vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> from powered-toothbrushes effectively reduced pain after initial archwire placement.

Design: Prospective controlled study. Setting: Academic research environment. Patient(s) : Men with spinal cord injury who achieved ejaculation through electroejaculation (n = 12) and penile <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation</b> (n = 10); 30 fertile control men without spinal cord injury. Intervention(s) : Electroejaculation or penile <b>vibratory</b> <b>stimulation,</b> semen analysis according to World Health Organization guidelines, morphology by Kruger's strict criteria.
