60|$|Sam looked {{round in}} the {{direction}} whence the voice proceeded. It came from a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance, who was seated beside the fireplace in the <b>bar,</b> <b>blowing</b> the fire to make the kettle boil for tea.

60|$|There {{had been}} an autumn storm of wind and rain, lasting for three days. Thunderous had been the crash of billows on the rocks, wild the white spray and spume that <b>blew</b> over the <b>bar,</b> troubled and misty and tempest-torn the {{erstwhile}} blue peace of Four Winds Harbor. Now it was over, and the shore lay clean-washed after the storm; not a wind stirred, {{but there was still}} a fine surf on, dashing on sand and rock in a splendid white turmoil--the only restless thing in the great, pervading stillness and peace.|$|R
50|$|The {{scutching}} machine passes the cotton through {{a pair of}} rollers, then strikes it with iron or steel bars called beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars, allowing the seeds to fall through. At the same time air is <b>blown</b> across the <b>bars,</b> which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber. The end result is a continuous sheet of cotton wadding known as a lap, {{ready for the next}} stage of the production process, carding.|$|R
5000|$|The {{opposite}} of what Verrilli told the Supreme Court happened since then in actual criminal prosecutions. Federal prosecutors, apparently unaware of his representations, have refused to make the promised disclosures. In a prosecution in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., against two brothers accused of plotting to bomb targets in New York, the government has said it plans to use information gathered under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, which authorized individual warrants. [...] But prosecutors have refused to say whether the government obtained those individual warrants based on information derived from the 2008 law, which allows programmatic surveillance. Prosecutors in Chicago have taken the same approach in a prosecution of teenager accused of plotting to <b>blow</b> up a <b>bar.</b>|$|R
40|$|Detailed heat {{transfer}} measurements and predictions are given for a power generation turbine rotor with 129 deg of nominal turning and an axial chord of 137 mm. Data {{were obtained for}} a set of four exit Reynolds numbers comprised of the design point of 628, 000, - 20 %, + 20 %, and + 40 %. Three ideal exit pressure ratios were examined including the design point of 1. 378, - 10 %, and + 10 %. Inlet incidence angles of 0 deg and +/- 2 deg were also examined. Measurements were made in a linear cascade with highly three-dimensional blade passage flows that resulted from the high flow turning and thick inlet boundary layers. Inlet turbulence was generated with a <b>blown</b> square <b>bar</b> grid. The purpose of the work is the extension of three-dimensional predictive modeling capability for airfoil external {{heat transfer}} to engine specific conditions including blade shape, Reynolds numbers, and Mach numbers. Data were obtained by a steady-state technique using a thin-foil heater wrapped around a low thermal conductivity blade. Surface temperatures were measured using calibrated liquid crystals. The results show the effects of strong secondary vortical flows, laminar-to-turbulent transition, and also show good detail in the stagnation region...|$|R
25|$|Scutching {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is <b>blown</b> across the <b>bars,</b> which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|R
40|$|The {{role of an}} {{anti-intrusion}} bar for automotive use is {{to absorb}} the kinetic energy of the colliding bodies that is partially converted into internal work of the bodies involved in the crash. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performances of a new kind of anti-intrusion bars for automotive use, filled with metallic foams. The reason for using a cellular material as a filler deals with its capacity to absorb energy during plastic deformation, while being lightweight. The study is the evolution of a previous paper presented by the authors at Esaform 2010 and will present new results and findings. It is conducted by evaluating some key technical issues of the manufacturing problem and by conducting experimental and numerical analyses. The evaluation of materials and shapes of the closed sections to be filled is made in the perspective of a car manufacturer (production costs, weight reduction, space availability in a car door, etc.). Experimentally, foams are produced starting from an industrial aluminium precursor with a TiH 2 <b>blowing</b> agent. <b>Bars</b> are tested in three point bending, in order to evaluate their performances in terms of force-displacement response and other specific performance parameters. In order to understand the role of interface between the inner surface of the tube and the external surface of the foam, different kinds of interface are tested...|$|R
25|$|In 1976 McFarlane {{was sentenced}} to life {{imprisonment}} in connection with the Bayardo Bar attack on Aberdeen Street in the Protestant Shankill Road district of Belfast, which killed five people (three men and two women) and injured 60 more on 13 August 1975. In a 1995 House of Lords debate, Gerry Fitt, the formerly Nationalist Party MP for West Belfast, alleged that McFarlane had machine-gunned three pedestrians who were passing by the Bayardo as it was <b>blown</b> up. The <b>bar</b> was attacked because it was allegedly frequented by member of the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The IRA initially denied it had carried out the attack. The attack occurred against a background of severe sectarian violence. The IRA killed 88 Protestant civilians in similar attacks in 1974–76, in reprisal for loyalist attacks on Catholics, which killed 250 civilians in the same period.|$|R
25|$|Twelve more murders followed, {{often with}} {{multiple}} bodies {{found on the}} same day. In addition to the earlier sprees, two victims were found each day from 14 July to 16. Victims were seemingly selected at random. Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, elderly, vagrants, or people {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Most victims were killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction <b>bars.</b> <b>Blows</b> were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many victims were also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her fetus cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any victim were reported. Some victims were also robbed of their cell phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area. However, most victims had their possessions intact. The murders covered a large geographical area. Aside from Dnepropetrovsk, many occurred in outlying areas of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.|$|R
5000|$|Roland's {{final act}} {{occurred}} in Greene, Tennessee in 1937. [...] He again fell during a stunt {{but this time}} there was no awning to break his fall.

50|$|Semyonova's initial {{international}} {{success was}} at the WOGA Classic in January, where she placed first on uneven bars and balance beam. She continued her success {{as part of the}} Russian team at the Gymnix International in Montreal, scoring an exceptional 15.95 on uneven <b>bars,</b> <b>blowing</b> away {{the rest of the field}} with her world leading start value of 7.2. She also won balance beam with a 15.85 and placed 3rd in floor exercise. In March at the Russian National Championships, she helped the Central region to victory in the team competition, won the uneven bars with 15.975 and took 3rd on beam. Semyonova was unable to compete at the European championships in April but returned to win the uneven bars competition at the Russian Cup in July. Her main competition of the year came at the 2007 World Championships in September, where she succeeded in becoming world champion on the uneven bars, scoring 16.35 over Nastia Liukin and Yang Yilin, making her the first Russian world champion in gymnastics since Svetlana Khorkina in 2003.|$|R
