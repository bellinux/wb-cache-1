500|$|The [...] "Panama Creature" [...] (also {{variously}} {{referred to}} as the [...] "Panama Monster", [...] "Panama ET" [...] "Cerro Azul Monster", [...] "Blue Stream Monster" [...] or [...] "Blue Hill Horror") refers to a creature photographed near the town of Cerro Azul, Panama, in September 2009. After the creature was discovered and reputedly killed by a group of teenagers, photographs of the corpse were given to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. The story and pictures circulated, and comparisons to the Montauk Monster were made. There was speculation about the identity of the creature, with suggestions including a hairless sloth, an alien species and a creature new to science. A biopsy performed by the National Environmental Authority of Panama on the remains {{a few days after the}} creature's discovery concluded that the corpse was in fact that of a male <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth.</b> The odd appearance had been caused by underwater decomposition, which had resulted in hair loss. Once identified, the corpse was buried.|$|E
500|$|The creature's corpse was {{recovered}} {{four days after}} the encounter, and a biopsy was performed by the National Environmental Authority of Panama (ANAM). The biopsy concluded that the corpse was in fact a male <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sloth,</b> a species common in the area. André Sena Maia, a veterinarian who works at Niterói Zoo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, explained that [...] "most people know how a dead animal looks like in a dry environment", and claimed that [...] "the body must have got stuck under the water, and the movement of the currents gave the false impression that it was alive." [...] A necropsy revealed that severe trauma had been inflicted on the body of the sloth, and Melquiades Ramos, a specialist from the ANAM Department of Protected Areas, estimated that the body had been in the water for [...] "about two days" [...] prior to discovery. The hairlessness was probably caused by the fact it was submerged in water, which can lead to acceleration of fur loss, resulting in smooth skin. A post-mortem bloating further contributed to the unusual appearance of the corpse. After the sloth was identified, its body was buried by ANAM staff.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brown-throated</b> <b>sloths</b> sleep 15 to 18 {{hours every}} day and are active {{for only a few}} brief periods, which may be during either the day or night. Although they can walk along the ground, and even swim, they spend most of their lives in the high {{branches}} of trees, descending once every eight days or so to defecate in the soil. Adult animals are solitary, except when raising young, and males have been observed to fight one another using their fore claws.|$|R
40|$|Sloths are {{considered}} {{to have one of}} the lowest mass-specific metabolic rates of any mammal and, in tandem with a slow digestive rate, have been theorized to have correspondingly low rates of ingestion. Here, we show in a study conducted over five months, that three captive Bradypus variegatus (<b>Brown-throated</b> <b>sloths)</b> had a remarkably low mean food intake of 17 g kg− 1 day− 1 (SD 4. 2). Food consumption was significantly affected by ambient temperature, with increased intake at higher temperatures. We suggest that the known fluctuation of sloth core body temperature with ambient temperature affects the rate at which gut fauna process digesta, allowing for increased rates of fermentation at higher temperatures. Since Bradypus sloths maintain a constantly full stomach, faster rates of fermentation should enhance digestive throughput, increasing the capacity for higher levels of food intake, thereby allowing increased energy acquisition at higher ambient temperatures. This contrasts with other mammals, which tend to show increased levels of food intake in colder conditions, and points to the importance of temperature in regulating all aspects of energy use in sloths...|$|R

50|$|The {{yellow-headed caracara}} is omnivorous, and will eat reptiles, {{amphibians}} {{and other small}} animals as well as carrion. Birds are rarely if ever taken, and this species will not elicit warning calls from mixed-species feeding flocks that cross its path even in open cerrado habitat. It will also take ticks from cattle, and is sometimes called the tickbird. It has been observed also to forage for small invertebrates in the fur of <b>brown-throated</b> three-toed <b>sloths</b> and capybaras. In addition, at least younger birds are fond of certain fruits, {{such as those of}} the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense).

50|$|The home ranges used by wild <b>brown-throated</b> three-toed <b>sloths</b> in Costa Rica include cacao, pasture, {{riparian}} forests, {{and living}} fence-rows. For {{the first few}} months after giving birth, mothers remain at just one or two trees, and guide their young. At about five to seven months of age, when the young have become more independent, mothers expand their resources and leave their young in new areas. The home range for mothers are larger than those of young. After separation, only the mothers use the cacao agro forest, but both use riparian forest. Different types of trees are used by both mother and young, which indicates that this agricultural matrix provides an important habitat type for these animals.|$|R

40|$|Promiscuous mating {{strategies}} {{are much more}} common than previously appreciated. So much so, that several authors have proposed that promiscuity is the "rule" {{rather than the exception}} in vertebrate mating systems. Decreasing species mobility and increasing habitat fragmentation have both been suggested to reduce the "polygyny potential" of the environment and promote other mating strategies like promiscuity in females. We explored the social and genetic mating system {{for one of the most}} sedentary extant mammals, the <b>brown-throated</b> three-toed <b>sloth</b> (Bradypus variegatus), within a highly fragmented Neotropical habitat. Surprisingly, we found that three-toed sloths were strongly polygynous, with males excluding male competitors from their core ranges, and exhibiting strong reproductive skew. Indeed, only 25 % of all resident adult males sired offspring and one individual sired half of all sampled juveniles. Paradoxically, a sedentary life-history strategy seems to facilitate polygyny in fragmented landscapes because multiple females can persist within small patches of habitat, and be monopolized by a single male. Our work demonstrates that strong polygyny can arise in systems in which the polygyny potential should be extremely low, and other strategies, including promiscuity, would be favoured. Mating systems can be influenced by a multitude of factor and are dynamic, varying among taxa, over time, and across habitats; consequently, mating systems remain difficult to predict based on general ecological principles...|$|R
40|$|The {{functions}} of sleep remain an unresolved question in biology. One approach to revealing sleep's {{purpose is to}} identify traits that explain why some species sleep more than others. Recent comparative studies of sleep have identified relationships between various physiological, neuroanatomical and ecological traits, and the time mammals spend in rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. However, owing to technological constraints, these studies were based exclusively on animals in captivity. Consequently, it is unclear {{to what extent the}} unnatural laboratory environment affected time spent sleeping, and thereby the identification and interpretation of informative clues to the {{functions of}} sleep. We performed the first electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of sleep on unrestricted animals in the wild using a recently developed miniaturized EEG recorder, and found that <b>brown-throated</b> three-toed <b>sloths</b> (Bradypus variegatus) inhabiting the canopy of a tropical rainforest only sleep 9. 63  h d− 1, over 6  h less than previously reported in captivity. Although the influence of factors such as the age of the animals studied cannot be ruled out, our results suggest that sleep in the wild may be markedly different from that in captivity. Additional studies of various species are thus needed to determine whether the relationships between sleep duration and various traits identified in captivity are fundamentally different in the wild. Our initial study of sloths demonstrates the feasibility of this endeavour, and thereby opens the door to comparative studies of sleep occurring within the ecological context within which it evolved...|$|R
50|$|The {{biggest threat}} to sloth’s {{survival}} in Colombia is the destruction and fragmentation of their habitat. Three types of sloths’ species are distinguished in Colombia: the <b>brown-throated</b> three-toed <b>sloth,</b> Bradypus variegatus which inhabits the Pacific and Amazonian lowland rainforest and the Caribbean, the Hoffman’s two-toed sloth, Choloepus hoffmanni prevails in the north along with the B. variegatus, in the Pacific rainforest and the Caribbean savanna dry forest, {{but it is also}} found in Andean montane forest, and the southern two-toed sloth, Choloepus didactylus who is native in the south with B. variegatus, sharing the lowland Amazonian rainforest, but this specific species has been studied little in Colombia. Habitat for these species is limited primarily by the ongoing deforestation with in natural forest. The continuous expansion of agriculture, ranching, and urbanization are a direct threat to sloths’ survival. Frequently, sloths die in large numbers in accidents related to the destruction of natural forests that go underreported by the media and lack attention from wildlife agencies and police. All three-different species have a different rate and specific threat to their survival but collectively habitat loss - deforestation is pivotal. Deforestation facilitates the illegal trade of sloths as they are usually caught by young children who take them from deforested areas and sell them to traffickers. Poachers also take hundreds of young two-and three-toed sloths from their mothers. The Colombian Ministry does not recognize the three-sloth species as being in threat of extinction mainly because there is no long-term study that represents the estimate of the total sloth population to demonstrate cause of concern.|$|R
