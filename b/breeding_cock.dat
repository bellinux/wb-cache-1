40|$|Group size in poultry {{breeding}} flock {{as well as}} female and male ratio greatly contributes to their production, in this concern from an Egyptian Fayoumi laying flock in 27 th week of age, 36 layers were weighed (1. 60 kg/layer), randomly grouped in A (11), B (12) and C (13) and allocated <b>breeding</b> <b>cock</b> of same age and flock. Layers kept at Poultry Experiment Station, Tandojam, on flour system, each group provided one laying nest, 16 hr florescent light and 2 sq. ft space per layer were provided. Birds fed 100 g/layer/day and water was provided 24 h. Eggs were collected at 10, 14 and 18 h daily, soundness was checked and stored in dark room. 50 candled and fit eggs randomly selected and settled into hatchery for incubation. Candling was practiced on 3 rd and 14 th day and turning was practiced daily. Hatched chicks of each group were collected, weighed and brooded over two weeks. Layers average feed intake (682, 686 and 685 g/b/w) and egg weight (40. 36, 40. 45 and 40. 54 g/egg) were almost increased followed by significant increase in egg production (5. 03, 5. 19 and 5. 21 egg/b/week) {{with the increase in}} breeding layer group size for a cock in A,B and groups, respectively. Average fertility and hatchability rates of Fayoumi layer were high for middle (B) than small (A) and large (C) flock size groups during first, second and third hatch of eggs. However, both fertility and hatchability rates were in increasing trend with the progress of age and eggs hatched but hatchability rate was slightly reduced during last hatch and small group reached to its peak of hatching. Overall results of Fayoumi layers kept in middle flock size eggs fertility and hatchability rates were at peak for medium (B) than small (A) and large (C) groups but, chicks from large group to become heavier (29. 90) than medium (29. 80) and small (29. 34) g/b, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three districts of central zone of Tigray, with the aim to assess the socioeconomic characteristics and production environments of local chicken ecotypes, along with farmers’ breeding objectives, breeding practice, and traits of preference for local chickens and to assess the phenotypic characteristics of the local chicken. A total of 242 chicken owners were selected for the study. Nine qualitative and nineteen quantitative traits from 457 chickens were considered. The research finding revealed that village chicken production seems to be an important activity with an average flock size 9. 41 and 8. 98 birds per household in midland and highland agro ecology. The most important chicken production system of the study area is traditional with small feed supplementation. A separate house to keep chicken was practiced in 36. 8 % and 28. 9 % of the respondents in highland and midland area, respectively. About 87. 6 % of the respondents select eggs for incubation and straw was commonly used as bedding material. About 96. 7 % of the respondent use broody hens for incubation and rearing chicks. About 81 % of households participate in chicken and egg marketing as a source of income. Culling is practiced by 78. 9 % of households based on production level of chicken, age, plumage color, ill and bad temperament of hens and cocks. The main breeding objectives of the respondents were meant for household consumption, income generation and for replacement of the flock. The effective population size (Ne) and the rate of inbreeding (ÄF) calculated for the indigenous chicken flock of the study area were 3. 99 and 0. 13, respectively. The selection criteria used for selection of breeding hen were egg size, plumage color, broodiness, disease resistance and hatchability with an average index value of 0. 067, 0. 064, 0. 062, 0. 054, 0. 042. The highest selection criteria used for selection of <b>breeding</b> <b>cock</b> were egg number of the dam, comb type, plumage color, and disease resistance, egg size growth rate with an index value of 0. 053, 0. 052, 0. 045, 0. 044, 0. 041 and 0. 041, respectively. Farmers preferred traits like comb type, plumage color, egg size, broodiness, disease resistance, meat quality, fertility growth, egg number and body size with indices of 0. 169, 0. 156, 0. 137, 0. 117, 0. 114, 0. 113, 0. 108, 0. 096 and 0077, respectively. Reproductive performance study revealed that the overall mean age at first mating of male chickens and the age at first egg of female chickens were 5. 29 and 5. 96 months. Local chicken were mostly normally feathered (hens 97. 8 %, cocks 96 %), red (33 %), grayish (17. 5 %), brownish (17. 3 %) colors. Morph metric measurements indicated that significance differences (P< 0. 05) were observed between agro ecology with respect to breast width, spur length, chest circumferences and shank length. In all parameters, male shows higher significance (P< 0. 001) value than female except breast width and beak width. Multivariate analysis result showed that five PC were extracted that accounted for 58. 45 % of the total variation. The differentiation of highland and midland populations was apparent based on the weights of neck length, beak length, body length, wattle width, body weight, wattle length and height at back traits. The Mahalanobis’ distances between populations shows the smallest and largest distances between highland and midland chicken ecotypes. In conclusion, there is diversity of indigenous chicken population and farmers’ preference for specific traits that may invite to design community based genetic improvement.

40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the steps of}} spermiogenesis and stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in <b>breeding</b> guinea <b>cocks.</b> Sections embedded in epoxy resin were employed for {{the determination of the}} stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in the guinea fowl. Acrosomic granules aided in identifying the initial steps of spermiogenesis, whereas nuclear morphological changes facilitated the identification of subsequent stages. Eleven steps of spermiogenesis and nine stages of seminiferous epithelium were recognized in the guinea fowl testis. Three spermatogonial types, namely, spermatogonial A, B and intermediate were identified in the guinea fowl seminiferous epithelium. Spermatogonial A and preleptotene spermatocytes had the largest (P[*][*] 0. 05) differences were found among birds in spermatogonial A and intermediate spermatogonial nuclei diameters. Spermatogonial B, preleptotene primary spermatocyte, type I spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte in prophase I), and round spermatid nuclei diameters were, however, bigger (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in some birds than others. The classification of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in the guinea fowl was similar to that described in other birds and mammals...|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the ten cockerels; they did not crow very much, and at first I paid little {{attention}} to them. After a few days I remarked that one individual among them was rapidly acquiring the clear vigorous strain of the adult bird. Compared with that fine note which I have described, it was still weak and shaky, but in shape it was similar, and the change had come while its brethren were still uttering brief and harsh screeches as at the beginning. Probably, where there is a great mixture of varieties, it is the same with the fowl as with man in the diversity of the young, different ancestral characters appearing in different members of the same family. This cockerel was apparently the musical member, and promised in a short time to rival his neighbour. Having heard that it was intended to keep one of the cockerels to be the parent of future broods, I began to wonder whether the prize in the lottery--to wit, life and a modest harem--would fall to this fine singer or not. The odds were that his musical career would be cut short by an early death, since the ten birds were very much alike in other respects, and I felt perfectly sure that his superior note would weigh nothing in the balance. For when has the character of the voice influenced a fancier in selecting? Never I believe, odd as it seems. I have read a very big book on the various breeds of the fowl, but the crowing of the cock was not mentioned in it. This would not seem so strange if fanciers had invariably looked solely to utility, and their highest ambition had ended at size, weight and quality of flesh, early maturity, hardihood, and the greatest number of eggs. This has not been the case. They possess, like others, the love of the beautiful, artificial as their standards sometimes appear; and there are breeds in which beauty seems to have been the principal object, as, for instance, in several of the gold and silver spangled and pencilled varieties. But, besides beauty of plumage, there are other things in the fowl worthy of being improved by selection. One of these has been cultivated by man for thousands of years, namely, the combative spirit and splendid courage of the male bird. But there is a spirit abroad now which condemns cock-fighting, and to continue selecting and <b>breeding</b> <b>cocks</b> solely for their game-points seems a mere futility. The energy and enthusiasm expended in this direction would be much better employed in improving the bird's vocal powers.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{paper was}} to study the effect of application of various forms of zinc in diet on gonad development and on selected haematological and biochemical blood indices {{during the period of}} sexual maturation in <b>breeding</b> <b>cocks.</b> The signification of this study erise from the obtained results, from which is evident that the level of applied trace elements is very important but much more important is their form. The paper was compiled {{as a part of the}} research project: "The effect of mineral nutrition on metabolism, gonad development and spermatogenesis in poultry males" soluted as the project of research and development of Ministry of Agriculture. Total of 150 cocks paternal line RIR 05 at the age of 9 weeks were housed in cotes (50 cocks in each) in deep litter in experimental stable in the Department of Nutrition of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The examination period lasted from 10 th to 25 th week of cocks age. The cocks were divided by random sampling into 3 groups of 50 cocks each - a control group and two experimental ones. Control and experimental cocks received complete feed mixture ad libidum. Complete feed mixture of the control group contained 30. 4 kg- 1 Zn which corresponded to a natural Zn content in feed. In the experimental groups P 1 and P 2 the Zn level was supplemented to the value 100 mg kg- 1 of feed mixture with ZnSO 4 in P 1 and with BIOPLEX-Zn preparation (Alltech) in P 2. In the course of experimental period 10 cocks from each group were randomly sampled and weighted, vena basilica was taped and blood was taken off for haematological and biochemical examination and after slaughtering also gonads were examined. The results unambigously show the positive effect of zinc on gonad development and the fact that biological responses are dependant on various forms of zinc. The organic forms of zinc (in our case BIOPLEX-Zn) are supposed to be more biological effective. From the theoretical and practical point of view, these findings are consequential because feed industry and also legislation stated only permited forms of trace elements without consideration of their utilization and biological responses. Utilization of more diggestive and more biological effective forms of trace elements leads to their lower concentration in feed mixtures, which has not only positive economical impact but also positive ecological effect - the protection of biosphere against contamination by those trace elements through animal excrements. In conclusion it is possible to state that this paper contributes to problematics of the effect of zinc on gonad development and internal environment of animals, and in addition brings information about appropriate Zn level and its form in animal nutritionAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R

40|$|Studies of rock {{ptarmigan}} Lagopus mutus in northern latitudes have shown that, in the breeding season, {{the majority of}} cocks pair monogamously and defend small territories, whilst in most populations, {{a small proportion of}} cocks are polygynous or remain unmated. Little is known, however, on spacing behaviour and habitat use of alpine {{rock ptarmigan}} populations occurring at low densities at the southern edge of the species’ range. From 1995 to 1997, we trapped, radio-tracked and observed birds in the Central Italian Alps (elevation 2, 000 – 3, 000 m) in order to investigate spacing behaviour and habitat use in alpine landscapes where habitats offering rich food and cover are patchy. Both sexes were selective in their habitat use, and cocks did not establish territories on bare ground, artificial or nutrient rich grasslands or bogs. In the <b>breeding</b> season, <b>cocks</b> had larger home ranges than hens (cocks 99 ± 57 ha, hens 50 ± 25 ha) that overlapped with the ranges of neighbouring cocks and hens. Cocks were monogamous and defended relatively large territories (core areas of home ranges: cocks 37 ± 26 ha, hens 24 ± 12 ha), which corresponded with low spring densities (0. 47 – 2. 29 cocks km– 2 and 0. 35 – 1. 60 pairs km– 2). Territory size of individual cocks was negatively correlated with the amount of high quality habitat in the core-area. Our results suggest increased home ranges and large breeding territories in low density alpine rock ptarmigan populations, compared to populations occurring at higher densities in the central and northern alps, and on subarctic and arctic grounds at northern latitudes, confirming the predictions of models on foodbased territoriality...|$|R
50|$|Bobwhites are {{generally}} compatible with most parrots, softbills and doves. This species should, however, {{be the only}} ground-dwelling species in the aviary. Most individuals will do little damage to finches, but one should watch that nests are not being crushed when the species perches at night. Single pairs are preferred, unless the birds have been raised together as a group since they were chicks. Some fighting will occur between <b>cocks</b> at <b>breeding</b> time. One <b>cock</b> may be capable of servicing several hens at once, but the fertility seems to be highest in the eggs from the preferred hen. Aviary style is a compromise between what is tolerated by the bird and {{what is best for}} the bird. Open parrot-style type aviaries may be used, but some birds will remain flighty and shy in this situation. In a planted aviary, this species will generally settle down to become quite tame and confiding. Parents with chicks will roost on the ground, forming a circular arrangement, with heads facing outwards. In the early morning and late afternoon, the cock will utter its call, which, although not loud, carries well and may offend noise-sensitive neighbors. Most breeding facilities keep birds in breeding groups, on wire up off the ground. This keeps the birds clean and generally avoids diseases and parasites which can devastate a covey. Cages with mesh floors for pairs and trios are also employed, but usually where there is a photo-period manipulation to keep birds breeding through winter.|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{basis of}} seasonal breeding in the guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) still remains unknown, despite the socioeconomic {{importance of these}} birds, particularly in Ghana. A study involving a total of 50 local guinea cocks was conducted, and documented gross anatomical and histological differences in the reproductive organs of breeding and non-breeding male guinea fowls. The study also compared peripheral testosterone concentrations in <b>breeding</b> and non-breeding <b>cocks.</b> Seasonal differences in variables measured were determined using two-tailed t-test/Mann-Whitney U-test. All comparisons were made at 5 % level of significance. Breeding males had significantly (P[*]=[*] 0. 000) higher anatomical biometric parameters than their non-breeding counterparts. Also, breeding birds had thicker (P[*]=[*] 0. 000) phalli than their non-breeding counterparts. Histologically, regressing testis was characterized {{by the presence of}} sloughed off cells and increased debris in the tubular lumen and within the excurrent duct system, collapsed tubules and reduction in tubular lumen. Germ and Sertoli cell populations and nuclear diameters and actual seminiferous tubular diameter and length in regressing testes were significantly (P[*]=[*] 0. 000) lower than in active testes. Leydig cell nuclear diameters and populations were also significantly (P[*]=[*] 0. 000) reduced. Relative volume of seminiferous tubules in the testis, testicular sperm production/mg testis and per testis and peripheral testosterone concentrations were all higher (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05) in breeding than non-breeding testis. The ducts in the epididymal region also saw significant (P[*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05) reductions in luminal diameters in non-breeding birds. Significant regression in anatomical and histological structures of the guinea cock reproductive tract occurred during the non-breeding season, and lower peripheral testosterone concentrations may be responsible for this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Along the time, {{the poultry}} {{industry}} {{has become one}} of the pillars of the Colombian economy, as a result of its extensive influence in the national gross domestic product and in the livestock field. In fact, the poultry industry significantly contributes to the food security, due to the affordability of poultry and eggs in relation to other protein sources. Due to the current reality of greater economic integration and globalization, it is required to pursue the removal or reduction of barriers such as the health related ones, that could be an obstacle for free trade. The industrial-type poultry industry (broilers, layers, breeders, grandmothers, turkey) is one of the leading sectors of the country’s livestock production. Other types of exploitation such as the <b>breeding</b> of fighting <b>cocks,</b> backyard poultry, farm ostrich and quail, among others, represent another important part of this sector. However, a big concern related to these types of practices is the movement of birds and the potential risk of these as distributors of diseases that could potentially affect the national poultry industry. The Newcastle (ENC) is among the most important diseases. This is one of the easily transmitted pathologies that causes great economic impact to the poultry industry due to its costs associated to high morbidity and mortality, low in production, high costs of treatment of secondary infections and significant investments in programs targeting its control and eradication. Therefore the objective of the study was to determine the presence of antibodies of the disease in fighting cocks (Gallus gallus) in Saboyá, Boyacá. The technique of hemagglutination inhibition was used for this matter. Prior to the study, a census was conducted to determine the population of (N = 1. 500 animals). The health, manipulation and biosecurity standards of the subject population were assessed through the use of an epidemiological survey. The size of the study sample which was n = 138 animals, was calculated through the use of the program Win episcope 2. The results found a prevalence of 96. 4 % (133 / 138), with 79. 7 % (110 / 138) in males and 20. 3 % (28 / 138) in females. The information obtained in the study will be included in the Agreement of Epidemiological Surveillance Program ICA FENAVI-FONAV. To prevent and control the spread of this disease, new measures such as the following ones need to be included: The implementation of vaccination programs not only to these birds, but also to the backyards where they have contact with, the development of plans for active epidemiological surveillance, the monitoring of suspicious cases, the creation of permanent trainings and education to owners, caretakers or people dealing with these birds. These actions will make possible the removal of this disease in a near future. </p...|$|R
