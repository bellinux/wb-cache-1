This study was conducted to detect the clinical outcomes of treatment with oral ribavirin in children with CCHF. In this study, we evaluated the recovery rate and mortality rate among children with confirmed CCHF, who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> with oral ribaririn within the three days of onset of disease and the patients who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after this time or had not <b>been</b> <b>treated.</b> Out of 29 children with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (18 Male, 11 Female with age range 5 to 17 years) 25 patients had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> by oral ribavirin within the initial three days, two patients <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after three days of the onset of disease and two cases had not <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with ribavin.

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings can never <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> merely as means to ends; they must always also <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as ends themselves, requiring {{that their own}} reasoned motives must be equally respected.

A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
