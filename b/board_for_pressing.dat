30|$|MOR {{was higher}} in higher-density boards (Fig.  3) as {{commonly}} mentioned [10, 11], while the MOR of the AIP boards was lower compared with OP <b>boards</b> <b>for</b> both <b>pressing</b> temperatures of 150 and 170  °C. The {{temperature of the}} former boards during hot pressing was {{lower than that of}} the latter boards because the heat was deprived by the injected air [1]. This, therefore, inhibited the hardening of the urea–formaldehyde resin of the former boards; hence the MOR of the former boards was lower.|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} of particleboard, different properties of the board have to be measured {{in order to keep}} the board quality within required limits. Non-destructive methods for this purpose include ultra-sonic testing and eigen frequency testing. These methods have been proposed for mesuring of the strength of the <b>board</b> after <b>pressing,</b> <b>for</b> process control purposes. The ultra sound velocity and eigen frequency methods have been proved to be good instruments for doing this. The results show that Young's modulus and bending strength can be predicted with high accuracy with these methods. Internal bond can only be predicted with poor to fair accuracy with normal regression models. The use of multivariate models most often give better and more reliable models for Young's modulus and bending strength and gives much better predictions of the internal bond. Multivariate models are best suited for complex predictions and if the prediction variables are weak. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
