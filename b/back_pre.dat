5000|$|Throughout {{this crisis}} {{there were many}} {{attempts}} to form Farmers' Unions. This was difficult considering the lack of effective communication technology, the lack of electricity on many farms, and the overall size of the country. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 intended to bring government aid to cooperatives. It allowed the Federal Farm Board to make loans and other assistances in hopes of stabilizing surplus and prices. Later, Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which was enacted on May 12, 1933, aimed to bring <b>back</b> <b>pre</b> World War 1 Farmers' abilities to sell farm products for the same worth {{they were able to}} buy non-farm products. The Act involved seven different crops: corn, wheat, cotton, rice, peanuts, tobacco, and milk. Farmers were paid to not plant those seven crops, thus decreasing supply and returning to market equilibrium. In order to prevent noncooperative farmers from taking advantage of other farmers decreasing supply the bill states [...] "is to keep this noncooperation minority in line, or at least prevent it from doing harm to the majority, that the power of the Government has been marshaled behind the adjustment programs" [...] In other words,the benefits from payments to cooperative farmers were designed to be more beneficial than being noncooperative and flooding the market. The AAA was deemed unconstitutional on January 6, 1936. Further reformation included Farm Credit Act of 1933, which allowed farmers to re-mortgage no longer affordable property, as well as the Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act.|$|E

This group posits their cosmological bases on a cultural matrix dating <b>back</b> to <b>pre</b> columbian and colonial times. Notwithstanding the presence of that cultural matrix, the communities manifest different kinds of social organization that the author perceives as having evolved {{as a consequence of}} the destructuration of the system of kinship.

40|$|The {{teaching}} of Science in English {{was introduced to}} counter detriments of the Malaysian’s inability {{in keeping with the}} pace of developments in science and technology. The current Malaysian linguistic ecosystem is a result of historical events that eminently date <b>back</b> to <b>pre</b> independence dominance by foreign powers (the British). This dominance perpetuated the use of the English language for trade, government matters and education. A notable turn of events is the implementation of the 1963 National Language Act after independence which changed the character of language use in education. English as a medium of instruction was categorically replaced by the Malay language. However, a bilingual policy innovation is now a current feature in the Malaysian linguistic ecosystem. The emphasis given to English brings along a growing concern of the standard that needs to be achieved in the learning of science. Given this policy, the paper attempts to unfold the embedding of learning English through science by examining teacher attitude towards the {{teaching of}} science in English. Data is obtained from a critical analysis of a survey questionnaire and teacher interviews. Using the content analysis approach, the data is analyzed and categorized. Findings provide directions in on-going evaluations of a policy initiative which has generated much attention and discussion. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of study}} was to examine the effects of the world's most {{challenging}} mountain ultramarathon (Tor des Geants [TdG]) on running mechanics. Mechanical measurements were undertaken in male runners (n = 16) and a control group (n = 8) before (PRE), during (MID), and after (POST) the TdG. Contact (tc) and aerial (ta) times, step frequency (f), and running velocity (v) were sampled. Spring-mass parameters of peak vertical ground-reaction force (Fmax), vertical downward displacement of the center of mass (Deltaz), leg-length change (DeltaL), and vertical (kvert) and leg (kleg) stiffness were computed. Significant decreases were observed in runners between PRE and MID for ta (P <. 001), Fmax (P <. 001), Deltaz (P <. 05), and kleg (P <. 01). In contrast, f significantly increased (P <. 05) between PRE and MID-TdG. No further changes were observed at POST for any of those variables, with the exception of kleg, which went <b>back</b> to <b>PRE.</b> During the TdG, experienced runners modified their running pattern and spring-mass behavior mainly during the first half. The current results suggest that these mechanical changes aim at minimizing the pain occurring in lower limbs mainly during the eccentric phases. One cannot rule out that this switch to a "safer" technique may also aim to anticipate further damages...|$|R
25|$|Textile {{production}} in Michoacan includes embroidery, back strap and foot-pedal loom weaving, and crochet. Weaving dates <b>back</b> to the <b>pre</b> Hispanic period, when cotton, ixtle and even feathers and rabbit {{were used to}} create cloth and other textiles. All weaving was done on back strap looms, and the relatively narrow cloth stitched together when wider pieces were need to items such as huipils and blankets. The Spanish brought sheep and wool was added alongside the native fibers. They also introduced the framed pedal loom, which allows the creation of wider, thicker and longer pieces. The arrival of the Spanish also introduced new designs, such as horses appearing in weavings. Textile work is still passed on {{from generation to generation}} in indigenous communities in the state and is an important source of income for these families.|$|R

40|$|Due {{to changes}} in land use over the last century, the {{physical}} nature of many streams and rivers in the British Isles has probably changed. In some cases this change may be large for example {{as a result of}} flood defence schemes and is easily observed, whilst in other cases altered land use, farming, forestry or urbanization may have resulted in more subtle changes to river features. This working guide draws together a way of assessing habitat in any stream or river and determine sites or reaches on the assessed watercourse that may benefit from habitat improvement schemes. It will determine a method of measuring existing habitat in a broad sense, whilst referring to R and D studies currently being undertaken in this area. A method of prioritising any proposed habitat restoration work will be suggested. The limitations of fisheries improvement schemes in terms of cross functional acceptance (flood defence and conservation) will be examined along with suggested proposals for some example watercourses. The need for pre and post enhancement monitoring will be discussed as will the requirement for maintenance programs on schemes. Finally methods for determining the cost benefits of small schemes will be examined, compared to other currently used enhancement strategies. This will allow small scale revenue schemes to be used to <b>back</b> up <b>pre</b> project cost benefit analysis as required in future capital submissions...|$|R

50|$|Basketry {{was one of}} Mesoamerica’s oldest crafts, {{important}} {{since the}} early hunting-gathering period and predates both the manipulation of fire {{and the creation of}} pottery. The craft was originally developed from simple containers for gathering foodstuffs in nature and storage, to other items such as mats, boxes, chairs, cradles, sandals and some clothing items. Basketry in Mexico has two lineages, one indigenous and one Spanish, distinguished mostly by the products made. Many products that date <b>back</b> from the <b>pre</b> Hispanic period still survive such as mats called petates, carrying braces and baskets for the transport of wares to market. The last two were particularly important in the period because there were no beasts of burden, and merchandise was carried by men over land.

25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of these cut outs is not known. It may extend <b>back</b> to the <b>pre</b> Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish {{destroyed}} all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs. Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These cut outs are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made {{in order to keep the}} ritual aspect separate.|$|R
