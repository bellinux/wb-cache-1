25|$|The early 2000s brought {{substantial}} funding increases. High {{energy prices}} drove Alberta's energy boom resulting in multibillion-dollar government surpluses {{and the subsequent}} creation of a $4.5 billion provincial post-secondary educational endowment. In 2005, the university hired Indira Samarasekera as its 12th president, embarking on an ambitious plan to establish itself {{as one of the}} world's top public research universities. These plans were hampered by the 2008 economic downturn, and by late March 2008, the university's endowment had shrunk by more than $100 million, almost 14 per cent of its value. The university predicted a $59-million budget shortfall in 2009 before provincial cuts brought that figure to $79 million. To close the <b>budgetary</b> <b>gap,</b> the university increased non-instructional fees by $290 per year laid off teaching and support staff, and even eliminated phones in some departments (such as English and Film Studies).|$|E

The per capita <b>budgetary</b> <b>gap</b> quantified the fiscal institutional structure between central and local governments, the third independent variable as identified in the literature review.|$|E
40|$|Opportunity Programs such as Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) {{have been}} {{institutionalized}} for over forty years. Emerging {{out of the}} Civil Rights movement, EOP and similar programs have helped to compensate economically and academically disadvantaged students to not only gain admission to colleges and universities by providing them with a leg up, but to also academically and financially support them through college completion. In New York, for example, {{it has been reported}} that over 100, 000 students have been served since the statutory adoption of HEOP, one of four Opportunity programs founded in the late 1960 's. Despite the numbers served, only one third to one half of enrolled students have completed their college degree. In an era of accountability this doesn't bode well, especially in light of New York's $ 1. 2 billion <b>budgetary</b> <b>gap.</b> Thus, to inform public policy of the impact of Educational Opportunity Programs, a more systematic examination of program effectiveness is essential. Through a comprehensive review of empirical literature, this thesis utilizes Astin's Input, Environment, and Output conceptual model for assessment (1993) to identify individual student factors (Input) and programmatic factors (Environment) that contribute to EOP effectiveness (Output). While the EOP literature left much to be explored, the thesis was supplemented with studies from both college access and college student retention. Together, they provided a comprehensive perspective on the challenges and opportunities EOP students encounter on their way to and while enrolled in college that affects their college outcome...|$|E

40|$|State lotteries {{have been}} adopted by thirty-eight states, {{primarily}} {{as a means of}} funding “good causes ” or closing <b>budgetary</b> <b>gaps.</b> While several studies have identified the regressive nature of lotteries and factors responsible for their expansion, less is known about the underlying voting patterns that have driven this expansion. This article examines county-level voting patterns from the 2002 Tennessee lottery referendum and county-level lottery expenditures to determine whether voting reflects a latent demand for lottery or is a deliberate attempt to shift the tax burden. The results indicate that the percentage voting for lottery approval and lottery expenditure is not correlated with income and negatively correlated with education. Voting patterns are therefore similar to lottery participation, suggesting that voting reflects a latent demand for lottery. Lottery expenditure patterns for border counties exhibit familiar cross-border shopping patterns. Casino gambling is a substitute for instant but not online games...|$|R

40|$|Collegiate equestrian {{programs}} are costly to operate, and cost often exceeds revenue from tuition. The local {{problem in this}} project study was the need for supplemental revenue to support a cost-intensive equestrian program, without cutbacks or raising student fees. The study examined the integration of an equine-assisted activities and therapy (EAAT) program for additional income, while capitalizing on existing institutional resources at a Midwestern university in the United States. Research questions explored how to implement an EAAT program to close the <b>budgetary</b> <b>gap</b> at the project site. Systems theory formed the conceptual framework for analyzing the relationship between program characteristics and budgetary adequacy, as well as promising points of intervention in the systemic relationship between program and budget. A mixed methods design included a quantitative survey of all U. S. post-secondary institutions (37) with EAAT programs. Survey data were expanded and validated through open-ended interviews using a panel of five experts selected from the survey group. Data analysis included the constant comparative method, member checking, and triangulation procedures. Focus groups provided feedback on analyzed data regarding application to the project site. Results revealed dominant themes: collaborations; the relationship with administration; finances; staffing; scheduling; and employability. A three-option proposal was created to integrate EAAT, which included students providing community EAAT services to enhance their professional skills, and program revenue. Beyond addressing the financial issue, the social change implications of this study include preparing college graduates for service-based careers that advance a culture of equity and diversity in the workplaces to which they will bring the values learned in the EAAT program...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} project and {{forecast}} future tax collections {{is an important}} element in the identification of future <b>budgetary</b> <b>gaps</b> and the planning of new tax measures that may be needed to meet these needs. Aside from projecting future tax collections, a good tax forecasting model may also be used as a gauge against which to measure the government’s tax collection efforts. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop, specify and estimate a forecasting model for internal taxes which has a higher level of disaggregation, includes determinants in the specification other than tax bases, and considers various proxy variables for the tax bases. Total tax collections fall into four general categories, namely: (1) income taxes, (2) license and business taxes, (3) specific taxes, and (4) other taxes. Some seventy subcategories are divided into these four main groupings. Structural single equation forecasting models were specified and estimated for a selected number of these sub-categories for the period 1961 - 1978. The rest were estimated through the use of identities. The determinants used to explain and forecast the movements of the tax variables may be classified into two groupings: (1) variables that reflect the tax bases; and (2) variables that reflect the changes in the tax structure and tax rates over time. In specifying the functional relationship between the tax and explanatory variables, both the linear and logarithmic forms wee considered. For each of the forecasting equations estimated, the t-statistics, coefficient of determination, R 2, and the percentage root mean square error (RMSE%) were computed to aid in evaluating the relative merits of alternative forecasting equations. The equation harnessing the highest number of merits relative to a set of criteria is used to compute the forward projections of the tax variable specified. Having built an econometric model for forecasting future taxes which exhibited lower forecasting errors, were now challenged to test our next modeling work towards the spatial or regional direction. The full documentation of this project required the inclusion of the data base of the tax variables and their determinants for the estimating (1961 - 1978) and forecasting (1979 - 1982) period. Since the data series for these highly disaggregated variables were not readily available, this was an initial problem. The result of the effort, though, should eliminate re-gathering of data already established and make the model implementable by Bureau personnel...|$|R
40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} {{is likely}} to entail a bias in the budget process toward higher public expenses and deficits. The paper reviews lessons drawn from the theoretical literature and international experience {{on the design of}} intergovernmental relations. The institutional setup should address the dual problem of "common tax resources" and "soft" budget constraints, where policies devised to correct one problem may exacerbate the other. An approach based on full tax autonomy of lower-tier governments and reliance on market discipline, not supplemented by self-imposed constitutional limits, is not advisable. More effective seems to be a cooperative approach with some preeminence granted to the central government.
