5|$|Coghlan took {{an active}} part in public debates. He was loyal to Britain, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> that all parts of the British Empire should be {{internally}} self-governing, with each territory supporting the others. Arguing that this should extend to his ancestral home of Ireland, he expressed support for the Home Rule movement there. He disapproved of the policy of the South African Republic government under Paul Kruger of conscripting uitlanders (mostly British settlers) for military service while denying them the electoral franchise.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E
5|$|The kitchen, oratory {{and great}} chamber rose two floors, {{therefore}} only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase {{on the second}} floor. However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery.|$|E

5|$|Torrential rain forced Henry's army {{to retreat}} in {{disorder}} without fighting a major battle, and Henry vented his spleen on the hostages, having Rhys's son Maredudd blinded. Rhys's other son, Hywel, {{was not among}} the victims. Rhys returned to Deheubarth where he captured and burned Cardigan Castle. He allowed the garrison to depart, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> the castellan, Robert Fitz-Stephen, as a prisoner. Shortly afterwards Rhys captured Cilgerran castle.|$|E
5|$|According to Voigt, the coven {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or ritual, and were eclectic in their practices, mixing Huna with forms of American folk magic. She noted {{that they did not}} worship a goddess <b>but</b> <b>held</b> to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity. Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon. According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used a naked woman as their altar, and that the group disbanded after World War II broke out.|$|E
5|$|Around Gacko and Avtovac in the north, the day {{had been}} quiet. When the {{commander}} of the 2nd Company of the 7th Battalion at Gacko reported rebels gathering near the town, Prpić sent a truck-mounted platoon with an ammunition resupply. The platoon was ambushed en route, with 14 Home Guardsmen being captured. Gacko was reinforced later in the day from troops in Avtovac. On the night of 26 June, the Nevesinje garrison was subjected to a sustained attack by the rebels, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> out.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Strasbourg, Calvin was not {{attached}} to one particular church, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> his office successively in the Saint-Nicolas Church, the Sainte-Madeleine Church and the former Dominican Church, renamed the Temple Neuf. (All of these churches still exist, but none are in the architectural state of Calvin's days.) Calvin ministered to 400–500 members in his church. He preached or lectured every day, with two sermons on Sunday. Communion was celebrated monthly and congregational singing of the psalms was encouraged. He also worked on the second edition of the Institutes. Calvin was dissatisfied with its original structure as a catechism, a primer for young Christians.|$|E
5|$|During this campaign, the 21st {{suffered}} heavy casualties {{during the}} Battle of Spotsylvania and the Battle of Bethesda Church. In the latter engagement, the 21st acted as rear guard and bore {{the brunt of}} a fierce attack <b>but</b> <b>held</b> their position. Grant's Overland Campaign concluded with several assaults on Petersburg, Virginia, on June 15–18, 1864. The 21st again took considerable casualties during these attacks, particularly during the assault on June 17. Maj. Henry Richardson, commanding the 21st, {{was wounded in the}} thigh during the engagement and was shortly thereafter sent home. Now numbering less than 100 men, the regiment had been reduced to a tenth of its original size. Company A, by this time, had only three men on its active roster.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against United Airlines, the U.S. Government, or both. On September 24, 1958, United Airlines filed for damagesbased on the Federal Tort Claims Actagainst the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The airline {{alleged that the}} United States through its agents in the United States Air Force negligently operated the F-100F, and sought damages of US$3,576,698. The court found neither crew was negligent for a failure to see and avoid each other, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> the United States was liable because of other negligence. The case was settled on December17, 1962, with the United States agreeing to pay the airline $1.45million.|$|E

5|$|In Major League Baseball the {{two teams}} with {{the best record in}} each league who do not win a {{division}} play in the Wild Card Game. A number of teams were in competition for these Wild Card spots, along with their divisional competition. The Rangers spent over 80 days leading the American League West and shared the lead as late as September 4. The Rays spent only a few days leading the American League East, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> a share of the lead as late as August 24. The Cleveland Indians did not lead the American League Central after July 2 but remained close throughout the season and ultimately finished just a single game back of the Central champion Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a disaster emergency {{across the entire}} state on the 15th. PPL Electric Utilities Corporation reported 1,542 customers were without power for a time during the storm in the Lancaster, Harrisburg and Allentown areas. Snow began across between 6 AM and 7 AM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Berks counties. The snow then overspread Bucks, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, Berks, and most of Schuylkill counties between 8 AM and 10 AM EST, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> off in Monroe County until the early afternoon hours. There was a lull in the precipitation during the evening hours of the 13th especially across southeastern Pennsylvania, however the precipitation became widespread overnight and during {{the early morning hours}} of the 14th.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 964, Nikephoros, now emperor, campaigned in the East. Mopsuestia was besieged <b>but</b> <b>held</b> out, but Nikephoros {{returned}} {{in the next}} year, stormed the city and deported its inhabitants. On 16 August 965, Tarsus was surrendered by its inhabitants. Cilicia became a Byzantine province, and Nikephoros re-Christianized it. Amidst rebellions and Byzantine raids {{as far as the}} Jazira, Sayf al-Dawla died at Aleppo in February 967. His son and successor, Sa'd al-Dawla, faced constant internal turmoil, and he did not secure control of his own capital until 977. By this time, the rump Emirate of Aleppo was almost powerless and became a bone of contention between the Byzantines and the new power of the Middle East, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory in three hours. He {{lengthened}} the innings break by seven minutes, by remonstrating with officials to pause the {{match for the}} running of the Melbourne Cup. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race. Queensland lost seven wickets <b>but</b> <b>held</b> on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E
5|$|North Korean forces {{began making}} {{gains in the}} hills along the river {{adjacent}} to their bridgehead, against positions of the 34th Infantry. Coordinated attacks pushed A Company to the north back from their hills with heavy casualties on August 7. K Company to the south was also attacked <b>but</b> <b>held</b> its line, reinforced by L Company on August 10. Fighting continued for several days, resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured the hills along the Naktong, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage against the other.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, <b>but</b> <b>held</b> the seeds of future conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution of the Soviet Union {{recognised}} the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and {{the earlier}} Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Congress of Soviets {{as the highest}} organs of state authority in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Under the 1924, 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution these bodies served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Chairman of these bodies personally performed the largely ceremonial functions assigned to a single head of state <b>but</b> <b>held</b> little real power.|$|E
5|$|The event {{opened with}} a tag team match between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) and the team of Alex Shelley and Michael Shane, who were {{accompanied}} by Traci. The duration of the bout was 11 minutes and 47 seconds. At one point, Storm lifted up Shane, so Harris could dive off the top rope and bash {{him in the chest}} with his forearm. Later, Storm was thrown out of the ring <b>but</b> <b>held</b> on to the top rope. He attempted to pull himself back in, however, Shelley dropkicked him from inside the ring, knocking him to the outside. AMW won the match after Storm pinned Shelley following a kick to the chin.|$|E
