50|$|The <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> {{lives on}} a diet mainly {{composed}} of fish. It also eats water bugs and occasionally lizards, snails and rodents.|$|E
50|$|Ictinia is near-basal, {{after the}} Old-World genus Butastur. Rostrhamus and Helicolestes form a clade with the <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> (Busarellus) and the crane hawk (Geranospiza).|$|E
50|$|It {{includes}} {{endangered species}} such as Aristolochia labiata, Eriotheca pubescens and the palms Acanthococos emensis and Euterpe edulis.Fauna include cougar (Puma concolor), giant anteater (Mymercophaga tridactyla), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> (Busarellus nigricollis) and red-winged tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens). The black-fronted titi (Callicebus nigrifrons) occurs in the reserve.|$|E
50|$|One natural {{enemy of}} this ibis {{may be the}} <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> Busarellus nigricollis, one {{individual}} of which has once been observed to pursue a sharp-tailed ibis over a flooded marsh. Further, the ibis flew with a rapid twisting flight which was unusual considering its normally torpid wing beating.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} covered by {{secondary}} growth of seasonal semi-deciduous forest, arboreal/shrub/herbaceous formations in the várzea areas, and areas of riparian palms.Vegetation includes the vulnerable Euterpe edulis (Jussara palmito).Vulnerable, threatened or endangered fauna include horned screamer (Anhima cornuta), wood stork (Mycteria americana), <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> (Busarellus nigricollis), jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), American pygmy kingfisher (Chloroceryle aenea), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) and South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> (Busarellus nigricollis) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Busarellus. [...] It is found in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, and swamps.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the tiny hawk's {{breeding}} biology. Their breeding season may vary depending on their location; from Panama to Colombia, it apparently runs between February and June, while {{in the southern part of}} the range, it may range from October to January. They are known to build stick nests, at least sometimes in the canopy of tall trees. In Venezuela, there is a record of a pair nesting in an old <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> nest. Females lay one to three bluish-white eggs, faintly streaked and spotted with brown. Incubation and fledging periods are not known.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> has the basal {{phalanges}} of {{the inner}} toe fused, which may be an adaptation to prevent the toe from bending back when catching prey. This feature is shared with Ictinia and with the group of true milvine kites and sea eagles (Milvus, Haliastur, Haliaaetus, and Icthyophaga). [...] Research in molecular phylogenetics during the early 21st century indicates {{that there is a}} clear milvine-haliaetine clade that is related to a large group of buteonine hawks and their relatives. Within the buteonine group, Ictinia is near-basal, and Busarellus is a member of a clade shared with Geranospiza, Rostrhamus, and Helicolestes.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> {{has a more}} or less white head, {{tinged with}} buff, and with black shaft streaks on the crown. The body, above and below, and the mantle are bright cinnamon-rufous, paler on the chest. There is a black {{crescent}} on the upper breast. The back has scattered black shaft stripes; the flight and tail feathers are black with the base of the tail barred with rufous. The eyes are bright reddish brown, the cere and bill black, and the legs bluish white. Immatures are similar, but blotched with black, including on the crown, and the rufous barring on the tail is more extensive. The pale area on the chest is also more clearly marked. The upper surface of the wings is barred, and the eyes are brown.|$|E
50|$|The marshes of Cantão hold a great {{diversity}} of plant life, and this becomes evident {{at the peak}} of the floods, when vines, shrubs, and floating vegetation flower, covering large areas with a mosaic of color. Most of these plants go on to produce fruit which are consumed by fish. In addition, broad mats of Paspalum repens grass and other floating vegetation with roots suspended in the current create a substrate for a very productive aquatic ecosystem. The roots of the vegetation are shaped so as to act like filters, trapping organic particles brought by the current, and doing so near the surface, where oxygen and sunlight are abundant. As a result, not only fish, but also fish predators like giant otters and the <b>black-collared</b> <b>hawk</b> move into the marshes to forage.|$|E
40|$|Predation of Caiman yacare (Spix, 1825) (Crocodilia, Alligatoridae) by Busarellus nigricollis (Latham, 1790) (Accipitriformes, Accipitridae) in the Taiama Ecological Station, Alto Pantanal, State of Mato Grosso. The <b>Black-collared</b> <b>Hawk</b> Busarellus nigricollis is an Accipitridae {{commonly}} seen on river banks, lagoon shores, and marshy areas. It feeds {{mainly on}} fishes and aquatic insects. It hunts from dead tree branches at forest edges or emergent trunks in flooded areas. Detailed {{information about the}} <b>Black-collared</b> <b>Hawk</b> food habits is scarce. In this study, we describe the predation of Caiman yacare (Pantanal alligator) by an individual of B. nigricollis. The event was observed on 20 August 2010 at 10 : 14 am, in the Taiama Ecological Station, municipality of Caceres, Alto Pantanal, state of Mato Grosso. The B. nigricollis individual was seen leaving the Paraguay River carrying a juvenile C. yacare around 40 cm long. The prey was torn apart and given to a <b>Black-collared</b> <b>Hawk</b> nestling sitting atop a nest in flooded forest, ca. 15 m way from the river bank. This is the first published record of Pantanal alligator predation by the <b>Black-collared</b> <b>Hawk...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Black-collared</b> <b>Hawk</b> {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in Brazil, but records are scarce in the southern limits of its range. In the state of Santa Catarina its occurrence was reported {{for the first time}} in 1999. In April 2007, a juvenile was seen and photographed in southern Santa Catarina. This is the first documented record of the species for the state...|$|E
