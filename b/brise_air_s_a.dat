40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{historical}} study of United States paramilitary operations since World War II. It presents a typology of operational environments based {{on the level of}} political constraint imposed upon the National Command Authority. An inductive approach is used to study three cases: OSS operations during WWII; attempts by the United States to overthrow the Castro regime; and efforts by the United States to destabilize the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. From these cases emerge a set of criteria that are useful in defining operational success across a spectrum of paramilitary environments. These criteria can be used to evaluate the possible use of future paramilitary operations, as well as provide benchmarks to judge which organizations, or combination of organizations, would be best suited to perform the paramilitary mission.

40|$|Today's {{military}} {{command and control}} (C 2) systems provide much information to today's combatants, but because these legacy systems are disjointed, there exists an overload of poorly organized and incomplete data during operations. These systems tend to be "stovepiped," inflexible, difficult to integrate, and bard to use in building a common operational picture. The information exchange model for DoD C 2 systems is migrating away from dedicated point-to-point and broadcast systems (information push) toward a model based partly on Internet and World Wide Web technologies (publish and subscribe). The USAF Scientific Advisory Board has created a visionary combat information management concept called the Joint Battlespace Infosphere {{in response to this}} movement. The purpose of this thesis is to identify and evaluate emerging Internet/Web-based technologies that could be employed by the DoD to improve upon existing information exchange services. This survey will examine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} technologies such as client-server architectures, search engines, middleware, intelligent software agents, and multicast delivery tools that could enhance the development of the Joint Battlespace Infosphere.

40|$|The {{threat to}} US Operations in the Middle East has changed {{significantly}} {{since the end}} of the Cold War, and although counterintelligence methodology has changed with it, additional modifications are needed. This thesis demonstrates the gap that has emerged in the ability of counterintelligence forces to counter the threat. Increased military presence in the Middle East and the removal of the Cold War's checks and balances increase the impact of "rogue states" and non-state actors. Current counterintelligence methodology fails to adequately address the non-state-based threat. Revolutionary information technologies and the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons ensure that non- state actors will pose a counterintelligence threat as great, or greater, than the state-based threat. The implication of this is significant. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), the USAF Agency tasked with counterintelligence support, must restructure itself to meet this emerging threat. A Classified annex to this thesis is published under separate cover. This annex outlines current AFOSI methodology and makes policy recommendations to allow AFOSI to better address the non-state-based threat.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{software}} management in a development {{program is a}} major factor in determining the success of a program. The four main areas where a software program manager can affect the outcome of a program are requirements management, estimation/planning management, people management, and risk management. In this thesis a quality management metric (QMM) was used to measure the performance of ten software managers on Department of Defense (DoD) software development programs. Informal verification and validation of the metric compared the QMM score to an overall program success score for the entire program and yielded positive correlation. The results of applying the QMM can be used to characterize the quality of software management and can serve as a template to improve software management performance. Future work includes further refining the QMM, applying the QMM scores to provide feedback and appropriate training to program managers, and using the QMM scores as an input to program cost and schedule estimation methodologies to provide better program estimates.

40|$|Iranian foreign policy, {{like any}} state's foreign policy, {{is the product}} of various {{pressures}} originating in domestic, international, cultural, historical, institutional, and even individual factors. However, the greatest amount of understanding and potential for prediction can be obtained using the historical institutional method, focusing on Iran's history of foreign domination, the role of Twelve Shia Islam, and the particular institutions of the Islamic Republic. These three factors both drive and constrain foreign policy decisions in every case. They can be used to understand the prospect for rapprochement between the United States and Iran in the present circumstances, as well as guide future U. <b>S.</b> -Iranian relations. <b>As</b> a major producer of oil and natural gas, Iran's foreign policy is relevant to U.

40|$|Today, in the post-Cold War era, {{each of the}} U. S. {{military}} services and U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) realizes {{that in order to}} remain relevant it must be able to innovate and change. This thesis defines military innovation as a change in the stated roles or missions of the organization to solve current or projected military challenges or threats as defined by the national strategy. The thesis surveys three contending theories of military innovation. It identifies elements from each and develops a hypothesis to explain innovation in U. S. Special Operations Forces (SOF). This hypothesis is then tested against three instances where U. S. SOF accepted and developed the new missions of counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and counterproliferation. The study concludes that the variables of SOF culture, changes in the security environment, civilian intervention, and military leaders have combined to cause military innovation in U. S. SOF. Of these variables, military leaders, who control of resources and can provide promotion pathways to junior officers, is necessary for innovation. Recommendations for USSOCOM are then drawn from these conclusions. U. <b>S.</b> <b>Air</b> Force (U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> F.) author...|$|R
40|$|Personal Communications Services (PCS) {{may be the}} key {{ingredient}} for vastly improved military communications capabilities {{at the turn of the}} century. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines PCS as a family of mobile or portable radio communications services which could provide services to individuals and businesses and be integrated with a variety of competing networks [...] . the primary focus of PCS will be to meet communications requirements of people on the move. Today's generation of Theater Deployable Communications, which provides joint tactical communications to deployed forces, is the Tri-Service Tactical Communications (TRI-TAC) system. A description of TRITAC's family of equipment, network topology, typical employment, and critical limitations is presented in this thesis. Five commercial Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) are described as viable candidates for augmenting existing communications systems. Cellular design principles such as frequency reuse, cell splitting, channel access methods, and propagation factors are also addressed. Finally, a framework for comparison of the candidate MSS systems is proposed as a baseline for further studies into the most beneficial implementation of PCS into theater deployable communications systems for the future.

40|$|In {{the latter}} part of 1998, the United States Air Force began to institutionalize its post-Cold War expeditionary nature by {{ushering}} in its "Expeditionary Aerospace Force" (EAF) concept. A critical component of this concept is a "lean" force which calls for a reduction of the Air Force's forward-deployed footprint of both personnel and equipment. This reduction is supported by and relies on advances in information and communications technologies. These technological advances allow the Air Force to conduct operations from multiple, independent nodes in a teaming manner. This approach, also known as "distributed operations", is becoming standard throughout the U. S. Armed Forces. It allows many personnel to remain geographically separated from the forward-deployed forces which "reach back" to rear locations for required support. The Air Force's transition to an expeditionary aerospace force and corresponding reliance on "distributed operations" poses new challenges to command and control. This thesis examines the changes the Air Force is undertaking to meet the challenges associated with implementing the EAF concept. These changes fit into the three pillars of command and control - personnel, processes, and technology. U. <b>S.</b> <b>Air</b> Force (U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> F.) author...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} in the form of a {{literature}} review of the theories advanced by both academics and revolutionaries of why and how a revolution occurs. The thesis is in two parts: the first part describes theories devised by academics to explain why revolutions occur. These theories are divided into three categories based on the level of analysis chosen by the academic. The second half of the thesis deals with the organizational choices made by revolutionaries. These choices amount to the development of a theory, not always explicit, on how revolutions occur. I divide the field into those revolutionaries who choose centralized versus decentralized organizational forms, and those who rely on mass movements versus those who concentrate on actions by elites. The major conclusions of the thesis are that no single level of analysis is sufficient to explain why revolutions occur, and that the choices of organizational form have more to do with the structural considerations of the environment than the will or wishes of the revolutionaries. I end with a call for more research on the organizational choices of revolutionary movements. NAU. <b>S.</b> <b>Air</b> Force (U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> F.) author...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} implementing secure virtual machine monitors (VMM) on the Intel Pentium architecture. A VMM allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently under virtual machines on a single workstation. High-assurance VMMs could allow complete isolation of, or data sharing between, virtual machines according to a security policy such as a mandatory secrecy policy. The Intel architecture was mapped {{to a set of}} hardware requirements for VMMs. It was found that the Intel architecture was not virtualizable. However, several techniques are presented that allow the Intel architecture to support a virtual VMM. A commercial virtual VMM was studied and found to be unable to support secure VMMs. Therefore, a foundation upon which a secure VMM could be built for the Intel Pentium architecture is presented. A secure VMM for the Intel architecture offers several benefits. First, PC users could work in a more secure environment. Second, PC users could run familiar COTS operating systems and applications. Finally, secure VMMs could save the DoD millions of dollars by eliminating the need for separate systems when both high assurance, and COTS operating systems and applications are required.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an implementafion of DecisionNet which uses updated, more efficient web technology {{and includes a}} pricing system. DecisionNet is an organized electronic marketplace of Intemet-accessible decision support systems. Providers register their decision support technologies in a online index. When consumers need {{a particular type of}} decision support system that they do not have, they can search the index to locate a system accessible over the web which might meet their needs, thus avoiding the purchase of a stand-alone system. Previous implementations of DecisionNet have assumed that decision support system providers allowed the use of their systems at no cost. The present implementation incorporates a simple pricing system for recovering fixed and variable costs associated with providing systems over the Intemet. Pricing of services over the Internet is still in its earliest stages and there is no single, generally accepted model that applies to pricing of Internet services. This thesis examines some academic studies of Intemet pricing and some pricing policies currently in use, then describes a flexible pricing system which permits the provider to experiment to find optimum prices for a changing market.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} fuel optimal {{periodic}} reboost profile {{required to maintain}} a spacecraft experiencing drag in low-earth-orbit (LEO). Recent advances in computational optimal control theory are employed, along with a Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto Pseudospectral collocation code developed at the Naval Postgraduate School, to solve the problem. Solutions obtained by this method are compared against a previous study. Key issues were checking the optimality of the solutions {{by way of the}} necessary conditions and the behavior of the solution to changes in the thruster size. The results confirmed Jensen's findings of propellant savings of one to five percent when compared against a middle altitude Forced Keplerian Trajectory (FKT). Larger savings are predicted if compared against a finite-burn Hohmann transfer with drag. The costates estimates compared favorably against necessary conditions of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. Analysis of the switching flinction yielded periods of thrust-modulated arcs. The optimal thrust profile appears to be a thrust- modulated burn to raise the orbit followed by an orbital decay and a terminating thrust-modulated arc. For a sufficiently low thrust-control authority, the switching structure includes a maximum thrust arc. Indirect optimization techniques to confirm these findings were unsuccessful.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the utility of}} non-lethal weapons for mitigating risks in demanding tactical scenarios, specifically crowd control. Noncombatant evacuation operations (NEOs) are conducted when a host government becomes unstable. A NEO force's failure to manage the potential for local violence against the mission can lead to negative consequences for U. S. foreign policy and international relations. Therefore, the NEO force must control any escalation in the threat level because mission success could be jeopardized. Along with restrictive rules of engagement these considerations discourage the use of deadly force. Thus, non-lethal weapons {{have a role in}} NEOs. One of the challenges in NEOs is crowd control. Crowds have the potential for violence. Left unchecked, they can endanger the NEO mission. This thesis finds that a non- lethal capability is essential for responding to these threats. The thesis' methodology produces a short list of suitable non-lethal crowd control weapons for deployment in NEOs. Finally, the arguments for non-lethality in NEOs can be extended to other operations other than war, thus increasing the utility of non- lethal weapons in the U. S. military inventory.

The U. <b>S.</b> considers Sudan <b>an</b> Islamic Fundamentalist regime because National Islamic Front (NIF) members hold key positions in the government In 1993 the U.

It reviews current policies and argues that key strategic interests are being neglected. The U. S. tends to equate Islamic Fundamentalism with its more radical element terrorism, which significantly influences U. S. policy towards Sudan. Currently the terrorism policy of the US is based on countering state-sponsored terrorism while the more significant threat is from a new breed of well-funded terrorists who operate independently of states. Instead of isolating Sudan for harboring such individuals, the U. S. should take advantage of Sudan's influence with loosely knit Islamic groups. America's inability to effectively deal with the evolving terrorism threat as reflected in its policy toward Sudan, re resents a serious vacuum in its ability to provide for its national security.

40|$|Human {{rights have}} {{in recent years}} become a key {{justification}} for outside powers to intervene in conflicts within states. NATO's intervention in Kosovo in March to June 1999 is but one important example of this rationale. Despite the allied "victory," NATO's decision making was muddled and burdened by convoluted rhetoric and hesitancy and cannot {{serve as a model}} for any similar future engagements. It is out of the need to find a constructive way forward that the thesis argues for a rational course of action based on ideals but tempered with realism. International norms regarding state sovereignty, human rights, and intervention as propounded in the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are discussed and critiqued. Kosovo is critically analyzed as a case study highlighting practical constraints and the need for reasserting clear definitions and guidelines that are philosophically well- grounded and legally viable. Philosophical obstacles to achieving clarity and formulating universal norms are briefly assessed. The thesis proposes a philosophical framework and norms that may well serve as the foundation for revised international guidelines. The conclusion argues for tempered international enforcement of clear and coherent guidelines that uphold specified, universally acknowledged human rights.

This thesis compares Russian and U. S. views of the future security environment, looking for areas of overlap that could {{serve as the basis for}} mutually acceptable cooperative approaches to military options [...] especially in areas in or around the former Soviet Union [...] to deal with new WMD threats. The most effective military options might require the creation of a Russian-American response force similar to the U. S.

This thesis analyzes the circumstances in which Russian-American SOF cooperation is more likely to succeed than U. S. unilateral action. The analysis concludes that information-sharing may be the most likely form of cooperation, although any Russian-American cooperative effort would reveal to the other side sensitive information about capabilities and vulnerabilities in that area of cooperation.

40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} optimal age replacement policies for devices whose age {{is measured in}} multiple time scales. For example, the age of a jet engine {{can be measured in}} chronological time, the number of flight hours, and the number of landings. Under a single-scale age replacement policy, a device is replaced at age or upon failure, whichever occurs first. We show that a natural generalization to k > 2 scales is to replace non-failed devices when their usage path crosses the boundary of a k-dimensional region M, where M is a lower set with respect to the matrix partial order. For lifetimes measured in two scales, we consider two contexts. In the first, devices age along linear usage paths. For this case, we generalize the single-scale long-run average cost and estimate optimal two-scale policies. We show these policies are strongly consistent estimators of the true optimal policies under mild conditions, and study small- sample behavior using simulation. For the second context, in which device usage paths are unknown, we use two-dimensional renewal theory to derive the long-run average cost of a policy. We give examples in both settings and note that these ideas generalize to more than two scales. NANAU. <b>S.</b> <b>Air</b> Force (U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> F.) author...|$|R
40|$|While Iranian {{foreign policy}} making since the 1979 {{revolution}} has been erratic and even {{hostile to the}} interests of the United States, it has been anything but irrational and unintelligible. This thesis argues that Iranian foreign policy making is not enigmatic but rather can be understood in a systematic and rational manner. The key to understanding Iranian foreign policy making is the notion of factional politics in an unconsolidated polity. Put briefly, Than has lacked a consistent and decisive center of power, leaving foreign policy-making in the hands of various elite factions. The seemingly erratic nature of Iran's actions is explained by noting which taction is behind various policies. Seemingly self-defeating foreign policies have often been designed for domestic political advantage. Foreign policy, like domestic policy, is a tool for advantage in Iran's factional power struggle-conclusions directly at odds with Neo-Realist theory. President Khatami's pursuit of liberalization and rapprochement with the U. S. has highlighted the factional component of Iranian policy making. Understanding Iranian policy in this manner leads to a logical conclusion for U. S. policy makers: Khatami's overtures are genuine and strategic, not only because they will help Iran forward but also because the will help Khatami remain in power.

Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions GmbH (formerly Lurgi GmbH) {{has been part of}} <b>Air</b> Liquide <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> since 2007. Lurgi was the cable address of Metallurgische Gesellschaft founded on 5 February 1897. Its origin dates back to the technical branch of Metallgesellschaft, which had been established by Wilhelm Merton in 1881. By the end of World War I, the company had gained a foothold in the steam and absorption business and gathered expertise in the upgrading of solid fuels and the processing of the resulting gaseous and liquid products. As a consequence of this diversification, the company divided into process-specific subsidiaries, which from 1919 traded under the name of LURGI. In 1923, they jointly moved into offices at Gervinusstrasse, Frankfurt am Main. In order to meet the requirements of the international markets, Lurgi constituted itself as a German stock corporation in 1990. Its operating limited liability companies - chemistry, metallurgy and industry construction; energy and environmental techniques; gas- and mineral oil techniques - each had their own engineering and commercial staff. In 1991, Lurgi pooled its polymer activities by taking over Zimmer AG from the British Davy-McKee AG as the fourth operating company. In 2001 Lurgi sold their metallurgical division (Lurgi Metallurgie) to Outokumpu.

The preferred method thus far has been passive isolation because of its simplicity and low cost. Active vibration isolation and disturbance rejection will soon be more common as space qualified sensors, actuators and processors become more capable and affordable, and performance requirements increase. Spacecraft disturbances are typically periodic vibrations which are most effectively controlled through feedforward techniques. A popular choice of feedforward control methods for disturbance rejection is the Multiple Error Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm which requires a separately measured disturbance correlated signal in its implementation. A new technique called Clear Box makes extensive use of identification to bring out information that is normally hidden or not used by traditional control methods. It allows operation in an information rich environment with built in fault tolerance, {{the ability to control}} unanticipated disturbances, and the ability to select which modes to control (if saturation of the actuators is a possibility or concern), all without the need for a separately measured disturbance correlated signal. Experiments using both Multiple Error LMS and Clear Box on an Ultra Quiet Platform provide an effective demonstration of the advantages of the Clear Box Algorithm, including a new Adaptive Basis Method which allows control of rapidly varying frequencies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedWhat explains Syria's pro-Western {{foreign policy in}} recent years? The most common argument [...] that the shift occurred because of {{the demise of the}} USSR, Syria's primary patron [...] is, as this thesis demonstrates, inaccurate. Rather, this thesis proves that changes in Syria's foreign policy began in the mid-l 980 s [...] not in 1991 [...] and were driven primarily by domestic economic factors, not by international structures. Syria's increasingly pro-Western foreign policy was a byproduct of economic liberalization policies (infiraj), begun in the early 1980 s. For economic liberalization to succeed, Syria had to attract foreign [...] primarily Western [...] capital. In addition, the liberalization changed Syria's class structure, expanding and promoting to positions of influence a new class of Western-educated and/or -looking entrepreneurs. Both of these developments pushed Syria in new foreign policy directions well before the collapse of the USSR. Its behavior in the Gulf War and at the Madrid Conference was more a reflection of altered Syrian internal politics than of the recognition that the United States was the only true superpower in a changed international system. This thesis has important policy and theoretical applications. It identifies the driving forces of Syria's current foreign policy behavior, and it pushes theorists to take seriously the domestic roots of foreign policy-making.
