5|$|According to Article 45 of the {{protocol}} to the Accession Treaty of <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania,</b> the {{new members of}} the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of the Commission and after consultation with the European Parliament. Compared to former enlargements of the European Union, the Accession Treaty for <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania,</b> for the first time, contains an explicit acknowledgement of the Parliament’s role and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners’ appointment procedure.|$|E

5|$|Turnout {{has dropped}} {{consistently}} {{every year since}} the first election, and from 1999 it has been below 50%. In 2007 both <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania</b> elected their MEPs in by-elections, having joined {{at the beginning of}} 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6% and 28.3% respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} also known from Montenegro and {{possibly}} from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Early records of Myotis ikonnikovi—now known to be an eastern Asian species—from Ukraine, <b>Bulgaria,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania</b> may also pertain to this species. Because whiskered bats in many cases cannot easily be distinguished from each other {{without the use of}} genetic methods, some listings do not differentiate between them; records of M.alcathoe and/or M.mystacinus and/or (in some cases) M.brandtii have been reported from Bulgaria, Belgium, and Montenegro.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 434 were built; of these, the Germans seized 244 when they {{occupied}} Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired 52 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia {{at the same}} time. Others were exported to <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania.</b> In German service, it saw combat {{during the early years}} of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942. It was used for the remainder of the war by other countries and as a training tank in Bulgaria into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|By {{a narrow}} margin, Scotland {{qualified}} for the UEFA European Championship {{for the first time}} in 1992. A 1–0 defeat by Romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results, but a 1–1 draw between <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania</b> in the final group match saw Scotland squeeze through. Despite playing well in matches against the Netherlands and Germany and a fine win against the CIS, the team was knocked out at the group stage. Scotland failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The team finished fourth in their qualifying group behind Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. When it became clear that Scotland could not qualify, Andy Roxburgh resigned from his position as team manager.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Savage's career, squadrons would {{typically}} deploy a detachment to Naval Air Station Port Lyautey, Morocco, {{for service}} with the Sixth Fleet and fly the bombers aboard aircraft carriers {{that were already}} deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. The plan was that the Savages would then be loaded with atomic bombs already aboard the carriers and launched once the carriers were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The tactic to deliver the bombs was to fly at low level through <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania</b> before climbing at maximum power to the proper altitude to release the bomb. The aircraft would then perform a wingover maneuver and dive to low altitude, keeping {{the tail of the}} aircraft aimed at the target to avoid serious damage from the shock wave of the explosion.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania,</b> which {{joined the}} EU in 2007, are also legally bound {{to join the}} Schengen Area, {{implementation}} has been delayed. Bulgaria's and Romania's bids to join the Schengen Area were approved by the European Parliament in June 2011 but rejected by the Council of Ministers in September 2011, with the Dutch and Finnish governments citing concerns about shortcomings in anti-corruption measures and {{in the fight against}} organised crime. Concern has also been expressed about the potential influx of illegal migrants through Turkey to <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania</b> and then to present Schengen countries. Although the original plan was for Schengen Area to open its air and sea borders with <b>Bulgaria</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romania</b> by March 2012, and land borders by July 2012, continued opposition from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands has delayed the two countries' entry to the Schengen Area.|$|E
