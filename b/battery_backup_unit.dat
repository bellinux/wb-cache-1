30|$|Besides the modules {{providing}} the core communication functions, base station sites also host components that ensure {{the equipment is}} kept safe, in adequate ambient conditions, and protected from any external interruptions. While all these components are required to ensure reliable communication networks, they all add energy overheads, increasing consumption and reducing the efficiency of each site. Major technological improvements have allowed for the availability of more energy-efficient equipment. For instance, within base station sites, active cooling is considered to consume around 30 % of the energy. Improvements have allowed for equipment to support higher operational temperatures, reducing {{or in some cases}} eliminating the need for active cooling. Other energy-related improvements within base station sites include more efficient rectifiers, <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> <b>units,</b> and system designs. Overall, advancements in technology have allowed for more compact, flexible, and efficient equipment packed with a wider array of features.|$|R
50|$|A local <b>backup</b> <b>battery</b> <b>unit</b> is {{necessary}} in some telephony and combined telephony/data applications built with use of digital passive optical networks. In such networks there are active units on telephone exchange side and on the user side, but nodes between them are all passive in the meaning of electrical power usage. So, if a building (such as an apartment house) loses power, the network continues to function. The user side must have standby power since operating power isn't transferred over data optical line.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{available}} 17xx-series Commodore REUs, and then their later discontinuation, Berkeley Softworks, the publishers of GEOS, developed their own 512 kB RAM expansion cartridge - the GeoRAM. This device was purposely designed for use with GEOS, although some REU-aware programs were later adapted {{to be able to use}} it. Some time later, the GeoRAM was cloned by another company to form the BBGRAM device (which also sported a <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> <b>unit).</b> The GeoRAM used a banked-memory design where portions of the external SRAM were banked into the Commodore 64's CPU address space. This method provided substantially slower transfer speeds than the single-cycle-per-byte transfer speeds of the Commodore REUs. A benefit of using SRAMs was lower power consumption which did not require upgrading the Commodore 64's power supply.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In this {{wireless}} communication era, mobile phones {{have become a}} necessity in the common man’s life. Besides being capable of making calls and sending messages, the latest advancements in mobile phones facilitate them to connect to the internet also. With these capabilities, {{there has been an}} unprecedented use of mobile phones in many areas of automation. One such area where mobile phone can help with the automation is irrigation process. The main aim of the work is to simplify the method of irrigation using vocal commands through the mobile phone. The Farmer just needs to call a fixed number and utter the control commands through his phone. The control system at the field involves a PIC microcontroller interfaced with GSM modem to receive the command from the farmer and a voice recognition unit which decodes it. The motor is turned on/off according to the decoded commands by the controller. In addition, the system also sends back a message to the farmer’s mobile about the action that has taken place. The power detection and <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> <b>unit</b> helps in detecting the power availability in the field and inform the farmer about the same, even if the there is no supply at the field. The moisture sensor attached to the system helps in collecting the moisture content of the soil and switch off the motor after it reaches the required value...|$|E

50|$|In {{the areas}} that are prone to power interruptions, adding <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> to the traffic {{controller}} systems can enhance {{the safety of the}} motorists and pedestrians. In the past, a larger capacity of uninterruptible power supply would be required to continue the full operations of the traffic signals using incandescent lights. The cost for such system would be prohibitive. After the newer generations of traffic signals that use LED lights which consume 85-90% less energy, it is now possible to incorporate <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> into the traffic light systems. The <b>battery</b> <b>backups</b> would be installed in the traffic controller cabinet or in their own cabinet adjacent to the controller.|$|R

Currently, <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> systems are designed using engineering judgment {{due to a lack}} of operational requirements and well-defined performance measures. New high resolution traffic controllers now have the ability to record event based data for power failures and traffic counts at a tenth of a second resolution. Equipped with this high-resolution data, the paper proposes a performance-based investment programming using average annual signal downtime (AASD) over the analysis period as a performance measure. AASD is stochastically estimated using hazard-based duration models developed with power failure data. A volume and functional class weighted stochastic optimization scheme is then presented for a <b>battery</b> <b>backup</b> system project planning by sizing battery capacity to minimize AASD for a network under given budget constraints...|$|R
