"Mutual Core" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "best" [...] and [...] "climactic" [...] by Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, which elected Biophilia as the CD of the Week, and [...] "literally volcanic" [...] by Heather Phares of Allmusic. Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal stated that the track is [...] "earthbound". According to the Daily Mirror review, the track [...] "adds angry rebuke and glitchy distorted power chordings to the shimmering, ringing percussion and natural awe that feature on the astonishing tracks [...] "Virus" [...] and aptly named [...] "Crystalline"". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised {{the composition of the}} album and stated [...] "There’s something audacious and impressive about the way [...] "Hollow" [...] attempts to strike a weird balance between menace and calm, the vocals as lulling as the staccato backing is unsettling. Or [...] "Mutual Core"’s repeated shifts from a wheezing keyboard – it was doubtless built in a laboratory by the provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and professor Brian Cox, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a 13th-century portative organ – to electronic bombardment". Möhammed Choudhery of Consequence of Sound analysed the use of Björk's voice in the album, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time on the season three finale of US The Voice. Mars performed the song with two piano players and no stage production except for blue lighting. Unlike, most performers he did not sing with a contestant from the show. Rap-Up considered that Mars [...] "rocked the stage" [...] during his performance, while EW's Hillary Bussis found the crowd to [...] "go crazy" [...] because of his lyrics or persuading Mars [...] "to ditch those Cee Lo shades". [...] He also performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on January 10, 2013. The performance had Mars with piano accompaniment. Kyle McGovern of Spin wrote that [...] "he swells and contracts with every new regret and heartbroken epiphany." [...] McGovern also stated, [...] "Mars might still be locked out of heaven, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> he's getting closer to the angels." [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was performed}} at The Jonathan Ross Show after an interview, on March 3, 2013. The song was performed at season five the finale of Let's Dance for Comic Relief, on March 9, 2013. On April 3, 2014, Mars performed the song live on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Carl Williott called the performance [...] "flawless". It was sung on the show Vivement Dimanche, on April 7, 2013. On May 26, 2013, the single was performed at the Radio 1's Big Weekend. [...] It was the twelfth song of his second and third worldwide tours, The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-2015) and 24K Magic World Tour (2017-2018), respectively.|$|E

60|$|Imprimis, {{there was}} some sort of a dispute between New York and Chicago as to which town should give an {{exhibition}} of products to be hereafter holden, and through the medium of their more dignified journals the two cities were yahooing and hi-yi-ing at each other like opposition newsboys. They called <b>it</b> humor, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> something quite different.|$|R
60|$|And then {{something}} happened--something shattering, disintegrating. It {{was only a}} pheasant, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> {{the end of the}} world. It rose at their feet with a rattle that filled the universe, and for a moment all was black confusion. And when that moment had passed it became apparent to Bill that his arm was round Elizabeth, that she was sobbing helplessly, and that he was kissing her. Somebody was talking very rapidly in a low voice.|$|R
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such {{a huge part of}} me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Miami" [...] has a trip rock style. It {{begins with}} a drum loop, with Mullen's hi-hats playing {{backwards}} through a very extreme equalization filter. Howie B explained, [...] "The main groove is actually just Larry's hi-hat, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a mad engine running or something really crazy – about {{as far away from}} a hi-hat as you can imagine... the task in 'Miami' was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you'd ever have heard before." [...] Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono's affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. D. Leurssen described it as a [...] "sonic travelogue," [...] while the Edge termed it [...] "creative tourism." [...] In 2005, Q magazine included the song [...] "Miami" [...] in a list of [...] "Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists". However, Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine acknowledged the inclusion of the song in Q's list and said [...] "I’m pretty sure they gave this album some super-glowing review when it was first released, so clearly they’re not to be trusted in the first." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1994, {{the band}} issued a seven-track EP, Dick Sandwich. Its cover had [...] "a graphic {{drawing of the}} {{offending}} flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce." [...] Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature {{and told them to}} [...] "grow up". The EP was described as having [...] "good songs <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it was recorded under a doona" [...] and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, [...] "I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson" [...] (aka [...] "Roger"), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson – a Seven News anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites [...] "Chemotherapy", and a cover of the TV series theme [...] "Home And Away". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, [...] "Sorry About the Ruse", on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records? The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers Bad Religion, The Offspring, and Blink-182.|$|E

60|$|Very early {{they heard}} {{mass in the}} convent, and then rode along {{the bank of the}} river, with the downs sloping down on the other side, and the grand spire ever seeming as it were taller as they came nearer; while the sound of the bells grew upon them, for there was then a second tower beyond to hold the bells, whose {{reverberation}} would have been dangerous to the spire, and most sweet was their chime, the sound of which had indeed often reached Wilton in favourable winds; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a sad farewell to Grisell.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no good getting mad at a {{compliment}} like that. The English all do it. They're a crazy breed. When they don't know you they freeze up tighter'n the St. Lawrence. When they do, {{they go out}} like an ice-jam in April. Up till we prisoners left--four days--my Captain Mankeltow told me pretty much all about himself there was; his mother and sisters, and his bad brother that was a trooper in some Colonial corps, and how his father didn't get on with him, and--well, everything, as I've said. They're undomesticated, the British, compared with us. They talk about their own family affairs as if they belonged to someone else.

6000|$|Carley had {{not been}} able yet, during the several hours of their journey, to take any {{pleasure}} in the scenery or in her mount. For in the first place there was nothing to see but scrubby little gnarled cedars and drab-looking rocks; and in the second this Indian pony she rode had discovered she was not an adept horsewoman and had proceeded {{to take advantage of the}} fact. It did not help Carley's predicament to remember that Glenn had decidedly advised her against riding this particular mustang. To be sure, Flo had approved of Carley's choice, and Mr. Hutter, with a hearty laugh, had fallen in line: [...] "Shore. Let her ride one of the broncs, if she wants." [...] So this animal she bestrode must have been a bronc, for it did not take him long to elicit from Carley a muttered, [...] "I don't know what bronc means, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> this pony acts." ...|$|E

60|$|I loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family--why, {{they could}} hardly speak {{of him with}} patience. To this day I regret his loss, and wish I had him back; but they--it is {{different}} with them. He was a native, and came from Surat. Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace and Manuel's, and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters and dispositions. I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan. This latter's real name was intensely Indian. I could not quite {{get the hang of}} <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder. It was too long for handy use, anyway; so I reduced it.|$|R

50|$|The {{channel is}} clear, {{but a bit}} meandering. There is a large tide swing of about 9 ft feet. There are {{extensive}} mariculture clam beds and salt pans near the sea.

5000|$|The {{album was}} awarded 4 stars in an AllMusic review by Alex Henderson, who states [...] "Caracas was {{recorded}} in 1993, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> {{it could have been}} recorded 30 years earlier. Regardless, this CD is excellent... Is Caracas essential? Not quite, but it's still a highly rewarding album that will please die-hard soul-jazz enthusiasts".|$|E
5000|$|Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave a {{negative}} review, and {{compared it to}} Taylor Swift's [...] "You Belong with Me". [...] "I didn’t sit in when this was made or anything, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> it passed through so many levels of self-consciousness {{that most of the}} personality just got rubbed out of the mix at some point, leaving behind a flimsy song and a recycled production." ...|$|E

A word--it was inaudible <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> part of a woman's name--escaped him. He had the appearance, during those few seconds, of a man who looks through the present into a past world. It was all over before even they could appreciate the situation.

5000|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{praised the}} musical {{diversity}} of the album: [...] "More startling, however, is the confidence with which other tracks shift into unexpected musical territory. On paper, a rapper like Stormzy recording a lo-fi, electric piano-led, Stevie Wonderesque gospel track called '"Blinded By Your Grace, Pt 1" [...] sounds like a textbook case of an artist overstretching himself; in reality, it’s fantastic, and oddly moving.", concluding that [...] "It’s not a perfect debut - it’s slightly too long for one thing, {{and there are a}} couple of points where it sags - <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> an album teeming with original, daring ideas. More importantly, it sounds like the work of an artist with the confidence and the talent to pull those ideas off." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lord {{pushed the}} Hammond-Leslie sound through Marshall amplification, {{creating}} a growling, heavy, mechanical sound which allowed Lord {{to compete with}} Blackmore as a soloist, with an organ that sounded as prominent as the lead guitar. Said one reviewer, [...] "many have tried to imitate Lord's style, and all failed." [...] Said Lord himself, [...] "There's a way of playing a Hammond that's different. A lot of people {{make the mistake of}} thinking that you can play a Hammond with a piano technique. Well, you can, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> you are playing a Hammond with a piano technique. Really, you {{have to learn how to}} play an organ.

Sam Lansky of Idolator wrote that the song [...] "may not be a mainstream radio smash, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> the kind of thing that'll go over pretty well in the heartland (probably better than, say, [...] "Hole")." [...] Critic of Music wrote a positive review, giving it a B+ rating, saying [...] "It's a much stronger country effort than the cliché 'Don't Rush'".

[...] At Ani-Gamers, a reviewer known as [...] "Ink" [...] wrote that the series unduly [...] "romanticizes" [...] a bar, but praised its storytelling and staging techniques, the narration, its [...] "casual dialog and effective visuals", and its balance. He described it as [...] "a love letter to liquor as opposed to the consumption thereof," [...] while Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network (ANN) called it [...] "a delicious ode to mixology". Michael Toole, also for ANN, wrote that although it is [...] "pretty cheesy...there is something deeply, compulsively watchable about Bartender in spite of its plainness.
