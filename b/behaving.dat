5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, warning {{of their ability}} to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and <b>behaving</b> like bees.|$|E

It becomes apparent that an alien presence entered the ship during its flight, and Quatermass and his associates must prevent the alien from destroying the world.|$|E
5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets <b>behaving</b> in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men <b>behaving</b> oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E
40|$|Internal {{motivation}} to <b>behave</b> nonprejudiced leads to heightened control of stereotype activation. However, {{it is not}} clear whether internal {{motivation to}} <b>behave</b> nonprejudiced only reduces stereotype activation or whether individuals high internally motivated to <b>behave</b> nonprejudiced are also more successful in intentionally controlling already activated stereotypes. Two studies show that internal motivation to <b>behave</b> nonprejudiced when measured as well as when manipulated leads to more efficient control of activated stereotypes. This underlines the powerful potential of internal motivation to <b>behave</b> nonprejudiced to support the intentional control of previously activated stereotypes...|$|R

5000|$|Libertarian {{paternalism}} {{is similar}} to asymmetric paternalism, which refers to policies designed {{to help people who}} <b>behave</b> irrationally and so are not advancing their own interests, while interfering only minimally with people who <b>behave</b> rationally. [...] Such policies are also asymmetric {{in the sense that they}} should be acceptable both to those who believe that people <b>behave</b> rationally and to those who believe that people often <b>behave</b> irrationally.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that {{participants}} are not completely blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because {{the context of the}} judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were <b>behaving</b> logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in <b>behaving</b> animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate {{even in the absence of}} the synaptic input. In awake, <b>behaving</b> animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E
5|$|The Van Cortlandt Golf Course, {{which opened}} on July 6, 1895, with nine holes, is located {{centrally}} {{on the park}} grounds. Within a year, the course became very crowded and disorganized, with crowds <b>behaving</b> poorly. Rules were set in 1896, with golfers paying caddies 15 cents per round or 25 cents per two rounds. Only caddies with badges could be hired, and bicycles, baby strollers, horse-riding, and horse-drawn carriages were banned from the course.|$|E

5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be}} a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that which is expected, <b>behaving</b> as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like <b>behaving</b> as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was <b>behaving</b> badly while researchers used an fMRI to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E

5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, and the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of <b>behaving</b> in an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is upset}} after being {{identified}} {{in a magazine}} as an actor <b>behaving</b> normally, far from the insane persona {{he is trying to}} maintain. To re-establish his street cred, Tracy gets a dragon tattoo on his face, but is later identified as made of sharpie. At the same time, Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) is told that he is to receive a special gift from Liz Taylor (Rachel Dratch) as a response to an impression he did of the actress on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Liz Taylor sneaks into the 30 Rock studios and, upset over Josh's impersonation, brutally beats him with a fire extinguisher.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} Idaho {{and meet with}} Budahas' wife, Anita, who claims her husband {{exhibited}} erratic behavior before his disappearance. She takes them to a neighbor whose husband, also a test pilot, is <b>behaving</b> similarly. Scully makes an appointment with the base's director, Colonel Kissell, but he refuses to talk when they visit his home. They subsequently meet local reporter Paul Mossinger, who refers them to a local UFO-themed diner; there, they discuss UFOs with the owner, who believes she has witnessed several nearby.|$|E

5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from <b>behaving</b> animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E
5|$|At 19:00, {{two local}} men spotted Sabina whilst walking a dog on Christchurch Street, Fenton. One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The other man was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be <b>behaving</b> oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how {{she was trying to}} locate her hospitalised sister.|$|E
5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and <b>behaving</b> cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
50|$|Behavioralism studies how {{individuals}} <b>behave</b> in group positions realistically rather than {{how they should}} <b>behave.</b> For example, {{a study of the}} United States Congress might include a consideration of how members of Congress <b>behave</b> in their positions.
