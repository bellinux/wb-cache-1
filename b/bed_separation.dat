30|$|Source {{of water}} to the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> <b>Bed</b> <b>separation</b> {{provides}} potential reservoir space for underground water. Water supply determines the volume of water and hydrostatic pressure in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> Generally, the underground water in the strata above the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> is the direct water source, which quickly fills up the bed-separation void under the negative pressure, thus driving up the water pressure in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> up to the level in the upper strata (apparently, if the upper strata are insufficiently water abundant, the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> would not be filled up and bed-separation water pressure would not rise {{to that in the}} upper strata). In addition to direct water source, there would be indirect source of water (such as the Quaternary pore aquifer) that replenishes the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> through inter-stratum fissures or water-conductive structure.|$|E
30|$|The {{formation}} of bed-separation water hazards is closed related with geological and mining factors. From geological perspective, the lithological {{properties of the}} roof strata are the main constrains of the emplacement of the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> The slant angle of coal seam is the deciding factor of {{the shape of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> and the emplacement of the maximum bed-separation height. The water source to the bed-separation water {{will have an impact on}} the water volume and hydrostatic pressure in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> Among mining factors, when full-caving rooftop management is applied, the lifecycle of <b>bed</b> <b>separation,</b> from formation, development to maturity, is largely constrained by the cyclical rock pressure. Mining height is positively correlated to <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> height. The strike length and slope width of the mining working face will determine the lifespan of the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> Mining at a constant speed can slow down water accumulation in the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b>|$|E
30|$|Generally, bed separations {{developed}} in the caving zone and fissure zone closer to the goaf area do not require grouting and backfilling treatment. <b>Bed</b> <b>separation</b> at a great distance from the goaf area (such as the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> in the mid or {{upper part of the}} bending zone) contains less-threatening water log, making grouting and backfilling unnecessary (unless ground subsidence demands such treatment). For disastrous <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> (i.e., the <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> in {{the lower part of the}} bending zone, which is over the fissure zone), grouting and backfilling is imperative.|$|E
40|$|Two {{examples}} of en echelon mining-induced fractures seen in hard-rock mines provided {{a basis for}} inferring that fracture zones and <b>bedding</b> plane <b>separations</b> immediately surrounding mine openings are promoted by oblique shear into the openings. It is hypothesized that initial fractures or separations form {{at the corners of}} openings as a result of high stress and physical constraint on the rock's ability to deform elastically toward the opening. These conditions result in a locally preferred direction of shearing. The shearing, in turn, generates tensile stress that initiates a progression of systematically offset fractures approximately parallel to the direction of greatest compressive stress. The fractures or <b>bedding</b> <b>separations</b> create tabular rock layers that amplify shearing displacement through bending and dilation. Such shearing effectively reduces and redistributes the compressive stress, but significant dilation is an inevitable consequence. The combination of dilation and shearing and the progressive development of fracture zones have important implications with respect to ground support. The concept of mining-induced fractures forming as a result of shear is illustrated by two examples from coal mines. First, fractures seen at longwall faces probably result from shear associated with subsidence. The fracture zone that develops approximates or possibly defines the draw angle of subsidence. As the face advances, fractures extend downward along the lower edge of the fracture zone, while upper extensions of the fractures are pressed closed. Fracture zones in entry roofs provide a second practical example. Here, mining-induced fractures typically follow bedding planes. The shear zone model suggests that the first <b>bedding</b> <b>separations</b> develop near the edges of the roof and successive separations progress upward and toward the center. However, if the direction of greatest stress is inclined with respect to the roof, a fracture or <b>bedding</b> <b>separation</b> zone may propagate from one side only and also extend higher. Because coal ahead of the face provides some support against lateral shear deformation, <b>bedding</b> <b>separation</b> is inhibited near the face. Rock bolts installed close to the face ultimately become more strained and bent than bolts installed a few meters from the face, and bolts installed through the more remote part of a separation zone may ultimately experience the greatest tensile and bending strains. This model is supported by field data documenting progressive bolt failures that rapidly propagated downward across the roof during face advance...|$|R
30|$|The {{conventional}} {{theory of}} rock movement divided the deformed roof rock, the strata from the goaf area {{up to the}} ground surface, into three layers (i.e. the upper three zones): caving zone, water-conductive fissure zone, and bending zone. As mining technologies and theoretical researches developed, the theory of rock movement has been further refined with an addition of bed-separation zone to the upper three zones (Tan et al. 2010). Empirical experiences obtained from extensive field monitoring and observations from simulations and calculations {{have shown that the}} presence of thick-hard strata in the roof strata is the precondition for <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> to develop. In effect, <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> can only grow to the extent bound by the thick-hard strata, which is, therefore, named as the key strata (Qian et al. 1996). Researches in this regard provided the theoretical rationale for the identification of <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> and bed-separation water, as well as effective containment of bed-separation water hazard. Since the 1980 s, grouting has been the main preventive measure against bed-separation water hazard. It was first tested successfully {{in more than a dozen}} coal mines, such as Fushun Laohutai Coalmine of Liaoning Province and Datun Xuzhuang Coalmine of Jiangsu Province (Chen and Guo 2008; Xuan and Xu 2014; Xuan et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2016), and then promulgated nationally. Later on, new techniques were introduced to treat bed-separation water, such as diversion and interception. The toolkit to treat bed-separation water hazard are further completed in China (Xu et al. 2013; Tan et al. 2013; Xing et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Identifying the {{properties}} of overlying rocks in underground mining operations is important to ensure the appropriate roof support design is used to maintain stability of the mine entries. Recently J. H. Fletcher & Co. developed a monitoring and control system for roof bolters for the underground mining industry. The system records the drilling parameters used during roof bolt drilling and the information can {{provide insight into the}} physical properties of the roof strata. The parameters include thrust, rotational speed, torque and velocity and the measurements are collected every 0. 1 second during the operation. The drilling parameters were analyzed to determine the application of identifying the strength of rocks being drilled from the measurements. The data was converted into the specific energy of drilling which {{is a measure of the}} amount of energy required for removing a given unit of rock during a drilling operation. The laboratory studies completed to date indicate a fairly high correlation between the specific energy of drilling and the unconfined compressive strength of :he rocks that were drilled. Additionally, the drilling parameters were shown to be effective for identifying the presence of fractures or <b>bed</b> <b>separations</b> between rock layers. The thrust, torque and specific energy of drilling were all good indicators for identifying the fractures or separations. Regardless of the drilling parameters used during the drilling experiments, the location of the fractures were identified. In order to determine the application of the drilling parameters for identifying roof rock properties, two series of experiments were conducted. The first series of experiments used three "manufactured" roof layers that had various rock samples embedded in concrete blocks. The rock samples included three types of sandstone, marble, and argillite. Another concrete block was poured with foam inserts to simulate large <b>bedding</b> <b>separations</b> (2 to 8 -in). Two other manufactured blocks were constructed using high-strength concrete with cardboard layers embedded to simulate smaller fractures or <b>bedding</b> <b>separations.</b> The size of the cardboard layers varied from 1 / 8 - to 1 -in thick. One of the blocks had the cardboard layers embedded at an inclined angle to determine the effect of the orientation on the drilling parameters. A series of experiments was conducted with the rotational speed and the penetration rate held constant and the thrust and torque allowed to vary. The information collected from the experiments is used to determine the application of the drilling parameter measurements for identifying rock properties, fractures and <b>bedding</b> <b>separations...</b>|$|R
30|$|Major {{techniques}} {{to prevent and}} treat <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water hazards: (i) Interception. From at a long distance, grouting through directional branch drills to fully block off the water-conductive channels between the water source and the <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> (ii) Diversion.

30|$|Building on the {{understanding}} of the formation mechanism of bed separations, <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water, and the analysis of the influencing factors, the main technologies to treat <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water in China coal mines include: (1) cutting off source of water to bed separations (interception) and draining bed-separation water (diversion); (2) breaking the buffer zone; (3) grouting and backfilling the bed-separation void, etc.|$|E

30|$|Bed-separation {{water is}} one of the major water hazards in coal mines. Targeted {{researches}} on the preventive technologies are of paramount importance to safe mining. This article studied the restrictive effect of geological and mining factors, such as lithological properties of roof strata, coal seam inclination, water source to <b>bed</b> <b>separations,</b> roof management method, dimensions of mining working face, and mining progress, on the formation of bed-separation water hazard. The key techniques to prevent bed-separation water-related accidents include interception, diversion, destructing the buffer layer, grouting and backfilling, etc. The operation and efficiency of each technique are corroborated in field engineering cases. The results of this study will offer reference to countries with similar mining conditions in the researches on bed-separation water burst and hazard control in coal mines.|$|R
30|$|Mining {{activities}} {{disrupt the}} stress and strain balance in the roof rocks and drive them to slide downward. Under normal conditions, the roof rock is composed of rock strata with varying thicknesses and hardnesses. As mining proceeds, the strata move down at different speeds, creating a void called <b>bed</b> <b>separation.</b> In its definition, <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> is also expressed by the deflection difference of the two contiguous strata. The underground water accumulated in the bed-separation void is thus called bed-separation water (Gui et al. 2017). The consequences of bed-separation water accidents would range from production halt to geological calamities such as rock burst, further resulting in equipment destruction and human casualties. Therefore, the formation of <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> water and hazard control are now closely studied by Chinese mining experts.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of core-log analyses from the exploration boreholes, the analyses of face advance rates, and the results of downhole monitoring studies performed in gob gas ventholes for calculation of changes in hydraulic properties in the longwall overburden at a mine site in southwestern (SW) Pennsylvania section of Northern Appalachian Basin. In the ?rst part of the study, coal measure rocks in overburden strata were analyzed and the locations where possible fractures and <b>bedding</b> plane <b>separations</b> would occur were evaluated. In the second part, the hydraulic conductivities were computed by two different slug test analyses methods using the water level changes measured in gob gas ventholes as longwall face approached. Hydraulic conductivities were analyzed with respect to the changes in overburden depth, the locations of the borehole, and mine face advance rates. These data were used to interpret the potential productivities of the gob gas ventholes as a result of fracturing and changes in hydraulic conductivities. The general results showed that the probability of fracturing and <b>bedding</b> plane <b>separations</b> in the overburden increase between strong and weak rock interfaces. Also, the probability of <b>bedding</b> plane <b>separations</b> increases as the interface is close to the extracted coal seam. Evaluation of slug tests showed that the hydraulic conductivity developments in the boreholes and their potential production performances are affected by the underground strata and the roof materials. In situations where the roof material is stiff and thick, the development of high permeability fractures around the borehole will be less. Results also indicated that borehole location with respect to face position affects the fracturing time and permeability evolution as well. Greater overburden depths generally cause earlier fracturing as longwall face approaches, but eventually result in lower hydraulic conductivities and potentially less effective boreholes. Increasing mining rates also resulted in generally lower hydraulic conductivities in the overburden. The results of this study were intended to improve the interpretation of gob gas venthole performance and to provide better siting of these boreholes...|$|R

30|$|Overall, in {{the section}} of dry coal beneficiation, the most {{significant}} properties of coal that facilitate the separation process are density, shape, friction, electricity, and magnetite. According the different beneficiating mechanisms, dry coal beneficiation reported in recent literature are mainly classified into the following five categories: (I) air dense medium fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> with/without external force field, (II) fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>separation</b> based on the difference of settling velocity, (III) compound dry separation, (IV) triboelectrostatic separation and (V) magnetic separation. These five categories of technologies have their own advantages respectively in processing certain coal or yielding clean coal product with certain quality. Generally speaking, technologies belong to the categories (I), (IV) and (V) usually have high separation efficiency but high operational cost, which are suitable for producing high-quality clean coal. In contrast, technologies in categories (II) and (III) don’t need additional dense medium or power and usually have larger capacities and low processing cost, but low separation efficiency due to the original limitation of separation mechanism. These technologies are suitable for producing steam coal. Besides, the electrostatic separation technologies and the magnetic separation technologies have high requirements for coal properties and certain degree of dissociation, thus, the handling capacities are limited. Considering these limitation, {{these two types of}} beneficiation technologies are only used in very special purpose. In the following sections, the representative research works in terms of the aforementioned technologies {{in the last five years}} are reviewed in detail and finally, we discuss the prospects and the challenges of the development of dry coal beneficiation.|$|E
