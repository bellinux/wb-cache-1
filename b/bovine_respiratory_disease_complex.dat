The objectives {{of this study were}} to create plasmid DNA constructs encoding single or multiple N-glycosylation-site deletion BRSV fusion (F) proteins, and evaluate their expression in cell culture, and potential to induce anti-BRSV F antibody responses in BALB/ c mice. Four plasmid DNAs were constructed, each encoding 1 - 4 N-glycosylation-site deletions: Gly 4, Gly 2 / 4, Gly 1 / 2 / 4 and Gly 1 / 2 / 3 / 4. Each of the N-glycosylation-site deletion BRSV F proteins were expressed in COS- 7 cells following transfection with plasmid DNA. Inoculation of BALB/c mice with plasmid DNA, resulted in a significant anti-BRSV F IgG response to the wildtype (WT) F and glycosylation-site deletion protein Gly 2 / 4. Gly 2 / 4 elicited a higher antibody titer than the fully glycosylated WT F protein. Significant neutralizing antibody titers were detected following immunization with the Gly 2 / 4 plasmid DNA. These glycosylation-site deletion BRSV F proteins will be useful to characterize the effects of glycosylation on immunogenicity in the natural host, and may lead to a new approach for the generation of BRSV vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Histophilus somni is an {{economically}} important {{member of the}} <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> (BRD) <b>complex.</b> An H. somni infection {{has a number of}} clinical manifestations including septicemia, myocarditis, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, arthritis and infectious thromboembolic meningoencephalitis. The incidence of systemic disease has significantly increased over the past decade while <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> incidence has remained constant. Current vaccines based on decades old strains are less effective against the systemic form of disease. An understanding of the immune responses generated as well as the antigens expressed during infection is essential in producing effective vaccines. TonB-dependent proteins {{have been shown to be}} protective in other members of the Pastuerellaceae family. Therefore, I hypothesized that vaccination with H. somni TonB-dependent proteins would be protective against experimental infection and a good cellular immune response would be induced following immunization. The genes coding for the TonB-dependent receptor 1372, transferrin-binding protein 1 (Tbp 1) and transferrin binding protein 2 (Tbp 2) also known as TbpA and TbpB respectively, were cloned, expressed and protein products purified. Vaccine formulations containing all three proteins were tested in mice to determine the Th 1 /Th 2 response. These results showed that Tbp 2 induced an increase in the production of IFNγ, a cytokine of the cellular immune response. ELISAs and proliferation assays were used to evaluate whether experimentally infected cattle immunized with the three proteins generated both humoral and cellular immune responses. Results suggested that TonB-dependent receptor 1372 initiates both a proliferative response and a humoral response while Tbp 1 and Tbp 2 induce a cellular and humoral immune response, respectively, in cattle. This work provides a better understanding of the immune responses generated against H. somni infection and aids in the development of a vaccine capable of preventing both <b>respiratory</b> and systemic <b>disease...</b>|$|R

The syndrome, in a method preferred by the author, can be classified into four grades: Grade 1, subclinical disease;Grade 2, compensated clinical disease (at this stage, the inflammatriry reaction generated tends to lirait the impact of the disease on thi animal); Grade 3, noncompensated clinical disease (at this stage, the inflamniattxy reaction is excessive and must be controlled); and Grade 4, irrevertibk clinical disease (which threatens the animal's survival). The increase in frequency and economic impact of <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> <b>complex</b> can be correlated with the escalating industrialisation of cattle production. In intensive operations, commingling of animale from multiple sources, exposure to many organisme, stress and management practicgs are all factors that can lead to disease. 	- The predisposition of cattle, especially beef calves, to respiratory problems is related to their lack of functional pulmonary hardiness.

40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) is a {{cause of}} respiratory disease in cattle worldwide. It has an integral role in enzootic pneumonia in young dairy calves and summer pneumonia in nursing beef calves. Furthermore, bovine RSV infection can predispose calves to secondary bacterial infection by organisms such as Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni, resulting in <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> <b>complex,</b> the most prevalent cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} among feedlot cattle.
