25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. <b>But</b> <b>tell</b> them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, <b>but</b> <b>tell</b> a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
500|$|... "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. It is the opening track from their 1983 album War and was {{released}} as the album's third single on 11 March 1983 in Germany and the Netherlands. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies. One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters and bystanders. At the same time, the lyrics reject hate and revenge as a response, {{as noted in the}} line [...] "There's many lost, <b>but</b> <b>tell</b> me who has won." [...] Along with [...] "New Year's Day," [...] the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release.|$|E

500|$|After Minh {{had ordered}} the rebels to search the areas {{known to have been}} frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was {{informed}} by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being [...] "I don't know whether I will live or die and I don't care, <b>but</b> <b>tell</b> Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.|$|E

The argument that this information is not relevant or important for customers is quite simply ridiculous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{anthology}} as a [...] "flawless jewel of science fiction", Shaenon K. Garrity {{called it an}} emotional work which touched her deeply: [...] "Because of A, A Prime, I discovered that this art form could do more than I'd imagined—not just tell ambitious stories, which I already knew from reading Sandman and Bone and Watchmen, <b>but</b> <b>tell</b> them with passion, in lines drawn from nerve endings, using every weapon in the artist's arsenal to not just dazzle the mind, but stab straight to the heart." [...] Katherine Dacey also praised the [...] "intensely Romantic quality of all three stories" [...] and their artwork, particularly Hagio's representation of the characters' memories and emotional states with [...] "symbolically rich imagery" [...] and a [...] "dream-like quality". Dacey cited Hagio's [...] "unique ability to mix the sublime with the ridiculous", such as the characters' names and costumes and the sex-change drug.|$|E
