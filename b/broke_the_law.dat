5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by enabling French taxpayers {{to hide their}} assets in UBS-controlled offshore assets to avoid paying taxes. The bankers undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than keep the money in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E

50|$|The {{first chapter}} begins with Kean {{setting the stage}} of a {{historic}} jousting match between King Henri II of France and Gabriel Montgomery. After jousting with Montgomery once, Henri demanded that he go a second time (which <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of chivalry and good sport). It is during this second joust that Henri was whacked square in the face by his opponent's jousting pole.|$|R
50|$|Classical {{genetics}} {{consists of}} the techniques and methodologies of genetics that were in use {{before the advent of}} molecular biology. A key discovery of classical genetics in eukaryotes was genetic linkage. The observation that some genes do not segregate independently at meiosis <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of Mendelian inheritance, and provided science with a way to map characteristics to a location on the chromosomes. Linkage maps are still used today, especially in breeding for plant improvement.|$|R
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
25|$|In June 2010, a Swedish public {{prosecutor}} said an inquiry was being opened into {{whether any of}} Lundin's Swedish employees <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> The investigation was triggered by an 8 June 2010 report published by the European Coalition on Oil in the Sudan, an NGO based in the Netherlands.|$|E

5000|$|Kettling {{was used}} during the 24 November 2010 student protest in London and in various other {{locations}} around the country. Guardian blogger Dave Hill thought the kettling was in retrospect [...] "probably inevitable", after the protest two weeks before had led to damage at the Conservative party headquarters. In July 2011 three school children challenged the use of kettling of children at this protest. They sought a Judicial Review in the High Court, arguing it <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of <b>the</b> European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Children Act 2004, mainly the right to protest {{and the safety of}} children.|$|R

If Foley <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in Florida, and is convicted, he would be a sex offender, although the Constitutionality of such a law is probably in dispute in light of issues dealing with interstate commerce and the challenge in having one age of consent law for sex.|$|E
6000|$|And {{very much}} the same sad fate had {{happened}} to the Romans a little before St. Paul's time. They gave up their ancient respect for law; they <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws,</b> and ran into all kinds of violence, and riot, and filthy sin; and therefore God took away their freedom from them, because they were not fit for it, and delivered them over into the hand of one cruel tyrant after another; and perhaps the cruellest of them all was the man who was emperor of Rome in St. Paul's time. Therefore it was that St. Paul says to them: Love each other, and obey <b>the</b> <b>laws,</b> [...] "knowing <b>the</b> time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep." ...|$|R

He stole very {{important}} information that has fallen into the wrong hands so I think he should not be brought home without facing the music." [...] PolitiFact rated her statement that Snowden could have gotten the protections of a whistleblower as [...] "mostly false", noting that [...] "the protections that Clinton referenced {{do not seem to be}} as strong as she suggested, and most of the expert opinion suggests they would not apply to Snowden." ...|$|R

One of his most significant appointments was that of Holden Thorp as the tenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who resigned on September 17, 2012 {{in the wake of}} several athletics-related scandals.

500|$|China Daily, a CCP-controlled news {{organization}} since 1981, {{states in a}} 2008 article that although there were dynastic changes after Tibet was incorporated into the territory of Yuan dynasty's China in the 13th century, [...] "Tibet has remained {{under the jurisdiction of}} the central government of China." [...] It also states that the Ming dynasty [...] "inherited the right to rule Tibet" [...] from the Yuan dynasty, and repeats the claims in the Mingshi about the Ming establishing two itinerant high commands over Tibet. China Daily states that the Ming handled Tibet's civil administration, appointed all leading officials of these administrative organs, and punished Tibetans who <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> The party-controlled People's Daily, the state-controlled Xinhua News Agency, and the state-controlled national television network China Central Television posted the same article that China Daily had, the only difference being their headlines and some additional text.|$|E
500|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} in the United States was a social reform campaign from 1914 to around 1945 that aimed to increase the availability of contraception in the U.S. through education and legalization. [...] The movement began in 1914 {{when a group of}} political radicals in New York City, led by Emma Goldman, Mary Dennett, and Margaret Sanger, became concerned about the hardships that childbirth and self-induced abortions brought to low-income women. Sanger, in particular, simultaneously sought to connect birth control to the organized eugenics movement, [...] regularly appealing to the authority of eugenic scientists [...] Karl Pearson, Charles Davenport, and others in her Birth Control Review from the early 1920s [...] Such figures sought to prevent population segments they deemed genetically 'undesirable' from reproducing. While seeking legitimacy for the birth control movement partly through the approval of organized eugenics, Sanger and other activists also worked on the political front. Since contraception was considered to be obscene at the time, the activists targeted the Comstock laws, which prohibited distribution of any [...] "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" [...] materials through the mail. Hoping to provoke a favorable legal decision, Sanger deliberately <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by distributing The Woman Rebel, a newsletter containing a discussion of contraception. In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, but the clinic was immediately shut down by police, and Sanger was sentenced to 30 days in jail.|$|E

He may forgive them if he will, and count their deeds good service. What has that to do with this Christian's offence against me and mine? Born a Mankesman--bred and nursed in <b>the</b> island--he <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> under which he lived, and died for the breach of them, after the fair trial which they allowed.--Methinks, Margaret, we have enough of this peevish and foolish magistrate--I attend you to your apartment." ...|$|R

These demands existed in a context of a general social radicalisation under Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the last}} attack of Native Americans against {{settlers}} in Iowa. Historians have considered it a foreshadowing of the Sioux uprising in Minnesota in 1862. [...] The events worsened relations between the Sioux and settlers in the territory, with mistrust and fear higher on both sides. Whites reacted by attacking some innocent Sioux who were hunting near settlements. Because of competition over the lands, white settlers feared that the remaining free Indians would attack them, so they called for their removal by the US government. The Sioux resented {{the failure of the}} government to fulfill treaty obligations; they were starving due to inadequate rations and annuities at the reservations. By 1862, seeing thousands of children and elders die from starvation while whites <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> by seizing prime Sioux lands, the Sioux rebelled in what historians called the Sioux [...] "Uprising." ...|$|R

Because after his triumph he grew proud, and <b>broke</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of God and man. And one thing worst of all he did, which brought him to his grave with sorrow. For he went down (they say beneath the earth) with that bold Peirithoos his friend to help him to carry off Persephone, {{the queen of the}} world below. But Peirithoos was killed miserably, in the dark fire-kingdoms under ground; and Theseus was chained to a rock in {{everlasting}} pain.
