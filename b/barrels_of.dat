5|$|The first {{crude oil}} arrived at Phoenixville via the Big Inch on August 14, 1943, {{and the first}} refined product in the Little Big Inch arrived on March 2, 1944. The Big Inch carried up to 334,456 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil a day, the Little Big Inch 239,844 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gasoline; the lines were among the largest {{industrial}} consumers of electricity in the US, requiring 3.89 million kilowatt {{hours a day to}} pump the oil along the pipes.|$|E

5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> flour and 272 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> foodstuff were captured.|$|E
5|$|Most of Clarke's time in England {{was during}} the Interregnum, when rule {{of the country was}} under Parliament and Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector. Clarke's primary purpose there was to secure a {{strengthened}} charter for the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ensuring the religious liberties on which the colony had been founded, and Cromwell confirmed the validity of Rhode Island's 1643 patent. Clarke also assisted the colony in 1656 by sending home four <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> powder and eight <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> shot and bullets, and in 1657 he handled a letter from the colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris.|$|E
5|$|The Albion Brewery {{was first}} {{established}} at {{the eastern end of}} Whitechapel Road in 1808 by Richard Ivory, landlord of the Blind Beggar. In 1860, the brewery was rebuilt, producing an average of 133,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> beer a year. It closed in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> oil {{releases}} about 5.8 million BTU when burned, so that 5.8 MCF of gas (at {{the standard}} one thousand BTU per cubic foot) releases {{about the same}} energy as a <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> oil. Sometimes gas containing 5.8 million BTU {{is defined as a}} [...] "barrel of oil equivalent for energy calculation purposes. When describing reserves or production, however, {{the oil and gas industry}} more commonly uses the rounded number of 6 MCF of gas (or 6 million BTU in the natural gas) as equal to one <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> oil equivalent.|$|R

5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its role in protecting the Thames, the fort had various military uses during the 18th century. From 1716 onwards, the Board of Ordnance began {{to use it as}} a gunpowder depot; there were safety restrictions on moving gunpowder in and out of the London docks, so Tilbury was used instead. Two large magazines were built, able to hold 3,600 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> powder each, and the old blockhouse and other buildings were converted to act as further magazines. Eventually the fort could hold more than 19,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder. It was also used as a transit depot for soldiers and, after the Jacobite rising of 1745, as a prison to hold 268 Highlander prisoners of war. The Jacobite prisoners were kept in the gunpowder magazines and 45 died from typhus before they were sent on to London for trial.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this initial mishap, De Sotos first capture did not take long, as she and a bluejacket-crewed lugger took {{schooner}} Major Barbour off Isles Dernières, Louisiana on 28 January 1862.

On 8 February, the steamer caught the small schooner Star out of Bayou Lafourche, taking her four-man crew prisoner.|$|E

5|$|The frigate Thétis, {{stationed}} to {{the south}} of Brest at Lorient, was selected to carry supplies to Martinique and given a full complement of 330 men, 40 cannon and a new captain, Jacques Pinsum. Supplies were loaded, including over 1,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> flour and 106 soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Martinique. Secrecy was tight: to prevent the British discovering Thétis mission, even the local shore defences were not informed of the frigate's departure early on 10 November 1808.|$|E

5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Andrianjaka {{moved his}} capital from Ambohidrabiby to Ambohimanga upon {{ascending}} {{to the throne}} around 1610 or 1612. He was reportedly the first Merina leader to receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for guns and other firearms {{to aid in the}} pacification of rival principalities, obtaining 50 guns and three <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder to equip his army. He unified the principalities on what he later designated as the twelve sacred hills of Imerina at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka. These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when Andrianampoinimerina redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.|$|E
5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force {{his way past}} the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up the}} ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E
