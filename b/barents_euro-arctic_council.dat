40|$|Regional {{development}} in a knowledge-based economy to a higher degree than in a traditional industrial society requires co-operation between (i) industry and trade, (ii) knowledge centres such as universities, and (iii) government bodies on different levels. A knowledge-based economy thus involves new challenges for regional development. For peripheral regions at the outskirts of an integrated European economy, overcoming spatial disadvantages adds {{to the list of}} challenges for actors involved in regional development. Established theoretical wisdom, however, seem to have difficulties in providing guidance and advice how to achieve favourable conditions for a dynamic development of such regions. This has fostered an interest in ‘bench-learning', i. e. learning from regions that seem to ‘have made it' regardless of geographical disabilities. This article applies a Triple Helix perspective on the development of two Nordic regions: the Luleå region in Sweden and the Oulu region in Finland. The article discusses how the {{development in}} these two regions may be understood from a Triple Helix perspective.

Taking into account the Nordic countries’ involvement in Arctic affairs, the project includes a study on Nordic environmental activities in the region. For this purpose, the methodology is based on applying comparative analysis to the Nordic countries’ Arctic environmental activities. The sources {{used in the study}} include the Nordic countries’ Arctic strategies, chairmanship and cooperation programmes in the Arctic Council, the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> <b>Council</b> and the Nordic Council of Ministers as well as reports and assessments and other relevant documents. According to the results, the Nordic countries’ positions and activities on Arctic environmental issues agree mainly due to their environmental thinking, their connection with the Arctic region and solidarity on Arctic issues that can be achieved through the Nordic Council of Ministers. The Nordic countries comply with three prerequisites required to achieve environmental security in the Arctic region, which are climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution prevention and sustainable exploitation of natural resources, namely marine bioresources. Furthermore, the Nordic countries contribute to comprehensive security in the region, since mitigation activities related to Arctic climate change are necessary to underpin the stability in societal, economic, political and military sectors of security. On the other hand, the Nordic countries’ activities do not contribute to achieving a successful securitization of environmental threats in the Arctic, which means that the current environmental situation in the region is relatively stable, and therefore, there is time to take proper measures in order to prevent greater Arctic environmental problems and securitization thereof in the future...|$|E

40|$|The thesis will examine, broadly speaking, the {{external}} {{relations of the}} European Union (EU) with its Northern neighbours {{in the light of}} the development of a new policy dedicated to this purpose: the Northern Dimension. In the thesis it is argued that the Northern Dimension deviates significantly from previous policies that the EU has developed to deal with its neighbours due to a number of elements: the absence of a dedicated budget line, the involvement of "outsiders" in the implementation phase, e. g. the regional organisations like the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> <b>Council,</b> and the horizontal agenda based on tangible issues like environment threats, including nuclear wastes management, fight against organised crime and health issues. While analysing the content of the initiative, attention will be devoted to the political process that has led to the creation of the Northern Dimension. Particular emphasis will be attached to elements like the role of small member states in the definition of the foreign policy interests of the EU and the political dynamics characterising the relations among the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the EU Council, when it comes to shaping the relations with key neighbouring countries. In the final part of the work a comparison will drawn between the Northern Dimension and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP), the policy that the EU has set up to deal with its Southern neighbours. The most important element emerging from the comparative analysis reflects the claim that the development of a grand strategy and the allocation of significant resources, as the case of the EMP demonstrates, are not necessarily ingredients that lead to a successful policy towards the neighbouring areas. It will be demonstrated that the Northern Dimension has been comparatively more successful and effective than the EMP, hanks to the political perseverance of the Nordic (EU) member states, the active participation of the regional organisations and the focus on a "low-politics" well-prioritised political agenda...|$|E
40|$|This thesis will {{inquire into}} the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> <b>Council</b> (BEAC) from a constructivist viewpoint. The title is {{inspired}} by Alexander Wendt s famous phrasing Anarchy is what states make of it and is reframed to the Barents cooperation is what states make of it. The aim is to show how identities and common norms embedded in the social culture of the Barents cooperation affect actors interests and their behavior. The point of departure is that self-image and identity will shape norms and states interests, based on a notion that they operate in a social context of international relations. In my thesis, I will study how states view their own role in this cooperation, how they perceive {{each other and the}} region and which norms are brought to the fore. I will also try to find out which norms are shared and how they are internalized. The hypothesis {{is that there is a}} certain degree of identification by members of the Barents cooperation with the region and that it plays a significant role in their self-image. There should also exist some shared norms and values, which members of the group consider legitimate and are willing to project in cooperation with their counterparts. The theoretical framework of the current study is based on constructivism in IR, as presented mainly by Onuf and Wendt, as well as regime studies. Constructivism plays a part in explaining the role of identity and norms in the Barents cooperation; the theory of international regimes is used to put cooperation in its present context and to explain for the process of learning, knowledge sharing and norms internalization. The methodological basis of the study is the Qualitative Content Analysis and the Theory of Speech Acts. Applying these methods I will analyze BEAC documents, as well as speeches of official representatives of Norway, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and the EU. Availability of speeches delivered by politicians in relation to the involvement of their countries in the Barents cooperation at different times will allow making a comparison of how interests and identities of actors have changed for 20 years of cooperation. The thesis does not intend to cover the actual implementation of different Barents policies and give a positivist truth on whether this cooperation is effective or not, but it rather makes an attempt to look at how ideas matter in international politics and thus to support the theory of constructivism in IR by applying it to a particular example of international relations cooperation in the BEAC...|$|E
40|$|Wydział Nauk Politycznych i DziennikarstwaCross-border and {{regional}} {{cooperation in the}} Baltic Sea area in the years 1989 - 2007. Political changes, accomplished after the year 1989 in the Baltic Sea area, allowed to raise relationship between countries, regions and enabled easier contact between people living in that area. The collapse of artificial partitions existing after the Second World War in the Baltic Europe became the crucial factor {{in the development of}} multilateral connection between governments, organizations, regions and all types of local governments and no governments` organizations in the 1990 s. Nowadays the term of the hibernation of the region is a part of history and a warning in creating partnership between countries which now belong to the European Union and Russia. The subject is not the accidental one. The Baltic Sea area its potential on the field of cooperation and development in the extended European Union and relationships between European Union and Russia are the main author’s interests. The foundation of this is the analysis of the regional partnership on the field of social, economical and political cooperation. Looking back at the history of the region, understanding the international relationship and partnership and the cooperation between the European Union and Russia can allow us to find the way the Baltic Europe is getting at. You can also find here the analysis of the relationship, way of development and vision of the future connections between the European Union and Russia. The richness of different forms of cooperation between government and no government’s organizations in the Baltic Sea region, as nowhere else in Europe, should be consolidated by the considered schedule of social, economical and political development. The answer for this postulate, in my opinion, is the strategy of “Northern Dimension” Which creates a bridge for cooperation in the region between the countries which belong to the European Union and those which are not able to join it in the nearest future, for instance, Russia. The Baltic Europe has at its disposal a huge potential. Nowadays the Baltic Sea is the “internal sea” of the European Union. We can estimate that in the nearest decade this area will become one of the fastest developing regions all over the world. It is worth emphasizing this region has highly developing economy, stable and well-educated society and its countries have at their disposal rich natural resources, especially energetic ones. In this area there are magnificent conditions for investment and business development. Therefore, the Baltic Sea region consolidates all these elements in its possibility of cooperation. The Baltic partnership is a cooperation of countries, regions and international {{and regional}} organizations. Besides Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, which are the European Union members, there is Norway in the region as an economic partner of the European Union in the project of the European Economic Area. Iceland is another country being outside the Baltic Sea Region but it has its influence on international cooperation development in this area. The whole cooperation is complemented by Russia, which is an important partner for the countries of the region and the whole European Union. Organizations are also an important element of the Baltic cooperation. The leading role in the region is performed by Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) – the main forum of the Baltic countries` cooperation. Therefore, some other government organizations have their influence on the Baltic cooperation, for instance, Nordic Council of Minister (NCM), <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> <b>Council</b> (BEAC), Arctic Council. In the region there are some subregional organizations, which act dynamically, for instance, Baltic Sea States` Sub-regional Cooperation (BSSSC), Union of the Baltic Cities (UBC) and Helsinki Commission (HELCOM). Euroregions like Pomerania, Baltic, Niemen, perform a very important role in Baltic cooperation building and also some other cross-border cooperation Baltic organizations. The Baltic Sea Region, despite its complicated past, is able to show its unity and identity. A lot of possibilities are also given by the rich net of decentralized organizations and institutions which complement and support official government structures and strong political involvement of the European Union noticeable in European Commission membership in Council of the Baltic Sea States. Russia – European Union partnership, which is connected with this region, should be seen as an opportunity to consolidate our multilateral relations...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{research}} is the analysis of migration processes in the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> region (BEAR). The main focus is the balance of interests between ethnic immigrants and citizens of the accepting country as well as formation and dynamics of ethno-social structure. The research of the migration problems is done through socio-cultural focus. It implies that a research of nation’s constant norms, values and traditions creates a scientific basis for creation of poly-cultural society and it’s stable structure. The {{novelty of the work}} is the regional aspect. The transformational trends of modern society and specifics of the BEAR are taken into account and studied on the example of the Murmansk region which is characterized as a region of heavy migration. The study describes migration processes intertwined with the realities of the multi-cultural society in BEAR (with the example of Murmansk region). The factors of upkeep of ba-lanced inter-ethnic relationship and formation of poly-cultural society are highlighted. The role of each ethnic group and national diasporas within ethno-social processes is highlighted.   Authors suggest that the success of socio-cultural adaptation of immigrants is not only due to knowledge of language and culture of the accepting society, but also is due to traditions and trends of poly-culture of the accepting nation. The results of the study may be used for managing solutions in stabilizing of ethno-cultural processes within BEAR but also {{within the framework of the}} study courses, such as «Ethno-sociology» or «Sociology of migration». </p...|$|R
40|$|Current {{changes in}} the {{political}} landscape of Northern Europe are characteristic of post-Cold War international relations as a whole. During this {{short period of time}} globalisation, localisation and regionalisation have challenged previously unproblematic state sovereignty. The blurring of state-region interface in post-Soviet Russia has been affected by these processes but has followed the logic of its own. The regionalisation of post-Soviet space constitutes tendencies of disintegration and integration, and therefore, it is convenient to count this process as reshapement. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the process of regional reshapement in Northwest Russia. In the regional reshapement, the functional and territorial fragmentation is combined with the functional and, to some extent, territorial re-integration. These processes, and especially territorial integration, require reconstruction of inter-regional connections. Owing to the previous policy to construct transport routes in vertical rather than horizontal direction, the horizontal connections within and between the regions are incomplete or totally lacking. Therefore, construction of new inter-regional connections is considered essential for establishment and improvement of the regional co-operation. My question formulation and methodical application base on the Searlean argumentation for constructivist theory of social reality. Accordingly, regions, ‘corridors’ or ‘transport areas’ do not exist independently of human intentionality. The examination of functions assigned to the development of horizontal transport connections in different contexts provides a key to study the reshaping of territorial and functional space and the purposive orders in-making. It may be argued that from the regional viewpoint the improvement of the horizontal connections is an instrument to enhance regional independence from the centre, and at the same time provide for integration of previously excluded regional economies. In Northwest Russia, the search for ‘direct connections’ to the adjacent regions, is accompanied with an aim to improve connections to Europe and the world markets. In the framework of the Barents region, the development of transport connections is aimed at the integration of western and eastern parts of the region. Although the subject of co-operation - the construction of horizontal connections - does not change, the creation of a new concept ‘the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> Transport Area’ provides for maintaining rather than reconstruction of existing structures. Since the accession of Finland and Sweden to the European Union, the Union acquired a new northern dimension and the integration of northern transport networks became a part of the EU enlargement policies. Whether approached from the regional or state perspective the questions is about management of the change that allows for the construction of horizontal spaces in the East-West direction. 1.

40|$|The project Barents Protected Area Network (BPAN) {{produced}} {{an overview of}} the characteristics and representativeness of the protected area network in the Barents Region in 2011 - 2014. A second phase was launched in 2015, and included studies on high conservation value forests (HCVFs) and coastal areas. The main aim of the project on forests was to produce new information on the distribution and protection status of HCVFs in a study area including the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> regions of northwest Russia, Finland and Sweden. Furthermore, the aim of the project was to deliver updates on the protected area coverage in the study area, and to relate the progress of establishing protected areas to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and especially Target 11. In this study, a project-specific concept of high conservation value forests was applied in order to identify, describe and visualize the distribution of forests that are especially important for biodiversity. In Sweden and Finland, HCVFs were identified on the basis of existing data gained in field inventories. Remote sensing data, data from national forest inventories as well as studies of aerial photographs provided additional information. In northwest Russia, due to the vast areas covered by forests, mainly remote sensing was used. Data on land cover, and in particular regarding HCVFs and protected areas, was analyzed and displayed on maps using geographical information systems. A total of close to 325 000 km² were identified as verified or potential HCVFs. In Sweden, HCVFs covered about one fourth of the forested area of the study area, whereas the share was a bit higher in Finland (29 %) and considerably higher in Russia (37 %). The biggest share of HCVFs was detected in spruce-dominated coniferous forests; about 60 % of these forests were classified as HCVFs. By the end of 2015, the protected areas covered almost 200 000 km² or 12, 7 % of the study area. The protected area coverage as compared to the situation two years earlier has improved, but in this rather short period of time the progress has naturally been rather modest. The biggest change has occurred in Russia. In most of the administrative regions of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> Region the objective of protecting 17 % of terrestrial areas and inland waters by 2020 - according to the Aichi Target 11 - has not yet been reached. A more thorough analysis of the protection level of the main types of forests of the Barents Region was carried out. The forests were divided into coniferous forests (pine-dominated coniferous forests on mineral land, pine-dominated coniferous forests on peatland, spruce-dominated forests), mixed forests and deciduous forests. Comprehensive maps and overviews of these forests were produced, presenting the distribution, total area, the proportional share of these types of forests as well as the level of protection. Statistics were produced for the whole study area, by country and region. In the whole Barents Region (excluding Norway) 11, 7 % of the forests were protected by the end of 2015. The project results and especially the data on high conservation value forests could be used {{in the development of the}} protected area systems of the region. The project has also highlighted the need to enhance the ecological connectivity between protected areas, and the data compiled by the project could provide a starting point for further development of connectivity analyses on different geographical scales. Furthermore, the project results could be used in order to facilitate an increased stakeholder dialogue regarding sustainable management of forest resources in the Barents Region...|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{results of}} a {{regional}} evaluation on protected areas in the Barents Region are presented. The evaluation was made using the Programme of Work on Protected Areas (PoWPA) of the Convention on Biological Diversity as a framework. The Convention on Biological Diversity aims to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020. The work was done {{as a part of}} the Barents Protected Area Network (BPAN) project by national and regional authorities, scientific institutes and nature conservation nongovernmental organisations from Norway, Sweden, Finland and northwest Russia. The aim of the project is to promote the establishment of a representative protected area network in the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> Region to conserve biodiversity of boreal and arctic nature, particularly forests and wetlands. The PoWPA national reporting framework was modified and simplified to make it more suitable to be used as a tool for analysis of the protected area network in the Barents Region. It was used especially to see in which PoWPA goals and targets the Barents Region as a whole had made progress, and in which there was need for further work, and thus make recommendations for future actions in the Region. This enabled also the individual regions to assess in which goals and targets their region had made progress and in which there was need for further development. The reporting framework also provided a common language for interregional discussions and comparisons. A network of existing and planned protected areas is under development in the Barents Region. New protected areas have been established in recent years. However, strong efforts are still needed for strengthening the network of protected areas in order to reach the internationally agreed Aichi Biodiversity Targets...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the characteristics and representativeness of the protected area network in the Barents Region based on a large amount of GIS data. The report evaluates {{the current state of the}} protected area network in comparison with the global Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity that aim to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2020 (2010, Nagoya, Japan). Target 11 states that by 2020 at least 17 % of terrestrial and inland water areas are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas. This work was done as a part of the Barents Protected Area Network (BPAN) project by national and regional authorities, scientific institutes and nature conservation non-governmental organizations from Norway, Sweden, Finland and northwest Russia. The aim of the BPAN project is to promote the establishment of a representative protected area network in the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> Region to conserve biodiversity of boreal and Arctic nature, particularly forests and wetlands. This report provides for the first time unified and harmonized information on protected areas across national and regional borders covering 13 administrative regions in the four countries, providing a common language to discuss different kinds of protected areas. The information is presented in comprehensive forms as thematic maps, tables and figures. This information is now available to be utilized in nature conservation planning in each participating country, taking into account the trans-boundary connectivity of protected areas. A network of existing and planned protected areas is under constant development in the Barents Region. In March 2013, protected areas covered 13, 2 % (231 600 km 2) of the Barents Region, and national and regional nature conservation plans included establishing a further 59 400 km 2 as protected areas, increasing the future level of protection to cover 16, 6 % of the terrestrial area. In developing protected area networks, the representativeness of forests and wetlands and the connectivity of the protected areas need special emphasis...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the problem}} of co-aligning corporate strategy and public policy for effective environmental governance. A case study of the mining industry in the Russian Kola Peninsula shows how institutional arrangements (including public policies) affect the environmental performance of industrial organizations. The analysis emphasizes the motivations that drive people's decisions {{and how they are}} affected by culture and formal institutions {{both inside and outside the}} domain of public policy. It bridges management and governance studies with an added focus on engineering approaches to sustainability. In substantial terms, the dissertation has a strong focus on "complex utilization", which has been a common environmental and natural resource strategy in Russia since the 1930 s. In an important respect, complex utilization both antedates and closely resembles industrial ecology that has been developed in the West. This suggests that a lack of technical knowledge was not the principal cause of the well-known environmental problems that existed in the Soviet Union. On the contrary, the potential benefits of complex utilization were not realized because Soviet political and economic institutions provided weak incentives for pollution control and efficient resource use. The central theoretical effort of this dissertation is to show how effective environmental governance is contingent upon emergent strategy and policy processes. Both corporate environmental strategy and public environmental policy depend on power relations and network building among a variety of actors in the society. The case study yields three different emergent processes: political embedding of scientific concepts, cultural contextualization of indicators, and legitimacy in stakeholder salience. The dissertation also delivers policy recommendations pertaining to the future development of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Euro-Arctic</b> region. This future depends both on the level of political centralization and on the future development of the oil and gas industry in the region. On one hand, it is possible that the mining industry will continue on the same path as it has done throughout the 2000 s. It will continue to develop its environmental strategy primarily on the basis of signals from the international market and a few dominant stakeholder groups. On the other hand, it is possible that complex utilization will be strengthened as an environmental strategy in the region. The two future scenarios allow for case specific recommendations for indicators and environmental co-operation...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the Russian-Norwegian {{borderland}} and its development in the 1990 s and early twenty-first century. In 1991, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, the border was opened for communication in both ways, and since then its meaning has undergone significant changes that have reshaped the whole territory. My argument is that there are nowadays a considerable number of people in the borderland whose “own” territory is not limited any more by the state border, but includes both Russian and Norwegian territories as parts of a unified personal space, which is neither Russia, nor Norway to the full extent. Practical, operative space has expanded for the local people who actively use border-related resources in their everyday life. Local identity has changed, and the broadening of operative space has led to the formation of new life strategies and social mobility in the region. The idea of a unified crossborder space is now implemented both on the individual level, as a result of extensive cross-border contacts, and on the level of political and administrative decisions and official discourses. Furthermore, political and cultural elites of the region are actively constructing the concept of the <b>Euro-Arctic</b> <b>Barents</b> Region as an identity region...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Euro-Arctic</b> <b>Barents</b> Region {{includes}} Lapland County (Finland), Nordland, Troms and Finnmark Counties (Norway), the Norrbotten County (Sweden) and Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Counties and the Republic of Karelia (Russia). The three Nordic {{countries and}} Russian Kola carried out new national lake surveys {{in the fall}} of the 1995. Because of the special interest in the local resources in the Barents area, the Barents Secretariat has supported a project which evaluates the chemical properties of the lakes located within the Barents region in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russian Kola. In general, the lakes of the Barents region of the Nordic countries are less acid than the lake populations in the countries as a whole. The most acid lakes are found in Russian Kola, where also the organic carbon content is highest. The nitrate concentrations are generally lower in the Barents region than in the countries as a whole. This is in good agreement with the low N depositions in the Barents region. The critical loads of acidity in the Barents region are highest in Norway, while they are largely at similar levels in the other three areas. For Norway, the critical loads in the Barents region are substantially higher than for the whole country, because the most sensitive areas are located in southern Norway. For Finland and Sweden the opposite is the case. The critical loads are exceeded in the Barents region, the highest percentage are found in Russian Kola (14 %) and Norway (12 %), while Sweden shows the lowest percentage (3 %). The data from the lake monitoring programs in the Nordic countries and Russian Kola show that the lakes in the area give a rapid response to reduced sulphur depositions. The planned reconstruction of "Pechenganikel" smelter will give a significant reduction in emissions of sulphur and heavy metals resulting in reduced adverse effects on the ecosystems in the area. It is important to continue environmental research and monitoring in the border areas. Such a programme is needed in order to study the reversibility of acidification and to what extent the actions will be sufficient. The Barents Secretaria...|$|R
