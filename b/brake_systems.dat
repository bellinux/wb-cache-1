40|$|Air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other <b>brake</b> <b>system.</b> The practical performance of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory.

However, the dynamic mathematic model of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of air <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> characteristics, <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance and <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters that influence brake pedal force / displacement characteristics as ‘felt’ by the driver in a passenger car. It includes detailed studies of individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the brake booster reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance and to design a <b>system</b> with better <b>brake</b> pedal ‘feel’. Each of the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> component design parameters was validated to ensure that the <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> performance was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of brake booster air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> engineers to design a <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> with improved pedal ‘feel’. The simulation model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> performance at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R

25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (brake drum) to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|E
25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional <b>brake</b> <b>systems.</b> The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to air <b>brake</b> <b>systems,</b> all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Which if {{there would have been a}} two-man crew the crew would have been able to perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the hand brakes will hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air brake hoses, charging up the brake system, setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|E
