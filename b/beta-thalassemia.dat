Although some patients can be clinically asymptomatic, there are patients who exhibit severe anemia. The total annual incidence of symptomatic individuals is estimated at 1 in 100, 000 throughout the world [1]. Patients suffering from beta thalassemia often manifest severe anemia, poor growth, and skeletal abnormalities during infancy. Affected children will require regular, lifelong blood transfusions. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell (bone marrow) transplant-ation can be a curative treatment, but graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) can develop as a serious complication following bone marrow transplantation. GVHD is not an uncommon complication following bone marrow transplant.

25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a balanced translocation). PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, <b>Beta-thalassemia,</b> sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The aging {{red blood}} cell {{undergoes}} changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, {{red blood cell}} programmed cell death. This process normally occurs {{at the same rate}} of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased {{in a wide variety of}} diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, <b>beta-thalassemia,</b> glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, <b>beta-thalassemia,</b> sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic villus sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Beta-thalassemias</b> {{are caused}} by more than 200 {{mutations}} of the β-globin gene, leading to low or absent production of adult hemoglobin. Achievements have been made with innovative therapeutic strategies for β-thalassemias, based on research conducted at the levels of gene structure, transcription, mRNA processing and protein synthesis. AREAS COVERED: The objective of this review is to describe the development of therapeutic strategies employing viral and non-viral DNA-based approaches for treatment of β-thalassemia. EXPERT OPINION: Modification of β-globin gene expression in β-thalassemia cells has been achieved by gene therapy, correction of the mutated β-globin gene and RNA repair. In addition, cellular therapy has been proposed for β-thalassemia, including reprogramming of somatic cells to generate {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} to be genetically corrected. Based on the concept that increased production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is beneficial in β-thalassemia, DNA-based approaches to increase HbF production have been optimized, including treatment of target cells with lentiviral vectors carrying γ-globin genes. Finally, DNA-based targeting of α-globin gene expression has been applied to reduce the excess of α-globin production by β-thalassemia cells, one of the major causes of the clinical phenotype...|$|R
40|$|<b>Beta-thalassemias</b> are a {{group of}} {{hereditary}} blood disorders characterized by anomalies in the synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin resulting in variable phenotypes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. The total annual incidence of symptomatic individuals is estimated at 1 in 100, 000 throughout the world and 1 in 10, 000 people in the European Union. Three main forms have been described: thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia minor. Individuals with thalassemia major usually present within {{the first two years}} of life with severe anemia, requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Findings in untreated or poorly transfused individuals with thalassemia major, as seen in some developing countries, are growth retardation, pallor, jaundice, poor musculature, hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, development of masses from extramedullary hematopoiesis, and skeletal changes that result from expansion of the bone marrow. Regular transfusion therapy leads to iron overloadrelated complications including endocrine complication (growth retardation, failure of sexual maturation, diabetes mellitus, and insufficiency of the parathyroid, thyroid, pituitary, and less commonly, adrenal glands), dilated myocardiopathy, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis). Patients with thalassemia intermedia present later in life with moderate anemia and do not require regular transfusions.

40|$|Effective {{gene therapy}} {{constructs}} based on retrovirus or adeno-associated virus vectors will require regulatory elements that direct expression of genes transduced at single copy. Most beta-globin constructs designed for therapy of <b>beta-thalassemias</b> are {{regulated by the}} 5 'HS 2 component of the locus control region (LCR). Here we show that a human beta-globin gene flanked by two small 5 'HS 2 core elements or flanked by a 5 'HS 3 (footprints 1 - 3) core and a 5 'HS 2 core are not reproducibly expressed in single copy transgenic mice. In addition, low copy transgene concatamers that contain only dimer 5 'HS 2 cores fail to express, whereas those that contain monomer 5 'HS 2 cores express at 14 % per copy. These data suggest that spacing between HS cores is crucial for LCR activity. We therefore constructed a novel 3. 0 kb LCR cassette in which the 5 'HS 2, 5 'HS 3 and 5 'HS 4 cores are each separated by approximately 700 bp. When linked to the 815 bp beta-globin promoter this LCR directs 45 % levels of expression from four independent single copy transgenes. However, the 3. 0 kb LCR linked to the 265 bp promoter expresses variable levels, averaging 18 %, from three single copy transgenes. Our findings suggest that sequences in the distal promoter {{play a role in}} single copy transgene activation and that larger LCR and promoter elements are most suitable for gene therapy applications...|$|R

Claiming over 1 million deaths worldwide every year, malaria 2 ̆ 7 s wide and severe effects on the human condition are undeniably strong. However, studies on populations existing in malaria endemic areas have revealed numerous biological adaptations that confer resistance against the disease. Major forms of genetic resistance to malaria are seen through variants involved in sickle cell disease, Duffy blood antigens, glycophorins, blood type groupings, and glucose- 6 -dehydrogenase deficiency. Of these the best studied are the genetic variants in the HBB gene, which is responsible for the construction of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Variants of the HBB gene include HbS, HbC, HbE, and variants involved in <b>beta-thalassemias,</b> which are present at varying frequencies in different areas of the world in response to the pressure of malarial disease. African populations in particular are of great interest due to their greater genetic diversity and the high rates of malarial diseases reported in African countries. As such, sequencing the genotypes of multiple African populations would give a greater understanding to the frequencies of the two major HBB variants present in Africa, HbS and HbC. Furthermore, given the strong selective pressure an infectious disease such as malaria would place on populations in malaria-endemic regions, it is possible that multiple variants may have evolved in these populations in attempt to combat the disease. By sequencing the HBB gene and its corresponding upstream region in 260 individuals from 15 different African populations, the frequencies of the HbS and HbC SNPs have been determined...|$|R
40|$|The <b>beta-thalassemias</b> and {{sickle cell}} anemia are severe {{congenital}} anemias {{for which there is}} presently no curative therapy other than allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. This therapeutic option, however, is not available to most patients {{due to the lack of}} an HLA-matched bone marrow donor. Emerging modalities based on cell engineering offer new prospects for potentially curative approaches that are applicable to more patients. The first is based on the transfer of a regulated globin gene in autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This strategy, simple in principle, raises major challenges in terms of controlling transgene expression, which ideally should be erythroid-specific, differentiation and stage-restricted, elevated, position-independent, and sustained over time. Following the original report by May et al., several groups have reported that lentiviral vectors encoding slightly different combinations of proximal and distal transcriptional control elements of the normal human ss-globin gene permit lineage-specific and elevated ss-globin expression in vivo, resulting in therapeutic hemoglobin production and correction of anemia in ss-thalassemic mice. Clinical studies utilizing the TNS. 3 vector are likely to be initiated in the US in 2009. While the addition of the wild-type ss-globin gene is naturally suited for treating ss-thalassemia, several alternatives have been proposed for the treatment of sickle cell disease, using either gamma- or mutant ss-globin gene addition, trans-splicing or RNA interference. The recent discovery that adult somatic cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells from which HSCs can be derived, provides yet another venue for developing stem cell engineering using either lentiviral vectors or homologous recombination techniques. Altogether, these recent advances bode well for the advent of curative stem cell-based therapies. ...|$|R

Three main forms have been described: thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia minor. In each population only a few (~ 6) common mutations in the -globin {{have been found to}} be responsible for -thalassemia, which indicate population differences. In Saudi Arabia - thalassemia occurs in high frequency in some regions and premarital screening has been implemented for this disorder. No comprehensive mutational screening for the –globin gene locus have been carried so far in Saudi Arabia. This study was designed with the objective to sequence the -globin gene in -thalassemia patients and to investigate the genotype phenotype correlation. 110 -thalassemia patients were enrolled in the study and hematological and biochemical data were recorded, DNA was extracted and a 3. 8 Kb fragment of the -globin gene was sequenced. The -globin gene cluster at chromosome 11 was subjected to haplotype analysis using different restriction endonucleases in some of these patients. Direct sequencing of the -globin gene identified a total of 8 previously reported point mutations and one novel small deletion in 39 % of the patients. -thalassemia major patients were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for the mutations, while - thalassemia minor patients were heterozygous for these mutations. In addition 53 variants were identified in the cohort of patients. Haplotype analysis revealed 7 novel haplotypes and demonstrated that Hap 1, Hap 11 and Hap 4 are the most prevalent haplotypes in these patients.
