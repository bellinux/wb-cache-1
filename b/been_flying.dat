5|$|Captain Walter Lux, 53, had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> the DC-10 {{since its}} {{introduction}} eight years earlier. He had logged around 22,000 flying hours, of which about 3,000 {{were in a}} DC-10. He was also qualified to pilot 17 other aircraft, including the DC-6, DC-7, and Boeing 727. First Officer James Dillard, 49, and Flight Engineer Alfred Udovich, 56, were also highly experienced: 9,275 hours and 15,000 hours respectively, and between them they had 1,830 hours flying experience in the DC-10.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{development}} of the Mk. I to III, various units had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> the systems in an effort to develop suitable interception techniques. Very early on it was decided to dispense with the full reporting chain of the Dowding system and have the radar operators at the Chain Home (CH) sites talk to the fighters directly, greatly reducing delays. This improved matters, and on an increasing number of occasions aircraft received direction from the CH stations towards real targets.|$|E
5|$|Nos. 610, 615 and 32 Squadrons were {{guarding}} the air space near Biggin Hill. Operating at about 25,000 feet {{they were waiting}} for the high-altitude force to reach the area. Unfortunately, the German escort fighters had climbed much higher and they were taken by surprise. JG 3's Bf 109s had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> extended cover for the 12 Ju 88s and 27 Do 17s of KG 76. They spotted No. 615 below them and bounced the RAF fighters. Oberleutnant Lothar Keller and Leutnants Helmut Meckel and Helmut Landry each destroyed a Hurricane. While 615 had taken grievous losses, it had served an important purpose by keeping the escorting German fighters busy. While they engaged JG 3, Squadron Leader Michael Crossley led No. 32 Squadron against I. and III./KG 76 bombers without having to worry about enemy fighter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, but poor weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored to intercept these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it crashing into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Ireland declared neutrality. There were a total of 56 Irish ships at {{the outbreak}} of World War II; 15 more were purchased or leased in the conflict, and 16 were lost. Up to then most Irish-registered ships had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> the red ensign of the United Kingdom Merchant Navy. All were required by UK law to fly the Red Ensign, but some, such as the Wexford Steamship Company ships, had always travelled under the tricolour. With {{the outbreak of}} hostilities, choices were forced. The Irish government ordered all Irish ships to fly the tricolour. Some British ships were on the Irish register, such as the whalers which were Scottish-owned (Christian Salvesen Shipping) but Irish-registered in order {{to take advantage of the}} Irish whale quota. The six whale catchers and the two factory ships were pressed into British naval service, after their owners transferred them to the British registry. Some ships which could be described as British also choose the Tricolour. Kerrymore, which was registered as belonging to R McGowan of Tralee, was actually owned by Kelly Colliers of Belfast. Most of the crew had addresses in loyalist areas of Belfast. For six years they sailed under the tricolour.|$|E
50|$|El Oro {{entered the}} {{approach}} from the southwest, passing slightly {{west of the}} NDB, as opposed to directly over it. The pilot began the turn correctly, but <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> too fast; the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> at 230 knots, rather than the required 180. This took the 727 wide of its intended course; {{by the time it}} came around to a westerly heading, it <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> not towards the runway, but {{into the side of the}} Cumbal Volcano.|$|R

5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
5|$|That day, Lützow had led {{a flight}} of six Me262s of JV44 against a force of 256 medium bombers of the 322nd and 344th Bombardment Group (344th BG). Lützow's flight {{included}} Hauptmann Walter Krupinski and Oberleutnant Klaus Neumann. Two of the Me262s had to abort the mission due to engine problems. The remaining four, of which at least Lützow's and Neumann's Me262s were armed with the R4M air-to-air rockets, attacked elements of 344thBG. Following the first attack, at least three B-26 Marauder bombers were seen trailing smoke, when the Me262s came under attack by P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft of the 365th Fighter Group. Blue Flight leader Captain Jerry G. Mast and his wingman, Second Lieutenant Byron Smith, went into full power dives to drive the attacking Me262s away. Following the dive, Smith got separated from Mast and pursued an Me262. Mast and Second Lieutenant William H. Myers then jointly went after another Me262 which went into an even steeper dive. The Me262 was seen crashing {{into the ground and}} exploding. In Forsyth's account, the Me262 chased by Mast and Myers was Lützow's and had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> furthest to the south.|$|E

25|$|In 1856, Qing authorities, {{in searching}} for a pirate, boarded a ship, the Arrow, which the British claimed had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> the British flag, an {{incident}} {{which led to the}} Second Opium War.

25|$|On Friday, Major Tom Holloway, {{spokesman}} for the British Armed Forces, reported two air strikes were made in support of Iraqi forces in Basra overnight. The air strikes, which occurred at 21:00 on Thursday and shortly after midnight involved US Navy or Marine F/A-18 fighters firing cannon rounds at a militia stronghold and on a mortar team in Basra. Major Holloway reported coalition aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> surveillance operations over Basra {{since the beginning of}} the fighting in support of the Iraqi offensive.|$|E

25|$|On 2 December 2005, {{conservative}} newspaper Le Figaro {{had revealed}} {{the existence of}} two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners.

The other suspected aircraft would have landed in Brest on 31 March 2002. It is investigated by the Canadian authorities, {{as it would have}} <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, via Keflavík in Iceland before going to Turkey.|$|E
25|$|In another investigative report {{brought up}} by Sabah, it was claimed that the {{aircraft}} had <b>been</b> <b>flying</b> without permission {{on the day of}} the accident. The sub-lease contract between World Focus Airlines and Atlasjet for the operation of the MD-83 was signed on 25 June 2007 for a five-month period, which ended on 25 November 2007, five days prior to the crash. In a press conference however, Atlasjet refuted the claim that the aircraft was flying without permission, assuring that a short-term contract lasting for three days was signed on 29 November 2007, one day prior to the crash.|$|E
