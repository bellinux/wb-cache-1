5|$|Five {{minutes before}} half-time, Juventus were awarded a free-kick. Boniek, who had beaten three Liverpool players with a run, was <b>brought</b> <b>down</b> outside the Liverpool penalty area by Wark, who {{received}} a yellow card for the foul.

Paul Walsh stretched to reach a pass from Neal, aggravated a stomach strain {{and was replaced by}} Craig Johnston. Juventus were gaining an ascendancy in the match, and in the 56th minute they were awarded a penalty kick. Boniek again went on a run through the centre of the Liverpool defence and was <b>brought</b> <b>down</b> by Gillespie. Liverpool believed that the foul was outside the area, but the Swiss referee, from some 25 yards (22.86 m.) behind the ball, awarded the penalty.
