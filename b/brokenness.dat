25|$|Juniors have {{a choice}} of retreat. One is a three-day retreat experience, the first day of which is spent with the {{disadvantaged}} members of the Houston area. Afterwards, they spend two days reflecting on the experience, upon the <b>brokenness</b> of the world, and the meaning of Jesus' claim to be present in the poorest. The other option is focused on prayer; this began in 1996 after requests from students over 2–3 years. During this three-day residential retreat, juniors discover and experience a variety of prayer methods such as meditation, praying with music, through nature, and the psalms, and using such things as play-dough as creative prayer.|$|E
500|$|... "Homesick" [...] is a ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and forty-one seconds. Lyrically, the song is an {{expression}} of grief, pondering Heaven and {{the time it takes to}} get there, as well as anger, confusion, and <b>brokenness.</b> The song is set in the key of F major and has a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. Millard's vocal range in the song spans from C4–A5.|$|E

However, since his arrest {{it has been reported}} that Lambesis [...] "has spent much of the last year reevaluating what originally convinced him to abandon belief in God. After much <b>brokenness</b> and repentance he sees things differently, considers himself a follower of Jesus, someone submitted to the will of God." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Steve Lillywhite sessions, Lee {{described}} the album as a [...] "rainbow of sounds" [...] with heavy, stripped-out songs. According to Lee, it had electro influences {{and a lot}} of drum programming. During the later sessions with Nick Raskulincecz, she discussed two of the album's themes: <b>brokenness</b> ("Brokenness has become a little bit of theme, without necessarily offering a solution") and oceans. In a later MTV interview, Lee mentioned other themes: [...] "the quest for freedom, and then there's songs that are just about falling in love". She said that Evanescence used new and vintage instruments (such as a harp, synthesizers and the Moog Taurus Pedal) and recorded the ballads [...] "Secret Door" [...] and [...] "My Heart Is Broken". In a Kerrang! interview, Lee said she was inspired by her life and personal relationships.|$|E

2500|$|The Face of Love is {{the third}} studio album from Christian rock band Sanctus Real. It was {{released}} on April 4, 2006 and peaked at number 158 on the Billboard 200. The singles [...] "I'm Not Alright" [...] and [...] "Don't Give Up" [...] both reached number 1 on Christian contemporary hit radio. The album was written and recorded following a period of personal struggles for the band members, and carries themes of honesty and <b>brokenness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Brokenness</b> and the Cross – For Edwards, those {{individuals}} with a talent for leadership (especially church planting) must demonstrate a sensitivity to {{the inner workings of}} the Holy Spirit. [...] In particular, he explains that those who wish to know God well must pass through a progressive breaking and humbling of their own dispositions. [...] Natural strengths, skills, and ambitions interfere with the working of God among believers, so those very things which seem most helpful to the church must pass through a kind of death before they can be used by God—the principle of death and resurrection.|$|E
2500|$|Broken Walrus I, a {{mild steel}} {{sculpture}} with an orange-red painted matte finish, was an abstract {{representation of a}} single walrus tusk broken into two pieces. Rather than a realistic, round tusk, it had squared edges and exaggerated, squared ends. To portray the sense of <b>brokenness,</b> the work had two pieces: a larger, main tusk and a smaller section resting against it. The larger section had thin pieces on the sides that radiated from each curve to give it an even more abstract feel. The piece's dimensions were [...] by [...] by it sat on a raised concrete rectangle base measuring approximately [...] high by [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|Hildegard of Bingen [...] "presents {{the most}} complex Mariology of Medieval German women writers." [...] While {{following}} the traditional juxtaposition of Eve and Mary, in the illustrated Scivias, Adam is depicted as listening to the tempter, and thus bears equal blame. Of the sixty-three songs in Hildegard's Symphonia, sixteen focus {{on the role of}} Mary in salvation history, the most dedicated to any one figure. In Hildegard’s Mariology, Mary assumes the status of an essential, active partner in the plan of redemption. A second characteristic Marian theme, is that of the Virgin Mother healing the <b>brokenness</b> brought into the world by the first mother, Eve. Hildegard belongs more to the Romanesque than the Gothic Age. Untouched by a new affective style of piety that friars will popularize across Europe, Hildegard’s Mary, like her overall spirituality is monastic.|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 2006, during Jason and Sam's first break up, Jason {{refused to}} resume a {{relationship}} with Sam for her own safety. After a fight at the hospital she ripped off the star necklace and dropped it in a janitor's bucket, symbolizing the <b>brokenness</b> of their relationship at the time. When Jason and Sam reunited later that year on December 26, 2006, Jason gifted Sam with a new star necklace for Christmas. On February 1, 2007 during the Metro Court Hostage crisis, the star necklace was ripped from Sam's neck {{by one of the}} gunman. It was lost until Alexis recovered it from one of the police department's evidence boxes. After Jason and Sam broke up for the second time and Sam went to Jason's penthouse to pick up the rest of her belongings, she left the newly recovered star necklace with him because she didn't want any reminders of [...] "what could have been." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of <b>brokenness</b> and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E
60|$|Q. What {{else would}} you advise me to in this great work?--A. When we confess sin, tears, shame, and <b>brokenness</b> of heart becomes us (Jer 50:4; Isa 22:12; Psa 51:17; Jer 31:19).|$|E
60|$|Third. The {{man with}} a broken heart is a very humble man; or, true humility {{is a sign of}} a broken heart. Hence, <b>brokenness</b> of heart, contrition of spirit, and humbleness of mind, are put together. 'To revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones' (Isa 57:15).|$|E
6000|$|Answ. 1. Ah! Sweet soul! It is not thy {{words that}} God so much regards, as {{that he will}} not mind thee, except thou comest before him with some eloquent oration. His eye is on the <b>brokenness</b> of thine heart; and that it is that makes the very bowels of the Lord to run over. [...] "A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise" [...] (Psa 51:17).|$|E
60|$|He {{was forced}} {{to give up the}} duties of his office to a new pastor, and though often entreated to preach again, he would hardly ever do so, by reason, he said, that it would be wronging the souls of his people, when they had an able minister; and when he preached for the last time on a fast day, on the 63rd Psalm, it was with an apology for what he called the poorness, and meanness, and <b>brokenness</b> of his meditations.|$|E
60|$|The broken-hearted know, {{that the}} sanctifying of the Spirit {{is a good}} means to keep from that relapse, out of which a man cannot come unless his heart be wounded a second time. Doubtless David had a broken heart at first conversion, and if that <b>brokenness</b> had remained, that is, had he not given way to {{hardness}} of heart again, he had never fallen into that sin out of which {{he could not be}} recovered, but by the breaking of his bones a second time. Therefore, I say, a broken heart is of great esteem with God; for it--and I will add, so long as it retains its tenderness--covets none but God, and the things of his Holy Spirit; sin is an abomination to it.|$|E
60|$|A prodigious {{growth of}} whiskers, greyish-dirty and {{untrimmed}} for years, sprouted from his face. This hirsute growth {{should have been}} white, but the season was summer and {{it had not been}} exposed to a rain-shower for some time. What was visible of the face looked as if at some period it had stopped a hand-grenade. The nose was so variously malformed in its healed <b>brokenness</b> that there was no bridge, while one nostril, the size of a pea, opened downward, and the other, the size of a robin's egg, tilted upward to the sky. One eye, of normal size, dim-brown and misty, bulged to the verge of popping out, and as if from senility wept copiously and continuously. The other eye, scarcely larger than a squirrel's and as uncannily bright, twisted up obliquely into the hairy scar of a bone-crushed eyebrow. And he had but one arm.|$|E
60|$|First. For {{this word}} broken, Tindal renders it a troubled heart;[4] but I {{think there is}} more in it. I take it, therefore, to be a heart disabled, as to former actions, even as a man whose bones are broken is disabled, as to his way of running, leaping, wrestling, or ought else, which vainly he was wont to do; wherefore, that which was called a broken heart in the text, he calls his broken bones, in verse the eighth: 'Cause me,' saith he, 'to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice' (Psa 51:8). And why is the {{breaking}} of the heart compared to {{the breaking of the}} bones? but because as when the bones are broken, the outward man is disabled as to what it was wont to do; so when the spirit is broken, the inward man is disabled as to what vanity and folly it before delighted in; hence, feebleness is joined with this <b>brokenness</b> of heart. 'I am feeble,' saith he, 'and sore broken' (Psa 38:8). I have lost my strength and former vigour, as to vain and sinful courses.|$|E
6000|$|... '...Another {{individual}} had {{a familiar}} spirit that he consulted and {{with which he}} conversed; but, on hearing the Gospel, he professed to become converted, and had no more communication with his spirit. It had left him, he said; it spoke to him no more. After a protracted trial I baptised him. I watched his case with interest, and for several years he led an unimpeachable Christian life; but, on losing his religious zeal, and disagreeing {{with some of the}} church members, he removed to a distant village, where he could not attend the services of the Sabbath, and it was soon after reported that he had communications with his familiar spirit again. I sent a native preacher to visit him. The man said he heard the voice which had conversed with him formerly, but it spoke very differently. Its language was exceedingly pleasant to hear, and produced great <b>brokenness</b> of heart. It said, [...] "Love each other; act righteously--act uprightly," [...] with other exhortations such us he had heard from the teachers. An assistant was placed in the village near him, when the spirit left him again; and ever since he has maintained the character of a consistent Christian.'[2] ...|$|E

60|$|In their {{conversation}} before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea {{did not see}} the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the <b>brokenness</b> of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments to be brought against Mr. Casaubon's entirely new view of the Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter she should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him. Again, the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in which she herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they had been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements, she had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that her mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and repulsion, or else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious Hooker or any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr. Casaubon's time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could not have the advantage of comparison; but her husband's way of commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to affect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting himself. What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by the general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried preparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|When I do this {{begin to}} apprehend, My heart, my soul, and mind, begins to bend To God-ward, and {{sincerely}} for to love His son, his ways, his people, {{and to move}} With <b>brokenness</b> of spirit after him Who broken was, and killed for my sin. Now is mine heart grown holy, now it cleaves To Jesus Christ my Lord, and now it leaves Those ways that wicked be; it mourns because It can conform no more unto the laws Of God, who loved me when I was vile, And of sweet Jesus, who did reconcile Me unto justice by his precious blood, When no way else was left to do me good. If you would know how this can operate Thus on the soul, I shall to you relate A little farther what my soul hath seen Since I have with the Lord acquainted been. The word of grace, when it doth rightly seize The spirit of a man, and so at ease Doth set the soul, the Spirit of the Lord Doth then with might accompany the word; In which it sets forth Christ as crucified, And by that means the Father pacified With such a wretch was thou, and by this sight, Thy guilt is {{in the first place}} put to flight, For thus the Spirit doth expostulate: Behold how God doth now communicate (By changing of the person) grace to thee A sinner, but to Christ great misery, Though he the just one was, and so could not Deserve this punishment; behold, then, what The love of God is! how 'tis manifest, And where the reason lies that thou art blest. This doctrine being spoken to the heart, Which also is made yield to every part Thereof, it doth the same with sweetness fill, And so doth sins and wickednesses kill; For when the love of God is thus reveal'd, And thy poor drooping spirit thereby seal'd, And when thy heart, as dry ground, drinks this in Unto the roots thereof, which nourish sin, It smites them, as the worm did Jonah's gourd, And makes them dwindle of their own accord, And die away; instead of which there springs Up life and love, and other holy things. Besides, the Holy Spirit now is come, And takes possession of thee as its home; By which a war maintained always is Against {{the old man and the}} deeds of his. [...] When God at first upon mount Sinai spake, He made his very servant Moses quake; But when he heard the law the second time, His heart was comforted, his face did shine. What was the reason of this difference, Seeing no change was in the ordinance, Although a change was in the manner, when The second time he gave it unto men? At first 'twas given in severity, In thunder, blackness, darkness, tempest high, In fiery flames it was delivered. This struck both Moses and the host as dead; But Moses, when he went into the mount The second time, upon the same account No fear, nor dread, nor shaking of his mind, Do we in all the holy Scripture find; But rather in his spirit he had rest, And look'd upon himself as greatly blest. He was put in the rock, he heard the name, Which on the mount the Lord did thus proclaim: The Lord, merciful, gracious, and more, Long-suffering, and keeping up in store Mercy for thousands, pardoning these things, Iniquity, transgressions, and sins, And holding guilty none but such as still Refuse forgiveness, of rebellious will. [...] This proclamation better pleased him Than all the thunder and the light'ning. Which shook the mount, this rid him of his fear, This made him bend, make haste, and worship there. [...] Jehoshaphat, when he was sore opprest By Amnon and by Moab, and the rest Of them that sought his life, no rest he found, Until a word of faith became a ground To stay himself upon; O, then they fell, His very song became their passing-bell. Then holiness of heart a consequence Of faith in Christ is, for it flows from thence; The love of Christ in truth constraineth us, Of love sincerely to make judgment thus: He for us died that for ever we Might die to sin, and Christ his servants be. O! nothing's like to the remembrance Of what it is to have deliverance From death and hell, which is of due our right, Nothing, I say, like this to work delight In holy things; this like live honey runs, And needs no pressing out of honey-combs.|$|E
