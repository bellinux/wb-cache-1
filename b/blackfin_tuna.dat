40|$|The {{ability to}} manage a fish stock relies on an {{understanding}} of life history characteristics and basic biology of the species. Numerous age-growth studies are facilitated by the relative ease of ageing fishes through hard-part analyses. Determining reproductive parameters for fish populations is equally important for stock assessments and management, and histological examination of gonads provides the most accurate determination of fecundity and spawning periods. Coastal pelagic fishes are often targeted commercially and recreationally due to their easy access by private vessels. However, there are few studies researching the biology and reproduction of recreational fishes {{in the waters of}} Southeastern Florida that would lead to a better understanding for management practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide baseline reproductive data for two fishes particularly important to Florida fisheries: the coastal pelagic scombrids <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna</b> Thunnus atlanticus and Little Tunny Euthynnus alletteratus. Archived gonad samples from 2010 - 2014 for these two species were evaluated, and GSI values and histological examination indicated one spawning season for both species. Little Tunny spawn April through August, and <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna</b> spawn May through June. Additionally both species have asynchronous oocyte development, and are batch spawners. Postovulatory follicles were used to estimate spawning frequency; for <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna,</b> mean spawning occurs once every 1. 49 days, and for Little Tunny, mean spawning occurs once every 1. 47 days. Comparison of otolith age data to these results indicates that Little Tunny mature at a smaller size and younger age than <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna.</b> Size at 50 % maturity for male <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna</b> was 435. 2 mm TL, for female <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna</b> was 392. 3 mm TL, and for male Little Tunny was 347. 77 mm TL.

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{examines}} the fishing of <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus) around Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in Martinique (French West Indies). It {{is based on}} the compared analysis of catches from monthly experimental fishing surveys and sampling of commercial landings. The data collected in these two different ways allowed comparison of <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> length frequencies. A large part of the commercial landings were made up of young immature tuna with a fork length of less than 40 cm, whereas the experimental longline catches were mainly made up of fish with a fork length ranging between 55 and 75 cm. We give evidence that these discrepancies were mostly due to the fishing technique used. Indeed, contrarily to the experimental surveys, Martinican fishermen only fish during daytime and usually on the surface by trolling. This way, fishermen {{do not have access to}} the largest fish, which are found deeper. Our results suggested that a new fishing technique such as vertical longlining, could improve commercial catches of big <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> under FADs. © 2000 Ifremer/CNRS/INRA/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|E
40|$|Summer ichthyoplankton {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} in surface waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico from 2007 to 2010 to characterize distribution and abundance of tuna larvae. The assemblage of tuna larvae was comprised of four genera: Thunnus, Auxis, Euthynnus, and Katsuwonus. True tunas (genus Thunnus) were the most abundant, and four species were detected; Atlantic bluefin tuna (T. thynnus), yellowfin tuna (T. albacares), bigeye tuna (T. obesus), and <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (T. atlanticus). Intra- and inter-annual variability in distribution and abundance of tuna larvae were observed with higher densities in 2008 and 2009 followed by a decline in abundance in 2010. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and generalized additive models (GAM) based on presence/absence and density were developed to {{examine the impact of}} mesoscale features on distribution and abundance on true tuna larvae. Distribution and abundance of true tuna larvae in surface waters were influenced by physicochemical conditions of the water mass, notably sea surface temperature and salinity. Distinct species-specific habitat preferences, were observed and the location of mesoscale oceanographic features influenced larval abundance with higher densities of <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna,</b> yellowfin tuna, and bigeye tuna associated with convergent zones near the margin of the Loop Current (LC) and other anticyclonic regions (warm core); bluefin tuna was observed in higher densities near cyclonic regions (cold core). Finally, habitat suitability maps were developed based on GAMs and environmental conditions to predict the spatial coverage of suitable habitat of <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (2011 and 2015) and yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010). Habitat suitability maps revealed that the amount of highly suitable habitat of <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae varied between months (June 6 %, July 51 %); however, in both months larvae were distributed in similar locations along the continental slope and at the margin of the LC in the northern GoM. Similarly, the extent of highly suitable habitat for yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna varied between June and July. A larger percentage of highly suitable habitat of bigeye tuna was exposed to surface oil (23 - 34 %) compared to yellowfin tuna (4 - 26 %), indicating that the oil spill might have impacted the two species differently...|$|E

The total length, the weight, the determination of the sexes and sexual maturity, were also considerated. The obtained results were: the estimated average length for gonadal maturation showed that females reached the gonadal maturity at 51 cm. The widths of monthly values of gonado somatic relation (GSR) ranged from 42, 48 in September to a maximum of 247, 04 in December.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{population}} structure and genetic variability of <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> despite catch increases over the past 25 years. In this thesis, levels of genetic variation contained in 323 bp of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region-I (CR-I) and in six microsatellite loci were characterized for two regions: the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and the Northwest Atlantic. Large amounts of mtDNA diversity (h> 0. 99; = 0. 047) were observed in both regions. Mismatch distribution analysis of the CR-I sequence data, using a mutation rate of 1. 6 % Ma- 1 for scombroid fishes, indicate <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> underwent population expansion about 1. 4 Ma, a timeline concordant with the expansion of other tunas and billfishes. Estimates of female effective population size were very large at 7. 8 million and 12. 8 million individuals for the NW Atlantic and the GoM, respectively. Both mtDNA and six microsatellite loci were used to determine <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> population structure. Microsatellite and mtDNA AMOVAs revealed significant differentiation (msat st= 0. 01, p= 0. 006 and mtDNA st= 0. 01, p= 0. 049) between the GoM and the NW Atlantic samples. Migration estimates using mtDNA data indicate that twice as many females enter the NW Atlantic from the GoM (346 individuals/generation) than the opposite direction (150 individuals/generation). Migration estimates using microsatellite data were substantially smaller, with the Gulf receiving 7 individuals/generation and the NW Atlantic 4 individuals/generation. Finally, low levels of genetic differentiation using microsatellite data have been reported in other highly abundant marine fishes, which have been attributed to homoplasy in allele size. To test this hypothesis, the allele frequency distributions of blackfin and yellowfin tuna at six microsatellite loci were compared. The distances between species were surprisingly small (Da= 4. 0 %, (delta mu) squared= 1. 08), with a large degree of similarity in frequency distributions at four loci. The comparison of bigeye tuna at two microsatellite loci revealed additional inter-specific similarities. A mutation rate for these loci was estimated by modifying an equation used to estimate time since divergence. Microsatellites in tunas appear to evolve at a rate (4. 3 x 10 - 7 Ma- 1) that is two orders of magnitude slower than other fishes (1 x 10 - 5 Ma- 1). Accordingly, microsatellite allele size similarities are plesiomorphic and not due to homoplasy...|$|E
40|$|The {{waters off}} the {{southeast}} coast of Florida {{are home to}} a rare coastal pelagic ecosystem where multiple top and mid-level teleosts are present. These teleosts, particularly scombrids such as tunas and wahoo, are primarily targeted by recreational anglers. However, {{there is a shortage}} of available trophic and diet composition data concerning fishes of the coastal pelagic ecosystem. The objective of this research project is to investigate and achieve a greater understanding of coastal pelagic fishes, with an emphasis on the higher order species that inhabit the mid-range coastal pelagic to true pelagic waters, and the ecological role they play within the community ecology of the pelagic ecosystem. The selected fish species includes king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus). These species were selected based on their position as upper trophic level predators in the marine ecosystem food web and their general habitat distribution in the coastal pelagic zone. In the two year period between March 2010 and March 2012, approximately 400 fish from the seven species have been sampled. The samples were collected opportunistically from recreational tournament anglers in the south Florida region between West Palm Beach and Key West. The stomach, gonads, muscle tissue, and liver tissue were collected from each specimen, as well as length (standard, fork, and total) data. Specimen sex was determined by gonad examination. Stable isotope analysis was performed with the muscle tissue samples using carbon δ 13 C for dietary assimilation comparison and nitrogen δ 15 N for trophic position. Stomach content analysis was performed with the frequency of occurrence, percent composition by number, percent composition by weight, and IRI indices used for a quantitative description of the diet. The stomach content analysis results are compared with the stable isotope values to evaluate the trophic interactions and trophic position among the coastal pelagic community. The preliminary analysis of stomach contents shows that the fishes of this complex feed on a diverse diet of fish, squid, and crustaceans. However, the δ 13 C data suggest that <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (- 16. 5 to 20. 5) has a greater spatial diet range compared to little tunny (- 16. 5 to - 17. 5) and skipjack tuna (- 17. 0 to - 18. 0).

40|$|The {{combined}} {{methods of}} stomach content analysis and stable 15 N and 13 C isotope biochemistry analysis {{were used to}} investigate the trophic dynamics and feeding ecology of coastal pelagic fishes in the waters off southeastern Florida, USA. The coastal pelagic fish complex includes <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> Thunnus atlanticus, dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus, king mackerel Scomberomorus cavalla, little tunny Euthynnus alletteratus, skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, and wahoo Acanthocybium solandri. These coastal teleosts, particularly the tunas and wahoo, are primarily targeted by recreational anglers. However, {{there is a shortage}} of available trophic and diet composition data concerning these fishes of the coastal pelagic ecosystem. Stomach and muscle tissue samples were collected from the species of various lengths over a three-year period from March 2010 and March 2013. Across all six species, teleost fishes dominated the prey with an average 64. 5 % by occurrence, 63. 7 % by number, and 89. 9 % by weight. There were two dominant prey families: Clupeidae and Carangidae. Dolphinfish showed the lowest diet overlap among the six species, due to the highly diverse diet. The highest diet overlap occurred between king mackerel and little tunny. The mean δ 15 N ranged from 8. 21 ‰ (wahoo) to 13. 18 ‰ (king mackerel), and the mean δ 13 C ranged from - 18. 41 ‰ (king mackerel) to - 16. 70 ‰ (dolphinfish). <b>Blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> exhibited the largest δ 15 N range (7. 22 to 13. 21 ‰), as well as the largest δ 13 C range (- 19. 13 to - 12. 99 ‰). The δ 15 N and δ 13 C signatures in the muscle tissue showed evidence of shifts to higher trophic levels with an increase in fish size and the formation of distinct trophic groups among the coastal pelagic predators. The δ 13 C also suggested an inshore-offshore spatial relationship among the coastal pelagic fish.

40|$|Total mercury (Hg) {{levels were}} {{determined}} in the tissues of ten taxa of pelagic fishes, {{with a special}} emphasis on apex predators (large vertebrates). Highest Hg levels were observed in blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), carcharhinid sharks (Genus Carcharhinus) and little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), ranging from 1. 08 to 10. 52 ppm. Moderate to low concentrations (< 1. 0 ppm) were observed in <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). For the majority of species examined, Hg level did not vary significantly between locations (Texas and Louisiana) and years (2002 and 2003). The relationship between Hg level and fish size/weight was also explored and six taxa (<b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna,</b> carcharhinid sharks, dolphinfish, king mackerel, wahoo, yellowfin tuna) showed significant positive relationships between Hg level and body size and/or weight. Natural dietary tracers, stable isotopes (15 N, 13 C) and fatty acids were {{used to evaluate the}} relationship between Hg and trophic position and the relationship between Hg and dietary history. Stable nitrogen isotope analysis showed that Hg levels in fish tissues were positively associated with trophic position. Based on the 13 C and 15 N values of pelagic consumers examined in this study, three natural groups were identified with cluster analysis, and the same groupings were detected based on fatty acid profiles. This not only confirmed the existence of these natural groupings, but also indicated that the distinguishing factors for the grouping was likely connected with the dietary history of these fishes. The classification tree based on the fatty acid profiles of pelagic fishes readily separated fishes from different regions, suggesting that diets of pelagic taxa within the same region are similar or these consumers share a common source of organic matter in their food web. Findings from this study complement other Hg investigations conducted in the Gulf and also furthered our understanding of the link between feeding ecology and Hg accumulation. Moreover, the combined use of stable isotope and fatty acid techniques provided new insights on the dietary history of pelagic fishes in the Gulf of Mexico...|$|E
40|$|Background. Understanding {{the life}} {{history of a}} species is {{essential}} for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. These valuable fishes are also important trophic linkages between small neritic fishes and large, economically valuable apex predators. This study describes {{for the first time}} the yearly age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida (USA) waters: <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna,</b> Thunnus atlanticus (Lesson, 1831); little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus (Rafinesque, 1810); and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus, 1758). Materials and methods. Tuna specimens were collected in two ways: via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains in the areas of the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line catches performed especially for this project. Age determination was based on sagittal otolith hyaline deposition patterns. Marginal increment analysis was used as an indirect validation method. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of the fish fork length and the hyaline band measurements. Results. Two hyaline bands formed each year in all three species—one in winter and one in summer. The von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna,</b> L∞ = 95. 34 cm, K = 0. 28, and t 0 = – 1. 53; little tunny, L∞ = 77. 93 cm, K = 0. 69, and t 0 = – 0. 69; and skipjack tuna, L∞ = 112. 76 cm, K = 0. 24, and t 0 = – 1. 70. Parameters of each resulting von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species showing that little tunny grew the fastest, but skipjack had the largest estimated size. Results were also compared with growth rates currently used in stock assessments by fisheries management organizations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Conclusion. Sectioned otoliths indicate two bands a year for these three species in the Florida Straits. Results were comparable to other studies, with a similar finding of two bands per year in hard parts for these species. Further knowledge of these populations will aid in stock assessments for these species and the ongoing shift to ecosystem-based management plans...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproduction}} of <b>Blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> Thunnus atlanticus {{has been described}} for coastal regions, {{and for a long}} time, this species was considered to be a strictly continental spawner. Recently, this species was observed around a seamount habitat 500 nautical miles Northeast of Brazil, located between South America and Africa. In this study we describe the reproductive biology of <b>Blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> at Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (SPSPA). Male and female gonads were sampled from December 2008 to July 2010, and analyzed macro and microscopically. A total of 361 fish were sampled (247 males and 114 females). Males were more common than females, with a sex ratio of 2. 2 ♂: 1 ♀. The fork length (FL) of all sampled specimens ranged from 38 to 98 cm, and larger length classes were more frequent in males. It was possible to distinguish six maturity phases for females: immature, developing, spawning capable, actively spawning, regressing and recovering. Five phases were identified for males: immature, developing, spawning capable, actively spawning and recovering. The gonad index (GI) mean monthly values ranged from 6. 6 (SD= 4. 1) to 58. 4 (SD= 34. 7) for females, and from 2. 6 (SD= 1. 3) to 66. 2 (SD= 30. 4) for males. For both sexes, the largest GI values were observed {{at the beginning of the}} first semester of the year. Size at first maturity was estimated at 48 cm FL and 55 cm FL for females and males respectively. Approximately 80 % of the specimens were adults and considered to be in reproductive conditions. Histological analysis of the ovaries and testes showed that most of the specimens were sexually mature and were reproductively active during all months of the year. However, females with mature ovaries, with large amounts of hydrated oocytes and post-ovulatory follicles, were mainly found from December to March, thus these months may constitute the main spawning season in SPSPA. Batch fecundity varied between 272 025 and 1 140 584 oocytes for 56 and 68 cm FL females respectively. Oocyte development and spawning patterns suggest a multiple spawning behavior. The results revealed that <b>Blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> is using the SPSPA as a spawning ground, similar to other species commonly observed in the same area during the same reproductive season. A pesar de la importancia de las capturas del atún de aleta negra Thunnus atlanticus en el noreste de Brasil y en las cercanías del Archipiélago San Pedro y San Pablo (ASPSP), hay una escasez de información sobre su reproducción, especialmente en las islas. La reproducción del atún de aleta negra en este archipiélago se estudió de diciembre 2008 a julio 2010. Con este fin, se recolectaron 361 gónadas de hembras y machos, los machos fueron predominantemente más frecuentes en la muestra total, con una proporción sexual de 1 ♀: 2. 2 ♂. La longitud furcal todos los ejemplares muestreados varió entre 38 y 98 cm, y los machos fueron más abundantes en las clases de mayor longitud.

In order to collect stakeholder opinion on including these three species into the HMS FMP, a survey was launched via online fishing forums. However, only 87 respondents participated in the 2 months-long survey process, with 43 % not even completing the whole of the survey. Aside from refusal to participate, the responses on the forums were that of extreme opposition. So, although the nature of these species certainly qualifies them to fall under this FMP, the reaction from the recreational fishing community would make these changes difficult. Given that these three stocks are not stressed nor overfished, the need to place these species under the HMS FMP {{may not be the best}} course of action at this time. Moreover, such an action could potentially hurt the recreational fishing industry by adding additional and unnecessary regulations...|$|E

Young‐of‐the‐year amberjack (Seriola dumerili) were fed with either <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus; 2647 [*]ng/g THg) or brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus; 25. 1 [*]ng/g THg) for 80 d or 50 d, respectively, and dissected for muscle, liver, kidney, brain, and blood. After 30 d of tuna consumption, Hg isotopes (δ 202 Hg and Δ 199 Hg) of the amberjack organs shifted to the tuna value (δ 202 Hg[*]=[*] 0. 55 ‰, Δ 199 Hg[*]=[*] 1. 54 ‰,), demonstrating the absence of Hg isotope fractionation. When amberjack were fed a shrimp diet, there was an initial mixing of the amberjack organs toward the shrimp value (δ 202 Hg[*]=[*]− 0. 48 ‰, Δ 199 Hg[*]=[*] 0. 32 ‰), followed by a cessation of further shifts in Δ 199 Hg and a small shift in δ 202 Hg. The failure of Δ 199 Hg to reach the shrimp value {{can be attributed to}} a reduction in Hg bioaccumulation from shrimp resulting from feeding inhibition and the δ 202 Hg shift can be attributed to a small internal fractionation during excretion. Given that the feeding rate and Hg concentration of the diet can influence internal Hg isotope distribution, these parameters must be considered in biosentinel fish studies.

40|$|Knowledge {{of mercury}} {{concentrations}} in fish {{is essential for}} human health protection. Mercury is a naturally occurring element {{that acts as a}} neurotoxin to humans and other species. The biologically available mercury form, methylmercury (MeHg), bio accumulates from small benthic invertebrates to large pelagic fish, and therefore high end consumers and terminal predators have elevated Hg concentrations. The main pathway of MeHg exposure in humans is by consumption of contaminated fish. In this study total Hg concentrations were measured in 10 Gulf of Mexico pelagic fish species using a DMA 80 analyzer. Total Hg concentrations ranged from 0. 004 to 3. 55 ppm (wet wt). The highest mean concentration (1. 04 ppm, wet wt) recorded in king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) exceeded FDA recommended criteria of 1 ppm. Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) had lowest mean Hg concentrations (< 0. 3 ppm). The rest of the species were above the EPA advisory level of 0. 3 ppm. Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) and gag grouper (Mysteroperca microlepsis) had high Hg concentrations of approximately 0. 7 ppm wet wt. <b>Blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacores) had moderate Hg concentrations (0. 39 and 0. 36 ppm wet wt respectively).

40|$|Time-series data {{collected}} over a four-year period {{were used to}} characterize patterns of abundance for pelagic fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) before (2007 – 2009) and after (2010) the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Four numerically dominant pelagic species (<b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna,</b> blue marlin, dolphinfish, and sailfish) were included in our assessment, and larval density of each species was lower in 2010 {{than any of the}} three years prior to the oil spill, although larval abundance in 2010 was often statistically similar to other years surveyed. To assess potential overlap between suitable habitat of pelagic fish larvae and surface oil, generalized additive models (GAMs) were developed to evaluate the influence of ocean conditions on the abundance of larvae from 2007 – 2009. Explanatory variables from GAMs were then linked to environmental data from 2010 to predict the probability of occurrence for each species. The spatial extent of surface oil overlapped with early life habitat of each species, possibly indicating that the availability of high quality habitat was affected by the DH oil spill. Shifts in the distribution of spawning adults is another factor known to influence the abundance of larvae, and the spatial occurrence of a model pelagic predator (blue marlin) was characterized over the same four-year period using electronic tags. The spatial extent of oil coincided with areas used by adult blue marlin from 2007 – 2009, and the occurrence of blu...|$|E

Ten tunas (71. 1 - 86. 4 cm FL) were tagged in the northern Gulf of Mexico in April 2012 after being caught on typical recreational fishing gear. PSATs recorded point measurements of temperature, pressure (depth), and light level every 90 s (n[*]=[*] 2 tags, deployment duration 9. 5 days), 180 s (n[*]=[*] 4, duration 19 days), or 270 s (n[*]=[*] 4, duration 28. 5 days). Nine fish survived for their respective full deployment periods; one fish died after only 5 h following release. Depths ranged from 0 – 217 m with a mean of 28 m (SD[*]=[*] 8. 38 m) and temperatures ranged from 13. 9 – 32. 9 °C with a mean of 23. 8 °C (SD[*]=[*] 1. 3 °C) for all nine archived records. The nine blackfin spent 90 % of their time in depths from 0 – 57 m and 89 % of their time in temperatures from 21. 9 – 26. 6 °C. Over 87 % of the movements in the water column, either ascending or descending, were less than 12 m differences in depth between sequential short-duration data sampling. With appropriate concern regarding the matching of fish and PSAT sizes, these results suggest that external tags with fishery-independent reporting capabilities are an available option for smaller tuna species...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} and mitigation of {{adverse effects of}} the bycatch of tuna longline fishery have been mainly developed and implemented for seabirds, sharks and turtles and, the knowledge on teleost bycatch for this fishery, remains very poor. This paper contributes to a comprehensive assessment of life history traits and fishery attributes of target and bycatch species caught by the tuna longline fishery in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Data was compiled on seven life history traits and three fishery attributes for 33 and 27 teleost stocks caught by longliners in South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively. In addition, each species was assigned into four categories describing {{the fate of the}} catch: target species for commercial use, bycatch species kept for consumption, bycatch species kept for commercial use and discarded bycatch. Life history traits and fishery attributes did not differ between oceans. However, non-target but commercialized species were smaller in the Atlantic Ocean. Teleosts caught by the tuna longline fishery was segregated into three main groups: (1) the fast growing species represented mainly by dolphinfishes (Coryphaena hippurus and C. equisellis), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), snoek (Thyrsites atun) and <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus); (2) target tunas and most other bycatch species which were part of an intermediate group and (3) billfishes including swordfish representing the large and slow growing species with moderate to high market values and unknown or highly uncertain stock status. Investment in some key life history traits (such as growth coefficient) and the development of quantitative or semi-quantitative approaches (stock assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment) should be priorized as precautionary management measures for these species...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the life}} {{history of a}} species is {{essential}} for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. This study describes the age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida waters: <b>blackfin</b> <b>tuna</b> Thunnus atlanticus, little tunny Euthynnus alletteratus, and skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis. Tuna specimens were collected via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains {{in the areas of}} the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line by the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center. Age was described via sagittal otolith deposition patterns. They were removed, dried, sectioned, and rings were counted as well as measured. Validation of the timing of ring deposits was done by marginal increment analysis. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of fish fork length to count measurements. This comparison via the Von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin, L∞ = 95. 34 cm, K = 0. 28, and t 0 = - 1. 53; little tunny, L∞ = 77. 93 cm, K = 0. 69, and t 0 = - 0. 69; and skipjack, L∞ = 112. 76 cm, K = 0. 24, and t 0 = - 1. 70. The curves indicate an average size of an individual of a given species at a certain age. They also give an estimation of a maximum length (L∞) of each species, in addition to specific growth rate, which is indicated by the slope. Parameters of each resulting Von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species. Results were also compared with growth rates currently used in stock assessments by fisheries management organizations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{waters off}} the {{southeast}} coast of Florida {{are home to}} a unique pelagic and coastal pelagic ecosystem. The geography and physical oceanographic characteristics of this area form a condensed ecosystem where multiple apex predators are present. The big game fish, particularly scombrids such as tunas and wahoo, can be harvested within these coastal pelagic waters and are primarily targeted by recreational anglers. Presently {{there is a shortage}} of available data concerning fishes of the coastal pelagic ecosystem. The objective of this research project is to investigate and achieve a greater understanding of coastal pelagic fishes, with an emphasis on the higher order species that inhabit the mid-range coastal pelagic to true pelagic waters, and the ecological role they play within the community ecology of the pelagic ecosystem. The selected fish species includes King Mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), Spanish Mackerel (S. maculates), Cero (S. regalis), <b>Blackfin</b> <b>Tuna</b> (Thunnus atlanticus), Yellowfin Tuna (T. albacares), Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), Atlantic Bonito (Sarda sarda), Little Tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), Greater Amberjack (Seroila dumerili), and Dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus). These species were selected based on their position as upper trophic level predators in the marine ecosystem food web and their general habitat distribution in the coastal pelagic zone. In a one year period between March 2010 and March 2011, a total of 239 fish from the 11 species have been sampled. The samples were collected opportunistically from recreational tournament anglers in the south Florida area between West Palm Beach and the Florida Keys. From each fish specimen sampled the stomach, gonads, blood, muscle tissue, and liver tissue was collected for further analysis. Morphometric data for each specimen was also recorded. A stable isotope analysis was performed with the muscle tissue and blood samples using carbon δ 13 C and nitrogen δ 15 N for trophic analysis. A gut content analysis was performed with the frequency of occurrence and percent composition by weight approaches used for quantitative description of the analysis. The gut content analysis is performed and compared to the stable isotope analysis to further understand the trophic interactions and trophic position among the coastal pelagic community. The preliminary results of the stomach content and stable isotope analysis from year 1 of sampling is being presented. This research project began in 2010 and is planned to continue 2012, in an effort to collect data over 2 - 3 generations. The completion of this research project will achieve a greater understanding of the community ecology of these HMS coastal pelagic fishes and illustrate of the ecological roles/linkages between the coastal pelagic and pelagic ecosystems. The ecosystem and trophic data obtained from this study will also assist with the development of ecosystem based models and sustainable fisheries for the Florida East Coast HMS fishery...|$|E
