50|$|Filters are {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} UV illumination source to narrow the illuminant waveband. This filter is called an exciter filter, and it allows only the radiation to pass which is needed to induce a particular fluorescence.

5000|$|Barrier filter: Allows only yellow-green light (from the fluorescence) {{to reach}} the camera. Both filters are {{interference}} bandpass filters, which means they block out all light except that at a specific wavelength.

However, the glass <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> used on the lens must now absorb or block all ultraviolet and infrared light and must permit only the visible radiation to pass. Visible fluorescence is produced in a suitable subject when the shorter, higher energy ultraviolet wavelengths are absorbed, lose some energy and are emitted as longer, lower energy visible wavelengths.

40|$|Purpose: To {{optimize}} anterior eye fluorescein {{viewing and}} image capture. Design: Prospective experimental investigation. Methods: The spectral radiance of ten different models of slit-lamp blue luminance and the spectral transmission of three <b>barrier</b> <b>filters</b> were measured. Optimal clinical instillation of fluorescein was evaluated by {{a comparison of}} four different instillation methods of fluorescein into 10 subjects. Two methods used a floret, and two used minims of different concentration. The resulting fluorescence was evaluated for quenching effects and efficiency over time. Results: Spectral radiance of the blue illumination typically had an average peak at 460 nm. Comparison between three slit-lamps of the same model showed a similar spectral radiance distribution. Of the slit-lamps examined, 8. 3 % to 50. 6 % of the illumination output was optimized for > 80 % fluorescein excitation, and 1. 2 % to 23. 5 % of the illumination overlapped with that emitted by the fluorophore. The <b>barrier</b> <b>filters</b> had an average cut-off at 510 to 520 nm. Quenching was observed for all methods of fluorescein instillation. The moistened floret and the 1 % minim reached a useful level of fluorescence in on average ∼ 20 s (∼ 2. 5 × faster than the saturated floret and 2 % minim) and this lasted for ∼ 160 seconds. Conclusions: Most slit-lamps' blue light and yellow <b>barrier</b> <b>filters</b> are not optimal for fluorescein viewing and capture. Instillation of fluorescein using a moistened floret or 1 % minim seems most clinically appropriate as lower quantities and concentrations of fluorescein improve the efficiency of clinical examination. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> system {{concepts}} {{have been}} proposed by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle filter elements can be used directly as inverted candle filter elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle filter elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle filter elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle filter elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet filter elements were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet filter element is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet filter element may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet filter elements could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet filter element manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reach the highest {{possible}} efficiencies in a coal-fired turbine-based power system, the turbine should be directly fired with the products of coal conversion. Two main types of systems employ these turbines: those based on pressurized fluidized-bed combustors and those based on integrated gasification combined cycles. In both systems, suspended particulates must be cleaned from the gas stream before it enters the turbine so as to prevent fouling and erosion of the turbine blades. To produce the cleanest gas, <b>barrier</b> <b>filters</b> are being developed and are in use in several facilities. <b>Barrier</b> <b>filters</b> are composed of porous, high-temperature materials that allow the hot gas to pass but collect the particulates on the surface. The three main configurations of the <b>barrier</b> <b>filters</b> are candle, cross-flow, and tube filters. Both candle and tube filters have been tested extensively. They are composed of coarsely porous ceramic {{that serves as a}} structural support, overlain with a thin, microporous ceramic layer on the dirty gas side that serves as the primary filter surface. They are highly efficient at removing particulate matter from the gas stream and, because of their ceramic construction, are resistant to gas and ash corrosion. However, ceramics are brittle and individual elements can fail, allowing particulates to pass through the hole left by the filter element and erode the turbine. Preventing all failure of individual ceramic filter elements is not possible at the present state of development of the technology. Therefore, safeguard devices (SGDs) must be employed to prevent the particulates streaming through occasional broken filters from reaching the turbine. However, the SGD must allow for the free passage of gas when it is not activated. Upon breaking of a filter, the SGD must either mechanically close or quickly plug with filter dust to prevent additional dust from reaching the turbine. Production of a dependable rapidly closing autonomous mechanical device at high temperatures in a dusty gas stream is difficult because of problems with materials corrosion, dust leakage, and detection of filter failure. Therefore, the Energy & Environmental Research Center is using its knowledge of the factors that make filter dust sticky at gas filtration temperatures to make a simple and inexpensive SGD that employs an adhesive yet thermodynamically stable coating on a highly porous ceramic substrate. The SGDs are placed on top of individual candle filters at the filtered gas exit. Upon failure of the filter, the dirty gas flows through the SGD where the adhesive surface rapidly and permanently traps dust particles, causing the device to plug and prevent the dust from reaching the turbine...|$|R

40|$|Reliable, {{maintainable}} {{and cost}} effective hot gas particulate filter technology {{is critical to}} the successful commercialization of advanced, coal-fired power generation technologies, such as IGCC and PFBC. In pilot plant testing, the operating reliability of hot gas particulate filters have been periodically compromised by process issues, such as process upsets and difficult ash cake behavior (ash bridging and sintering), and by design issues, such as cantilevered filter elements damaged by ash bridging, or excessively close packing of filtering surfaces resulting in unacceptable pressure drop or filtering surface plugging. This test experience has focused the issues and has helped to define advanced hot gas filter design concepts that offer higher reliability. Westinghouse has identified two advanced ceramic <b>barrier</b> <b>filter</b> concepts that are configured to minimize the possibility of ash bridge formation and to be robust against ash bridges should they occur. The ''inverted candle filter system'' uses arrays of thin-walled, ceramic candle-type filter elements with inside-surface filtering, and contains the filter elements in metal enclosures for complete separation from ash bridges. The ''sheet filter system'' uses ceramic, flat plate filter elements supported from vertical pipe-header arrays that provide geometry that avoids the buildup of ash bridges and allows free fall of the back-pulse released filter cake. The Optimization of Advanced Filter Systems program is being conducted to evaluate these two advanced designs and to ultimately demonstrate one of the concepts in pilot scale.

This barrier effect can prevent species from migrating and recolonising areas where the species has gone locally extinct as well as restricting access to seasonally available or widely scattered resources.|$|R
40|$|The Westinghouse Science & Technology Center has {{proposed}} a novel moving granular bed filter concept, the Standleg Moving Granular Bed Filter (SMGBF). The SMGBF has inherent advantages over the current state-of-the-art moving granular bed filter technology and is potentially competitive with ceramic <b>barrier</b> <b>filters.</b> The SMGBF system combines several unique features that make it highly effective for use in advanced coal-fueled power plants, such as pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), and integrated coal-gasification combined cycles (IGCC). The SMGBF is being developed in a phased program having an initial Base Contract period followed by optional periods. The Base Contract period was successfully completed and previously documented by Westinghouse. The Option 1 period, {open_quote}Component Test Facilities{close_quotes}, has also been completed and its results are reported in this document. The objective of the Option 1 program was to optimize {{the performance of the}} SMGBF system through component testing focused on the major technology issues. The SMGBF {{has been shown to be}} a viable technology in both cold flow simulations and high-temperature, high-pressure testing, and conditions to lead to best performance levels have been identified. Several development activities remain to be complete before the SMGBF can achieve commercial readiness...|$|R
