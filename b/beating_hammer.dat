There was a renewed appeal for information made, and two replica exhibits of evidence were shown to the media for the first time. A precision panel <b>beating</b> <b>hammer</b> with a black rubber handle, a red painted section and a soft rubber head was found at the scene, and police asked the public for help in tracing its origins. Similar mallets are used by panel beaters or mechanics repairing motorcycles. Also, a distinctive green [...] "Cosatto" [...] high-backed children's car booster seat carrying a [...] "Little Monster" [...] motif {{as well as a}} graphic of a monster was in the car when it was stolen. The child car seat - suitable for babies and young children - cost €119 to buy, and may have been dumped, offered for sale or given as a gift as investigators believe was taken out of the stolen vehicle before it was used in the killing.|$|E

50|$|Common tools {{used for}} {{planishing}} include panel <b>beating</b> <b>hammers,</b> slappers, and neck hammers. Heavy rawhide or hardwood hammers are often used. It {{is more difficult}} to make mistakes with heavy rawhide or wood mallets, but they are less effective for large imperfections. A worker, using repeated, relatively soft glancing blows, smooths the metal toward the curvature of the stake. If the metal begins to look dimpled, the worker is using too much force in individual hammer blows.|$|R

Its primary weapon is the Science Sword (Kagaku Ken), which it destroys monsters with its {{finishing}} attack, the Lightning Gravity Fall (Inazuma Jūryoku Otoshi). Its other weapons are the Dyna Knuckles (Daina Nakkuru), Dyna Shield (Daina Shīrudo), Dyna Boomerang (Daina Būmeran) and the <b>Beat</b> <b>Hammer</b> (Bīto Hanmā). Its other attacks are the Tornado Punch (Tatsumaki Panchi) and the Dyna Flash (Daina Furasshu).|$|R

6000|$|I {{wonder why}} the head {{coppersmith}} in an Italian town, always lives {{next door to the}} Hotel, or opposite: making the visitor feel as if the <b>beating</b> <b>hammers</b> were his own heart, palpitating with a deadly energy! I wonder why jealous corridors surround the bedroom on all sides, and fill it with unnecessary doors that can't be shut, and will not open, and abut on pitchy darkness! I wonder why it is not enough that these distrustful genii stand agape at one's dreams all night, but there must also be round open portholes, high in the wall, suggestive, when a mouse or rat is heard behind the wainscot, of a somebody scraping the wall with his toes, in his endeavours to reach one of these portholes and look in! I {{wonder why the}} faggots are so constructed, as to know of no effect but an agony of heat when they are lighted and replenished, and an agony of cold and suffocation at all other times! I wonder, above all, why it is the great feature of domestic architecture in Italian inns, that all the fire goes up the chimney, except the smoke! ...|$|R

60|$|Here {{he threw}} himself down in a great chair, and verily, by the time I had washed and attired myself, I had to shake him by the {{shoulder}} to arouse him. Thus I was carried to the Maid's lodging, my heart <b>beating</b> like a <b>hammer</b> with hopes and fears.|$|R
60|$|The whole crew {{seems to}} compose the band, and, {{like a lot}} of monkey-folk rejoicing in rude rhythm, {{emphasizes}} the <b>beat</b> by <b>hammering</b> kerosene cans, frying-pans, and all sorts of things metallic or reverberant. Some genius has rigged a line to the clapper of the ship's bell on the forecastle-head and clangs it horribly in the big foo-foo crises, though Bombini can be heard censuring him severely on occasion. And to cap it all, the fog-horn machine pumps in at the oddest moments in imitation of a big bass viol.|$|R
50|$|Team Solomid has won two of {{the past}} three championships since being acquired. Despite roster changes, they have had an {{remarkable}} runs in the North American Vainglory scene. During the 2016 Vainglory Summer Live Championships, Team SoloMid went 9-0 throughout the event, <b>beating</b> runner up <b>Hammers</b> Velocity with a 3-0 score.|$|R
60|$|As {{the hall}} door shut, Campbell started nervously, and, having {{got up from}} the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was {{shivering}} with a kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was like the <b>beat</b> of a <b>hammer.</b>|$|R
50|$|A ”Chanson a dancer“ is {{exhibited}} in the museum. This is a musical machine built {{in the late nineteenth}} century by the Frenchman Folliot. It comes from Verdun and was played in the Café Chantant. It still works thanks to a mechanical spring system and a phonotactical cylinder, through which small <b>hammers</b> <b>beat</b> on the strings and the bells reproduce one of the ten bolted cylinder melodies.|$|R

In these sounds he recognized the diapason, the diapente and the diatessaron, harmony. And the sound that was between the diatessaron and the diapente was by itself dissonant, yet gave completion to that which was the greater sound among them. (p.49) ...|$|R
60|$|Marston fell {{forward with}} his oar and fought for breath. His heart <b>beat</b> like a <b>hammer,</b> {{his arms and}} legs trembled, and he felt he had not {{strength}} to lift his head. Then the end of his oar struck something and they were alongside Columbine. Rousing himself with an effort, he leaned out and seized a rope. Wyndham got up and began to lift the mast.|$|R
60|$|In the silence, the ticks of {{the clock}} on the mantel-piece seemed like a <b>hammer</b> <b>beating</b> on her ears. Dolores thought of the morning's flat denial of all {{intercourse}} with Flinders! Then the word give occurred to her as a loophole, and her mind did not embrace all the consequences of the denial, she only saw one thing at a time, 'I didn't give it,' she answered, almost inaudibly.|$|R
6000|$|And yet her {{meetings}} with him were now {{a species of}} torture. Her self-respect suffered with every glance of his eyes. He resembled a man suffering from a fever. At times he talked with tiresome intensity about some new situation, quoting his own characters, <b>beating</b> and <b>hammering</b> at his scenes until Helen closed her eyes for very weariness. Only at wide intervals did he return to some dim realization of his indebtedness to her. One day he gratified her by saying, with a note of tenderness in his voice: [...] "You are keeping the old play on; don't do it. Throw it away; it is a tract--a sermon." [...] Then spoiled it all by bitterly adding, [...] "Go back to your old successes." ...|$|R
5000|$|The author {{reveals the}} heart and soul of a {{metropolitan}} police department. With Charlotte as her simmering background, she propels us into the core of the force through the lives of a dynamic trio of heroes: Andy Brazil, an ambitious younger reporter for The Charlotte Observer and an eager - sometimes too eager - volunteer cop; Police Chief Judy Hammer, the professionally strong yet personally troubled guardian of Charlotte's law and order; and her deputy chief, Virginia West, a genuine head-turner who is married to her job. To walk the <b>beat</b> with <b>Hammer,</b> West, and Brazil is to learn the inner secrets of police work - the tension and the tedium, the hilarity and the heartbreak, the unexpected pump of adrenaline and the rush of courage that can lead to heroics ... or death.|$|R
60|$|As Peter Pupkin {{stood there}} {{listening}} to the sounds in his stockinged feet, his faced showed grey as ashes in the light that fell through the window from the street. His heart <b>beat</b> like a <b>hammer</b> against his ribs. But behind its beatings was the blood of four generations of Loyalists, and the robber who would take that sixty thousand dollars from the Mariposa bank must take it over the dead body of Peter Pupkin, teller.|$|R
50|$|The league {{expanded}} to 11 teams as the Rehovot Silverbacks became the newest expansion franchise. The division format {{was left behind}} {{in favor of a}} simple schedule in which every team played every other team once. The Tel Aviv/Jaffa Sabres became the first team in IFL history to go undefeated throughout the regular season and post-season, as they loaded up on talent and barreled their way through the schedule. The wild card round saw both underdog teams come out victorious, including the Kings' Hail Mary pass to <b>beat</b> the <b>Hammers.</b> In the semifinals, the Sabres crushed the Kings and the Rebels upset the Pioneers in 100+ degree heat. The Sabres and Rebels went toe-to-toe in Israel Bowl VI, but the Sabres pulled away midway through the third quarter, and held on for their second straight title.|$|R
2500|$|The Hammers, with a {{place in}} next year's UEFA Cup and a FA Cup final, now turned their {{attention}} towards securing a top-ten finish, a position they had held {{since the start of}} the campaign. With this objective in mind, as well as the FA Cup final on 13 May, Pardew had a dilemma—whether to stick out his first team and run the risk of injuries and suspensions, or hold back. A [...] "mock" [...] run-up of the FA Cup final saw Liverpool <b>beat</b> the <b>Hammers</b> 2–1 in the league, with a late confrontation involving Hayden Mullins and Luis García seeing both players dismissed via red card, missing the final. In the wake of the match, the Hammers defeated an already-relegated West Brom side 1–0, with a single goal from Nigel Reo-Coker. Dean Ashton limped off with a hamstring injury, making him a doubt for the final.|$|R
5000|$|He won {{the bronze}} {{medal in the}} hammer throw at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Four years later he {{finished}} eleventh in the 1928 Olympic hammer throw competition. In 1923 he <b>beat</b> the British <b>hammer</b> throw record, but did so in a demonstration rather than a competition, so his throw did not count for record purposes. [...] He {{won the gold medal}} for England in the 1930 British Empire Games in the hammer throw contest and finished fifth in the discus throw event. At the 1934 British Empire Games he won again the gold medal in the hammer throw competition.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the film}} Broadway Melody of 1938, Judy Garland (aged 15) sings [...] "You Made Me Love You" [...] while {{looking at a}} {{composite}} picture of Gable. The opening lines are: [...] "Dear Mr. Gable, I am writing this to you, and I {{hope that you will}} read it so you'll know, my heart <b>beats</b> like a <b>hammer,</b> and I stutter and I stammer, every time I see you at the picture show, I guess I'm just another fan of yours, and I thought I'd write and tell you so. You made me love you, I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it..." ...|$|R
60|$|The current swept {{his legs}} under the boat, {{and when he}} tried to lift himself she rolled down with his weight and {{threatened}} to capsize. But he must not be beaten. He was fighting for Carrie's life, and remembering this gave him extra strength. Sliding his hands {{along the side of the}} punt, he let the current take him aft, and then with a desperate effort lifted the upper of his body above the pointed stern. Next moment, he fell forward on the deck and crawled to the well. He had won. He tried to shout, but could not. His heart <b>beat</b> like a <b>hammer</b> and he choked.|$|R
60|$|Our {{trouble is}} sore indeed {{when you turn}} away and will not comfort us. How long the dawn seems coming when we cannot sleep! Oh! those hideous nights when we toss and turn in fever and pain, when we lie, like living men among the dead, staring out into the dark hours that drift so slowly {{between us and the}} light. And oh! those still more hideous nights when we sit by another in pain, when the low fire startles us every now and then with a falling cinder, and the tick of the clock seems a <b>hammer</b> <b>beating</b> out the life that we are watching.|$|R

60|$|Lister went to {{the opera}} with his hosts and was moved by {{the music and the}} feeling {{that he was one of}} a careless, pleasure-seeking crowd. For the most part, his life had been strenuous and the crowds he knew were rude. His home was a bare shack, {{sometimes}} built on the wind-swept alkali plains, and sometimes in the tangled woods. From daybreak until dusk fell, hoarse shouts, the clank of rails, the <b>beat</b> of heavy <b>hammers</b> filled his ears, and often the uproar did not stop at dark. When a soft muskeg swallowed the new track, he must watch, by the flaring blast-lamps, noisy ploughs throw showers of gravel from the ballast cars.|$|R
50|$|McCallum formed {{part of the}} Hammers Under-21 {{development}} squad {{during the}} 2011-12 season. He was loaned out to Rochdale on 31 January 2012. However, the striker returned to his parent club on 9 March 2012 without making a single appearance for the then League One strugglers. McCallum's first involvement with the West Ham United senior squad was on 28 August 2012 as an unused substitute in the Second Round of the Football League Cup, in which the <b>Hammers</b> <b>beat</b> Crewe Alexandra 2-0. On 7 January 2013 McCallum signed a new deal with West Ham United extending his contract with the club for a further two-and-a-half years. He was released by West Ham {{at the end of}} the 2014-15 season.|$|R
50|$|Michael Morales {{was convicted}} of murdering 17-year-old Terri Winchell on January 8, 1981. Winchell was in a love {{triangle}} with Richard Ortega, a cousin of Morales, and another man. Ortega hired Morales to kill Winchell so that Ortega could have exclusive relations with his male lover. According to prosecutors, Morales attacked Winchell from behind and tried to strangle her with his belt. Morales then hit her head with a <b>hammer,</b> <b>beating</b> her into unconsciousness, and crushing the victim's skull. Morales then dragged Winchell face-down across the road and into a vineyard, where he raped her and stabbed her {{four times in the}} chest. Winchell died from both the head and chest wounds.|$|R
5000|$|We {{went off}} on Wednesday to the mines, which were quite a new scene to me and the whole process is very curious and interesting, the boys pushing the little carts full of ore on rails. The little girls washing and picking out the best parts, the bigger ones <b>beating</b> it with <b>hammers</b> all the time, thirty nine in a row, was a very pretty thing. They were all singing hymns which sounded so beautiful, and they looked so {{blooming}} and healthy from being {{so much in the}} air, so different from the appearance of the manufacturing classes in Glasgow.

50|$|In 1970, British League Division Two {{speedway}} {{returned to}} Hull {{for the first}} time since 1949 and proved to be exceedingly popular with large crowds cheering on the Hull Vikings each Wednesday. Hull had the dubious distinction of being the very last league speedway team ever to appear at the famous West Ham Stadium, on 23 May 1972, when they <b>beat</b> the closing <b>Hammers</b> 40-38. Subsequent years saw their promotion to the first division and the inclusion of world champions Barry Briggs, Ivan Mauger and Egon Müller to ride for the team. Promotional changes, falling crowds and financial problems eventually saw the Vikings demise until their resurrection some years later at Hull's other rugby league and speedway stadium, Craven Park.|$|R
5000|$|Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine {{praised the}} score and said [...] "The film's immaculate score, by Hans Zimmer, and sound design, so thick with thunder, wind, the {{chirping}} of crickets, <b>hammers</b> <b>beating</b> nails into wood, whips tearing black bodies to shreds, work in tandem to strongly convey the bucolic, sinister {{atmosphere of the}} antebellum South." [...] Tony Macklin of the Las Vegas Film Critics Society wrote positively of the score, stating [...] "Zimmer creates the hyperactive music. It emphasizes and reemphasizes. It shoves and pounds. It steers and announces. Even the rattle of chains has music behind it." [...] Emma Dibdin of Total Film spoke of the score [...] "a score that’s far more resonant than Hans Zimmer’s oddly conventional effort." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{needed a}} strong {{confidence}} in this assurance to induce them to enter, {{and what they}} saw inside did not diminish their apprehension and alarm. In a large and lofty building, supported by pillars of iron, with great black apertures in the upper walls, open to the external air; echoing to the roof with the <b>beating</b> of <b>hammers</b> and roar of furnaces, mingled with the hissing of red-hot metal plunged in water, and a hundred strange unearthly noises never heard elsewhere; in this gloomy place, moving like demons among the flame and smoke, dimly and fitfully seen, flushed and tormented by the burning fires, and wielding great weapons, a faulty blow from any one of which must have crushed some workman's skull, a number of men laboured like giants. Others, reposing upon heaps of coals or ashes, with their faces turned to the black vault above, slept or rested from their toil. Others again, opening the white-hot furnace-doors, cast fuel on the flames, which came rushing and roaring forth to meet it, and licked it up like oil. Others drew forth, with clashing noise, upon the ground, great sheets of glowing steel, emitting an insupportable heat, and a dull deep light like that which reddens {{in the eyes of}} savage beasts.|$|R
2500|$|As Shirley Ledford {{began to}} cry, she pleaded with Bittaker, saying, [...] "No, don't touch me." [...] In response, Bittaker again {{ordered her to}} scream as loud as she wished, then began {{alternately}} striking her with a <b>hammer,</b> <b>beating</b> her breasts with his fists and torturing her with pliers both between and throughout instances when he raped and sodomized her. Repeatedly, Ledford can be heard pleading for the abuse to cease and making statements such as, [...] "Oh no! No!" [...] as sounds of Bittaker alternately extracting either the sledgehammer or the pliers from the toolbox can be heard on a tape recorder he had switched on after entering {{the rear of the}} van. Norris later described hearing [...] "screams ... constant screams" [...] emanating {{from the rear of the}} van as he drove.|$|R
