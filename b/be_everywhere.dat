5|$|Laurie Mains had {{returned}} from South Africa to coach Otago in the 2001 NPC, and after Peter Sloane moved to the Blues, Mains was appointed the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season started with a narrow 3028 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium, after leading 2827 at one point. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams; a Grand Slam {{that they had not}} achieved since 1998. The closest of those four victories was a 2120 win over the Stormers in Cape Town. They also defeated the Brumbies 2518 in Canberra, The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. Highland prop said of the game against the Blues “While I’m sure Gordy was popular in Auckland during his time coaching up there, as he’d seemed to <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> he went, the trophy meant a huge amount to us and we were determined to be the first winners to honour his memory”. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 153 at half time, and eventually won 2013. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders’ 4026 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. With their eight victories from the regular season, the Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch in their semi-final. The Crusaders won 3423 although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E

25|$|One {{squadron}} (up to 64 men {{in total}} in its four patrol troops) from the UK-based 22 Special Air Service deployed to Borneo in early 1963 {{in the aftermath}} of the Brunei Revolt to gather information in the border area about Indonesian infiltration. There was a special forces presence until the end of the campaign. Faced with a border of 971 miles, they could not <b>be</b> <b>everywhere,</b> and, at this time, 22 SAS had only three squadrons, although there was also the Special Boat Service (SBS) that had two sections based in Singapore. Tactical HQ of 22 SAS deployed to Kuching in 1964 to take control of all special forces. The special forces shortage was exacerbated by the need for them in South Arabia, in many ways a far more demanding task in challenging conditions against a cunning and aggressive opponent.|$|E

500|$|Expressed {{justifications}} {{for refusing to}} obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from {{a deep sense of}} responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of conscription that should <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> condemned before the world can ever become safe for real democracy. A conscientious objector, however, does not have a primary aim of changing the law. John Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of [...] "moral innocency" [...] and inexpertness in moral training: [...] "the moving force of events is always too much for conscience". The remedy was not to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to connect conscience with forces moving in another direction- to build institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law, for example, [...] "then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of being forever the martyred and the coerced." [...] As an example, Albert Einstein who had advocated conscientious objection during the First World War and had been a longterm supporter of War Resisters' International reasoned that [...] "radical pacifism" [...] could not be justified in the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist organization with its own professional army.|$|E
500|$|There were racial {{tensions}} between black US athletes and their white counterparts; in one incident, African Americans blocked whites from the track. One black runner, Tommie Smith, told writers on October 15, [...] "I don't want Brundage presenting me any medals". The following day, Smith won the 200 meters, and fellow African-American John Carlos took the bronze medal. The two men, after receiving their medals from IAAF president Lord Exeter, and as [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] played, raised black-gloved fists, heads down, in salute of black power. Although the USOC initially only reprimanded the two men, {{under pressure from}} the IOC, two days after the race it suspended them from the team and expelled them from the Olympic Village. Other demonstrations by African-Americans also took place: the three African Americans who took the medals in the 400 meters race, led by gold medalist Lee Evans, wore black berets during the anthem (they were not disciplined by the USOC) while African-American boxer George Foreman, triumphant in the heavyweight division, waved an American flag around the boxing ring and with fellow American boxers invited Brundage to their victory celebration. Brundage's comment about the Smith-Carlos incident was [...] "Warped mentalities and cracked personalities seem to <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> and impossible to eliminate." [...] The USOC's official report omits the iconic photograph of Smith and Carlos with their fists raised; the local organizing committee's official film showed footage of the ceremony. Brundage, who termed the incident [...] "the nasty demonstration against the American flag by negroes", objected in vain to its inclusion.|$|E
500|$|Other {{issues of}} {{contention}} include {{the lack of}} historical context; the film does not cover some of the {{events leading up to}} Chávez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered [...] "how to defend themselves against possible... attacks" [...] from Chávez's supporters. In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held [...] "long before" [...] the events of April 2002. Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast. Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor Freddy Bernal as he sings to a happy group of Chávez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a [...] "differently dressed Bernal" [...] reveal that the footage was from another day. Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, [...] "The opposition march was entirely peaceful." [...] The film presents footage of its [...] "violent finale"—including an image from another day—as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that [...] "some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight". Bartley and ÓBriain admit that they included a [...] "limited" [...] amount of archive footage, but say it was a [...] "legitimate reconstruction" [...] to build context [...] "before the core narrative of the coup [...] off" [...] as they [...] "could not <b>be</b> <b>everywhere</b> filming at all times".|$|E
