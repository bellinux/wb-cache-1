40|$|Abstract. PET/PTT <b>bicomponent</b> <b>filament</b> {{composed}} of PTT and PET arranged side-by-side often manifest high curliness after being thermally stimulated at different temperature. In this article, we report {{an investigation of}} the effect of thermal stimuli on the performances of PET/PTT <b>bicomponent</b> <b>filament</b> under various temperatures. Both the original and the thermally stimulated ones were characterized by mechanical, thermal, thermo-mechanical and optical methods. The changes of other relevant properties were also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} develop PET/PTT <b>bicomponent</b> <b>filament,</b> the {{structure}} informations of PET/PTT fibers with different spinning parameters were got by density method, Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD), sonic orientation and Differiential Scanning Calority (DSC). Their mechanical and crimp properties were got from Instron 5566. On the spinning line, the PET component will crystal firstly and has higher draw inducing orientation and crystallinity than the PET fiber under the same spinning parameters, and those of PTT component are {{lower than those of}} PTT fiber. The crimp shrinkage and the elongation, the sonic orientation factor and the crystallinity of each component will improve with the increasing difference of the viscousity of two polymers. The crimp shrinkage and the elongation of the PET/PTT fiber are the highest when the content of the two components is equal. The crystallinity of each component decreases and the sonic orientation factor increases with the increasing difference of the content of two polymer...|$|E
