5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second byte and the 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third byte and the 4 high <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 bytes. The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Prior to filming, Clarkson's {{contract}} was not renewed by the BBC {{after he was}} involved in an altercation with a Top Gear producer in March 2015, leaving Hammond, May, and Wilman to follow him in departing the show following the end of the series. Later in 2015, they signed a deal with Amazon to create an original series. Filming for the introduction and tent scenes took place in Los Angeles, California in September 2016. The episode features the trio introducing the new <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show, as well as their film. For the film, the trio traveled in three supercars to the Algarve International Circuit in Portugal, where they had timed laps performed by race car driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio.|$|E
50|$|This table {{specifies}} {{the input}} permutation on a 64-bit block. The meaning is as follows: <b>the</b> first <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output {{is taken from}} <b>the</b> 58th <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input; the second bit from the 50th bit, and so on, with <b>the</b> last <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output taken from <b>the</b> 7th <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input.|$|R
50|$|Bit interleaving: The Walsh {{function}} {{for the first}} character in a block is constructed from <b>the</b> 1st <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st symbol, <b>the</b> 2nd <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd symbol, and so on.

5000|$|Stylistically this harkens {{back to the}} band's heavier roots with {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternative style still present. The band had claimed the sound would be [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old and a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new".|$|R
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking at the {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of the}} system into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{the last}} six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code point are stored in the low order six <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final byte, and again 10 is stored in the high order two bits (10).|$|E
25|$|Calculations can be {{completed}} a little faster if all <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significand {{are present in the}} register.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> most {{significant}} <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first number is 1 and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second number is also 1 so <b>the</b> {{most significant}} <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result is 1; {{in the second}} most significant <b>bit,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> second number is zero, so we have the result as 0.|$|R
5000|$|Diffusion {{means that}} if we change a single <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plaintext, then (statistically) half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> in the {{ciphertext}} should change, and similarly, if we change one <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext, then approximately one half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plaintext <b>bits</b> should change.|$|R
3000|$|... (3)The {{interleaved}} P 1 and P 2 streams are interlaced bit by bit. The interleaved and interlaced {{parity bit}} streams are {{written into the}} buffer in sequence, with <b>the</b> first <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream next to <b>the</b> last <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interleaved systematic <b>bit</b> stream.|$|R

25|$|Overflow is {{detected}} {{the same way}} as for addition, by examining the two leftmost (most significant) <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borrows; overflow has occurred if they are different.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit {{is driven by the}} XOR of some <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall shift register value.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} {{may arise from}} non-uniform distributions used in cryptography. For example, consider a 1000000-digit binary one-time pad using exclusive or. If the pad has 1000000 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> entropy, it is perfect. If the pad has 999999 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> entropy, evenly distributed (each individual <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad having 0.999999 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> entropy) it may provide good security. But if the pad has 999999 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> entropy, where <b>the</b> first bit is fixed and the remaining 999999 bits are perfectly random, then <b>the</b> first <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ciphertext will not be encrypted at all.|$|R

50|$|The {{feedback}} {{bit mask}} is 1001001010010010101001111002. Again with the convention that the {{least significant bit}} is <b>the</b> output <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LFSR and the most significant bit is <b>the</b> shift-in <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LFSR, 0 means no feedback into that position, and 1 means feedback into that position.|$|R
25|$|System mode (ARMv4 and above): The only {{privileged mode}} {{that is not}} entered by an exception. It can only be entered by {{executing}} an instruction that explicitly writes to the mode <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Current Program Status Register (CPSR).|$|E
25|$|Header extension: (optional) The first 32-bit word {{contains}} a profile-specific identifier (16 bits) and a length specifier (16 bits) that indicates {{the length of}} the extension (EHL = extension header length) in 32-bit units, excluding the 32 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extension header.|$|E
25|$|The FAT12 {{file system}} uses 12 bits per FAT entry, thus two entries span 3 bytes. It is {{consistently}} little-endian: if those three bytes are {{considered as one}} little-endian 24-bit number, the 12 least significant bits represent the first entry (f.e. cluster 0) and the 12 most significant bits the second (f.e cluster 1). In other words, while the low eight <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first cluster in the row are stored in the first byte, the top four bits are stored in the low nibble of the second byte, whereas the low four <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsequent cluster in the row are stored in the high nibble of the second byte and its higher eight bits in the third byte.|$|E
50|$|In a unibit phase-locked loop, {{the phase}} is {{measured}} using only one <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference and output counters, {{the most significant}} bit (MSB). In a multibit phase-locked loop, the phase is measured using more than one <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference and output counters, usually including the most significant bit.|$|R
50|$|The {{expansion}} {{function is}} interpreted {{as for the}} initial and final permutations. Note that some bits from the input are duplicated at the output; e.g. <b>the</b> fifth <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input is duplicated in both the sixth and eighth <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output. Thus, the 32-bit half-block is expanded to 48 bits.|$|R

25|$|Here, XS and YS {{represent}} the sign <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement vectors, XV and YV indicate an overflow in the respective vector component, and LB, MB and RB indicate {{the status of}} the left, middle and right mouse buttons (1 = pressed). PS/2 mice also understand several commands for reset and self-test, switching between different operating modes, and changing the resolution of the reported motion vectors.|$|E
25|$|SDXC {{cards are}} allowed to use all 22 <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to {{indicate}} a capacity of over 32GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.|$|E

25|$|Because {{rotational}} inertia {{is a part}} of angular momentum, it necessarily includes all of the complications of moment of inertia, which is calculated by multiplying elementary <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass by the squares of their distances from the center of rotation. Therefore, the total moment of inertia, and the angular momentum, is a complex function of the configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits.|$|E
25|$|In June 1994, Intel {{engineers}} {{discovered a}} flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the P5 Pentium microprocessor. Under certain data-dependent conditions, the low-order <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result of a floating-point division would be incorrect. The error could compound in subsequent calculations. Intel corrected the error in a future chip revision, and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective Pentium CPUs (which were limited to some 60, 66, 75, 90, and 100MHz models) on customer request.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{algorithms}} {{that are}} exact and yet run in sub-linear time use parallel processing (as the NC1 matrix determinant calculation does), non-classical processing (as Grover's search does), or alternatively have guaranteed assumptions on the input structure (as the logarithmic time binary search and many tree maintenance algorithms do). However, formal languages {{such as the}} set of all strings that have a 1-bit in the position indicated by the first log(n) <b>bits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> string may depend on every bit of the input and yet be computable in sub-linear time.|$|E
