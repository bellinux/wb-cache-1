[Subjects] Eleven male and 7 female computer users in their early 20 s and 10 male and 6 female computer users in their late 20 s participated in this study. [Methods] All cervical ROM measure-ments were taken with a Cervical Range of Motion Instrument. Electromyographic (EMG) data were obtained for analyzing the FR ratio. [Results] Cervical extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left rotation in the late 20 <b>s</b> <b>computer</b> users were significantly lower compared with the cervical motions in the early 20 <b>s</b> <b>computer</b> us-ers. The cervical FRR in the late 20 <b>s</b> <b>computer</b> users was significantly lower compared with the cervical FRR in the early 20 <b>s</b> <b>computer</b> users. [Conclusion] This {{study was conducted to}} be prepared that the possibility for young computer generations in Korea could easily develop chronic neck pain...|$|R

In a second phase starting in the late 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>computer</b> systems were developed for real time monitoring supporting human control of the power grid.
