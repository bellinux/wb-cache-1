40|$|We {{develop a}} {{generalization}} of the Black-Cox structural model of default risk. The extended model captures uncertainty related to firm's ability to avoid default even if company's liabilities momentarily exceeding its assets. Diffusion in a linear potential with the radiation boundary condition {{is used to}} mimic a company's default process. The exact solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation allows for derivation of analytical expressions for the cumulative probability of default and the relevant hazard rate. Obtained closed formulas fit well the historical data on global corporate defaults and demonstrate the split behavior of credit spreads for <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> in different categories of speculative-grade ratings with varying time to maturity. Introduction of the finite rate of default at the boundary improves valuation of credit risk for short time horizons, which is the key advantage of the proposed model. We also consider the influence of uncertainty in the initial distance to the default barrier {{on the outcome of}} the model and demonstrate that this additional source of incomplete information may be responsible for non-zero credit spreads for bonds with very short time to maturity. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to {{document}} the presence of a private premium in public bonds. We find that spreads are 31 basis points higher for public <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> private <b>companies</b> than for <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> public <b>companies,</b> even after controlling for observable differences, including rating, financial performance, industry, bond characteristics and issuance timing. The estimated private premium increases to 40 - 50 basis points when a propensity matching methodology is used or when we control for fixed issuer effects. Despite the premium pricing, <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> private <b>companies</b> are no more likely to default or be downgraded than are public bonds. They do not have worse secondary market performance or higher credit default swap spreads nor are they necessarily less liquid. Bond investors appear to discount the value of privately held equity. The effect does not come only from the lack of a public market signal of asset quality, because very small public companies also pay high spreads...|$|R

50|$|In {{synthetic}} transactions, {{credit risk}} of the Reference Portfolio is transferred to the SPV via credit default swaps. For each name in the portfolio the SPV enters into a credit default swap where the SPV sells credit protection to the bank {{in return for a}} periodically paid premium. The cash raised from the sale of the various classes of notes, i.e.; Class A, B, C and D in the above example, is placed in collateral securities. Typically these are AAA rated notes issued by supranationals, governments, governmental organizations, or covered bonds (Pfandbrief). These are low-risk instruments with a return slightly below the interbank market yield. If there is a default in the portfolio, the credit default swap for that entity is triggered and the bank demands the loss suffered for that entity from the SPV. For example if the bank has entered into a credit default swap for $10,000,000 on Company A and this company is bankrupt the bank will demand $10,000,000 less the recovery amount from the SPV. The recovery amount is the secondary market price <b>of</b> $10,000,000 <b>of</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Company</b> A after bankruptcy. Typically recovery amount is assumed to be 40% but this number changes depending on the credit cycle, industry type, and depending on the company in question. Hence, if recovery amount is $4,000,000 (working on 40% recovery assumption), the bank receives $6,000,000 from the SPV. In order to pay this money, the SPV has to liquidate some collateral securities to pay the bank. Having lost some assets, the SPV has to reduce some liabilities as well and it does so by reducing the notional of the equity notes. Hence, after the first default in the portfolio, the equity notes, i.e.; Class D notes in the above example are reduced to $24,000,000 from $30,000,000.|$|R

25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations.

A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} <b>bonds</b> or loans <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices.

A key factor, which increases the return on investment at a constant level of risk, is to diversify risk in the preparation of the portfolio.

Four types of securities with different levels of risk and return, which theoretically can be invested pension funds are taken for analysis. Opportunities for investment securities in the simple and expanded portfolios are determined on the basis of existing legislation. Portfolios with different risk levels are compared.

Critics argue that the government-sponsored reorganization impermissibly elevated claims of the auto union over those of Chrysler‘s other creditors. If the critics are correct, businesses might suffer an increase in their cost of debt because creditors will perceive a new risk, that organized labor might leap-frog them in bankruptcy. We examine the financial market where this effect would be most detectible, the market for <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> highly unionized <b>companies.</b> We find {{no evidence of a}} negative reaction to the Chrysler bailout by bondholders of unionized firms.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} methods and the empirical results {{of various types}} of arbitrage strategies in past numerical studies. Although arbitrage can be generally dividend into two categories including risk-free arbitrage and risky arbitrage, {{there is still a}} certain level of risk which arbitrageurs should take, no matter what kinds of arbitrage. Since there are limitations and transactions costs in conducting arbitraging strategies, the profit of arbitrage may be plentiful in theory but it could be misleading in practice after considering transactions costs and potential risk. It appears that all arbitrage strategies are theoretically sound, but it is debatable that arbitrage strategies will succeed in the real world. The key factors for arbitrage strategies to succeed depend on how to identify various types of arbitrage strategies, exploit market inefficiency, to reduce transaction costs, and to evaluate potential risk.
