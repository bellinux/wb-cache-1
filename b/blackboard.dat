5|$|When {{service from}} Union Station was inaugurated in 1928, both {{eastbound}} and westbound trains were departing the station almost every hour bound for destinations across the United States. Passengers in the station's expansive waiting room could patronize its news stand, telegraph office, barber shop, shoeshine stand, or its lunch counter and soda fountain. Train schedules were handwritten {{on a large}} <b>blackboard,</b> while station staff announced the arrival and impending departures of the trains by megaphone.|$|E
5|$|While {{the design}} of Monitor was well-suited for river combat, her low {{freeboard}} and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. Under the command of John P. Bankhead, Monitor put to sea on 31 December, under tow from , as a heavy storm developed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Using chalk and a <b>blackboard,</b> Bankhead wrote messages alerting Rhode Island that if Monitor needed help she would signal with a red lantern.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; the <b>blackboard</b> and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the <b>blackboards.</b> <b>Blackboards</b> cover available space on the north, east, and south walls.

5|$|With professionalism legalised, Preston flourished. Keen to {{make use}} of tactics, Sudell {{was the first person to}} use a <b>blackboard</b> to dictate {{positions}} and strategy to his players. In 1887, Preston recorded the biggest win in the history of the FA Cup, beating Hyde 26–0 in the first round. The club progressed to the final having amassed a run of 42 consecutive wins in all competitions, but were beaten in the FA Cup Final by West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the <b>blackboard</b> and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The <b>Blackboard</b> Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

5|$|While {{studying}} for his O-levels {{he began to}} have difficulties reading the <b>blackboard</b> and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, he played poorly at school, encumbered by the fragile spectacles. However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned {{for him at the}} behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on to be a strong influence on Boycott's early cricketing game while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school's Individual Cricket Cup. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.|$|E
