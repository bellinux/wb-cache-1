6000|$|The {{last words}} burst on {{me like a}} gleam of light! I had read them in the Report of the Trial--in the {{evidence}} of the sheriff's officer. Miserrimus Dexter had spoken in those very terms when he had tried vainly to prevent the men from seizing my husband's papers, and when the men had pushed his chair out of the room. There was no doubt now of what his memory was busy with. The mystery at Gleninch! His last <b>backward</b> <b>flight</b> of thought circled feebly and more feebly nearer and nearer to the mystery at Gleninch! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{states that}} at the moment of the {{explosion}} he distinctly thought he was killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward. It is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his <b>backward</b> <b>flight,</b> and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm. For a moment the concussion stunned him. He became aware at once of a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear the voice of Lidgett asking for him. You will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused.|$|E
60|$|Again our swords clashed, and my blows now fell as swift on his blade as his {{had done}} awhile ago on mine. So hard did I press {{him that he}} was forced to give way before me. Back I drove him pace by pace, his wrist growing weaker at each parry, each parry growing wider, and the {{perspiration}} streaming down his ashen face. Panting he went, in that <b>backward</b> <b>flight</b> before my onslaught, defending himself as best he could, never thinking of a riposte--beaten already. Back, and yet back he went, until he reached the railings and could back no farther, and so broken was his spirit then that a groan escaped him. I answered with a laugh--my mood was lusty and cruel--and thrust at him. Then, eluding his guard, I thrust again, beneath it, and took him fairly {{in the middle of his}} doublet.|$|E
60|$|When I did {{understand}} I {{tried to}} cheat {{myself into the}} belief {{that there was no}} change, and the dear heart bleeding for me assisted in that poor pretence. She sought to glide to me with swimming eyes as before, but it showed only that this caressing movement was still within her compass, but never again for me. With the hands she had pressed to her breast she touched mine, but no longer could they convey the message. The current was broken, and soon we had to desist miserably from our pretences. She could tell no more than I why she had ceased to love me; she was scarcely less anxious than I that I should make her love me again, and, as I have said, she waited with a wonderful tolerance while I strove futilely to discover in what I was lacking and to remedy it. And when, at last, she had to leave me, it was with compassionate cries and little <b>backward</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|On most aircraft, {{the wing}} centre of lift moves forward and <b>backward</b> {{according}} to <b>flight</b> conditions. If {{it does not}} align with the centre of gravity, a corrective or trim force must be applied to prevent the aircraft pitching and thus to maintain equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|The {{helicopter}} {{is controlled}} using a two lever control unit. The controls operate {{similar to a}} real helicopter. The throttle control provides proportional control of the blade speed. The pitch control provides for tilting the Vertibird forward or <b>backward.</b> During <b>flight</b> the VertiBird {{is subject to the}} same physical flight characteristics as a real helicopter. This included ground-effects for low level hovering, plus altitude gains and losses when changing direction. Overall the VertiBird is easy to learn how to pilot for basic flight, but precision flying will require some patience and time on the controls as in a real helicopter.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing in Rome helps your fancy {{to a more}} {{vigorous}} <b>backward</b> <b>flight</b> than to lounge {{on a sunny day}} over the railing which guards the great central researches. It [...] "says" [...] more things to you than you can repeat to see the past, the ancient world, as you stand there, bodily turned up with the spade and transformed from an immaterial, inaccessible fact of time into a matter of soils and surfaces. The pleasure is the same--in kind--as what you enjoy of Pompeii, and the pain the same. It wasn't here, however, that I found my compensation for forfeiting the spectacle on the Corso, but in a little church {{at the end of the}} narrow byway which diverges up the Palatine from just beside the Arch of Titus. This byway leads you between high walls, then takes a bend and introduces you to a long row of rusty, dusty little pictures of the stations of the cross. Beyond these stands a small church with a front so modest that you hardly recognise it till you see the leather curtain. I never see a leather curtain without lifting it; it is sure to cover a constituted scene of some sort--good, bad or indifferent. The scene this time was meagre--whitewash and tarnished candlesticks and mouldy muslin flowers being its principal features. I shouldn't have remained if I hadn't been struck with the attitude of the single worshipper--a young priest kneeling before one of the sidealtars, who, as I entered, lifted his head and gave me a sidelong look so charged with the languor of devotion that he immediately became an object of interest. He was visiting each of the altars in turn and kissing the balustrade beneath them. He was alone in the church, and indeed in the whole region. There were no beggars even at the door; they were plying their trade on the skirts of the Carnival. In the entirely deserted place he alone knelt for religion, and as I sat respectfully by it seemed to me I could hear in the perfect silence the far-away uproar of the maskers. It was my late impression of these frivolous people, I suppose, joined with the extraordinary gravity of the young priest's face- -his pious fatigue, his droning prayer and his isolation--that gave me just then and there a supreme vision of the religious passion, its privations and resignations and exhaustions and its terribly small share of amusement. He was young and strong and evidently of not too refined a fibre to enjoy the Carnival; but, planted there with his face pale with fasting and his knees stiff with praying, he seemed so stern a satire on it and on the crazy thousands who were preferring it to his way, that I half expected to see some heavenly portent out of a monastic legend come down and confirm his choice. Yet I confess that though I wasn't enamoured of the Carnival myself, his seemed a grim preference and this forswearing of the world a terrible game--a gaining one only if your zeal never falters; a hard fight when it does. In such an hour, to a stout young fellow like the hero of my anecdote, the smell of incense must seem horribly stale and the muslin flowers and gilt candlesticks to figure no great bribe. And it wouldn't have helped him much to think that not so very far away, just beyond the Forum, in the Corso, there was sport for the million, and for nothing. I doubt on the other hand whether my young priest had thought of this. He had made himself a temple out of the very elements of his innocence, and his prayers followed each other too fast for the tempter to slip in a whisper. And so, as I say, I found a solider fact of human nature than the love of coriandoli.|$|E
60|$|The {{charm of}} the Mediterranean coast only deepened for our heroine on acquaintance, for it was the {{threshold}} of Italy, the gate of admirations. Italy, as yet imperfectly seen and felt, stretched before her as a land of promise, a land in which a love of the beautiful might be comforted by endless knowledge. Whenever she strolled upon the shore with her cousin--and she was the companion of his daily walk--she looked across the sea, with longing eyes, to where she knew that Genoa lay. She was glad to pause, however, {{on the edge of}} this larger adventure; there was such a thrill even in the preliminary hovering. It affected her moreover as a peaceful interlude, as a hush of the drum and fife in a career which she had little warrant as yet for regarding as agitated, but which nevertheless she was constantly picturing to herself by the light of her hopes, her fears, her fancies, her ambitions, her predilections, and which reflected these subjective accidents in a manner sufficiently dramatic. Madame Merle had predicted to Mrs. Touchett that after their young friend had put her hand into her pocket half a dozen times she would be reconciled to the idea that it had been filled by a munificent uncle; and the event justified, as it had so often justified before, that lady's perspicacity. Ralph Touchett had praised his cousin for being morally inflammable, that is for being quick to take a hint that was meant as good advice. His advice had perhaps helped the matter; she had at any rate before leaving San Remo grown used to feeling rich. The consciousness in question found a proper place in rather a dense little group of ideas that she had about herself, and often it was by no means the least agreeable. It took perpetually for granted a thousand good intentions. She lost herself in a maze of visions; the fine things to be done by a rich, independent, generous girl who took a large human view of occasions and obligations were sublime in the mass. Her fortune therefore became to her mind a part of her better self; it gave her importance, gave her even, to her own imagination, a certain ideal beauty. What it did for her in the imagination of others is another affair, and on this point we must also touch in time. The visions I have just spoken of were mixed with other debates. Isabel liked better to think of the future than of the past; but at times, as she listened to the murmur of the Mediterranean waves, her glance took a <b>backward</b> <b>flight.</b> It rested upon two figures which, in spite of increasing distance, were still sufficiently salient; they were recognisable without difficulty as those of Caspar Goodwood and Lord Warburton. It was strange how quickly these images of energy had fallen into the background of our young lady's life. It was in her disposition at all times to lose faith in the reality of absent things; she could summon back her faith, in case of need, with an effort, but the effort was often painful even when the reality had been pleasant. The past was apt to look dead and its revival rather to show the livid light of a judgement-day. The girl moreover was not prone to take for granted that she herself lived in the mind of others--she had not the fatuity to believe she left indelible traces. She was capable of being wounded by the discovery that she had been forgotten; but of all liberties the one she herself found sweetest was the liberty to forget. She had not given her last shilling, sentimentally speaking, either to Caspar Goodwood or to Lord Warburton, and yet couldn't but feel them appreciably in debt to her. She had of course reminded herself that she was to hear from Mr. Goodwood again; but this was not to be for another year and a half, and in that time a great many things might happen. She had indeed failed to say to herself that her American suitor might find some other girl more comfortable to woo; because, though it was certain many other girls would prove so, she had not the smallest belief that this merit would attract him. But she reflected that she herself might know the humiliation of change, might really, for that matter, {{come to the end of}} the things that were not Caspar (even though there appeared so many of them), and find rest in those very elements of his presence which struck her now as impediments to the finer respiration. It was conceivable that these impediments should some day prove a sort of blessing in disguise--a clear and quiet harbour enclosed by a brave granite breakwater. But that day could only come in its order, and she couldn't wait for it with folded hands. That Lord Warburton should continue to cherish her image seemed to her more than a noble humility or an enlightened pride ought to wish to reckon with. She had so definitely undertaken to preserve no record of what had passed between them that a corresponding effort on his own part would be eminently just. This was not, as it may seem, merely a theory tinged with sarcasm. Isabel candidly believed that his lordship would, in the usual phrase, get over his disappointment. He had been deeply affected--this she believed, and she was still capable of deriving pleasure from the belief; but it was absurd that a man both so intelligent and so honourably dealt with should cultivate a scar out of proportion to any wound. Englishmen liked moreover to be comfortable, said Isabel, and there could be little comfort for Lord Warburton, in the long run, in brooding over a self-sufficient American girl who had been but a casual acquaintance. She flattered herself that, should she hear from one day to another that he had married some young woman of his own country who had done more to deserve him, she should receive the news without a pang even of surprise. It would have proved that he believed she was firm--which was what she wished to seem to him. That alone was grateful to her pride.|$|E

50|$|With Liberty Bell 7 at an {{altitude}} of 118.26 mi, it was now time to position the spacecraft in its reentry attitude.

40|$|The {{pressure}} sensors tested {{consisted of a}} perforated sphere static, a twin venturi pitot arrangement, designed to permit the derivation of dynamic pressure in both forward and <b>backward</b> <b>flight,</b> and a Mk. 8 T pitot-static head.

This pitot-static head was then calibrated over a range of incidence and sideslip angles and error contours ware plotted to facilitate the correction of the indicated static and dynamic pressures recorded in flight. The wind vanes measuring sideslip and incidence were also calibrated over the same range and error contours plotted for the correction of their indications. Finally the dynamic response of the wind vanes was investigated to determine their natural frequency and damping and hence their amplitude ratio and phase lag when recording aircraft oscillations...|$|E
40|$|Recently Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) {{imitating the}} {{mechanism}} of birds or insects have been developed. As hummingbirds ’ characteristics are regarded as an appropriate candidate for MAV model, the studies of hummingbirds’ aerodynamics and mechanics in relation to MAV are conducted. In this paper, an axiomatic design approach to develop a wing driving mechanism for MAV mimicking hummingbirds is proposed. Functional requirements (FRs) for the mechanism are defined through {{the analysis of the}} hummingbirds ’ wing motions involving hovering, forward, and <b>backward</b> <b>flight.</b> Five FRs are introduced at the highest level. Constraints (Cs) in size and weight are taken from the limitation employed in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s MAV program. Design parameters (DPs) are conceived in physical domain to satisfy these specified FRs and Cs. Through the process of mapping and zigzagging to decompose to the next level, totally fifteen FRs and the same number of DPs are defined. The wing driving mechanism design is proved to be decoupled by design equation. Also we can reduce the complexity of the mechanism by physical integration...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the ground testing of the {{technological}} demonstrator of the innovativeremotely controlled ETF airship. The testing activities are intended to validate the flight control system of the ETF, {{which is based on}} the thrust vectoring technology and represents one of the major innovations of the ETF design, together with the airship architecture. A research team of the Aeronautical and Space Department of the Polytechnic of Turin, in collaboration with Nautilus, a small Italian private company, has been working since a few years on the ETF (Elettra Twin Flyers). This airship is remotely-piloted, with high maneuverability capabilities and good operative features also in adverse atmospheric conditions. The Nautilus new concept airship features architecture and appropriate command system, which should enable the vehicle to maneuver in forward, <b>backward</b> and sideward <b>flight</b> and hovering with any heading, both in normal and severe wind conditions. To achieve these capabilities the ETF demonstrator 3 has been conceived with a highly non conventional architecture based on a double hull with a central plane housing structure, propellers, on board electric system and payload. As primary command system, the aerodynamic control surfaces are replaced by six propellers, which are moved by electrical motors and allow the airship to be controlled and maneuvered in the whole flight envelope. In this paper the results of the preliminary testing runs are analyzed and the power requirement is compared with the performance of the Fuel Cell system, purposely developed for the ETF Demonstrator...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{concentration}} {{and distribution of}} atmospheric aerosols using both airborne lidar and satellite instruments is a field of active research. An aircraft based aerosol lidar {{has been used to}} study the distribution of atmospheric aerosols in the California Central Valley and eastern US coast. Concurrently, satellite aerosol retrievals, from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, were take over the Central Valley. The MODIS Level 2 aerosol data product provides retrieved ambient aerosol optical properties (e. g., optical depth (AOD) and size distribution) globally over ocean and land at a spatial resolution of 10 km. The Central Valley topography was overlaid with MODIS AOD (5 x 5 sq km resolution) and the aerosol scattering vertical profiles from a lidar <b>flight.</b> <b>Backward</b> air parcel trajectories for the lidar data show that air from the Pacific and northern part of the Central Valley converge confining the aerosols to the lower valley region and below the mixed layer. Below an altitude of 1 km, the lidar aerosol and MODIS AOD exhibit good agreement. Both data sets indicate a high presence of aerosols near Bakersfield and the Tehachapi Mountains. These and other results to be presented indicate {{that the majority of the}} aerosols are below the mixed layer such that the MODIS AOD should correspond well with surface measurements. Lidar measurements will help interpret satellite AOD retrievals so that one day they can be used on a routine basis for prediction of boundary layer aerosol pollution events...|$|R

It “says” more things to you than you can repeat to see the past, the ancient world, as you stand there, bodily turned up with the spade and transformed from an immaterial, inaccessible fact of time into a matter of soils and surfaces. —Henry James, Italian Hours, “A Roman Holiday,” 1909 Cultural property offers a significant yet ambiguous example of the development of global regulatory regimes beyond the State. On the one hand, traditional international law instruments do not seem to ensure an adequate level of protection for cultural heritage; securing such protection requires procedures, norms, and standards produced by global institutions, both public (such as UNESCO) and private (such as the International Council of Museums). On the other hand, a comprehensive global regulatory regime to complement the law of cultural property is still to be achieved. Instead, more regimes are being established, depending on the kind of properties and public interests at stake. Moreover, the huge cultural bias that dominates the debate about cultural property accentuates the “clash of civilizations” that already underlies the debate about global governance. The analysis of the relationship between globalization and cultural property, therefore, sheds light on broader global governance trends and helps highlight the points of weakness and strength in the adoption of administrative law techniques at the global level...|$|E
