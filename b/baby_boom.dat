5|$|During the <b>baby</b> <b>boom,</b> DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach {{found new}} life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E

That year {{the congregation}} also updated the synagogue's kitchen, added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium, and the same for the sanctuary in 1953. Ettelson retired the following year, and was succeeded as senior rabbi by James Wax.|$|E
5|$|The {{global economy}} {{suffered}} heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently.

The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945–1948. Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and delayed European recovery for several years.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} <b>baby</b> <b>boom</b> and generous support from the public sector.

5|$|In {{response}} to the post–World War II <b>baby</b> <b>boom,</b> the New South Wales Department of Education, under Bob Heffron, queried the University of Sydney in 1951 on its thoughts about training and certifying schoolteachers by external studies and/or correspondence courses. The university rejected the idea, stating that external degree or certification programs would be significantly inferior to residence education. Undeterred, Heffron asked New England about its willingness to conduct external studies. Madgwick enthusiastically supported the idea and instructed his college's staff to begin preparing an external studies program. Heffron asked the University of Sydney if it had any objection to New England being granted independence to operate the state's external education program. The university replied {{that it had no}} objection.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the New York City Department of City Planning {{projected}} that Manhattan's population will increase by 289,000 people between 2000 and 2030, {{an increase of}} 18.8% over the period, second only to Staten Island, {{while the rest of}} the city is projected to grow by 12.7% over the same period. The school-age population was expected to grow 4.4% by 2030, in contrast to a small decline in the city as a whole. The elderly population was forecast to grow by 57.9%, with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% growth citywide. However, these 2006 projections may have become outdated, as Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a <b>baby</b> <b>boom,</b> well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001. The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 , nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census.

Furthermore, the rates of replication of the many components are often controlled by exogenous parameters causing periods of expansion and contraction, e. g., <b>baby</b> <b>booms</b> and busts, economic booms and recessions, etc. In addition, the sizes of these objects often either have reflective lower boundaries, e. g., cities do not fall bello...|$|R

Big {{changes in the}} level of fertility may affect, some decades later, the opportunities of marriage of eligible individuals, creating a marriage squeeze. Italy provides an interesting case study because since World War II, it has been characterised by alternate periods of declines and rises of the annual number of births an by their differential patterns between regions. In this paper we study the dynamics of the Italian marriage market (year 1969 - 1995) by using some indexes proposed by Schoen as well as two additional measures. The result of regional analysis also suggest that marriage squeeze has also been by international migratory movements. The recent and prolonged phase of steep fertility decline in Italy, together with the drop of international movements, suggests the possibility of a perspective increasing disadvantage of men in the marriage market.

40|$|We analyse an {{overlapping}} generations economy (Diamond, 1965) with pay-as-you-go public {{pensions and}} investigate {{the effect on}} long run neoclassical economic growth and population growth under myopic individuals’ expectations on future interest rates, by comparing the contexts with either exogenous or endogenous fertility.

We found, ceteris paribus, that the interaction between endogenous fertility and PAYG pensions may explain the occurrence of: (i) demographic oscillations that may mimic <b>baby</b> <b>booms</b> and <b>baby</b> busts in contrast with the unrealistic time-constancy of the demographic variable, (ii) economic cycles. Moreover, it is also shown that the possible increase in the social security contribution rate, as advocated by several economists and policymakers as a possible remedy against the crisis of public pension budgets, may exacerbate demographic fluctuations around a lower long-run level of population growth as well as economic cycles around a higher long-run income...|$|R
