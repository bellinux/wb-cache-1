5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to <b>business</b> <b>travel,</b> the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E

Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} <b>business</b> <b>travel,</b> Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} {{example of the}} country’s economic evolution is the international financial services industry based in London. Within this sector aviation services are seen as critically important for both businesses and their clients, even {{in the era of}} video-conferencing. London’s air transport services are widely regarded within the London business community surveyed by the OEF to provide a competitive advantage over the rest of Europe, and expansion of airport capacity in the South East has significant support. Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups, they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a <b>business</b> <b>travel</b> market which is already well served.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. Sunde {{stated that he}} regretted having started the airline, {{and said that he}} had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for <b>business</b> <b>travel.</b> In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK270 million was owed {{for the rest of the}} rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.|$|E

5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals if they saw players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of <b>business</b> <b>travel</b> compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had opt-out clauses that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|E

The survey respondents include business firms that either use or do not use videoconferencing currently. Based on survey data analyses, negative binomial models are developed for the set of current adopters of videoconferencing, and a Poisson regression model is developed for the non-adopters. They suggest substitution relationships between <b>business</b> air <b>travel</b> and videoconferencing for the two groups. However, the substitution effect is perceptibly stronger when videoconferencing {{is used as a}} substitute for <b>business</b> air <b>travel.</b> The analysis highlights that the meeting context significantly influences the choice of the communication mechanism; meeting contexts that do not specifically require face-to-face interaction tend to foster increased videoconferencing usage. Further, the perceptions of the respondents in terms of the relative benefits and weaknesses of each communication option influence the likelihood of substitution. <b>Business</b> air <b>travel</b> Videoconferencing Poisson regression model Negative binomial model...|$|R
