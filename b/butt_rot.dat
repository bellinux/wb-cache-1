5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the gilled mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on dead wood, but some are parasites that can cause root and <b>butt</b> <b>rot</b> in over 600 species of woody plants. Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E
500|$|Armillaria gallica (synonymous with A.bulbosa and A.lutea) is {{a species}} of honey {{mushroom}} in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales order. The species is a common and ecologically important wood-decay fungus that can live as a saprobe, or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or <b>butt</b> <b>rot.</b> It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been inadvertently introduced to South Africa. Armillaria gallica has had a confusing taxonomy, {{due in part to}} historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar Armillaria species. The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual colony living in a Michigan forest was reported to cover an area of , weigh at least , and be 1,500 years old. This individual is popularly known as the [...] "humungous fungus", and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom-themed festival in Crystal Falls.|$|E
500|$|Armillaria gallica is {{a weaker}} {{pathogen}} than the related A.Mellea or A.Solidipes, {{and is considered}} a secondary parasite—typically initiating infection only after the host's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation, drought, or infection by another fungus. Fungal infection can lead to root rot or <b>butt</b> <b>rot.</b> As the diseased trees die, the wood dries, increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning. The resulting forest fire may in turn kill the species that killed the trees. Plants that are under water stress caused by dry soils or waterlogging {{are more susceptible to}} infection by A.gallica. It {{has been shown to be}} one of several Armillaria species responsible for widespread mortality of oak trees in the Arkansas Ozarks. The fungus has also been shown to infect Daylily in South Carolina, Northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) in Italy and vineyards (Vitis species) of Rías Baixas in northwestern Spain. The latter infestation [...] "may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites".

5000|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>rot</b> is {{a disease}} of plants, mostly trees, caused by fungi. The fungus attacks the moist, poorly {{protected}} undersurface of tree trunk's thickest part (the [...] "butt" [...] above the root, as opposed to [...] "top"), where {{the end of the}} stem makes contact with the soil. It may affect the roots as well, causing a disease known as root rot. It then moves up into the interior of the plant, producing a roughly conical column of dead, rotted plant matter, up to one and a half meters long in severe cases. Such an infection is likely to impair the transport properties of the xylem tissue found {{at the center of the}} stem. It also weakens the stem and makes the plant more vulnerable to toppling. One particularly virulent species of fungus associated with <b>butt</b> <b>rot</b> is Serpula himantioides.|$|E

40|$|Armillaria species cause {{root and}} <b>butt</b> <b>rots</b> of woody plants {{throughout}} the world. Molecular genetic techniques {{were used to}} augment species identification, determine nuclear status, address issues of gene flow, and analyze mating of Armillaria isolates. ^ Twenty-six isolates representing nine North American Armillaria species were investigated with flow cytometry and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analyses to determine their genome size and RFLP profile. Putatively diploid isolates of A. ostoyae, A. gemina, A. calvescens, A. sinapina, A. mellea, A. gallica, A. nabsnona, North American Biological Species (NABS) X, and NABS XI were analyzed. Genome sizes of Armillaria species ranged from 0. 11 pg to 0. 17 pg per diploid nucleus, depending on species. A. ostoyae, A. gemina, and A. mellea possessed relatively small genome sizes (0. 11 pg– 0. 12 pg per diploid nucleus), whereas A. gallica possessed a relatively large genome size (0. 17 pg per diploid nucleus). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RFLP of the intergenic spacer region- 1 (IGS- 1) generated characteristic banding patterns for nine Armillaria species. ^ Thirty-five Armillaria isolates were collected from northern Idaho and eleven isolates were collected from northern Nebraska. Based on RFLP patterns of northern Idaho isolates, fifteen were identified as A. ostoyae, fourteen were identified as NABS X, and six were identified as A. sinapina or A. calvescens. All isolates from northern Nebraska were identified as A. gallica. Genome sizes of 46 Armillaria isolates ranged from 0. 11 pg to 0. 18 pg per diploid nucleus, depending on species. ^ For assessments of intraspecific mating using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, two compatible basidiospore-derived isolates were selected from each of four parental basidiomata of NABS X. Seven basidiospore isolates were specifically selected to assess rare, interspecific mating among A. cepistipes, A. sinapina, NABS X, and NABS XI. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopic analyses provided evidence of intraspecific mating within NABS X and interspecific mating among A. cepistipes, A. sinapina, NABS X, and NABS XI isolates. In addition, PCR-RFLP analysis of IGS- 1 showed combined banding patterns from interspecifically mated cultures. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [...] The {{history of}} annosus root disease in Europe and the southeastern United States is {{reviewed}} in prefacing {{the focus of}} this symposium on the disease as it occurs in the western United States. The topic is developed mostly from world literature on the disease published since mid- 1970. The occurrence of annosus root disease in both plantations and natural stands of conifers is discussed, with particular emphasis on disease range, hostpathogen variability, and environmental influences. Concluding attention is given to re-examination of the U. S. D. A. Forest Service guidelines for management of annosus root disease in the southeastern United States in the light of current understanding and the continuing need for improved technology transfer. The "death circle " in Hartig's (1894) textbook description of annosus root disease nearly a century ago has become an all too familiar sight in conifer stands throughout the north temperate region. Even then, he recognized tree-to-tree spread of Trametes radiciperda Hartig (equals Heterobasidion annosum (Fr. ] Bref.) via root contacts, {{but it was not until}} more than 50 years later when Rishbeth (1951) made the connection by showing the potential for disease initiation through plantation thinning and basidiospore colonization of fresh-cut stumps, thereby reaching adjacent trees. This mode of spread has accounted for a long history of damage in Europe where losses occur as: (1) mortality of residual stems in young conifer plantations, following and related to the extent and number of thinnings (Greig 1984) and (2) wood loss from <b>butt</b> and heart <b>rot</b> of old-growth timber, particularly Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.), on previously cut-over lands (Dimitri 1973).

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of the Phellinus; one that causes {{laminated}} root rot in Douglas fir, Grand fir, and Hemlocks and the other that causes <b>butt</b> <b>rot</b> in Western red cedar. The mycelium of this fungus doesn’t grow in the soil and also its spores are not spread by wind like most fungal pathogens. Infection occurs when roots of healthy trees grow in contact with infected roots. After initial contact with a living root, the mycelium grows on the bark, extending only a few millimeters into the surrounding soil. The mycelium penetrates the host through injured bark and advances proximally and distally along newly infected roots. It eventually penetrates through the host’s cambium and grows inside the wood causing decay and death of living cells in the heartwood and sapwood. During this process of entering into the cambium, the pathogen kills the phloem and initiates the decay of the xylem. The pathogen utilizes both cellulose and lignin, weakening the plant and eventually this leads to its death [...] Phellinus Weirii over-winters within infected stumps and can remain viable for up to 50 years [...] It is also known to infect bark, but this infection process is not well understood.
