40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary inflammation, oxidants-antioxidants imbalance, {{as well as}} innate and {{adaptive}} immunity have been proposed as playing {{a key role in}} the development of COPD. The role of vitamins, as assessed either by food frequency questionnaires or measured in serum levels, have been reported to improve pulmonary function, reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms. Vitamin supplements have therefore been proposed to be a potentially useful additive to COPD therapy. Methods A systematic literature review was performed on the association of vitamins and COPD. The role of vitamin supplements in COPD was then evaluated. Conclusions The results of this review showed that various vitamins (vitamin C, D, E, A, <b>beta</b> and alpha <b>carotene)</b> are associated with improvement in features of COPD such as symptoms, exacerbations and pulmonary function. High vitamin intake would probably reduce the annual decline of FEV 1. There were no studies that showed benefit from vitamin supplementation in improved symptoms, decreased hospitalization or pulmonary function. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{organophosphate}} insecticide feneitrothion is {{a contact}} insecticide and selective acaricide. It {{is used as}} a fly, mosquito and cockroach, residual contact spray for farms and public health programs. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the toxicity of fenitrothion on the female rate and the possible protective effects of ascorbic acid (vitamine C) and beta­carotene as antioxidant agents against the toxicity induced by fenitrothion. Sixty of adult female albino rats were randomly assigned to six equal groups including control group and groups treat­!"successive days. Ingestion of fenitrtothion caused a significant increase in ALT (alanine transferase), AST (aspartate transferase), and AP (alkaline phosphatase). It decreased signifiantly GL (glucose) level, AchE (acetyle cholinesterase) and GSH (glutathion reductase) activities, while, it had insignificant effects on TB (total bilirubine) and a slight decrease in TP (total protein). The histological study of female rat liver tissues by Hx & Eosin,P. A. S, and Methyl Green Pyronine revealed that, fenitrothion showed vascular and degenrative changes in the hepatic cells, Also, it caused a significant decrease in glycogen contents and depletion in of nucleic acids in hepatic cells. Treatments with ascorbic acid and beta­carotene plus fenitrothion hasn't been caused any significant changes in all parameters in serum of female rats. Treatment with ascorbic acid plus fenitrothion resulted a significant improvement in all parameters tested regarding to the histological study, while, beta-carotene plus fenitrothion showed the same improvement except in glycogen content in hepatic cells.

40|$|Introduction Raman spectra will be {{measured}} with the Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS) onboard ExoMars in 2018 to identify organic compounds and mineral products {{as an indication}} of former or recent biological activi-ty. Investigation with the same specifications as those onboard the ExoMars mission is conducted to test the potential of identifying biological material on martian analogue material with Raman spectroscopy. Appropriate parameters concerning integration time and number of repititions for the detection of biological matter {{as well as for the}} determination of the mineral composition will be derived. In addition, problems are reported on using Raman spectroscopy to discriminate the microorganisms from the mineral background. Biological sample Cyanobacteria and methane producing archaea are chosen to represent potential life on Mars. Prokaryotes like archaea and bacteria appeared on early Earth at least 3. 8 to 3. 5 billion years ago (Gya). Life might have developed under similar conditions on Mars as on Earth or might have been transferred from Earth (or vice versa). At that time on Mars the climate was more temperate and wet compared to the present day as inferred from geological evidence for liquid water on the ancient martian surface. Methane is known to be present on Mars. A source is still unknown. Methane might originate from geothermal or biological activities nearby the surface of the red planet. Cyanobacteria and prokaryotes using photosystem I use pigments such as scytonemin and beta-carotene as UV protection. Especially <b>beta</b> - <b>carotene</b> emits a strong Raman signal at the applied laser excitation wavelength. Raman measurements are used for detection of coccid, chain, and biofilm forming cyanobacteria Nostoc commune strain 231 - 06 (Fraunhofer IMBT CCCryo) on the below described Mars analogue mineral mixtures. Nostoc commune is known to be resistant to desiccation, UV B radiation and low temperatures, and thus suitable as a candidate for a potential life form on Mars. Furthermore, the Raman technique is applied on samples of the methane producing archaea candidatus Methanosarcina gelisolum (strain SMA 21) isolated from Siberian permafrost affected soils and on these archaea embedded in the martian analogue material. Martian analogue material In this investigation two different Mars analogue materials prepared from mineral and rock mixtures are used. The (1) Phyllosilicatic Mars Regolith Simulant (P-MRS) and (2) Sulfatic Mars Reg-olith Simulant (S-MRS) reflect the current understanding regarding environmental changes on Mars. Weathering or hydrothermal alteration of crustal rocks and of secondary mineralization during part of the Noachian and Hesperian epoch followed by the prevailing cold and dry oxidising condition with formation of anhydrous iron oxides. The use of two different mixtures accounts for the observations that phyllosilicatic deposits do not occur together with sulphatic deposits. P-MRS and S-MRS serve as the analogue geomaterials in which the cells of cyanobacteria and of methanogenes are embedded. Results Varying periods of measurement time and number of repetitions are used to get optimal Raman spectra for cyanobacteria and methanogenes. If cyanobacteria are present, beta-carotene is the dominant feature in the spectrum. Measurement times need to be adjusted to obtain optimal spectra of the P-MRS and S-MRS with cyanobacteria. Measurements performed with various values of measurement time and number of measurements show clearly the improvement achieved by increasing the time per spectrum from 1 s to 20 s. But it is desirable to find a set of small values of measurement time and number of repetitions in order to optimize the detection of minerals and biological markers and to reduce the disturbing effect of cosmic rays. A measurement regime is proposed for mineral mixtures with cyanobacteria on the basis of the RLS instrument characteristics: A procedure on ExoMars should start with a measurement time of only a few seconds to identify both biomarkers and minerals. If no biomarkers can be identified the time and number of measurements need to be increased until spectra of minerals are obtained. The measurement time should be selected between 1 s (for b-carotene) and 20 s (for minerals) for a laser power of 1 mW (spot diameter < 2 µm). Future investigations of Raman measurement parameters should consider the different environmental parameters on Mars like atmospheric pressure, composition and temperature. For methanogens a different measurement regime needs to be developed. Raman analytics are capable to identify biosignatures like <b>beta</b> – <b>carotene</b> on a multi-mineral mixture similar to those expected to be encountered during the ExoMars mission. ...|$|R
40|$|Yellow maize {{contains}} {{high levels}} of β-carotene (βC), making it an important crop for combating vitamin A deficiency through biofortification. In this study, nine maize inbred lines were selected at random from 31 provitamin A (PVA) maize inbred lines and crossed in a partial diallel mating design to develop 36 crosses. The crosses were evaluated {{in the field in}} two locations (Samaru and Kerawa) and their seed carotenoid content were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The modes of gene action, heritability, and correlations between agronomic traits and carotenoid content were estimated. Additive genetic variances (σ 2 a) were lower than non-additive genetic variances (σ 2 d) for all the carotenoids, plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY), suggesting a preponderance of non-additive gene action. Broad-sense heritability (H 2) was high (H 2  >  60 %) for zeaxanthin, days to anthesis, and PH, moderate (30 % < H 2  <  60 %) for lutein and GY, and low (H 2  <  30 %) for alpha <b>carotene,</b> <b>beta</b> cryptoxanthin, βC, and PVA. Genetic advance as a percentage of mean, considered with H 2, also suggests a preponderance of non-additive gene action for PVA carotenoids. Hybrid variety development is thus an appropriate approach to improving grain yield and PVA. GY showed no significant genotypic correlations with carotenoid content, suggesting that these traits can be improved concurrently. Thus, there is ample scope for improvement of PVA and GY in the sample of tropical-adapted maize...|$|R
40|$|Polyphenols {{have been}} shown in both in vitro and in vivo {{experiments}} to induce responses {{that are consistent with}} the protective effects of diets rich in fruits and vegetables against degenerative conditions such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Red palm oil, extracted from the fruit mesocarp of Elaeis guineensis is very important in the diet of many Nigerians, and indeed many citizens of developing countries living around the tropics. It contains antioxidant components such as carotenoids (alpha, <b>beta,</b> and gamma <b>carotenes)</b> and vitamin E (tocophorols and tocotrienols), which are of known nutritional and health benefits, but the antioxidant polyphenol contents of this oil is not fully explored. To assess the total antioxidant potential due partly to the scavenging of reactive oxygen specie (ROS) and the inhibition of the enzyme, xanthine oxidase, the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assay system and the 2 -deoxyguanosine-assay model were utilized. These revealed that the oil possesses promising antioxidant and radical scavenging activities with IC 50 values of 95 ?M and 219 ?M for the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase and 2 -deoxyguanosine assays, respectively. Liquid-Chromatography with Electrospray – Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI) showed the presence of the antioxidant, 3, 4 hydroxybenzyaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and ferulic acid in the red palm oil. Thus, in addition to antioxidant compounds like carotenoids, and vitamin E, the red palm oil also contains a rich mixture of phenolic compounds with potent antioxidant and radical scavenging capacities that might also account significantly for its widely reported capacity to modulate stress-related disorders...|$|R
25|$|Though {{the idea}} is controversial, some {{evidence}} suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents {{about the size of}} mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as <b>beta</b> <b>carotene,</b> vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.|$|E

They also contain a number of phytonutrients, which are thought {{to play a role}} in the prevention of ovarian and breast cancers. However, since traditional-style cooking of soul food vegetables requires high temperatures or long time periods, the water-soluble vitamins (e.g., Vitamin C and the B complex vitamins) are either destroyed or leached out into the water in which it is cooked. Additionally, the high quantity of oils used in preparing such ingredients means the final product might contain only a small amount of vegetable relative to the total amount of calories per serving.
