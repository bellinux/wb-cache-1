500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been exposed for what he is {{it is time to}} move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, four {{siblings}} – Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie – {{are among}} many children evacuated from London during World War II {{to escape the}} Blitz. They are sent to the countryside to live with professor Digory Kirke. Exploring the professor's house, Lucy finds a wardrobe which doubles as a magic portal to a forest in a land called Narnia. [...] At a lamppost oddly located in the forest, she meets Tumnus, a faun, who invites her to tea in his home. [...] There the faun confesses that he invited her not out of hospitality, but {{with the intention of}} betraying her to the White Witch. [...] The witch has ruled Narnia for years, using magic to keep it frozen in a perpetual winter. [...] She has ordered all Narnians to turn in any humans ("Sons of Adam" [...] or [...] "Daughters of Eve") they come across. [...] <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has come to know and like a human, Tumnus repents his original intention and escorts Lucy back to the lamppost.|$|E
2500|$|In , Snake Eyes is {{a member}} of G.I. Joe. He was given the name [...] "Hebi no me" [...] ("Snake Eyes") by his Arashikage clan sensei, Hard Master, because he {{possesses}} the [...] "steely gaze of a serpent". He cannot speak after having his throat punctured, and just shows up for special missions when called by Scarlett, who can [...] "translate" [...] what he is thinking. He is not used to teamwork, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has joined G.I. Joe, his sense of honor and morality would not let him walk away. In the episode [...] "Dreadnoks Rising", Zartan takes off his visor but puts it back on and says, [...] "You need it more than I do". Snake Eyes' wolf Timber made an appearance in the episode [...] "White Out", where he was rescued by Snake Eyes from a bear trap, before they were assaulted by Storm Shadow and Shadow-Vipers; at the end, Snake Eyes asks Snow Job to watch Timber until he returns. In the episode [...] "Revelations, Part 1", Scarlett learns that Snake Eyes briefly met her father, and promised him to look after his daughter, and he shows signs of having feelings for her. During the time when Snake Eyes still spoke, before his throat injury in the episodes [...] "Return of the Arashikage, Parts 1-2", Snake Eyes was voiced by Danny Cooksey.|$|E
50|$|Valentine's Day {{is one of}} Alex's {{favorite}} holidays back in the zoo, he {{was practically}} showered with Valentines from numerous admirers, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> in Africa, <b>he's</b> finding <b>that</b> Valentine's Day is not what he was used to.|$|R
50|$|Gavin {{may have}} been a non-entity while at school in Auchenlea, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> made his fortune, he's looking forward to lording it over his old classmates, {{especially}} now he's having an affair with Catherine O'Rourke, PR specialist and one-time pin-up for his male classmates at St Michael's.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, terrible. As {{long as he}} was {{interested}} in her simply from a literary point of view, though I didn't like that either, I could put up with it; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> got to telling her about himself, and exchanging weird experiences with her, it's another thing altogether. Oh, I never wanted Kendricks brought into the affair at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's {{go over to}} {{your home}} right away," [...] she whispered. [...] "I've never seen Shadow about here before, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been here once, he may come again." ...|$|E
60|$|Soames led {{till they}} had {{crossed to the}} far side, and there he stopped. It was the chosen site; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was about to divulge the spot to another he had become uneasy.|$|E
60|$|As {{has been}} said, many had heard Pumpkin Bill's wild cries, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had quieted down these boomers {{returned}} to their couches, grumbling that the half-witted lad should thus be allowed to disturb their rest.|$|E
60|$|Randolph Rover {{could eat}} <b>but</b> little. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{realized}} what had occurred, he upbraided himself bitterly {{for having been}} so deluded.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood before}} her again. [...] "It does come {{perhaps to the}} same thing. <b>But</b> Chad, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has seen, doesn't really want it." ...|$|R
5000|$|What I think may {{be going}} on {{is a lack of}} respect for hip hop and its {{complexity}} from people who care about music but don't know much about hip hop ... Predictably, Grammy tends toward pop-friendly hip hop that's easily understood by those who don't understand hip hop. Pop in this regard is not meant as an insult, it's merely music palatable to non-aficionados of the genre ... <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> released his most mature work, is being ignored.|$|R
60|$|The shaggy man hesitated. Dorothy {{had never}} known him {{to be ashamed of}} his shaggy looks before, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{surrounded}} by so much magnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place.|$|E
60|$|Bold was now choking with passion. He had let the archdeacon run {{on because}} he knew not with what words to {{interrupt}} him; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been so defied and insulted, he could not leave the room without some reply.|$|E
60|$|Daly {{felt the}} rebuke, and felt it strongly, too; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{embarked}} in the business, he must {{put the best}} face he could upon it. Still {{it was a moment}} or two before he could answer the young farmer.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in Metropolis in 2001, Irving Harper also commented on this practice: [...] "...there always had to be one name associated with the work. We couldn't just spread it around… that's fine. I'm grateful to George {{for what he did}} for me. While he was alive, I made no demands whatsoever, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> gone, whenever the Marshmallow Sofa is referred to as a 'George Nelson design', it sort of gets to me. I don't go {{out of my way to}} set things right, but if anybody asks me who designed it, I'm perfectly happy to tell them." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon the {{day after}} his arrival at Rangoon, Stanley had written a letter to his uncle; giving him a brief account of his adventures, and stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been {{appointed}} one of the general's aides-de-camp. <b>He</b> said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should, of course, be guided by his uncle's wishes; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had entered on the campaign as an officer, he should certainly like to remain till the end, when he would at once resign his commission and rejoin him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, I tell you," [...] said old Featherstone, snappishly. [...] "Stop {{where you}} are. Good-by, Solomon," [...] he added, trying to wield his stick again, <b>but</b> failing <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{reversed}} the handle. [...] "Good-by, Mrs. Waule. Don't you come again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Was it {{possible}} that people of this sort did [...] "run" [...] the country, after all?... When he had read Mrs. Humphry Ward in America he had always accepted this theory of the story quite easily, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw and heard them--! ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Mudge, who had {{remained}} on the bench, looked up at her; she often preferred to be quiet when he proposed to walk, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> seemed to wish to sit she had a desire to move. [...] "But you haven't told me what he has found out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Seagraves, [...] "holding down a claim" [...] near Rob, {{had come}} to see his {{neighboring}} [...] "bach" [...] because of feeling the need of company; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was near enough to hear him prancing about getting supper, he was content to lie alone on a slope of the green sod.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> happily, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had given}} him the wink, the Herr could corroborate it himself by going to the theater tonight. Ah, {{it would be a great}} joke--quite colossal! if he took a front seat where she could see him. And the good man rubbed his hands in gleeful anticipation.|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{had thought}} before <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{as hot as}} it was {{possible}} for a man to be; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> found <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was mistaken.|$|R
60|$|Captain Bonnet {{had never}} been in the habit of {{speaking}} loudly before ladies, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>now</b> felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must stand by his character.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{stood before}} her in rough fisherman's clothes, stained and torn, his face {{covered with blood}} and grime, his eyes red and swollen, the breath coming in quick, short gasps through his blue, cracked lips, the first sense of fear at {{what she had done}} seized hold of her heart.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{felt he had}} {{solved the}} reason that he rode always with closed helm, he was {{for the first time}} anxious himself to hide his face from the sight of men. Not from fear, for he knew not fear, but from some inward impulse which he did not attempt to fathom.|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} for a moment, while she looked at him questioningly. Her soft, {{delicate}} voice, with its very slight but piquant foreign intonation, had often sounded in his reluctant yet charmed ears since their last meeting; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> heard it again he felt how weak were his imaginings, and what sweet music it indeed was.|$|E
500|$|Alanna Nash {{regularly}} compared Diffie's {{voice to}} that of George Jones. In her review of A Thousand Winding Roads, she contrasted the album with Mark Chesnutt's debut Too Cold at Home by saying, [...] "While Chesnutt merely takes his inspiration from Jones, Diffie mimics Jones' delivery... <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> making records himself, [...] drops him {{to the rear of}} the pack, as a stylist with little style of his own." [...] She thought that Diffie began to move away from his George Jones influences on A Night to Remember. William Ruhlmann wrote that Diffie [...] "has put together a decade-plus career in country largely on his ability to succeed" [...] in [...] "scour Nashville publishers for ten good compositions in the established style", and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an [...] "adequate but undistinguished singer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} loved him," [...] Joan answered. [...] "It was he didn't love me, for a time, as I thought. <b>But</b> I know <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody {{seems to}} believe him," [...] said Mr. Anderson, not as {{intending}} to say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed him <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had done so.|$|R
60|$|Dan usually {{travelled}} {{in light}} marching order, and hated {{to have more}} luggage than he could carry in his well-worn valise. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a little money of his own, he had cumbered himself {{with a collection of}} trophies won by his bow and spear, and brought them home to bestow upon his friends.|$|E
60|$|Kala, alone, he {{was glad}} to have with him, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was better she was gone longer at a time, in search of food; for the devoted animal had {{scarcely}} eaten enough to support her own life while Tarzan had been so low, and was in consequence, reduced to a mere shadow of her former self.|$|E
60|$|Peter was {{thinking}} of this as he and Johnny Chuck stretched out in a sunny spot to get their breath and rest. He {{had never thought of}} it before, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had noticed it, he couldn't remember that he ever had seen little Mr. Greensnake wink, nor any of Mr. Greensnake's relatives. He mentioned the matter to Johnny Chuck.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{had been}} waiting anxiously for such an opportunity, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it came <b>he</b> hesitated. He was desperately afraid of losing money. He had little of the gambler's spirit.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{had taken}} {{it for granted that}} Agatha would not find the vein, and had helped her because he thought it better she should {{convince}} herself that Strange had been the victim of his imagination. He had honestly thought this when they started, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> recognized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had unconsciously had another object: he wanted her society and to earn her gratitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> Tess is all alone, Frederick {{keeps her}} company and they fall in love. Elias finds out and tells Fred he doesn't {{want to have}} {{anything}} to do with him anymore. Frederick announces he is planning on marrying Tess as soon as he finishes college. Meanwhile, Teola finds out she is pregnant and already started planning to marry Dan, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> dead, the child will be born out of wedlock. She plans on killing herself, but doesn't have the nerve to. Tess protects her by claiming the child as her own. After the baby is born, Teola keeps on supporting her financially. One night, Teola isn't allowed to leave the house, so Tess breaks in to get milk for the baby. She is caught by Elias, who is outraged. Meanwhile, Fred has just returned from college. Ben's mate threatens him to tell the truth about Ben having killed Dan Jordan. Ben becomes mad and strangles him. He next hides the body.|$|R
