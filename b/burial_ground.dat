5|$|To the {{immediate}} south-west {{of the church}} building, St Botolph's Aldersgate owned an irregularly shaped churchyard enclosed by Aldersgate Street to the east, the Christ Church Greyfriars <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> to the west, housing and the <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> of St Leonard, Foster Lane, {{to the south and}} housing along Little Britain to the north. The churchyard was used as a <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> and as a public open space. As with other City churchyards, as the amount of available burial space in London failed {{to keep pace with the}} growing population it came to be used exclusively as a <b>burial</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} chapel (Ohel) at the Jewish <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> is Grade II-listed. Designed in 1893 by Lainson and Son {{and built}} by the Garrett building firm, it is a red-brick octagonal structure in the Queen Anne style, with a tiled turreted roof and corbel-topped piers at each corner, a pedimented entrance and arched windows set below recessed panels. The <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> is surrounded by walls, stucco-faced gate piers and wrought iron fences which are listed separately at Grade II.|$|E
5|$|Burials are {{oriented}} east-west. The <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> covers {{most of the}} site's {{land and}} is planted with grass and trees. The surrounding land is predominantly of agricultural use {{but there are some}} nearby residences. To the east a wind farm is under construction.|$|E
50|$|In 1967 some Ipswich Aboriginal people, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Les Davidson, petitioned the Queensland Premier requesting that their <b>burial</b> <b>grounds,</b> bora rings, cave paintings and any cemetery excavations be preserved as are European <b>burial</b> <b>grounds.</b> This letter identified two <b>burial</b> <b>grounds,</b> one at Deebing Creek Mission and one at Purga.|$|R

50|$|Gepidic {{society was}} divided by wealth. From <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> found {{scattered}} throughout the Carpathian Basin and Hungarian Plain, archaeologists can divide Gepidic sites into two distinct groups. Large <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> indicate villages of common people with no significant wealth, and small <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> of larger houses which often have weapons, jewelry, and religious icons, wealth far greater than the goods found in the mass gravesites of the larger and poorer villages.|$|R
5|$|The <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> {{preceded the}} meeting house, {{as the site}} was home to another meeting house that was {{constructed}} in 1859. The Benjaminville Meeting House represents a well-constructed example of Quaker meeting house architecture and contains within its design many of the major elements associated with the style. It is unique in that it allowed {{both male and female}} friends to worship together in the same room. The <b>burial</b> <b>ground,</b> however, maintains a strict separation, not by gender but by religious affiliation; there are three sections, one for Quakers, one for non-Quakers, and one for distant relatives of both.|$|E
5|$|Cockcroft {{died from}} a heart attack at his home at Churchill College, Cambridge, on 18 September 1967. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension <b>Burial</b> <b>Ground</b> in Cambridge, in the same grave as his son Timothy. A {{memorial}} service was held at Westminster Abbey on 17 October 1967.|$|E
5|$|Progress in {{clearing}} and covering the <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> was slow, {{and it was}} not until 28 October 1880 that the churchyard was reopened as a public park. Laid out with flower beds and gravel paths, the park became a popular place for local workers to spend breaks.|$|E
5000|$|When the Welsh Church Act 1914 {{was passed}} to disestablish the Church in Wales, the {{responsibility}} for maintenance of <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> and churchyards were transferred from the church to local authorities, though the Church in Wales' Representative Body retained a number of ancient churchyards. Often local authorities did not accept legal responsibility for them, and the <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> were vested in the Welsh Church Commissioners. As a result, the Church in Wales continued to look after them despite having no legal obligation to do so. [...] In 1944, the Church in Wales informed the Government of the United Kingdom {{that they would be}} prepared {{to take responsibility for the}} <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> that had not passed to local authorities. Parliament passed the Welsh Church (<b>Burial</b> <b>Grounds)</b> Act 1945 unanimously to allow for the transfer of churchyards and <b>burial</b> <b>grounds</b> from the Welsh Church Commissioners back to the control of the Church in Wales.|$|R

5|$|The {{site was}} {{discovered}} by Europeans in the 17th century, though it was likely earlier explored by aboriginals. It was initially used for storehouses before being purchased by the British, who built a prisoner-of-war camp to hold captives from the Napoleonic Wars and later the War of 1812. The <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> for prisoners was on the adjacent Deadman's Island.|$|E
5|$|A son, Geoffrey Bruce Oliphant, {{was born}} 6 October 1930, but {{he died of}} {{meningitis}} on 5 September 1933, and was interred in an unmarked grave in the Ascension Parish <b>Burial</b> <b>Ground</b> in Cambridge alongside Timothy Cockcroft, the infant son of Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Cockcroft, who had died the year before. Unable to have more children, the Oliphants adopted a four-month-old boy, Michael John, in 1936, and a daughter, Vivian, in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} back over a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of what were two settlements and a <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> {{can be seen on}} Lindholm Høje, a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, one from the 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E

5|$|Conwell died on April 22, 1842, {{at about}} the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia. Conwell's death led to one final controversy, as the old bishop's nephews and nieces sued for {{possession}} of the Bishop's <b>Burial</b> <b>Ground,</b> claiming it had been Conwell's private possession. After the threat of excommunication, they withdrew their claim. Conwell's remains were buried in St. Mary's churchyard. In 1864 the remains were transferred to the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul.|$|E
5|$|Fielding died {{approximately}} two years later, his death {{caused by the}} gout and asthma that had, in part, compelled him to end the Journals run. In his final year, he travelled to Portugal {{in the hope of}} recovery. He wrote an account of his travels during this time, entitled The Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon, which was published in England in 1755. Fielding died in Lisbon on 8 October 1754, and was buried in the Os Cyprestes cemetery, a local English <b>burial</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several other {{structures}} within the policies are listed. These include the Category B listed Gothic style mausoleum constructed in 1865 {{at a cost}} of £2,500, equivalent to around £266,000 as at 2012. Built {{in the shape of a}} cross, it has a round stained glass window in the front gable and features many gargoyles and other stone decorations. Bodies are interred in the <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> outside but commemorative stones made of Carrara marble are inside the mausoleum. The corbels on the internal oak roof are embellished with angel figurines.|$|E

5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another <b>burial</b> <b>ground</b> was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E
