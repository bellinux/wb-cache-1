5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Nasri's goal-scoring {{began to take}} form. In late January, he scored goals in {{back-to-back}} matches against Nancy and Caen. In European competition, Nasri participated in the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} in his career, however he failed to make an impact in the four group stage matches he appeared in.

Marseille ultimately finished the group in third place, which resulted in the team qualifying for the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup. The club was defeated in the round of 16 by Zenit Saint Petersburg despite <b>being</b> <b>up</b> 3–1 heading into the second leg. Of those three goals Marseille scored in the first leg, Nasri assisted on two of them. On 16 March 2008, Nasri scored a goal in a 3–3 draw with Lens. A month later, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Metz. In his final match with Marseille, against Strasbourg, Nasri scored a goal and assisted on another in a 4–3 victory. Marseille finished the league campaign in third place, which resulted in the club qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the second consecutive season. On 8 May 2008, with all the transfer speculation surrounding the player, Nasri surprised many by signing a three-year contract extension with the club until 2012.|$|E

Both times, the teams lost after <b>being</b> <b>up</b> 2–0 in their {{respective}} World Series, and both losses happened in New York (The Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series at Shea Stadium).

One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a left-hander at Yankee Stadium and the first no-hitter by a Yankee since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by a Yankee since 1951.|$|E
