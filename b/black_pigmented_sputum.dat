When pH is 4, the properties of as-prepared sample are similar with the conventional high-temperature pigment. XRD and SEM further confirm that silicon coats with carbon black fully.

40|$|Background and methods: Several {{standard}} powdered <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> {{were characterized}} by means of thermogravimetry TG-DTG and allied techniques. These pigments were used to make standard plaster frescoes at this purpose prepared. The latter ones were subjected to Raman and reflectance analysis. The results obtained, together with TG data, were chemometrically processed and used to identify an analogous standard fresco fabricated by an unknown commercial <b>black</b> <b>pigment,</b> obtaining excellent results. Results: The same colorimetric and reflectometric techniques, coupled with suitable chemometric techniques, were then successfully used to identify the type of <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> present in an ancient roman fresco of the Imperial Age (30 B.

Conclusion: TG-DTG resulted useful techniques to autenticate powdered <b>black</b> <b>pigments.</b> Colorimetry and Raman, but also the only colorimetry, were useful to identify an ancient <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> in situ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Black</b> <b>pigment</b> is an {{important}} pigment in the ceramic decoration. The traditional <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> is spinel type matter containing Co, Fe or Cr elements. Carbon black is the best <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> and is nontoxic. However, carbon black is oxygenated in the ceramic sintering process at atmosphere. Carbon black enclosed in the crystal latter of ZrSiO 4 was reported. However, the content of carbon black is little which decreases the color generation. Carbon black coated with SiO 2 was prepared by sol-gel method using combustion method using SiO 2 sol and black ink as raw materials.

5000|$|The {{genetics}} {{behind the}} black horse are relatively simple. The color black is primarily controlled by two genes: Extension and Agouti. The functional, dominant allele of the extension gene (labeled [...] "E") enables {{the horse to}} produce <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> in the hair. Without this gene (homozygous recessive condition [...] "ee"), the coat is devoid of <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> and the horse is some shade of red. The functional, dominant allele (or alleles) of the agouti gene (labeled [...] "A") enable the horse to restrict <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> to {{certain parts of the}} coat, notably the legs, mane and tail, allowing the underlying red to show through, resulting in bay coloring. Without this gene (homozygous recessive condition [...] "aa"), any <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> present is unrestricted, resulting in a uniformly black coat.|$|R

A third option, At, restricts <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> to a black-and-tan pattern called seal brown.

3000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Pigments</b> Charcoal <b>Black,</b> Lamp Black, Ivory Black, Bone Black, Graphite, Black Chalk and Terre-noire (Black Earth) {{are among}} the list of <b>black</b> <b>pigments.</b> Well ground {{charcoal}} has often been used as <b>black</b> <b>pigment.</b> In India, charcoal prepared from twigs and woods of tamarind tree after burning in a closed pot, is powdered to make <b>black</b> <b>pigment.</b> Some other substances which after charring were used for preparing <b>black</b> <b>pigment</b> are the shells of almonds and coconuts. The charcoal so produced is soft and gives homogeneous and fine <b>black</b> <b>pigment.</b> By far, the most important black used India is ‘Kajal’ prepared by burning oil in a lamp and depositing the soot on an earthen bowl. Ivory black is prepared by charring ivory cuttings in a closed earthen pot and then grinding, washing and drying black residue. The black so prepared is very intense. It is not favoured now for ecological and animal rights considerations. Bone black is prepared by charring animal bones in closed earthen pots. It is not as intense as ivory black but used as a substitute. Powdered graphite, a mineral found {{in different parts of}} India, has been used as writing material. It gives a dull grey pigment. However, it has mostly been used for drawing rather than for painting. Black chalk is the name given to black clay used for paintings and terracotta. Terre-noire is the same as black clay. It is a mixture of carbonate of calcium, iron and manganese with clay.|$|R

40|$|Spanish Levantine Rock Art is {{a unique}} {{pictorial}} expression within the prehistoric European context. Located in shelters in the inland regions of the Iberian Mediterranean basin, this art form, which must be necessarily studied {{in the frame of}} the process of neolithization of this territory, still lacks direct dating, and therefore its authorship is still open to debate. In this paper we present the first characterization of <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> used in the Cova Remigia shelters in the Valltorta-Gassulla area (Castell on, Spain) by means of EDXRF spectrometry combined with SEMEDS and Raman spectroscopy. Our aim is both to identify the raw material used for the preparation of <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> and to make a first approach to the cultural choices involved in its use. The results are relevant for several reasons. Firstly, carbon-based <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> have been identified {{for the first time in}} northern regions of Levantine rock art. Secondly, the recurrent use of <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> in Cova Remigia questions the assumption of its restricted use in Spanish Levantine art. Thirdly, posterior repainting and graphic re-appropriation of black figures have been observed in Cova Remigia, giving rise to the combination of two colours, black and red, fact that is extremely rare in this rock art tradition. Finally, the identification of organic matter in the <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> opens the possibility of radiocarbon dating...|$|R

In this work {{the effect of}} various <b>black</b> <b>pigments</b> (carbon <b>black</b> (CB) and carbon nanotubes (CNT)) on optical and mechanical properties of PP-RCT grades (Polypropylene-Random Copolymer with special crystalline structure (ß phase) for elevated temperature applications) is investigated.
