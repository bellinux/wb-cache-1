However, the pseudo-scientific method he uses in his work The Atlas of Creation cannot in any way be considered scientific. The author tries {{to prove the}} non-scientific nature of the theory of evolution by taking and challenging the evidence of evolution. He does not mention any prior questioning. Moreover, as he only compares photographs of fossils to photographs of current species he provides no scientific proof for these statements. Even better, ..., on page 60 of this work we see a superb photograph of a fossil of a perch with a claim in the caption that this fish has not evolved over millions of years. That, however, is wrong: a detailed study of the fossil and perches living today shows that, on the contrary, they have evolved a great deal. Unfortunately, Yahya’s book is full of this type of falsehood. None of the arguments in this work are based on any scientific evidence, and the book appears more like a primitive theological treatise than the scientific refutation of the theory of evolution. It may be noted that Yahya says he has the support of major scientists. They would also have to be specialists in the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution!</b> ... By only presenting facts without any theory or proof, Harun Yahya abuses the credulity of individuals who listen to him or read his works. Moreover, as Jacques Arnoult emphasises, the BAV and Harun Yahya in Turkey, just like the American Institute for Creation Research, resort to partial, indeed erroneous, references to develop their creationist arguments. The authors do not hesitate to quote magazine articles that defend evolution but they succeed in turning the meaning round by shortening the quotations. This is nothing less than intellectual dishonesty, which is particularly harmful.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{cognitive}} science cannot be understood without {{recent developments in}} computer sci-ence, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, neuroscience, biology, linguistics, and psychology. Classic analytic philosophy as well as traditional AI assumed that all kinds of knowledge must eplicitly be represented by formal or programming languages. This assumption is in con-tradiction to recent insights into the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> and developmental psychology of the human organism. Most of our knowledge is implicit and unconscious. It is not formally repre-sented, but embodied knowledge which is learnt by doing and understood by bodily interacting with ecological niches and social environments. That is true not only for low-level skills, but even for high-level domains of categorization, language, and abstract thinking. Embodied {{cognitive science}}, AI, and robotics try to build the embodied mind in an artificial evolution. From a philosophical point of view, it is amazing that the new ideas of embodied mind and robotics have deep roots in 20 th-century philosophy...|$|E

40|$|When {{you have}} an {{established}} scientific emergent truth, it is true {{whether or not you}} believe in it. ” Neil deGrasse Tyson, Science in America. Very few people outside of a particular scientific discipline can actually say they understand it, because most do not have the training to “speak the language. ” They are then not particularly bothered by its tenets and predictions. Of all the major branches of science, however, evolutionary biology is an exception to this generalization because even though people are not versed in the field, they sometimes have a negative, knee-jerk objection. This objection is often because they are told that evolution conflicts with their faith-based beliefs. To the contrary, it is actually the case that most of the world’s religions accept evolution, especially theistic evolution, where life was created and then evolved. However, to a few who do not understand the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> even this is unacceptable. In this book we identified a number of misconceptions that we think {{at least some of the}} general public has about evolutionary biology. Our intent is to present how evolutionary scientists approach these specific questions and what their consensus of the evidence shows to be true. We hope that those who have heard of the misconceptions we address will come to appreciate the evidence that scientists actually discovered and interpreted...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> has been {{confined}} to laboratories and model organisms. However, controlled laboratory conditions are unlikely to model variations in environments that influence selection in wild populations. Thus, the study of "fitness" for survival and the genetics that influence this are best {{carried out in the}} field and in matching environments. Therefore, we studied highland populations in their native environments, to learn how they cope with ambient hypoxia. The Andeans, African highlanders and Himalayans have adapted differently to their hostile environment. Chronic mountain sickness (CMS), a loss of adaptation to altitude, is common in the Andes, occasionally found in the Himalayas; and absent from the East African altitude plateau. We compared molecular signatures (distinct patterns of gene expression) of hypoxia-related genes, in white blood cells (WBC) from Andeans with (n = 10), without CMS (n = 10) and sea-level controls from Lima (n = 20) with those obtained from CMS (n = 8) and controls (n = 5) Ladakhi subjects from the Tibetan altitude plateau. We further analyzed the expression of a subset of these genes in Ethiopian highlanders (n = 8). In all subjects, we performed the studies at their native altitude and after they were rendered normoxic. We identified a gene that predicted CMS in Andeans and Himalayans (PDP 2). After achieving normoxia, WBC gene expression still distinguished Andean and Himalayan CMS subjects. Remarkably, analysis of the small subset of genes (n = 8) studied in all 3 highland populations showed normoxia induced gene expression changes in Andeans, but not in Ethiopians nor Himalayan controls. This is consistent with physiologic studies in which Ethiopians and Himalayans show a lack of responsiveness to hypoxia of the cerebral circulation and of the hypoxic ventilatory drive, and with the absence of CMS on the East African altitude plateau...|$|E
40|$|Adam Smith {{has been}} {{portrayed as a}} proto-Darwinist (Hayek, 1967 and Flew, 1985 cited in Hill, 2001, pp. 17 - 19; Alvey, this volume), largely based on his account of human {{development}} {{as a form of}} linear progression and the ubiquity of spontaneous order within nature. In this chapter, these and other possible connections between Smith and some strands of evolutionary thought are developed and considered. The focus is on Smith's assumptions about nature in general and human nature in particular in The Theory of Moral Sentiments and possible connections between these and the <b>biology</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution.</b> The initial connection is that Smith's ideas on sympathy and beneficence were approvingly noted by Darwin, who in turn proposed some explanations for the evolutionary origins of sympathy. There were subsequent attempts to explain the possible evolutionary origins of beneficence in the related fields of sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, game theory and economic psychology, with at least one contemporary work from the latter field explicitly bringing the ideas of Darwin and Smith back together (Gintis et al., 2005). Yet as will be argued in this chapter, neither this joint contribution to a contemporary field of intellectual endeavour nor a shared interest in innate moral sense necessarily makes Smith a proto-Darwinist. There is insufficient evidence of direct connections between Smith and evolutionary thought or of critical fundamental agreements between Smith and the evolutionists, including Darwin, to make such a claim. In particular, Smith's theory of moral sentiments relies on ends whereas theories of natural and sexual selection, at the core of evolutionary theories, are only descriptions of mechanisms of change, or means. The ends are always uncertain. In Smith, the sentiment of sympathy, reinforced by habits of affection, reciprocity and social approval, can lead to beneficent actions (Smith, [1790] 1984, p. 78). It is possible to trace an interest in sympathy from Smith to Darwin, and from Darwin to contemporary evolutionary theorists and economic behaviourists. From the latter field, and following both Smith and Darwin, Paul Ormerod (1994, p. 13) has argued that there are 'propensities in human nature which incline us toward society, such as fellow feeling and the desire to obtain the approval of others and to be worthy of that approval'. Sympathy, reinforced by social approval and reason, can lead us to moderate our wants in order to take account of the welfare of others. According to Ormerod, for Smith, life would be intolerable 'if everyone pursued a career of fraud, pillage and murder' - self-control was a 'natural, integral part of human nature' (ibid.). Ormerod further argues that economics has been out of step with developments in our understanding of human nature and motivation, especially stemming from advances in the life sciences. Against the 'individualistic behavioural model' of orthodox economics, Ormerod (ibid., p. 35) proposes the cooperative model of, for example, Robert Axelrod, whose The Evolution of Cooperation (1984) showed that in Prisoner's Dilemma and other games, participants frequently employed cooperative strategies rather than aiming at favourable zero-sum outcomes. More recently, Duncan Foley (cited in Colander, 2 (04) has similarly noted Axelrod's finding that 'cooperation survives as a strategy in competitive tournaments with a high probability' (p. 203), and Kenneth Binmore (cited in Colander p. 71) has likewise drawn attention to Axelrod's 'evolutionary simulations'. Another contributor to the debate, Herbert Gintis, subsequently co-authored with Samuel Bowles, Robert Boyd and Ernst Fehr 'Moral Sentiments and Material Interests: The Foundations of Cooperation in Economic Life' (Gintis et al.,) and 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments'(hereafter TMS) is discussed at length in the book's Introduction. For Gintis et al. Smith is: often portrayed as a proponent of Homo economicus - that selfish, materialistic creature that has traditionally inhabited the economics textbooks. This view overlooks Smith's second - and equally important -contribution, 'The Theory of Moral Sentiments', in which Smith promotes a far more complex picture of the human character. His book is a thorough scrutiny of human behavior with the goal of establishing 'sympathy' as a central emotion motivating our behaviour towards others. (Gintis et al., 2005, p. 3) Gintis et al. (2005, p. 3) claim their own work is: 'part of a continuous line of intellectual inheritance from Adam Smith and his friend and mentor David Hume 1, through Thomas Malthus, Charles Darwin and Emile Durkheim, and more recently the biologists William Hamilton and Robert Trivers'. The notion of a related set of attempts to explain cooperative and beneficent or altruistic behaviour running from Smith to Darwin and on to Hamilton and Trivers will be considered below...|$|E
