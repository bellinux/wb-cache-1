The arcade cabinet is upright, with the marquee bearing the game's name protruding outward. There are large, <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon. The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto Yagishita of Zuntata, Taito's music division. A soundtrack CD (a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids) was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21, 1991. This album was also released as part of Taito 1500 Collector's Box on September 17, 1993. A track from the game is on the limited edition CD Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st, released by Zuntata/Taito on April 1, 1999.|$|E

25|$|It can be {{approached}} from three directions. The two most common use the Dry Brook Ridge Trail, blazed with <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> markers, {{to connect to}} the red-blazed Balsam Lake Mountain Trail, which makes a short loop across the summit. South of the fire tower it connects to the yellow-blazed Mill Brook Ridge Trail, which offers a longer approach from the west over that mountain.|$|E
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} and {{for reasons of}} simplicity, it can be sufficient to not use cover materials at all or to use toilet paper itself as cover material. One example is the case where the UDDT has a mechanized ventilation system and a view guard, like the UDDT manufactured by Separett which has a removable bucket, built-in fan and <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> view guard which closes when weight {{is removed from the}} toilet seat after use. Also in the case of public toilets, it can be easier to let the caretaker perform the task of adding cover material, rather than the user. An example of this are the public single vault UDDTs operated by the not-for-profit company Sanergy in low-income urban areas in Kenya.|$|E

50|$|The 1997 KTM Jackpiner 200 LE was {{a limited}} {{production}} run of the first 200 cc KTM. It was built to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the first Penton KTM motorcycle.

It came with Penton <b>blue</b> <b>plastics</b> and a sticker attached to the front fender bearing John Penton's signature. It was outfitted with Öhlins Forks and was the first bike with PDS no-linkage rear suspension developed by Öhlins, and {{was also one of the}} first bikes to incorporate a hydraulic clutch. A year later the first production KTM 200 MXC was fitted with Marzocchi 45 forks and the trademark orange plastics.|$|R
2500|$|A metal pilot's {{qualification}} badge {{was created}} in the mid-1960s, in two classes. It was identical to the US Air Force wings, except for the letters [...] "RLAF" [...] stamped {{across the top of the}} central crest. The badge was worn over the left breast pocket on service dress and working uniforms, whilst an embroidered white version on a blue cloth background was worn on flight suits. [...] Blue and subdued nametapes were occasionally worn above the right shirt or jacket pocket on field dress and flight suits; <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> nameplates were worn with the working and dress uniforms. Full-colour embroidered, woven or printed squadron insignia went over the right breast; RLAF service insignia – a winged lotus leaf rosette – went on the right collar. [...] RLAF pilots sent for training in Thailand wore on the right shoulder a Laotian national emblem with [...] "Laos" [...] tab.|$|E
2500|$|Apple iMac was {{introduced}} in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted [...] "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's." [...] Described as [...] "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi <b>Blue</b> <b>plastic,</b> was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured some technical innovations, such as having USB ports as the only device inputs. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third party peripheral makers – {{as evidenced by the}} fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 the {{president}} of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as [...] "26,500 pounds of human excrement" [...] each season is left behind on the mountain. Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within meters of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 18,000 feet, Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> 50-gallon barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed. The problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepalese government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.|$|E

2500|$|Brighton's {{earliest}} council houses {{date from}} the 19th century. [...] Two landowners donated land around the present St Helen's Road in 1897, and simple polychromatic brick cottages were built to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Much council building {{took place in the}} 1960s and 1970s, often in the form of tower blocks. In Hove, the Conway Redevelopment Scheme lasted from April 1966 until July 1967. [...] Hundreds of slum houses were replaced by five towers with between 54 and 72 flats each; the ten-storey Conway Court is the tallest. [...] Dark red and buff brickwork, small areas of <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> panelling and recessed balconies characterise the buildings. About £2 million was spent. In 1976–77, old council houses in the Ingram Crescent area off Portland Road were replaced by low-rise flats in a modern style with varied architectural features such as weatherboarding-style timber, dark brickwork and catslide roofs. No council houses have been built since the 1980s, but in July 2010 the council announced plans to demolish Ainsworth House, a 1960s low-rise block in the Elm Grove area, and build a higher-density high-rise [...] "family complex". Planning permission was granted in April 2011, and the 15-home development called Balchin Court was opened in September 2013. In November 2011 squatters occupied the building, which was in a dangerous condition because it contained asbestos.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the light}} blue paint blazes are usually {{vertical}} rectangles painted on trees {{to mark the}} trail, {{there is often a}} bit of variety in terms of both paint blazes and signage found on a Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail. [...] Usually direction is indicated with one blaze to indicate 'go straight ahead', two blazes with the top blaze to the left indicating a left turn, two blazes with the top blaze to the right indicating a right turn, and two blazes directly {{on top of each other}} indicating the end of a trail (two parallel horizontal rectangles is the new preferred form). [...] Three blazes indicates that the trail is forking in two different directions (as in a loop). [...] But directional arrows are also often painted on rocks, trees and other stationary objects, particularly when they can provide better information (such as 'Up!' on a rock climb). [...] Occasionally sticks or poles places in the ground are used instead of trees (especially in open fields) with a blue blaze or the top painted blue. [...] Blue blazes are painted on telephone poles, road guard rails, buildings (rarely) and other signs (rarely). [...] Sometimes wooden tags or wooden arrows are nailed to trees (or sticks stuck in the ground) though this is much more common on non-Blue-Blazed trails. [...] Some trail sections are marked using <b>blue</b> <b>plastic</b> diamond signs or metallic disks nailed in trees rather than painted blazes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Kazuhiko Nishi {{initiated}} a 'MSX Revival' around an official MSX emulator called MSXPLAYer. This {{is the only}} official MSX emulator as all MSX copyrights are maintained by the MSX Association. In 2004, a Dutch company Bazix announced they had become the representatives of MSX Association in Europe, being the English contact for any questions regarding the MSX trademarks, copyrights, and licensing. On October 17, 2006, Bazix launched WOOMB.Net, a website selling MSX games in English and other languages, with a selection of 14games. In Japan, game sales began earlier, through Project EGG. WOOMB.Net was the English counterpart of this and other Japanese services offered by D4 Enterprise, which also announced in August 2006 the launch of a new MSX2 compatible system called the [...] "one chip-MSX", a system based on an Altera Cyclone EP1C12Q240C8 FPGA. The one chip-MSX" [...] is similar in concept to the C-One, a Commodore 64 clone also built {{on the basis of}} a single FPGA chip. The new MSX system is housed in a box made out of transparent <b>blue</b> <b>plastic,</b> and can be used with a standard monitor (or TV) and a PC keyboard. It has two MSX cartridge slots and supports the audio extensions MSX-MUSIC and SCC+. A SD/MMC-flashcard can be used as an external storage medium, emulating a disk drive and can be used to boot MSX-DOS. Due to its VHDL programmable hardware, it is possible to give the device new hardware extensions simply by running a reconfiguration program under MSX-DOS. The [...] "one chip-MSX" [...] also has two USB connectors that can be used after adding some supporting VHDL code.|$|E
