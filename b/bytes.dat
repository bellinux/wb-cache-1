5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 <b>bytes</b> (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 <b>bytes</b> for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused <b>bytes</b> from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E
5|$|Storage is {{reported}} to the user in the base 10 (1 kilobyte equals 1000 <b>bytes)</b> format instead of base 2, which was used in older iOS versions.|$|E
5|$|The Spectrum {{is based}} on a Zilog Z80 A CPU running at 3.5MHz (or NEC D780C-1 clone). The {{original}} model has 16KB (16×1024 <b>bytes)</b> of ROM and either 16KB or 48KB of RAM. Hardware design was by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research, and the outward appearance was designed by Sinclair's industrial designer Rick Dickinson.|$|E

5|$|The Altair 8800 kit {{came with}} a front panel, a CPU board with the Intel 8080 microprocessor, 256 <b>bytes</b> of RAM, a 4-slot {{backplane}} and an 8-amp power supply for $439. A 1k byte memory board was $176 and the 4k byte was $264. The serial interface board was $124 and the parallel interface was $119. There was a special price for an 8k byte system with BASIC for $995. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was $1500.|$|E
5|$|The German video gaming {{market is}} one of the largest in the world. The Gamescom in Cologne is the world's leading gaming convention. Popular game series from Germany include Turrican, the Anno series, The Settlers series, the Gothic series, SpellForce, the FIFA Manager series, Far Cry and Crysis. Relevant game {{developers}} and publishers are Blue Byte, Crytek, Deep Silver, Kalypso Media, Piranha <b>Bytes,</b> Yager Development, and some of the largest social network game companies like Bigpoint, Gameforge, Goodgame and Wooga.|$|E
5|$|The only {{floppy disk}} drives that were readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 <b>bytes</b> of data. The Altair disk controller occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed {{until the end of}} 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one disk drive sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>byte</b> {{range is}} lexicographically ordered with the {{following}} thirteen <b>byte</b> values excluded: [...] For example, the <b>byte</b> sequence , coding for a difference of , is immediately followed by the <b>byte</b> sequence , coding for a difference of [...]|$|R
5000|$|The {{algorithm}} performs {{best with}} long needle strings, when it consistently hits a non-matching character {{at or near}} the final <b>byte</b> of the current position in the haystack and the final <b>byte</b> of the needle does not occur elsewhere within the needle. For instance a 32 <b>byte</b> needle ending in [...] "z" [...] searching through a 255 <b>byte</b> haystack which does not have a 'z' <b>byte</b> in it would take up to 224 <b>byte</b> comparisons.|$|R
50|$|The {{rolling hash}} uses a 256 <b>byte</b> table {{containing}} the <b>byte</b> last seen in each possible order-1 context. The hash is updated {{by adding the}} next <b>byte</b> and then multiplying either by an odd constant if the <b>byte</b> was predicted or by an even number {{that is not a}} multiple of 4 if the <b>byte</b> was not predicted.|$|R
5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k <b>bytes</b> of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, {{many ideas}} were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II. The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, but only about 10 <b>bytes</b> of free space remains in final products.|$|E
5|$|Since all PID <b>bytes</b> include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, {{which is the same}} as the low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
30|$|On single precision, the {{coordinates}} of a 3 D points, i.e., float x, y, z, needs 12 <b>byte</b> (4 <b>byte</b> × 3 values); and in CUDA the memory size for alignment is maximum 16 <b>byte.</b> Thus, it only need one {{time of the}} memory size for alignment because 12 <b>byte</b> {{is less than the}} maximum memory size for alignment, i.e., 16 <b>byte.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the byte-order scheme, [...] "RGBA" [...] is {{understood}} to mean a <b>byte</b> R, followed by a <b>byte</b> G, followed by a <b>byte</b> B, and followed by a <b>byte</b> A. This scheme is commonly used for describing file formats or network protocols, which are both byte-oriented.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the ISO-2022 character sets, the following custom sets are available too. The <b>byte</b> designation follows the escape <b>byte</b> (hexadecimal 1B). There is no intermediate <b>byte.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{encryption}} {{resembles the}} RSA algorithm. This algorithm encodes data in 3-byte blocks. First, the each byte is permuted through an 8-position permutation, then the bits are {{split into two}} 12-bit integers (by taking the low 4 bits of the second byte and the 8 bits of the first byte as the first 12-bit integer, and the 8 bits of the third byte and the 4 high bits of the second integer as the second 12-bit integer). Each is individually encrypted by taking them to the 3491st power, mod 4097; the bits are then reassembled into 3 <b>bytes.</b> The encrypted text is then stored in a string variable {{as part of the}} program. To shroud the would be visible and noticeable text it is compressed with the simple Lzw before final storage. As the Macintosh Common Lisp compiler compresses the main program code into the executable, this was not that necessary.|$|E
25|$|A chunk {{consists}} of four parts: length (4 <b>bytes,</b> big-endian), chunk type/name (4 <b>bytes),</b> chunk data (length <b>bytes)</b> and CRC (cyclic redundancy code/checksum; 4 <b>bytes).</b> The CRC is a network-byte-order CRC-32 computed over the chunk type and chunk data, but not the length.|$|E
25|$|Self-synchronization: The leading <b>bytes</b> and the {{continuation}} <b>bytes</b> {{do not share}} values (continuation <b>bytes</b> start with 10 while single <b>bytes</b> start with 0 and longer lead <b>bytes</b> start with 11). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting {{in the middle of}} another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 <b>bytes</b> to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.|$|E

5000|$|Every TIFF file {{begins with}} a two-byte {{indicator}} of <b>byte</b> order: [...] "" [...] for little-endian (a.k.a. [...] "Intel <b>byte</b> ordering", circa 1980) or [...] "" [...] for big-endian (a.k.a. [...] "Motorola <b>byte</b> ordering", circa 1980) <b>byte</b> ordering. The next two-byte word contains the format version number, which has always been 42 for every version of TIFF (e.g., TIFF v5.0 and TIFF v6.0).All words, double words, etc., in the TIFF file {{are assumed to be}} in the indicated <b>byte</b> order. The TIFF 6.0 specification states that compliant TIFF readers must support both <b>byte</b> orders ( [...] and [...] ); writers may use either.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} table summarizes {{usage of}} UTF-8 code units (individual <b>bytes</b> or octets) in a code page format. The upper half (0_ to 7_) is for <b>bytes</b> used only in single-byte codes, {{so it looks}} like a normal code page; the lower half is for continuation <b>bytes</b> (8_ to B_) and (possible) leading <b>bytes</b> (C_ to F_), and is explained further in the legend below.|$|E
25|$|If an {{odd number}} of <b>bytes</b> {{is missing from}} UTF-16, the whole rest of the string will be {{meaningless}} text. Any <b>bytes</b> missing from UTF-8 will still allow the text to be recovered accurately starting with the next character after the missing <b>bytes.</b>|$|E
