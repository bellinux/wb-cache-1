5|$|In 144 BC Emperor Jing {{abolished}} private minting {{in favor}} of central-government and commandery-level minting; he also introduced a new coin. Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later he abandoned the ban liangs entirely {{in favor of}} the wuzhu (五銖) coin, weighing 3.2g (0.11oz). The wuzhu became China's standard coin until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu.|$|E
5|$|In 1644, {{after the}} false {{news of the}} death of Adam Kazanowski, Wiśniowiecki took over his disputed estate of Rumno by subterfuge. For this he was at first sentenced to exile, but due to his influence, even the King could not realistically expect to enforce this ruling without a civil war. Eventually after more discussions at local sejmiks and then in the Sejm, he won the case and was granted the right for Rumno. In 1646, after the death of Koniecpolski, he became the voivode of Ruthenia. He invaded and took over the town of Hadiach which was also being claimed by a son of Koniecpolski, Aleksander Koniecpolski, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later, in 1647, he lost that case and was forced to return the town.|$|E

5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E
5|$|The club is {{associated}} with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the 2015–16 season). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white {{at the start of}} the 1973–74 season. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the 1999–2000 season, when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Norris {{arranged}} for the club's promotion back to the First Division, in contentious circumstances. With increased financial resources, the club established themselves as a permanent fixture in the division and was better able {{to spend money on}} new players. In 1930, Arsenal beat Newcastle United to win its first major piece of silverware: the FA Cup. Success continued right throughout the decade, as they won five league championships and a further FA Cup in seven years. Following the Second World War, Arsenal won two more championships and a FA Cup, but their fortunes gradually declined. It was not until 1970 that the club won another trophy – the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a European club competition designed to promote trade fairs. A first league and cup double was completed a year later; {{by the end of the}} decade Arsenal added another FA Cup, beating Manchester United in the 1979 final. 1980 saw Arsenal lose two finals in quick succession, defeated by West Ham United in the FA Cup final and then to Valencia in the Cup Winners' Cup on penalties. The club won their first League Cup in 1987, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later failed to retain the trophy as outsiders Luton Town beat them in the final. In 1989, Arsenal won their first league championship in 18 years, courtesy of Michael Thomas' last-minute goal against closest challengers Liverpool in the final game of the season. The club did not build on their success, finishing fourth the following season, but regained the title in 1991. As champions, Arsenal were eligible to play in the European Cup, but their time in the competition ended abruptly as they were eliminated in the second round to Benfica.|$|E

25|$|Dissatisfaction with Russian autocracy {{culminated in}} the huge {{national}} upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops.

The Tsar undermined this promise of reform <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later with Article 87 of the 1906 Fundamental State Laws, and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative.
