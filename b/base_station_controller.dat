BTSM allows sending messages {{between the}} <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Controller</b> and the Base Transceiver Station. Protocol messages {{consist of a}} series of information elements. For each message there are mandatory information elements and optional information elements.

40|$|Problem {{statement}} In cellular communications networks, cells use beacon frequencies {{to ensure}} the smooth operation of the network, for example in handling call handovers from one cell to another. These frequencies are assigned according to a frequency plan, which is updated from time to time, in response to evolving network requirements. The migration from one frequency plan to a new one proceeds in stages, governed by the network’s <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controllers.</b> Existing methods result in periods of reduced network availability or performance during the reassignment process. The Study Group was asked to develop an algorithm for implementing a new frequency plan that maintains service quality during the transition...|$|R

The SMLC may control several LMUs (Location Measurement Units), which measure radio signals to help find mobile stations in the area served by the SMLC. It can calculate location using the TA (Timing Advance) method.|$|E
50|$|GSM {{consists}} of two components: the mobile radio telephone and Subscriber Identity Module. GSM is a cellular network, which is a radio network {{made up of a}} number of cells. For each cell, the transmitter (known as a base station) is transmitting and receiving signals. The base station is controlled through the <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Controller</b> via the Mobile Switching Centre.|$|E
5000|$|The base {{transceiver}} station, or BTS, {{contains the}} equipment for transmitting and receiving radio signals (transceivers), antennas, and equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications with the <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controller</b> (BSC). Typically a BTS for {{anything other than}} a picocell will have several transceivers (TRXs) which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell (in the case of sectorised base stations).|$|E
5000|$|OpenBTS {{replaces the}} {{conventional}} GSM operator core network infrastructure from layer 3 upwards. Instead {{of relying on}} external <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controllers</b> for radio resource management, OpenBTS units perform this function internally. Instead of forwarding call traffic through to an operator's mobile switching center, OpenBTS delivers calls via SIP to a VOIP soft switch (such as FreeSWITCH or yate) or PBX (such as Asterisk). This VOIP switch or PBX software can be installed on the same computer used to run OpenBTS itself, forming a self-contained cellular network in a single computer system. Multiple OpenBTS units can also share a common VOIP switch or PBX to form larger networks ...|$|R
30|$|The goal of our {{assessment}} is {{to estimate the}} national energy consumption and GHG emissions using the number of <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> as an input parameter. This requires {{an estimate of the}} power consumption per <b>base</b> <b>station</b> and the overhead from the remaining parts of the network. Depending on its type, the power consumption of a <b>base</b> <b>station</b> can vary between 800 and 2, 800  W (estimations presented in [25]). Without additional information about the specific types of <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> the OCI data can only be parameterised with average data. Additionally, an assessment of the energy consumption of a mobile network should include all relevant system parts in order to enable greater transferability of results. We assume the following composition of the wireless network: the <b>base</b> <b>stations,</b> which house the antennas and amplifiers, and auxiliary equipment for cooling and power transformation provide the radio signal to subscribers. They are controlled by several <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controllers</b> and a few mobile service centres to which they are connected via a radio or fixed network. This network also provides connectivity with the Internet or networks of other operators. In our estimate of the GHG emissions we had to make some simplifying assumptions about the network infrastructure. We estimated the energy consumption for a single <b>base</b> <b>station</b> (including overhead for other system parts such as <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controllers)</b> of around 2, 100  W based on similar assumptions made in [25] and [26] that are based on publicly available data by Vodafone. This value is a top-down estimate based on the total energy consumption of the network and the total number of <b>base</b> <b>stations.</b> The corporate responsibility report of the Vodafone Group states that in 2011 the company globally operates 224, 000 <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> and that the energy consumption was 4, 117  GWh [27]. This value does not account for energy consumption in offices. Given that the average power consumption per <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is around 1.5  kW, the resulting value of 2, 100  W per <b>base</b> <b>station</b> is plausible and further corroborated by other studies such as [28] who state that the energy consumption of the <b>base</b> <b>stations</b> constitutes 60 - 80 % of the total energy consumption of the network.|$|R

50|$|In {{cellular}} wireless networks, such as GSM, the picocell {{base station}} is typically a low-cost, small (typically {{the size of}} a ream of A4 paper), reasonably simple unit that connects to a <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controller</b> (BSC). Multiple picocell 'heads' connect to each BSC: the BSC performs radio resource management and hand-over functions, and aggregates data to be passed to the mobile switching centre (MSC) or the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN).|$|E
50|$|In {{the fixed}} {{telephone}} network, a node {{may be a}} public or private telephone exchange, a remote concentrator or a computer providing some intelligent network service. In cellular communication, switching points and databases such as the <b>Base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controller,</b> Home Location Register, Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) are examples of nodes. Cellular network base stations are {{not considered to be}} nodes in this context.|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{wireless}} {{networks have}} become an indispensable part of the communications infrastructure. CDMA is an important air-interface technology for cellular wireless networks.

This project work aims to realize a congestion control mechanism for CDMA based IP-RAN networks. This project implements congestion avoidance, using the mechanism router control. To realize Router control mechanism an AQM-RED is to be implemented to maximize network capability while maintaining good voice quality. The performance of implementing system using AQM-RED is to be evaluated with Drop tail AQM method. Simulation results show that how congestion is controlled using Router Control Algorithms. 1...|$|R

There are two important aspects of upgrading to NGWN. The first importance of backward compatibility with pre-existing networks, and the second is the cost and operational benefit of gradually enhancing networks, by replacing, upgrading and installing new wireless network infrastructure elements that can accommodate both voice and data demand. Our objective function is the sources to concentrators connectivity costas well as the cost of the installation, connection, replacement, and capacity upgrade of infrastructure equipment. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm with a set of real world and data randomly generated. Numerical results show that our algorithms is a promising approach to solve this problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{the world}} of {{cellular}} telephony there is a hierarchy of controlling devices. Cellular telephones communicate with Base Transceiver Satations (BTS) or transceivers, which is turn are assigned to <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Controllers</b> (BSC) or controllers. All controllers are connected to a Mobile Switching Centers (MSC). As a user of a cellular telephone moves around, the call must be transfered from transceiver to transceiver, and sometimes from controller to controller. We {{are interested in the}} problem of minimizing the cost of these transfers from controller to controller. In the above hierarchy, we consider a subtree emanating from one Mobile Switching Center. The two sets corresponding to the subtree are I, the set of transceivers, and J, the set of controllers. The problem is to assign each transceiver from the set I to a controller from the set J optimally subject to certain constraints [...] ...|$|R

The aim of the architecture is to provide users who satisfy specific pre-conditions access to restricted resources and applications to which they otherwise normally would not be granted access.

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{efficiently}} transport slowly varying channel associated signalling bits, second order structures known as multiframes or superframes are defined.

Other types of second order structures {{are also in}} common use. In GSM cellular networks, the Abis channel that connects the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and <b>Base</b> <b>Station</b> <b>Controller</b> (BSC) is an E1 link with several framing alternatives, {{all of which have}} a basic superframe duration of 20 milliseconds.|$|E
50|$|A Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC), a node {{which is}} a source of SMS-CB, is {{connected}} to a <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controller</b> (BSC) in GSM networks or to a radio network controller (RNC) in UMTS networks via standardized interface over TCP/IP. The BSC-CBC interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 48.049; however, non-standard implementations exist. The RNC-CBC interface is described in 3GPP standard TS 25.419. A CBC sends SMS-CB messages, a list of cells where messages are to be broadcast, and the requested repetition rate and number of times they shall be broadcast to the BSC/RNC. The BSC's and RNC's responsibility is to deliver the SMS-CB messages to the base station (BTSs) and NodeBs, which handle the requested cells.|$|E
50|$|The <b>base</b> <b>station</b> <b>controller</b> (BSC) provides, classically, the {{intelligence}} behind the BTSs. Typically a BSC has tens or even hundreds of BTSs under its control. The BSC handles allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls handovers from BTS to BTS (except {{in the case}} of an inter-BSC handover in which case control is in part the responsibility of the anchor MSC). A key function of the BSC is to act as a concentrator where many different low capacity connections to BTSs (with relatively low utilisation) become reduced to a smaller number of connections towards the mobile switching center (MSC) (with a high level of utilisation). Overall, this means that networks are often structured to have many BSCs distributed into regions near their BTSs which are then connected to large centralised MSC sites.|$|E

40|$|When {{it comes}} to their Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure, no two Mobile Operators, serving remote service areas, are alike. Despite {{situations}} and technologies being diverse, a well designed optimized RAN solution must adapt itself to the existing networking technologies, both with regard to legacy core networks and modern telecommunication networks in order to produce the best network which is possible subject to many constraints.
