Commonly used target materials are butanol, ammonia,lithium hydrides and their deuterated counterparts.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> of space charge compensation (SCC) and {{the investigation of the}} compensation process is of main interest for low energy beam transport of pulsed high perveance ion beams under space charge compensated conditions. To investigate experimentally the rise of compensation an LEBT system consisting of a pulsed ion source, two solenoids and a drift tube as diagnostic section has been set up. The beam potential has been measured time resolved by a residual gas ion energy analyser (RGA). A numerical simulation for the calculation of self-consistent equilibrium states of the beam plasma has been developed to determine plasma parameters which are difficult measure directly. The results of the simulation has been compared with the measured data to investigate the behavior of the compensation electrons as a function of time. The acquired data shows that the theoretical rise time of space charge compensation is by a factor of two shorter than the <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> determined experimentally.

40|$|The LCLS {{injector}} must {{operate at}} 120 Hz repetition frequency but {{to date the}} maximum operating frequency of an S-band rf gun has been 50 Hz. The high fields desired for the LCLS gun operation limit the repetition frequency due to thermal expansion causing rf detuning and field redistribution. One method of addressing the thermal loading problem is too reduce the power lost on the cavity walls by properly shaping the rf pulse incident on the gun. The idea is to reach the steady state field value in the gun faster than the time constant of the gun would allow when using a flat incident rf pulse. By increasing the incident power by about a factor of three and then decreasing the incident power when the field reaches the desired value in the gun, the field <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> can be decreased {{by more than a}} factor of three.

To measure the radial density profile of the ion beam a CCD-camera performed time resolved measurements, which allow an estimation the rise time of compensation. Further the dynamic effect of the space charge compensation on the beam transport was shown. A numerical simulation under assumption of selfconsistent states [4] of the beam plasma has been used to determine plasma parameters such as the radial density profile and the temperature of the electrons.

A numerical simulation of self-consistent equilibrium states of the beam plasma has been developed to determine plasma parameters which are difficult to measure directly. The temporal development of the kinetic and potential energy of the compensation electrons has been analyzed by using the numerically gained results of the simulation.

40|$|The {{study of}} Precipitable Water (PW) and {{determining}} the cloud seeding threshold are {{of great importance}} in reducing the considerable cost of unsuccessful seeding or over- seeding which well result in a decrease in rainfall potentiality. The present study was carried out within four-year period covering from 2000 - 2003 where the amount of rainfall in North-Western Iran (Tabriz) was recorded by precipitation stations. PW was calculated using the data obtained through radiosonde, thermodynamic charts and MODIS satellite. Using the curve and upon choosing the fittest index PW as independent variable and the rainfall average precipitation (P) as dependent variable, from among the PW, the suitable cloud seeding threshold was estimated. The thresholds obtained through MODIS and radiosonde for cloud seeding and PW were compared across 21 cases. The two methods employed showed high correlation. The thresholds obtained through MODIS in Tabriz was 7 mm, respectively, while the thresholds obtained through radiosonde on the same days for PW was 9 mm in Tabriz. In general, the amount of PW obtained through radiosonde proved to be greater than those achieved through MODIS.

40|$|Nonlinear optical {{properties}} of the narrow band-gap semiconductor InAs have been studied using ultrashort femtosecond infrared pulses from a regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapphire pumped optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and difference frequency mixing (DFM) system. Characterisation of the laser showed good stability with 1. 5 µJ pulse energy in a Gaussian spatial distribution. Wavelength spectra were broad Gaussian distributions consistent with dispersion of ultrashort femtosecond duration pulses. Sub- 200 fs pulse lengths were measured with a two-photon detector based autocorrelation. The measured two-photon absorption coefficient agreed well with perturbation theory from 4 to 5. 5 µm. At longer wavelengths the coefficient was smaller than expected. This was attributed to the broad, polychromatic wavelength and uncertainty in the pulse length. No additional free carrier absorption was observed, even at very high irradiance. It is hypothesized that {{this was due to}} the carriers having insufficient time to undergo intra- band relaxation on the timescale of the pulses. Beam spreading and saturation effects may also have been occurring. Nonlinear refraction was measured using the z-scan technique. A strong defocusing component dominated which was consistent with free carrier plasma effects. A weaker component was also observed that was defocusing at 4 µm and self-focusing at 5. 5 µm. This was in agreement with predictions of an ultrafast, n₂ contribution, corresponding to the real part of the third order susceptibility χ⁽³⁾. Pump-probe measurements showed that the nonlinear refraction was instantaneous but the absorption had a <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> of 100 ps.

The paramagnetic centers, which are needed for the dynamical nuclear polarization process, must not be seriously damaged by the projectiles. Already since 1980 {{it is known that}} the lithium hydrides (" 6 LiD, " 7 LiH) are highly polarizable solid state materials. In addition " 6 LiD offers a very high effective neutron content in comparison to other polarizable target materials. Samples of " 7 LiH, " 6 LiD, " 6 LiH have been irradiated at the Bonn 20 MeV electron preaccelerator under various temperatures and with different radiation doses. For this purpose a special ''high temperature'' irradiation cryostat has been developed in Bonn. The most important paramagnetic defect, the so-called ''F-center'', created during these irradiations has been studied in a conventional EPR spectrometer at liquid nitrogen temperature. The ''optimum preirradiation temperature'' of about 180 K could be reproduced and motivated in terms of associated F-center formation. Polarization measurements at 2. 5 T and 1 K have been performed with all three lithium hydride isotopes under the intense (up to 70 nA) and high energy (1. 2 GeV) electron beam of the Bonn Electron Stretcher and Accelerator ELSA.

40|$|A Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (DNP) {{enhanced}} solid-state Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR spectrometer {{which uses}} a 187 GHz (corresponding to 1 H NMR frequency of 284 MHz) Extended Interaction Klystron (EIK) amplifier as the microwave source is briefly described. Its performance is demonstrated for a biomolecule (bacteriorhodopsin), a pharmaceutical, and surface functionalised silica. The EIK is very compact and easily incorporated into an existing spectrometer. The bandwidth of the amplifier is sufficient that it obviates {{the need for a}} sweepable magnetic field, once set, for all commonly used radicals. The variable power (CW or pulsed) output from the EIK is transmitted to the DNP-NMR probe using a quasi-optic system with a high power isolator and a corrugated waveguide which feeds the microwaves into the DNP-NMR probe. Curved mirrors inside the probe project the microwaves down the axis of the MAS rotor, giving a very efficient system such that maximum DNP enhancement is achieved with less than 3 W output from the microwave source. The DNP-NMR probe operates with a sample temperature down to 90 K whilst spinning at 8 kHz. Significant enhancements, in excess of 100 for bacteriorhodopsin in purple membrane (bR in PM), are shown along with spectra which are enhanced by ≈ 25 with respect to room temperature, for both the pharmaceutical furosemide and surface functionalised silica. These enhancements allow hitherto prohibitively time consuming experiments to be undertaken. The power at which the DNP enhancement in bR in PM saturates does not change significantly between 90 K and 170 K even though the enhancement drops by a factor of ≈ 11. As the DNP <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>time</b> decreases by a factor 3 over this temperature range, the reduction in T 1 n is presumably a significant contribution to the drop in enhancement. </p...|$|E
