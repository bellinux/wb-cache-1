5000|$|<b>Behentrimonium</b> {{chloride}}, {{also known}} as docosyltrimethylammonium chloride or BTAC-228, is a yellow waxlike organic compound with chemical formula 3(2)21 (...) (3)3, used as an antistatic agent and, sometimes, a disinfectant. It is commonly found in cosmetics such as conditioners, hair dye, and mousse, and also in detergents. Laboratory tests have indicated {{that it does not}} readily biodegrade.|$|E
50|$|Common {{antistatic}} {{agents are}} based on long-chain aliphatic amines (optionally ethoxylated) and amides, quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., <b>behentrimonium</b> chloride or cocamidopropyl betaine), esters of phosphoric acid, polyethylene glycol esters, or polyols. Traditional migrating antistatic agents include long-chain alkyl phenols, ethoxylated amines, and glycerol esters, such as glycerol monostearate. Migrating antistatic agents offer cost-effective protection for short-term applications, but other applications need longer-term protection or the lower resistivity required to prevent sparks and protect electronics from electrostatic dissipation. These applications utilize permanent antistatic agents or conductive additives such as carbon black, conductive fibers, and nanomaterials. An antistatic agent for the treatment for coatings may also involve an ionic liquid or a solution of a salt in an ionic liquid. Indium tin oxide {{can be used as}} transparent antistatic coating of windows. It is also possible to use conductive polymers, like PEDOT:PSS and conducting polymer nanofibers, particularly polyaniline nanofibers. In general these systems are not very durable for coating, especially antimony tin oxide is used for durable systems, often in its nano form, it is then formulated to a final coating.|$|E
