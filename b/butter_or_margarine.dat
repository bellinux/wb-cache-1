25|$|A common way {{of eating}} Vegemite is on toasted bread {{with a layer}} of <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> Only a small amount of Vegemite is {{required}} due to its strong flavour. A Vegemite sandwich may consist of two slices of buttered bread, Vegemite, and cheese, but other ingredients such as lettuce, avocado and tomato can be added as well.|$|E
25|$|Marmite is {{traditionally}} eaten as a savoury spread on bread, toast, savoury biscuits or crackers, {{and other similar}} baked products. Owing to its concentrated taste it is often spread thinly with <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> Marmite can also {{be made into a}} savoury hot drink by adding one teaspoon to a mug of hot water much like Oxo and Bovril.|$|E
25|$|A {{small amount}} of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually {{vegetable}} oil is used, but <b>butter,</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the tava, so it softens but does not break.|$|E
5000|$|Oleomargarine {{was invented}} by a French chemist in 1869, which uses a variety of soluble and {{insoluble}} ingredients which quickly became an alternative to <b>butter.</b> Oleomargarine <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> manufacturing plants which used beef fat and lard as main ingredients were established as an inexpensive alternative to butter manufacture which traditional used dairy products. Soon after its invention it came under regulation, to protect the dairy industry where taxes were levied on yellow margarine and in some countries an outright ban on its sale.|$|R
5000|$|A popular filling snack with British troops {{since at}} least World War I, the [...] "egg banjo" [...] is a {{sandwich}} of a runny fried egg between two thick slices of bread (if possible, <b>buttered</b> <b>or</b> with <b>margarine),</b> often accompanied by a mug of [...] "gunfire". A popular account of the term's origins, possibly a false etymology, is the act of cleaning spilt egg off one's body, the sandwich held {{out to the side}} with one hand whilst the other wipes at the drips, giving the impression of playing an invisible banjo.|$|R
40|$|Amount {{and type}} of fats in the diet have an {{important}} effect on bone health and lipid profile. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effect of different types of dietary oils and fats on lipid profile, calcium absorption and bone mineralization in male mice. Mice weighing 25 ± 5 g were divided into nine groups and fed on diets without oils or fats (control group) and containing soybean oil, corn oil, olive oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, <b>butter,</b> animal fat <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> Mice fed on diet containing soybean oil or olive oil had the lowest levels of TG, TC, LDL-c and HDL-c as compared to the other groups. Diets with palm oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, <b>butter,</b> animal fat <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> caused significant decreases in the serum level of calcium as compared to the effect of diet without oils or fats. Mice fed diet containing olive oil, <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> animal fat had significant increase in bone density, while those fed diet containing soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> had significant decreases in femur bone density, compared to the control group. The apparent calcium absorption was significantly increased by feeding diets containing soybean oil, corn oil, palm oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> animal fat. Dietary intake of vegetable oils improved lipid profile while butter, animal fat and margarine had the opposite effect. Butter and animal fats increased calcium and phosphorus deposition in femur bone more than vegetable oils...|$|R
2500|$|One {{particularly}} notorious {{example of}} this first came to public attention in the mid-1990s, when the Center for Science in the Public Interest produced a report about [...] "Movie Popcorn", which {{became the subject of}} a widespread publicity campaign. The movie theaters surveyed used coconut oil to pop the corn, and then topped it with <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> [...] "A medium-size buttered popcorn", the report said, [...] "contains more fat than a breakfast of bacon and eggs, a Big Mac and fries, and a steak dinner combined." [...] The practice continues today. For example, according to DietFacts.com, a small popcorn from Regal Cinema Group (the largest theater chain in the United States) still contains 29 g of saturated fat. the equivalent of a full day-and-a-half's reference daily intake.|$|E
2500|$|Another item {{prepared}} like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake {{seems to}} be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes {{from other parts of the}} West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick fry-up for breakfast or dinner, stewed saltfish, or eggs ("western" [...] style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies including Trinidad, Barbados and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a [...] "bake and shark" [...] is a popular street food sandwich in which fried shark is sandwiched between two halves of a sliced bake with a plethora of local condiments. Pepper sauce, shado beni, garlic sauce, tamarind and mango chutney are most common as well as lettuce, tomato and cucumber for fillers.|$|E
5000|$|Polvoron- Roasted flour with sugar, milk, and <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{is based}} on a [...] "half-fat-to-flour" [...] ratio (twice as much flour as fat by weight). Fat (lard, shortening, <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> full-fat <b>margarine)</b> is rubbed into plain flour to create a loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice water, rolled out, then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a flan or pie. Ideally, equal amounts of butter and lard are used to make the pastry, {{ensuring}} that the ratio of the two fat products is half that of the flour. The butter is employed to give the pastry a rich flavor, whilst the lard ensures optimum texture.|$|R
50|$|Diacetyl and acetoin are two {{compounds}} that give butter its characteristic taste. Because of this, manufacturers of artificial <b>butter</b> flavoring, <b>margarines</b> <b>or</b> similar oil-based products typically add diacetyl and acetoin (along with beta-carotene for the yellow color) {{to make the}} final product butter-flavored, because it would otherwise be relatively tasteless.|$|R
50|$|Vegetable gravy or {{vegetarian}} gravy is gravy {{made with}} boiled or roasted vegetables. A quick and flavorful vegetable gravy {{can be made}} from any combination of vegetable broth or vegetable stock, flour, and one of either <b>butter,</b> oil, <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> One recipe uses vegetarian bouillon cubes with cornstarch (corn flour) as a thickener (cowboy roux), which is whisked into boiling water. Sometimes vegetable juices are added to enrich the flavor, which may give the gravy a dark green color. Wine could be added. Brown vegetarian gravy can also be made with savory yeast extract like Marmite or Vegemite. There are also commercially produced instant gravy granules which are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans.|$|R

50|$|Danish pastry {{is made of}} yeast-leavened dough {{of wheat}} flour, milk, eggs, sugar and large amounts of <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The fat - lard, {{vegetable}} oil, <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> - acts as {{a molecular}} lubrificant, contributing to the elastic texture of the dough.|$|E
50|$|Simple buttercream (also {{known as}} American buttercream, decorator's buttercream, and decorator's frosting) {{is made by}} {{creaming}} together fats (<b>butter,</b> <b>margarine,</b> <b>or</b> vegetable oil shortening) and powdered sugar to the desired consistency and lightness. Typically twice as much sugar as butter by weight is used. Flavorings, {{in the form of}} extracts and oils, may also be added. Some recipes call for non-fat milk solids or meringue powder; these add a creamy texture without any decrease in stability.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, traditionally, {{they are}} made from minced veal, pork or beef (or a blend of two of these meats); chopped onions; eggs; milk (or water); bread crumbs (or oatmeal or flour); salt; and pepper; then formed into balls and {{flattened}} somewhat. They are then pan-fried in pork fat or beef fat, or more commonly in modern times in <b>butter,</b> <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> even vegetable oil. Another popular variation is fiskefrikadeller replacing the meat with fish as the main ingredient and often served with remoulade.|$|R
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, <b>butter,</b> <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|R
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} served hot and consumed by dipping in coffee. It {{can also be}} complemented with <b>butter</b> (<b>or</b> <b>margarine),</b> cheese, jam, or peanut butter.|$|E
50|$|A jam {{sandwich}} {{is usually}} {{composed of two}} slices of bread, <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine,</b> and jam (traditionally strawberry) which is normally consumed at lunchtime or as a snack.|$|E

50|$|Banana cake is {{prepared}} using banana {{as a primary}} ingredient and typical cake ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, <b>butter,</b> <b>margarine</b> <b>or</b> oil and baking soda. The bananas can be mashed or puréed using {{a food processor or}} electric mixer and mixed into the cake batter, and the cake can also be topped or garnished with sliced bananas. Banana cake may be prepared as a use for browned or overly-ripe bananas. Chocolate may be used as an ingredient, which along with the banana is an enjoyable flavor combination for some people. Nuts such as walnuts and macadamias may be used in the batter and to top and garnish the cake.|$|R

30|$|D'Eon and Mabury [40] {{examined}} {{the formation of}} PFCA through the biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl phosphate surfactants [PAPS]. The authors showed that, {{in spite of their}} large molecular size, these substances are bioavailable and that PFOA and other PFCs may be formed by their biotransformation. PAPS can probably be degraded by dephosphorylating enzymes in organisms because of the phosphate-ester bond between the fluorinated part and the acidic head group. However, {{it should be noted that}} the rats in this study were fed high oral doses of 200 mg/kg PAPS. Renner raises concerns of the fact that PAPS may migrate much more effectively into emulsions such as <b>butter,</b> <b>margarine,</b> <b>or</b> lecithin additives than into food simulants such as oil or water [40, 41].|$|R
5000|$|Kue bolen, baked pastry with crust layers {{similar to}} those of croissant, baked flour with <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> layers, filled with cheese and banana. Other {{variants}} uses durian fillings. The cake demonstrate European pastry influences.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} effect on lipid and {{lipoprotein}} concentrations when <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> an unsaturated <b>margarine</b> is used for cooking or spreading in a reduced fat diet. DESIGN [...] Randomised crossover study with two intervention periods of six weeks' duration separated by a five week washout. SETTING [...] Community setting in New Zealand. SUBJECTS [...] 49 volunteers with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia and baseline total cholesterol concentration in the range 5. 5 - 7. 9 mmol/l. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein, Lp(a) lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein B 100, and apolipoprotein A I. RESULTS [...] Concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were about 10 % lower with margarine than with butter. Lp(a) lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were similar with the two diets. CONCLUSION [...] Despite concerns about adverse effects on lipoproteins of trans fatty acids in margarines, the use of unsaturated margarine rather than butter by hypercholesterolaemic people {{is associated with a}} lipoprotein profile that would be expected to reduce cardiovascular risk...|$|R
50|$|Frying is {{not always}} necessary, but is often used for fish or wild game caught while on the trip, as well as pancakes and certain kinds of bread and desserts made on the trail. As a general rule, the frying medium used in camp cooking is usually either {{vegetable}} oil <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> Normal (salted) <b>butter</b> may also be appropriate for camp use, but unsalted <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> lard may not be, due to their shorter shelf life.|$|R
5000|$|A {{finished}} cake {{is often}} enhanced by covering it with icing, or frosting, and toppings such as sprinkles, {{which are also}} known as [...] "jimmies" [...] {{in certain parts of}} the United States and [...] "hundreds and thousands" [...] in the United Kingdom. Frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder. Some decorators use a rolled fondant icing. Commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles. This makes the icing light and spreadable. Home bakers either use lard, <b>butter,</b> <b>margarine,</b> <b>or</b> some combination thereof. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.|$|R
50|$|They {{are made}} from wheat flour, palm oil and yeast, and are {{commonly}} served with cheese or other savoury topping such as Marmite or Vegemite. They are also eaten with <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine</b> or without accompaniment. An average cream cracker contains about 35 kcal.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{they are}} often eaten as a breakfast food; {{toppings}} vary from whipped cream, confectioners sugar, soft fruit, and chocolate spread, to syrup and <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine.</b> They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a dessert.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{ingredients of}} a Yorkshire parkin are oatmeal, flour, black treacle (similar to molasses), fat (traditionally lard, but modern recipes use <b>butter</b> <b>or</b> <b>margarine),</b> and ginger. Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Yorkshire parkin, whilst Lancashire Parkin is baked using Golden Syrup and extra sugar.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and optimization of an analytical method using enzymatic biosensors {{able to operate}} in organic solvents [organic phase enzyme electrodes (OPEEs) ] for {{the determination of the}} water content in food fats (<b>butter,</b> <b>margarine)</b> <b>or</b> pharmaceutical or cosmetic ointments is described. The method is based on the increase in enzymatic activity which is related to the increase in the percentage water content in the organic phase into which the biosensor is dipped. The enzymes used to assemble the biosensors were tyrosinase or catalase, the substrates were phenol or p-cresol and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, respectively, and the organic solvents were acetonitrile or dioxane. A gas diffusion amperometric electrode for oxygen measurement was used as electrochemical transducer. The results were compared with those obtained applying the Karl Fischer method to the same food or drug matrices. The correlations among the two methods proved satisfactory, as the difference in the computed values of water content was never higher than 7 %. Also, the precision of measurements was acceptable (RSD < 6 %) in all the analyses of real matrices...|$|R
5000|$|Boxed mixes {{consist of}} {{uncooked}} pasta and either a liquid cheese sauce (often labeled [...] "deluxe") or powdered ingredients to prepare it. The powdered cheese sauce {{is mixed with}} either milk <b>or</b> water, and <b>margarine,</b> <b>butter,</b> <b>or</b> olive oil and added to the cooked noodles. Some mixes prepared in a microwave cook the pasta in the sauce.|$|R
50|$|Johnnycake is a {{traditional}} staple across the island. Some people call these fried dumplings whilst others say fried Johnnycakes.
