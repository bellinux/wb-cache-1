5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no <b>better,</b> <b>because</b> the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E

25|$|In the children's houses, trained {{nurses and}} {{teachers}} were the care givers. It was felt that relationships {{of the children}} and their parents would be <b>better</b> <b>because</b> parents would not have to be the sole disciplinarians. Children grew up in the community environment and grew up with children who were born in the same year as them. The financial responsibility of the children was shared by the community.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of broadheads used by hunters: The fixed-blade and the {{mechanical}} types. While the fixed-blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times, the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. The mechanical head flies <b>better</b> <b>because</b> it is more streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the late}} 14th century, European powdermakers first began adding liquid during {{grinding}} to improve mixing, reduce dust, {{and with it}} the risk of explosion. The powder-makers would then shape the resulting paste of dampened gunpowder, known as mill cake, into corns, or grains, to dry. Not only did corned powder keep <b>better</b> <b>because</b> of its reduced surface area, gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. Before long, powder-makers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand.|$|E
25|$|Sodium carbonate, {{also known}} as soda ash, is an {{effective}} industrial alkali. The manufacture of sodium carbonate from common salt was first developed in France in the 1790s and known as the Leblanc process. Muspratt was attracted towards manufacturing it, but could not raise the capital for the relatively expensive Leblanc plant and also considered that Dublin was not a suitable location for this. He perceived Merseyside as <b>better</b> <b>because</b> of the neighbouring coal fields, the proximity to the salt district of Cheshire, and the proximity to glassmaking industry. The glassmakers were the main prospective customer base for the sodium carbonate alkali.|$|E

25|$|The last form is queen {{policing}} of eggs. It {{was estimated}} that about 32% of policing over worker-laid eggs {{was done by}} the queen (roughly one-third). There are two cases where queen-laid eggs were eaten: one if a reproductive worker eats the egg then, it will replace it with its own egg and if a non-reproductive worker eats the egg, then the queen always lays the replacement. These situations were less common and only occurred 8% of the time. Queen policing is popular in colonies that are small and of low paternity. Relatively smaller colonies are <b>better</b> <b>because</b> the queen can monitor and control her workers.|$|E
25|$|This {{enhanced}} {{sensitivity to}} {{noise in the}} region of 6kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of compact cassette recorders and Dolby-B noise reduction. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound <b>better,</b> <b>because</b> of differing spectral content.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of raw feeding {{believe that}} the natural diet of raw meat, bones, and organs is nutritionally {{superior}} to cooked meat and commercial pet food. They argue that a careful plan of a raw diet gives the animal numerous health benefits, including a healthier coat and cleaner teeth and elimination of bad breath. Critics of raw feeding assert {{that the risk of}} nutritional imbalance, intestinal perforations and foodborne illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meat and bones outweigh any benefits. The assertion that raw feeding is inherently <b>better</b> <b>because</b> it is natural has also been criticized by proponents of commercial pet foods.|$|E

25|$|Thirty {{thousand}} POWs {{were brought}} {{to work on the}} railway through Norland. The treatment of the POWs varied depending on their nationality, their status in regard to the Geneva Convention and their alignment. Russians who converted to support Andrey Vlasov were treated better and often sent to own camps. Similarly, only two of over 1,000 Polish POWs in Nordland died, and were treated <b>better</b> <b>because</b> Polish people were generally regarded as pro-Axis. Wehrmacht invested the equivalent of NOK15 million in labor and other costs in the line. At the time of the German capitulation on 8 May 1945, there were an estimated 8,300 POWs living in camps on the segment between Fauske and Drag. About ten percent of those who had worked on the line had died.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Stockton and Darlington {{encouraged}} the rich investors in the rapidly industrialising North West of England to embark upon a project to link the rich cotton manufacturing town of Manchester with the thriving port of Liverpool. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first modern railway, in that both the goods and passenger traffic were operated by scheduled or timetabled locomotive hauled trains. When it was built, there was serious doubt that locomotives could maintain a regular service over the distance involved. A widely reported competition was held in 1829 called the Rainhill Trials, {{to find the most}} suitable steam engine to haul the trains. A number of locomotives were entered, including Novelty, Perseverance and Sans Pareil. The winner was Stephenson's Rocket, which steamed <b>better</b> <b>because</b> of its multi-tubular boiler (suggested by Henry Booth, a director of the railway company).|$|E
25|$|Carnot {{published}} his {{book in the}} heyday of steam engines. His theory explained why steam engines using superheated steam were <b>better</b> <b>because</b> of the higher temperature of the consequent hot reservoir. Carnot's theories and efforts did not immediately help improve the efficiency of steam engines; his theories only helped to explain why one existing practice was superior to others. It was only {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century that Carnot's ideas, namely that a heat engine can be made more efficient if the temperature of its hot reservoir is increased, were put into practice. Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a real impact on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the hot reservoir is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.|$|E

30|$|Longer (> 150 ft) {{and wider}} (> 0.01 ft) {{fractures}} provide <b>better</b> efficiency <b>because</b> {{of the greater}} surface area for gas diffusion. With the same operating conditions, hydraulic-fracture effectiveness can double the efficiency.|$|R

25|$|Mulch is a kleptomaniac, {{criminal}} dwarf who {{has been}} involved in crime for about 300 years. When considered with the average Dwarf life span he is not that old, making him nice and spry, a good advantage for a criminal. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (in other words, humans) suited him much <b>better.</b> <b>Because</b> he has stolen from 'Mud Men' Mulch no longer has any significant magic powers of the usual fairy, however he has retained the gift of tongues, and has even shown his ability to speak 'American Dog' in The Arctic Incident. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. But eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with The People on many adventures, acting as a LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox.|$|E

500|$|Some {{contemporary}} scholars call Pericles a populist, a demagogue and a hawk, {{while other}} scholars admire his charismatic leadership. According to Plutarch, after assuming {{the leadership of}} Athens, [...] "he {{was no longer the}} same man as before, nor alike submissive to the people and ready to yield and give in to the desires of the multitude as a steersman to the breezes". It is told that when his political opponent, Thucydides, was asked by Sparta's king, Archidamus, whether he or Pericles was the better fighter, Thucydides answered without any hesitation that Pericles was <b>better,</b> <b>because</b> even when he was defeated, he managed to convince the audience that he had won. In matters of character, Pericles was above reproach {{in the eyes of the}} ancient historians, since [...] "he kept himself untainted by corruption, although he was not altogether indifferent to money-making".|$|E
