25|$|Device {{fingerprinting}} is {{a fairly}} new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are unaware their computers are being used.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought of nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
500|$|Beholder {{initially}} {{developed a}} reputation as a [...] "temperamental diva." [...] As a young filly, she was prone to rearing when she got upset and later turned to bucking. [...] <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> worked with her every day viewed her differently; her exercise rider in 2013, David Nuesch, described her as [...] "straightforward", explaining, [...] "she kind of likes it to be her idea and doesn't want to be told too much what to do." [...] Her groom, Ruben Mercado, said she was a [...] "little angel" [...] in the stables but [...] "all business" [...] on the track. Mandella used earplugs and a hood with ear coverings (colloquially called [...] "earmuffs") to help keep her focused. At one point, he tried giving her ear buds, but the sound upset her even more. Mandella was described as the [...] "perfect" [...] trainer for her, as he was willing to try different training techniques to keep her from getting in her own way, took the time to figure out her quirks, and learned to anticipate her behavior. [...] The bond and depth of communication between trainer and horse was noted in the press. Mandella's son Gary described Beholder as having an [...] "Alpha Male perspective," [...] explaining, [...] "She’s actually dominant, bullyish and head strong. She’s not quirky because she’s worried that something is lurking around the corner. The things that she does that are hard to manage are because she’s tougher than you." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{debate over}} the extent reached by {{unemployment}} in Australia, often cited as peaking at 29 per cent in 1932. [...] "Trade Union figures are the most often quoted, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were there...regard the figures as wildly understating the extent of unemployment" [...] wrote historian Wendy Lowenstein in her collection of oral histories of the Depression. However, David Potts argues that [...] "over {{the last thirty years}} ...historians of the period have either uncritically accepted that figure (29% in the peak year 1932) including rounding it up to 'a third,' or they have passionately argued that a third is far too low." [...] Potts himself though suggested a peak national figure of 25 per cent unemployed.|$|E

In March 2000, Lori Majewski, entertainment director at Teen People magazine, stated: [...] "If {{people want to know}} why Christina is going to be around a decade from now, the answer is very clear: It's pure talent," [...] Majewski said. [...] "When you hear this girl open her mouth, everyone is astounded. I've seen her sing many times, and every time, I'm impressed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are hearing {{it for the first time}} can't even believe it." [...] In an article about the [...] "2013 Most Influential People in the World", in which Aguilera appeared, Canadian singer-songwriter Céline Dion claimed that, [...] "I remember she broke onto the scene at the turn of the millennium, [...] so I got to watch a lot of her TV appearances, especially on the award shows.
