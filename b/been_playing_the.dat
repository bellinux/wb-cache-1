Later in 1955 Ford was hired by Warner Bros to direct the Naval comedy Mister Roberts, starring Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, William Powell, and James Cagney, but there was conflict between Ford and Fonda, who had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> lead role on Broadway {{for the past seven years}} and had misgivings about Ford's direction. During a three-way meeting with producer Leland Hayward to try and iron out the problems, Ford became enraged and punched Fonda on the jaw, knocking him across the room, an action that created a lasting rift between them. After the incident Ford became increasingly morose, drinking heavily and eventually retreating to his yacht, the Araner, and refusing to eat or see anyone. Production was shut down for five days and Ford sobered up, but soon after he suffered a ruptured gallbladder, necessitating emergency surgery, and he was replaced by Mervyn LeRoy.|$|E

500|$|Kanye West {{would be}} the first person to tell you he belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't [...] He fought for his place in the {{cultural}} pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): [...] "We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think." [...] But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process.

500|$|Connor {{undergoes}} {{dramatic changes}} in season five. Very much an opposite to his earlier persona, the only features common with his previous self are his protectiveness of loved ones, attraction to older women, and later his fighting prowess. Otherwise he's a prosperous, sweet young man, due to his fake memories of a happy childhood. Jeffrey Bell wanted to highlight Connor's [...] "well-adjusted" [...] mentality for this season. Vincent calls him a [...] "happy" [...] person and liked playing this version more because he has <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> [...] "brooding" [...] version {{for a year and}} a half year. The comic book Connor develops in the same direction as he starts emerging a hero still keeping his pleasant personality. Joss Whedon characterizes the comic book Connor as [...] "the closest thing to a superhero hell has' because he has powers without any of the weaknesses of the vampire, and is well adjusted. Brain considers him [...] "one of the coolest characters in any series or comics".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Materia Generation System" [...] allows {{players to}} acquire Materia, objects {{tied to the}} game's magic system, by taking a picture with their camera phone. The game synthesizes the picture down to its base color. Depending upon the {{dominant}} color, lighting, and other factors, the game produces a Materia of a certain type. For example, a dark green picture results in a Bio Materia, while a blue picture results in a Cure Materia. Once acquired, Materia can be leveled up as in Final Fantasy VII. Under certain circumstances, assistance {{in the form of}} summoned monsters, recurring figures in the Final Fantasy series, can be called in via the Materia system to deal damage to multiple enemies. Rank Points are awarded during the completion of objectives in all three modes of play. After a certain amount of Rank Points have been acquired, special bonuses are unlocked, such as stronger armor and weapons, and extra Materia slots. The player is also given a rank, based upon how long they have <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> game. The higher their rank, the better the bonuses the player gets.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 1988, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies". The song {{features the}} lyrics of The Beverly Hillbillies theme song altered slightly and set {{to the tune of}} [...] "Money for Nothing". The song appears in its entirety within UHF as a computer-animated dream sequence, framed as if it were part of a music video. As part of his terms that allowed Yankovic to record this parody, Dire Straits lead singer and guitarist and [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] songwriter Mark Knopfler insisted that he be allowed to play the guitar featured in the parody. As a result, both he and Guy Fletcher — Dire Straits' keyboardist — recorded their parts on guitar and synthesizer respectively. According to Yankovic, his guitarist Jim West had practiced the song for weeks, and, as a result could recreate the original; Knopfler, on the other hand, had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> song for several years and was much more relaxed with his playing. As a result, West's version sounded more like the original version, although Knopfler's track was the one used. Yankovic revealed in the DVD commentary for UHF that the concept [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] was originally a parody of Prince's 1984 hit [...] "Let's Go Crazy". Prince, however, refused, and has been unreceptive to any parody ideas Yankovic has ever presented him with. The fractured titled [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] is a result of Dire Straits' lawyers insisting that [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] remain in the parody's title. Yankovic was unhappy with the title and stated that he would rather have had the title be either [...] "Money for Nothing for the Beverly Hillbillies" [...] or [...] "Beverly Hillbillies for Nothing". The legal title for the song features an asterisk after the word [...] "Hillbillies", although it is often printed without the marking.|$|E

He argued that Daniel was not in the right state of mind to understand the finality of shooting his parents. He had <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> game so long that he did not comprehend the fact that death was real and permanent.
