500|$|Construction on the Brookville Tunnel, or the [...] "middle" [...] or [...] "second tunnel" [...] as it {{was then}} called, was begun {{sometime}} between 1849 and 1851. [...] The earth encountered at Brookville was of a much weaker quality than at the Greenwood Tunnel, rendering the digging of the tunnel both an extremely dangerous and difficult task. [...] Although the eastern section of the ridge was composed of firm and sturdy rock, the majority of the tunnel passed through a mixture of frail slate that was formed at a steep angle, soapstone, and clay. [...] When exposed to air, this mixture would often disintegrate causing large amounts of earth to fall into the tunnel bore. On two occasions during the tunnel's construction, though great care was taken to provide temporary support, major cave-ins occurred forming craters on top of the ridge, as much as [...] above the tunnel. [...] Another slide occurred {{on the outside of the}} western portal that blocked the entrance to the tunnel and prevented workers from repairing the damage from the two internal cave-ins. [...] Rocks often fell down upon the timbers under which the men worked, creating sounds described as [...] "resembling that of distant thunder". [...] The weakness of the earth, especially in the western sections, necessitated the implementation of a strong arch throughout approximately [...] of the tunnel and a durable <b>brick</b> <b>lining.</b> [...] Crozet described the nature of the work on the tunnel in an 1854 letter: ...|$|E
2500|$|The first tunnel (the more {{northern}} of the uptown pair) {{was originally}} built without an excavation shield or iron construction because {{the chief engineer}} of the time, Dewitt Haskin, believed that the river silt {{was strong enough to}} maintain the tunnel's form (with the help of compressed air) until a [...] <b>brick</b> <b>lining</b> could be constructed. Haskin's plan was to excavate the tunnel, then fill it with compressed air to expel the water and to hold the iron plate lining in place. They succeeded in building the tunnel out by approximately [...] from Jersey City until a series of blowouts—including a particularly serious one in 1880 that took the lives of 20workers—ended the project.|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the refractory <b>brick</b> <b>lining</b> of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the press and blow forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, inspection equipment gathers statistical information and relays it to the forming machine operators in the hot end. Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it. Operators carry out a range of checks manually on samples of containers, usually visual and dimensional checks.|$|E

"I {{feel ashamed}} to own it," [...] he said, at last; [...] "but I {{really do not}} know how one could set about the matter so as to have a chance of really {{destroying}} the tunnel, after so short a time for preparation. Were the tunnel an ordinary, brick-lined tunnel, the proposition of De Maupas--slightly modified--would no doubt have the effect of bringing down the <b>brick</b> <b>lining,</b> and the earth behind would fall in, of itself; but with a tunnel cut in the solid rock, it would be difficult. The natural strength of the tunnel would be so great that the force of the explosion would simply be lost, through the ends. It might or might not bring down a few masses of rock, but one could not rely upon it doing even that.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the tunnel}} itself was {{completed}} in 1852, track was not laid, due to problems with the east entrance. A temporary switchback track, requiring reversal at each stage, was built to provide service until the tunnel was finished. Work began in 1854 on an arched liner using prefabricated sections of iron, faced with stone against the eventual deterioration of the iron liners. 1200 ft of this system were used at the east end, and another 1700 ft of the tunnel were lined with <b>brick.</b> <b>Lining</b> work, followed by track laying, {{was completed in}} 1858. It was completed with two tracks, but the increasing size of rolling stock necessitated a conversion to single track after 1865. Grouting and underpinning work was required in 1889 through {{the entire length of}} the tunnel, and additional <b>brick</b> <b>lining</b> was later installed in the section with iron liners.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} {{structures}} built {{in addition to}} the traditional home: a cooking facility and storage area (located just behind the home) and several farming structures were built. They also installed the trademark <b>brick</b> <b>lined</b> well to provide water to the property.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brick</b> <b>lining</b> will {{typically}} rest on {{a circular}} concrete well curb.The lining may have open joints to allow water to enter. In this case the well is often plugged {{at the bottom and}} the water enters from the sides. Ballast of 20 to 25 cm diameter is packed around the outside of the lining to prevent sand from flowing into the well. This design may be used in gravel or coarse sand where the water table is shallow. Impervious wells are made using masonry with cement or lime mortar. They may be sunk 5 to 60 m deep. Water seeps into a cavity in the open bottom, or comes up from a pipe sunk down {{from the center of the}} well into the water-bearing sand.The top part of the well should prevent foreign matter or surface water from entering the well, so should be impervious.The top of the well should be protected and the area around the well drained.The <b>brick</b> <b>lining</b> can greatly improve sanitation if it rises above ground level, preventing contamination of the well water by animal feces.|$|E
50|$|In 1872, the River Medlock rose {{suddenly}} and tore away {{part of the}} printworks complex, as well as washing away between 40 and 50 bodies from Philips Park Cemetery. After this, the river was lined with red bricks to prevent such a disaster from happening again.

50|$|St Mary's Church {{was built}} in 1892/94 (Arthur Blomfield) to serve the new parts of the village, {{replacing}} St Peter at West Liss, which remains an intact 13th-century structure with its few later additions. The original construction of St Mary's consisted of a chancel with a north transept for the organ and a vestry, and a nave with north and south aisles and a north porch in plain 13th-century style. It is built of local sandstone with dressed quoins, with <b>brick</b> <b>lining.</b>|$|E
50|$|Close to the Romanesque-building style, Gothic, or Gothic-revival style uses {{stone masonry}} to build. The use of rocky dark {{sandstone}} and limestone materials contrasted greatly with the smooth <b>brick</b> <b>lining</b> inside, the pointed-arch shape dominating {{the windows and}} doors and hallways. The porch is another Gothic-revival element that architect Henry Sproatt added, a protected space {{in front of the}} main entrances for people to hide in case of bad weather. The addition of decorated wooden arch-braces and ceilings act like an acoustical amplifier for the Hart House Orchestra.|$|E
50|$|The soft, sandy tunnel {{collapsed}} {{several times}} and {{attempts were made to}} repair it with <b>brick</b> <b>lining,</b> but the whole aqueduct was abandoned in 1884 after a flood tore out the wooden dam. It had already been realized since 1878 that several improvements would have to be done to the zanja systems. Some of this included conversion of the smaller ditches to pipelines while larger areas would be concrete. After this last failure the earthen toma and open ditch were put back into service while more elaborate plans were being made.|$|E
