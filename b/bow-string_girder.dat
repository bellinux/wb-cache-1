50|$|The {{superstructure}} of {{the bridge}} is of the <b>bow-string</b> <b>girder</b> type. While designing, the projected speed for the trains was taken as 160 km per hour. Taking into consideration the cyclonic conditions, the wind speed considered without live load was 200 km per hour, and with dead load the speed considered was 158 km per hour. As the location {{of the bridge}} is in the Seismic Zone I, seismic load has not been accounted for in the design.|$|E
50|$|Opened in 1885, the five-span rock-hewn {{limestone}} railway viaduct {{over the}} River Laune has single-arch sections {{to the east}} and to the west with limestone and red brick voussoirs. A three-span section leads to the centre with <b>bow-string</b> cast-iron <b>girders</b> on tapered limestone piers. The Bridge was designed by S.G. Frazier. The three metal spans are each 95ft long, each consisting of pairs of twin cross braced <b>bow-string</b> <b>girders</b> of part N-truss and part latticed members. The piers and bridge abutments are made of local limestone. The bridge was repaired in 1950 and closed in 1960. Renovations in 1993 were made to accommodate its use as footbridge.|$|R
