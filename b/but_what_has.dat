25|$|English individualism {{developed}} hand in {{hand with}} legal equality. American self-reliance, on the other hand, has been inseparable from an insistence upon economic and social as well as political equality. The result is that a qualified individualism, with a qualified equality, has prevailed in England, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been considered the unalienable right of every American is unrestricted self-reliance and, at least ideally, unrestricted equality. The English, therefore, tend to respect class-based distinctions in birth, wealth, status, manners, and speech, while Americans resent them.|$|E

[...] He {{also said}} that [...] "Puente" [...] was the only song that was [...] "not allowed to undress". When asked about [...] "Puente"'s main theme, Arjona commented, [...] "Although many believe is a threshed topic, it isn't for a Cuban, be it on the island or Florida. The status of this dispute hasn't changed since 1959 and I've never seen {{something}} as disgusting as a rivalry between people occasioned from politics. Chávez can fight with Uribe, Fidel with Obama, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> this to do with two third-generation cousins that inherit an enmity for a politic matter".|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with the stark view of Winesburg, Ohio above, a number of scholars have taken the perspective that the cycle is, in fact, about escape from isolation instead of the condition itself. Barry D. Bort writes, [...] "Criticism of Winesburg, Ohio has recognized this desperate need to communicate, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> not been understood about Anderson's work is that this continual frustration serves as the context out of which arise a few luminous moments of understanding...Such moments {{are at the heart}} of Winesburg, Ohio, although they are few and evanescent". Though rarely does escape come in the narrative present, many of the stories prominently feature anecdotes of past adventures where lonely and reserved characters run naked through the town on a rainy night (Alice Hindman in [...] "Adventure"), drive their wagon headlong into a speeding locomotive (Windpeter Winters in [...] "The Untold Lie"), and have window-shattering religious epiphanies (Reverend Curtis Hartman in [...] "The Strength of God"). While not all of the adventures are so dramatic, each has its place in the annals of the town, sometimes as told to George Willard, other times in the memories of participants.|$|E
2500|$|Shevchenko {{was arrested}} {{along with other}} members of the society on April 5, 1847. Tsar Nicholas read Shevchenko's poem, [...] "Dream". Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy {{appearance}} and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated [...] "I suppose he had reasons not to be on terms with me, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> she done to deserve this?" [...] In the official report of Orlov Shevchenko was accused in using [...] "Little-Russian language" [...] (archaic Russian name for Ukrainian language) of outrageous content instead of being grateful to be redeemed out of serfdom. In the report Orlov claimed that Shevchenko was expressing a cry over alleged enslavement and disaster of Ukraine, glorified the Hetman Administration (Cossack Hetmanate) and Cossack liberties and [...] "with incredible audacity poured slander and bile on persons of Imperial House".|$|E
