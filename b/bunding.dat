5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, <b>bunding</b> was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
25|$|Where fly ash {{is stored}} in bulk, it is usually stored wet rather than dry to {{minimize}} fugitive dust. The resulting impoundments (ponds) are typically large and stable for long periods, but any breach of their dams or <b>bunding</b> is rapid and on a massive scale.|$|E
50|$|When {{the risk}} of tank failure is not as likely or when it would not cause {{extensive}} damage, the <b>bunding</b> may be designed to merely contain small leaks from hoses and valves. This <b>bunding</b> {{may not be able}} to contain the entire volume of the tank. Plastic and steel are used, but another common method is making a hump or lip around the perimeter of a concrete floor. Some <b>bunding</b> is temporary, such as short-term chemical storage in the field. A hump or slope type <b>bunding</b> is helpful when vehicles need access to the area. There is also a type of <b>bunding</b> that compresses when a vehicle passes over and expands once it has passed.|$|E

In February 1919 these groups (representing the majority in Ukrainian <b>Bund</b> movement) adopted the name 'Communist Bund', constituting themselves as an independent party of the Jewish proletariat.

50|$|The term {{can also}} refer to dikes, {{but it is}} {{frequently}} used to describe liquid containment facilities that prevent leaks and spillage from tanks and pipes, though sometimes any barrier {{is referred to as}} <b>bunding.</b> Frequently, the liquids in these tanks and pipes are toxic, and <b>bunding</b> is used to prevent the liquid from causing damage (either by force or its chemistry). If a large tank has a catastrophic failure, the liquid alone can cause extensive damage.|$|E

The Vilno Social Democratic <b>Bund</b> distrusted the Polish <b>Bund</b> for its overtures to the Comintern, stating that the Polish <b>Bund</b> had ceased to be a Social Democratic organization.|$|R

In February 1919 these groups (representing the majority in the <b>Bund</b> in Ukraine) adopted the name Communist <b>Bund</b> (Kombund), re-constituting themselves as an independent party. Moisei Rafes, who had been a leading figure of the <b>Bund</b> in Ukraine, became the leader of the Ukrainian Kombund.

50|$|Since most liquids can spill, evaporate, or seep through {{even the}} {{smallest}} opening, special consideration must be made for their safe and secure handling. This usually involves building a <b>bunding,</b> or containment dike, around the tank, so that any leakage may be safely contained.|$|E
50|$|Concrete {{works very}} well for many liquids, but it is {{unsuitable}} for some applications like containing strong acids. Using earth berms for <b>bunding</b> is not recommended for most situations, though liners {{can be used to}} decrease permeability. Smaller tanks often use containers made of steel or plastic. The material used depends on cost, the chemical properties of the liquid and its density. Plastic tanks cannot hold very dense liquids at high wall levels. Large, exposed <b>bunding</b> will need a sump pump or some other system to remove precipitation, though it may also be used to transfer spilled liquid into another container. Rainwater must be treated if the liquid being stored is toxic because there may be small amounts of it surrounding the tank.|$|E
