5|$|A {{prophylactic}} method introduced {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge <b>barriers</b> (flood <b>barriers).</b> They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge <b>barriers</b> are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which {{are part of the}} Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. <b>Barriers</b> are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and <b>barriers.</b> However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E

5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, <b>barriers,</b> or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. <b>Barriers</b> are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or <b>barriers</b> of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E

40|$|<b>Barrier</b> {{synchronization}} is {{a common}} operation in parallel and distributed systems. A fast implementation {{is important because it}} allows fine grained parallel programs to be more efficient. It is therefore important to minimize the latency of <b>barrier</b> operations. Modern network interface cards (NICs) have programmable processors which can be used to support collective communications such as <b>barrier.</b> In BPS 2001 we have designed and implemented a NIC-based <b>barrier</b> feature over GM. This new NIC-based <b>barrier</b> operation raises many open questions which must be answered. Does the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> perform better than the host-based <b>barrier?</b> How does the performance of the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> change with better NICs? Is the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> scalable? How does the performance of the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> affect the granularity of computation? How does the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> affect the performance of applications? In this paper, we take on these challenges. We find that the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> performs better than the host-based <b>barrier</b> with up to a 2. 22 factor of improvement on an eight node system at the MPI-level. We also find that the factor of improvement values increase with the number of nodes indicating that the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> is more scalable. We find that the NIC-based <b>barrier</b> also allows for finer grained computation without affecting the efficiency of the program. Finally, by using synthetic applications on an eight node system, we find up to a 1. 93 factor of improvement in the applications using a NIC-based <b>barrier</b> versus using a host-based <b>barrier.</b> These results indicate that NIC-based <b>barrier</b> in current and future clusters can deliver significant performance benefits to the applications...|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical <b>barriers</b> were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these <b>barriers</b> was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of wave overtopping and wave force by a porous wave <b>barrier</b> was investigated to clarify hydraulic performance {{of such a}} coastal structure. Two-dimensional model tests for a wave <b>barrier</b> mounted on a seawall were carried out to examine variations in regime of wave overtopping, mean overtopping rate and maximum wave force acting on the <b>barrier</b> with changing <b>barrier</b> parameter and incident wave intensity. The test {{results show that the}} porous wave <b>barrier</b> can reduce the overtopping rate and wave force in different overtopping regimes effectively. These reduction effects of the <b>barrier</b> are mainly governed by the porosity of <b>barrier</b> and several wave parameters. Their reduction ratios between the presence and absence of the <b>barrier</b> are influenced by variations in the wave run-up height induced by <b>barrier</b> installation...|$|R

5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound <b>barriers</b> at three points along the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive <b>barriers,</b> abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds.

5|$|Several <b>barriers</b> protect organisms from infection, {{including}} mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} <b>barriers.</b> The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical <b>barriers</b> that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the failure}} {{mechanisms}} for fire <b>barrier</b> materials is the stress-induced separation/splitting of <b>barrier</b> that results in exposing the cushioning materials of the soft furnishing to high temperatures and flames. When exposed to heat and/or flames, the <b>barrier</b> material undergoes chemical and/or physical changes (e.g., dissipation of heat, release of FR, and formation of a protective char), and that may cause the <b>barrier</b> to shrink, become stiff and/or brittle, and/or become thinner. The unexposed/unshrunken fire <b>barrier</b> exerts a force on the shrinking char, causing the <b>barrier</b> material to split open. The extent of the physical deformation {{is affected by the}} type of <b>barrier</b> material used. For example, a knitted <b>barrier</b> fabric will split open {{to a greater extent than}} a woven or nonwoven <b>barrier</b> fabric (Ohlemiller & Shields [1995]). The force that the unexposed <b>barrier</b> exerts on thermally degraded <b>barrier</b> material is dependent on the length and pre-tensioning of the <b>barrier,</b> as well as the “anchoring” forces on the <b>barrier</b> in the specific application. For example, the force seen by an area of <b>barrier</b> material on the top of the mattress may be lower than on the side as a result of the absolute amount of shrinkage caused by the greater length of the spring (unexposed fabric) on the top versus the side. The mattress application of <b>barrier</b> material is complicated by the fact that the material may be sewn tightly to other layers (ticking and back scrim) whose mechanical properties also affect, and potentially dominate, the amount of pulling stress on the <b>barrier</b> material. In addition, the edge conditions, and in particular the extent to which they inhibit shrinkage-induced movement, vary considerably with mattress design.|$|R
50|$|Many entrances {{and exits}} have tolls. In general, exits have tolls when they precede a <b>barrier</b> toll, and exits are free when they follow a <b>barrier</b> toll. Conversely, entrances that precede a <b>barrier</b> toll are free; and tolls are paid at entrances just beyond a <b>barrier</b> toll. This avoids double tolling (e.g., paying a <b>barrier</b> toll and then {{immediately}} paying again to exit) and under-tolling (e.g., driving {{a long distance}} and then exiting for free just before a <b>barrier</b> toll).|$|R
