The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate and report role perceptions of school <b>board</b> <b>member</b> duties <b>and</b> obligations as seen by <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents. A further {{purpose of the study was}} to identify task-related areas of disagreement regarding role responsibilities generally perceived by each respective response group. A questionnaire was designed to solicit responses from school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents regarding perceived initial <b>board</b> <b>member</b> involvement with twenty-one educational tasks. Each task was arranged into a five step horizontal continuum, ranging from executive duties to legislative duties. Respondents were selected from a random sampling of Indiana school corporations which had been stratified according to student enrollment into three equal groups. Major findings derived from the analysis of data were: 1. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents demonstrated significant differences in perceptions regarding <b>board</b> <b>member</b> initial involvement with respect to ten of the twenty-one educational tasks. 2. In ten of the remaining eleven tasks, <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents demonstrated intragroup disagreement. 3. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents of different sized school corporations demonstrated intergroup disagreements. Major conclusions based on findings of the study were: 1. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> fail to differentiate between the policy-making role of the school board and the administrative role of the superintendent. 2. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents are not consistent with respect to perceptions of initial <b>board</b> <b>member</b> involvement. 3. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents in different sized school corporations disagree concerning perceptions of initial <b>board</b> <b>member</b> assumption of responsibilities. Major recommendations based upon the findings and conclusions of the study were: 1. School <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents need to cooperatively plan orientation andtraining sessions in order to understand the processes of policy planning, policy development, and policy evaluation. 2. Research should be conducted to determine the effects of written policies and procedures upon the role perceptions of superintendents <b>and</b> <b>board</b> <b>members</b> regarding the duties <b>and</b> obligations of <b>board</b> <b>members.</b> 3. The study should be replicated with an enlarged sample to further validate the findings that were influenced by size of school corporation. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION OF PATRICK L. RICE for the Doctor of Philosophy {{degree in}} Educational Administration, {{presented}} on February 24, 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF SCHOOL BOARD TRAINING AND EVALUATION AS PERCEIVED BY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AND SUPERINTENDENTS MAJOR PROFESSOR: DR. KATHY HYTTEN 	The majority of school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents agree that school board training and evaluation {{is needed to}} increase school board effectiveness. Although, most <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents agree, {{there is not a}} consensus regarding the form and scope of board training and evaluation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a better understanding of the perceptions of school board superintendents <b>and</b> school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> regarding school <b>board</b> training and evaluation. 	Interviews were conducted from <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents of two similar sized K- 8 school districts located in Southern Illinois. Two focus groups were conducted, once composed of school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> the other of superintendents from various school districts in Southern Illinois. <b>Board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents agreed that training and evaluation are important components to the success of school boards. Specifically, many <b>board</b> <b>members</b> [...] especially newly elected members [...] fail to properly understand their roles and duties, which often lead to role confusion, challenging board/superintendent collaboration issues, and an increased number of <b>board</b> <b>members</b> with personal agendas. Although training and evaluation were seen as important, there was not a clear consensus regarding the form <b>and</b> scope of <b>board</b> <b>member</b> training <b>and</b> evaluation. <b>Board</b> <b>members</b> were especially concerned about issues related to local control, time commitment, and training expenses, as well as how trainings will be conducted...|$|R

40|$|Editorial <b>board</b> <b>members,</b> who are {{considered}} the gatekeepers of scientific journals, {{play an important role}} in academia, and may directly or indirectly affect the scientific output of a university. In this article, we used the quantile regression method among a sample of 1, 387 university in chemistry to characterize the correlation between the number of editorial <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> the scientific output of their universities. Furthermore, we used time-series data and the Granger causality test to explore the causal relationship between the number of editorial <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> the number of articles of some top universities. Our results suggest that the number of editorial <b>board</b> <b>members</b> is positively <b>and</b> significantly related to the scientific output (as measured by the number of articles, total number of citations, citations per paper, and h index) of their universities. However, the Granger causality test results suggest that the causal relationship between the number of editorial <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> the number of articles of some top universities is not obvious. Combining these findings with the results of qualitative interviews with editorial <b>board</b> <b>members,</b> we discuss the causal relationship between the number of editorial <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> the scientific output of their universities. Comment: This paper is revised and extended based on the paper entitled "Which Drives Which?

The {{purpose of this study}} was threefold: (1) to identify the prevalence of each decision-making style among <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents; (2) to find whether there were differences between <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents in their decision-making styles; and (3) to find whether the decision-making styles of <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> superintendents differed according to the enrollment size of the school district. ^ Data were obtained through a survey mailed to randomly selected Nebraska school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> school superintendents from Class II, III, and VI school districts. The survey was a modification of Slezak 2 ̆ 7 s (1984) series of decision techniques that are used to determine decision-making styles when differences of opinion exist. The five decision-making styles [...] avoiding, sharing, collaborating, accommodating, and competing [...] were assessed by a set of items in which the respondents were asked to rate their agreement on a Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
