50|$|Barium oxalate (BaC2O4), a <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of oxalic acid, {{is a white}} odorless powder that is {{sometimes}} used as a green pyrotechnic colorant generally in specialized pyrotechnic compositions containing magnesium.|$|R
50|$|Barium sulfite is the <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of sulfurous acid {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula BaSO3. It {{is a white}} powder which is used in paper manufacturing. Like other barium compounds, it is toxic.|$|R
25|$|Barium chloride, {{along with}} other {{water-soluble}} <b>barium</b> <b>salts,</b> is highly toxic. Sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate are potential antidotes because they form the insoluble solid barium sulfate BaSO4, which is relatively non-toxic because of its insolubility.|$|E
25|$|Barium {{chloride}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula BaCl2. It {{is one of}} the most common water-soluble salts of barium. Like other <b>barium</b> <b>salts,</b> it is toxic and imparts a yellow-green coloration to a flame. It is also hygroscopic.|$|E
25|$|Radium forms {{much the}} same {{insoluble}} salts as its lighter congener barium: it forms the insoluble sulfate (RaSO4, the most insoluble known sulfate), chromate (RaCrO4), carbonate (RaCO3), iodate (Ra(IO3)2), tetrafluoroberyllate (RaBeF4), and nitrate (Ra(NO3)2). With {{the exception of the}} carbonate, all of these are less soluble in water than the corresponding <b>barium</b> <b>salts,</b> but they are all isostructural to their barium counterparts. Additionally, radium phosphate, oxalate, and sulfite are probably also insoluble, as they coprecipitate with the corresponding insoluble <b>barium</b> <b>salts.</b> The great insolubility of radium sulfate (at 20°C, only 2.1mg will dissolve in 1kg of water) means that {{it is one of the}} less biologically dangerous radium compounds. The large ionic radius of Ra2+ (148pm) results in weak complexation and poor extraction of radium from aqueous solutions when not at high pH.|$|E
50|$|An early {{preparation}} method starts from the <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), {{from which the}} free TfOH is formed with dilute sulfuric acid, which is then neutralized with silver carbonate (Ag2CO3).|$|R
50|$|The <b>barium</b> <b>salt,</b> as its hexahydrate, is {{very soluble}} in water (a {{distinction}} between phthalic and terephthalic acids). Uvitic acid, 5-methylisophthalic acid, is obtained by oxidizing mesitylene or by condensing pyroracemic acid with baryta water.|$|R
5000|$|The salt is isostructural with K2MnO4, K2SO4, and K2CrO4. The solid {{consists}} of K+ and the tetrahedral FeO42− anion, with Fe-O distances of 1.66 Å. [...] The poorly soluble <b>barium</b> <b>salt,</b> BaFeO4, is also known.|$|R
25|$|As an inexpensive, {{soluble salt}} of barium, barium {{chloride}} finds wide application in the laboratory. It {{is commonly used}} as a test for sulfate ion (see chemical properties above). In industry, barium chloride is mainly used in the purification of brine solution in caustic chlorine plants {{and also in the}} manufacture of heat treatment salts, case hardening of steel, in the manufacture of pigments, and in the manufacture of other <b>barium</b> <b>salts.</b> BaCl2 is also used in fireworks to give a bright green color. However, its toxicity limits its applicability.|$|E
500|$|To create green sparks, {{fireworks}} use <b>barium</b> <b>salts,</b> such as barium chlorate, {{barium nitrate}} crystals, or barium chloride, {{also used for}} green fireplace logs. Copper salts typically burn blue, but cupric chloride (also known as [...] "campfire blue") can also produce green flames. Green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate. Smoke can be turned green by a mixture: solvent yellow 33, solvent green 3, lactose, magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate.|$|E
500|$|Carl Scheele {{determined}} that barite contained a new element in 1774, {{but could not}} isolate barium, only barium oxide. Johan Gottlieb Gahn also isolated barium oxide two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called [...] "barote" [...] by Guyton de Morveau, a name that was changed by Antoine Lavoisier to baryta. Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist William Withering noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of Cumberland, now known to be witherite. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten <b>barium</b> <b>salts</b> in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy in England. Davy, by analogy with calcium, named [...] "barium" [...] after baryta, with the [...] "-ium" [...] ending signifying a metallic element. Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride.|$|E

50|$|Barium chlorate, Ba(ClO3)2, {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} solid, the <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of chloric acid. It is an irritant and toxic, as are all soluble barium compounds. It {{is sometimes}} used in pyrotechnics to produce a green color. It also finds use {{in the production of}} chloric acid.|$|R
5000|$|The {{catalytic}} epoxidation of olefins {{by using}} modified silver polyoxometalate catalyst (Ag/Ag-POM) and gold catalyst {{supported on the}} <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of the POM (2% Au/BaPOM) {{is very important in}} the chemical industry since epoxides are versatile and important intermediates in the synthesis of many fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the boiled liver extract on the {{velocity}} of 4 -methyl umbelliferone lucuronide formation by mouse liver homogenate was studied. The results were as follows: 1. Addition of mouse or rat liver boiled extract to the complete system for the glucuronide formation produced {{an increase in the}} velocity of the glucuronide formation. 2. The boiled liver extract produced the increase in the velocity of the glucuronide formation not as a substrate but as an activator. 3, The activator in the boiled liver extract was relatively heat stable, acid labile, and precipitated as a fairly ethanol-soluble <b>barium</b> <b>salt.</b> The solution of the activator partially purified by ethanol fractionation of the <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> indicated its absorption maximum at 262 m&# 956;. These results suggested that the most possible substance in the boiled liver extract responsible for the activation of 4 methyl umbelliferone glucuronide formation might be a sugar nucleotide. </p...|$|R
50|$|Blanc's Rule {{says that}} heating a <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of a dicarboxylic acid, or {{dehydrating}} it with acetic anhydride will yield a cyclic acid anhydride if the carbon atoms bearing acid groups are in position 1 and (3,4 or 5). So succinic acid will yield succinic anhydride. For acids with carboxylic groups at position 1 and 6 this dehydration causes loss {{of carbon dioxide}} and water to form a cyclic ketone, for example adipic acid will form cyclopentanone.|$|R
50|$|The dry {{synthetic}} {{method is}} usually performed using a thermal technique. Primary experiments indicate {{an improvement in}} {{the purity of the}} synthesized barium ferrate by performing the reaction at low temperature in the absence of carbon dioxide and by rapidly filtering and drying the precipitate. Addition of a soluble sodium <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> to an alkali metal ferrate solution produces a maroon precipitate of barium ferrate, a crystal which has the same structure as barium chromate and has approximately the same solubility.|$|R

40|$|Spectrophotometric {{study shows}} that less than 35 per cent of normal {{perrhenate}} converts to a meso form in 15 M base, and Kf ~ 0 [middle dot] 1. The species absrobs at 260 m[mu] ([epsilon] = 6, 400) and near 310 m[mu] ([epsilon] ~ 1, 400), overlapping the normal perrhenate features. Reflectance spectra on an isolable <b>barium</b> <b>salt,</b> Ba 3 (ReO 5) 2, confirm this resolution of the curve components. The variation of the <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> solubility with concentration of aqueous hydroxide ion {{is consistent with the}} equilibrium deduced from spectrophotometry. Hydration is found for this salt and does not require the postulation of a dimeric form (to maintain 6 -coordination); nor does this postulate seem to fit the equilibrium data or the i. r. absorption. No detectable amount of a comparable mesopertechnetate species is found in aqueous media of any alkalinity. However, pertechnetate fused in sodium hydroxide does give new absorption at 345, 420 and (~ 570) m[mu] (of relative [epsilon] ca. 8 / 4 / 1), which is probably due to meso (or, ortho) species. Attempts to isolate a (VI) salt, BaTcO 4, from hydrazine-reduced (VII) in alkaline aqueous media, result in mixtures. Disproportionation of the intermediate state forms TcO 2, and incidental BaCO 3 gives "products" of high Tc/Ba ratio. The red intermediate {{is more likely to be}} a Tc(V) species...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{procedure}} which yields pure xylitol- 5 -phosphate is described. A cell extract of Lactobacillus casei Cl- 16 from a 6 -liter {{culture was}} used to synthesize up to 70 mg of xylitol- 5 -phosphate overnight from xylitol and phosphoenolpyruvate via a xylitol phosphoenolpyruvate:phosphotransferase system with a 53 % yield. Centrifugation, filtration, precipitation as a <b>barium</b> <b>salt,</b> and ion-exchange batch chromatography permitted recovery of nearly 90 % of the phosphorylated product synthesized. Thin-layer chromatography and enzymatic analysis indicated a purity level of more than 99 %.

50|$|Barium chloride, {{along with}} other {{water-soluble}} <b>barium</b> <b>salts,</b> is highly toxic. Sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate are potential antidotes because they form the insoluble solid barium sulfate BaSO4, which is relatively non-toxic because of its insolubility.|$|E
40|$|Xanthomegnin {{is one of}} the {{pigments}} {{that were}} isolated from the mycelium Trichophyton megnini. It is a binaphthoquinone consisting of two identical moieties joined at the 3 -position (I). Analytical data and spectral studies established the formula as (C 15 H 11 O 6) 2. The monomeric unit has one methoxyl, one hydrogen bonded phenolic hydroxyl, a CH 3 -CH(-O-) -CH 2 -Ar group, and one aromatic proton. Reduction gave a hydrogen-bonded quinol, as evidenced by the lowering of the absorption band of the carbonyl from 1716 cm- 1 to 1658 cm- 1. This carboxyl is part of a lactone group, since the <b>barium</b> <b>salt</b> of the pigment exhibited bands typical of a carboxylate anion...|$|R
50|$|In some accounts, the {{chemicals}} {{are described as}} <b>barium</b> and aluminum <b>salts,</b> polymer fibers, thorium, or silicon carbide.|$|R
5|$|Silver(II) {{complexes}} {{are more}} common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, {{they are usually}} square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag2+, produced by oxidation of Ag+ by ozone, {{is a very strong}} oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in phosphoric acid due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as 2+ and 2+: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. 2− is also known in its violet <b>barium</b> <b>salt,</b> as are some silver(II) complexes with N- or O-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.|$|R
