25|$|Delaware and Missouri use {{a lethal}} {{injection}} machine designed by Massachusetts-based Fred A. Leuchter {{consisting of two}} components: the delivery module and the control module. Two staff members each have a station in which they key on the machine and depress two stations' buttons to be ready in case of mechanical failure. Each person presses one station button on the console which travels to a computer which starts all three injections electronically. The computer then deletes who actually started the syringes, so the participants are not aware if their syringe contained saline {{or one of the}} drugs necessary for execution (to assuage guilt {{in a manner similar to}} the blank cartridge in execution by firing squad). The delivery module has eight syringes. The end syringes (i.e., syringes 7 and 8) containing saline, syringes 2, 4 and 6 containing the lethal drugs for the main line and syringes 1, 3 and 5 containing the injections for the <b>back-up</b> <b>line.</b> The system was used in New Jersey before the abolition of the death penalty in 2007. Illinois previously used the computer, and Missouri and Delaware use the manual injection switch on the delivery panel.|$|E
50|$|The station, {{originally}} named Pans Lane Bridge Halt, {{opened on}} 4 March 1929 {{for the residents}} of south Devizes, but more importantly for the nearby Roundway Hospital, {{during a time when}} the Great Western Railway was increasing the number of halts in the South West. The station name was simplified to Pans Lane Halt later in 1929. After completion of the eastern section of track, the Devizes line was a main line from London to Bristol. However, the line lost out to competition and reverted to branch line status, although it was used as a <b>back-up</b> <b>line</b> to the west country in case of emergency.|$|E
50|$|The {{intravenous}} tubing {{leads to}} a room next to the execution chamber, usually separated from the condemned by a curtain or wall. Typically, a prison employee trained in venipuncture inserts the needle, while a second prison employee orders, prepares, and loads the drugs into the lethal injection syringes. Two other staff members take {{each of the three}} syringes and secure them into the IVs. After the curtain is opened to allow the witnesses to see inside the chamber, the condemned person is then permitted to make a final statement. Following this, the warden signals that the execution may commence, and the executioner(s) (either prison staff or private citizens depending on the jurisdiction) then manually inject the three drugs in sequence. During the execution, the condemned's cardiac rhythm is monitored. Death is pronounced after cardiac activity stops. Death usually occurs within seven minutes, although the whole procedure can take up to two hours, {{as was the case with}} the execution of Christopher Newton on May 24, 2007. According to state law, if a physician's participation in the execution is prohibited for reasons of medical ethics, then the death ruling can be made by the state medical examiner's office. After confirmation that death has occurred, a coroner signs the condemned's death certificate.Delaware and Missouri use a lethal injection machine designed by Massachusetts-based Fred A.

50|$|A {{switching}} station is a substation without transformers and operating {{only at a}} single voltage level. Switching stations are sometimes used as collector and distribution stations. Sometimes they are used for switching the current to <b>back-up</b> <b>lines</b> or for parallelizing circuits in case of failure. An example is the {{switching station}}s for the HVDC Inga-Shaba transmission line.|$|R

40|$|Stability in {{financial}} institutions and {{in financial}} markets are closely intertwined. Banks and other financial institutions need liquid markets through which to conduct risk management. And markets need the <b>back-up</b> liquidity <b>lines</b> provided by financial institutions. Market liquidity depends not only on objective, exogenous factors, but also on endogenous market dynamics. Central banks responsible for systemic stability need to consider how far their traditional responsibility {{for the health of}} the banking system needs to be adapted to promote stability in the relevant financial markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Starting with 2002 the National Institute for Earth Physics (NIEP) has {{developed}} its real-time digital seismic network. This network consists of 39 broad band and short period stations and two seismic arrays. SeedLink and AntelopeTM program packages {{are used for}} real-time (RT) data acquisition and exchange. The present network {{is going to be}} expanded in the near future. Thus, in 2008 NIEP will install 40 additional broad band stations in Romanian territory and 40 strong motions stations in Bucharest, so {{that at the end of}} the year NIEP will have 119 digital broad-band seismic stations and short period in real time. The communication from digital seismic stations to the National Data Center in Bucharest is achieved by 5 providers (GPRS, VPN, satellite communication, radio lease line and internet), which assure the <b>back-up</b> communication <b>lines.</b> The power energy for all the seismic stations and the communication systems is supplied by batteries which offer 24 hours of autonomy. The processing centre runs BRTT’s AntelopeTM 4. 9 data acquisition and processing software on two workstations for real-time processing and post processing. The Antelope Real-Time System is also providing automatic event detection, arrival picking, event location and magnitude calculation. It provides graphical display and reporting within near-real-time after a local or regional event occurred. The Romanian Seismic Network is permanently exchanging real–time waveform data with IRIS, ORFEUS and different European countries through internet. In Romania, the magnitude and location of an earthquake are now available within a few minutes after the earthquake occurred. One of the greatest challenges in the near future is to provide shaking intensity maps and other ground motion parameters, within 5 minutes post-event, on the Internet and GIS-based format in order to improve emergency response, public information, preparedness and hazard mitigation. Key words: automatic event detection, real-time processing, seismic monitoring,seismic stations, sensor. 1...|$|R
