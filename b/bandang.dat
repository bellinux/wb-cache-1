The two Karaengs established alliances with and sent envoys to {{states and cities}} across the archipelago, including Johor, Malacca, Pahang, Patani, Banjarmasin, Mataram, Balambangan, and Maluku. Trade thrived as Makassar was more fully integrated into the Muslim commercial routes that Christian Pelras (1985) {{refers to as the}} [...] "Champa-Patani-Aceh-Minangkabau-Banjarmasin-Demak-Giri-Ternate network" [...] and Tunijalloq had the Katangka Mosque built for the burgeoning Malay community of Makassar. The influence of Islam on Gowa and Talloq grew stronger, although Muslim missionaries such as Dato ri <b>Bandang</b> still had little success; the veneration of the divine origins of nobility and the influential role of the bissu priesthood remained powerful obstacles for Islamization. In 1580 Sultan Babullah of the Malukan sultanate of Ternate offered an alliance on the condition that Tunijalloq convert to Islam, but this was rejected perhaps in order to prevent Ternaten religious influence over South Sulawesi. Four Franciscans were also sent to Gowa in the 1580s, but their mission, too, was short-lived. Nevertheless, foreign religions came to exert growing influence over the Gowa nobility in these years, culminating in the conversion of the kingdom to Islam in the 1600s decade. Other internal reforms under Tunijalloq included the expansion of court writing, the introduction of kris-making, and military strengthening such as the deployment of more cannons in forts.|$|E

It aimed at a discussion on ways in which Papuans could have [...] "an opportunity to handle their own affairs" [...] whether through full independence, through wide-ranging autonomy within the Indonesian unitary state, or through the formation of a federal system in which the province of Irian Jaya (now the provinces of Papua and West-Papua) would enjoy substantial autonomy. FORERI helped to set up the national dialogue in Papua, initiated by President B. J. Habibie. This resulted in 100 Papuans, representing the various districts, unanimously demanding independence from Habibie in February 1999. Benny Giay was elected by the Second Papua Congress in Jayapura in June 2000 {{to be a member of}} the Presidium of the Papua Council (Presidium Dewan Papua or PDP).

5000|$|The {{kingdom of}} Makassar {{conducted}} {{a series of}} military campaigns in all directions in the early 17th century, partly with the aim to spread Islam in the archipelago. Sumbawa was attacked through three expeditions in 1618, 1619, and 1626. According to Bimanese tradition written down in the Bo (an old record of historical events in the Bima Palace), king number XVI (in another count XXI), Mantau Asi Sawo, signed a contract of alliance with Makassar. When he died, power was usurped by the prince Salisi who killed Sawo's son and heir during a hunting party. Sawo's younger son La Kai fled to Teke in the east and allied with the Makassarese. He accepted Islam on 15 Rabiulawal 1030 AH (7 February 1621) and was instructed in the faith by the renowned missionary Dato' ri <b>Bandang.</b> Salisi successfully resisted the Makassarese forces for a while, but was eventually defeated by a fleet from Sulawesi led by the Bimanese grandee La Mbila. La Kai was installed as king number XXVII, with the title [...] "Ta Ma Bata Wadu Ruma".

It was valid until the reign of Sultan Bima XIII (Sultan Ibrahim, 1881-1915). Sultan Abu'l-Khair Sirajuddin was born in April 1627 (Ramadan 1038 H) and bore the title Uma Teak Ruma. He was also named La Mbila, and the Makassarese called him [...] "I Ambela". He died on July 22, 1682 (17 Rajab 1099 AH), and was buried in Tolobali. He married the sister of Sultan Hasanuddin of Makassar, whose name was Karaeng Bonto Je'ne, on 13 September 1646 (22 Rajab 1066 AH), the wedding taking place in Makassar. Abu'l-Khair Sirajuddin was crowned Sultan Bima II in 1640 (1050 H).Abubakar Sultan Nuruddin Ali Syah was the son of Sultan Abu'l-Khair Sirajuddin. He was born on December 5, 1651 (29 Dhul-Hijjah 1061 AH). The Makassarese gave him the title [...] "bung Mappara Din Daeng Matali Karaeng Panaragang".

Therefore, it is required to conduct mitigation efforts in order to anticipate similar disaster in the future. One of the mitigation efforts is modeling simulation of the past event. The understanding which is obtained from the simulation can be used as reference to arrange other mitigation efforts plan and action. Modeling simulation of the January 2006 flood was conducted by involving 1 -D model of HEC-RAS version 4. 1. 0 software. Flood hydrograph was obtained by analyzing related hydrologic aspects using Nakayasu method. The natural dam model was interpreted from field observation and related references. Some assumptions related to study constraints were taken. Model calibration was conducted by repeating simulation using fixed discharge and parameter values in a certain range. The observations were carried out to the maximum water surface elevation and it was traced to the downstream river. Calibration model result showed that the height of natural dam significantly influence changes of water surface elevation at control point.
