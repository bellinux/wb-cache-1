50|$|An antenna {{amplifier}} boosts a {{radio signal}} considerably for devices that receive radio waves. Many devices have an RF amplifier stage in their circuitry, that amplifies the antenna signal, these include, {{but are not}} limited to; radios, televisions, mobile phones and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices. Amplifiers amplify everything, both the desired signal present at the antenna, and the noise. Typical signal noises include: ambient background noise (electric <b>brush</b> <b>noise</b> from electric motors, high voltage sources from, for example a gasoline engine ignition, or large dispersed currents {{in the vicinity of the}} desired reception electric fence). To add, consideration must be taken for the noise generated by the amplifier itself and all other electrical noise which may be generated by the device that is to receive a signal, for example a lot of consideration has to go into mobile phone circuitry design to eliminate as much noise from its own circuitry in order to not disturb the desired transmission signals from its own antenna(ae).|$|E
40|$|Tachometer circuit {{operates}} {{in conjunction with}} brushless shaft-angle resolver. By performing sequence of straightforward mathematical operations on resolver signals and utilizing simple trigonometric identity, generates voltage proportional to rate of rotation of shaft. One advantage is use of brushless shaft-angle resolver as main source of rate signal: no brushes to wear out, no <b>brush</b> <b>noise,</b> and brushless resolvers have proven robustness. No switching of signals to generate noise. Another advantage, shaft-angle resolver used as shaft-angle sensor, tachometer input obtained without adding another sensor. Present circuit reduces overall size, weight, and cost of tachometer...|$|E

They increased the precision of the shaft and improved the commutator and <b>brush,</b> reducing <b>noise</b> and power consumption to 10% of the original F-type motor and axis deviation to less than 10 microns, and extending lifespan by 50-100 times to 1,000-2,000 hours.

40|$|In our {{previous}} study, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) {{was found in}} rat’s anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) following the stimulation of the medial thalamus (MT). The present study examines the effect of various peripheral stimulations on the PPF in both consciously awake and anaesthetized rats. During the chronic test, effects of different peripheral stimulations on PPF were measured in consciously awaken, and freely moving rats. During acute test, effects of sciatic nerve electrical stimulation on the PPF was investigated in anesthetized (Pentothal, 6. 25 mg/ 100 g) rats. The {{results showed that the}} PPF measured in the ACC was affected by the applications all types of peripheral stimulations. With the applications of <b>noise,</b> <b>brushing</b> and pinching stimuli, this PPF had been decreased to 58. 04 ± 11. 96 %, 58. 22 ± 8. 21 % and 51. 15 ± 6. 63 % respectively while compared to the control rats. In the formalin injection test, the PPF decreased to 79. 66 ± 4. 99 % in phase 1 (after 1 - 5 mines) and 81. 40 ± 8. 21 % in phase 2 (after 18 - 30 mins). In the laser stimulation test, the PPF was decreased to 64. 66 ± 14. 72 % when the laser stimulation preceded paired-pulse stimulation with 100 - 200 ms and 60. 05 ± 14. 83 % when the delay was 350 - 500 ms. In the state of fear conditioning and non-movement, PPF increased to 112. 52 ± 3. 14 % and 123. 5...|$|R
40|$|RESUMO: A doenÃ§a vibroacÃºstica Ã© uma patologia sistÃ©mica, caracterizada pela proliferaÃ§Ã£o anormal das matrizes extra-celulares e causada pela exposiÃ§Ã£o crÃ³nica a ruÃ­do de baixa frequÃªncia (RBF) (â¤ 500 Â Hz, incluindo os infra-sons). Neste contexto, nos estudos conduzidos em ratos Wistar expostos a RBF, na tentativa de reproduzir a patologia observada em trabalhadores expostos a esta noxa, observaram-se aspectos nÃ£o descritos. Urge assim esclarecer os aspectos normais em populaÃ§Ãµes de ratos Wistar nÃ£o expostos. Dez ratos Wistar, tratados de acordo com a norma 86 / 609 / CE, foram mantidos em silÃªncio atÃ© Ã  idade de 3, 5 meses e entÃ£o sacrificados tendo sido colhidos fragmentos de traqueia e brÃ´nquios para microscopia Ã³ptica e electrÃ³nica de varrimento (MEV) e de transmissÃ£o (MET). As cÃ©lulas em escova (CE) que se observam frequentemente em MET sÃ£o menos visÃ­veis em MEV, devido aos cÃ­lios das cÃ©lulas vizinhas. SÃ£o frequentes as estruturas em roseta, constituÃ­das por um anel de cÃ©lulas secretoras centradas numa CE. Em MET observam-se corpos multivesiculares dentro das CE. Observam-se, tanto em MEV como em MET, numerosas vesÃ­culas emanando da membrana plasmÃ¡tica dos cÃ­lios e das microvilosidades das CE. Estes dados podem contribuir para a compreensÃ£o da funÃ§Ã£o das CE. REV PORT PNEUMOL 2003; IX (5) : 381 - 388 ABSTRACT: Morphofunctional {{changes of}} {{respiratory}} epithelia became {{the object of}} intense study in Wistar rats after previous research showed that occupationally-simulated exposure to low frequency noise (â¤ 500 Â Hz, including infrasound) induced irreversible lesions in these tissues. Aspects of normal respiratory epithelia in rats are lacking in the literature, and are the object of this report. Ten Wistar rats were kept in silence, fed standard rat food, and had unrestrained access to water (treated in accordance with 86 / 609 /CE). The animals were sacrificed at 3. 5 Â months of age, and respiratory epithelial fragments were excised and prepared for scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. Brush cells (BC) were frequently observed with TEM, but with SEM they were often covered by the cilia of neighbouring cells. BC were always observed {{at the center of}} a ring of secretory cells (SC), in a rosetta-shaped formation. In TEM, the microvilli of SC surrounding the BC were uniform, and had the same density and shape in all cells. Multivesicular bodies were identified in areas within the BC. Formation and budding of vesicles from ciliary plasma membranes and from BC microvilli were frequently observed in both TEM and SEM. These data contribute to the understanding of the BC function.
