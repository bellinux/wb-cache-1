40|$|Scan {{channels}} on the Nimbus 7 Earth Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>instrument</b> sample radiances from underlying earth scenes at {{a number}} of incident and scattering angles. A sampling excess toward measurements at large satellite zenith angles is noted. Also, at large satellite zenith angles, the present scheme for scene selection causes many observations to be classified as cloud, resulting in higher flux averages. Thus the combined effect of sampling bias and scene identification errors is to overestimate the computed albedo. It is shown, using a process of successive thresholding, that observations with satellite zenith angles greater than 50 - 60 deg lead to incorrect cloud identification. Elimination of these observations has reduced the albedo from 32. 2 to 28. 8 percent. This reduction is very nearly the same and in the right direction as the discrepancy between the albedoes derived from the scanner and the wide-field-of-view channels...|$|E

We apply this approach to a test case comparing observations made by the Geostationary Earth Radiation <b>Budget</b> <b>instrument</b> to output from the Met Office Unified Model run at two resolutions. The 12 km resolution model produces peak convective activity on all lengthscales significantly earlier in the day than shown by the observations and no evidence for storms growing in size.

40|$|The main {{uncertainty}} in anthropogenic forcing of the Earth’s climate stems from pollution aerosols, particularly their ‘‘indirect effect’’ whereby aerosols modify cloud properties.

We derive a statistical relationship between planetary albedo and cloud properties, and, further, between the cloud properties and column aerosol concentration. Combining these relationships with a data set of satellite-derived anthropogenic aerosol fraction, we estimate an anthropogenic radiative forcing of �- 0. 9 ± 0. 4 Wm�- 2 for the aerosol direct effect and of �- 0. 2 ± 0. 1 Wm�- 2 for the cloud albedo effect. Because of uncertainties in both satellite data and the method, the uncertainty of this result is likely larger than the values given here which correspond only to the quantifiable error estimates. The results nevertheless indicate that current global climate models may overestimate the cloud albedo effect...|$|E

Convection is initiated preferentially over mountainous regions and the cloud then advects downstream in the ambient flow.

Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are computed for the global distribution of ASR. Six EOFs are found which have physical significance and which account for 97. 8 percent of the spatial variance of the data set. The first EOF describes the annual cycle and is primarily a latitudinal variation which is driven by the incident solar radiation. The second and fourth EOFs are semiannual cycles. EOFs 3 through 6 are strongly longitudinally dependent. EOF 3 describes the spring/fall part of the annual cycle, and EOF 4 describes the part of the semiannual cycle which is out of phase with EOF 2. EOF 5 is the response of the ASR to El Nino. The annual cycle and its harmonics account for 97. 6 percent of the variance with time. When the data set is deseasonalized, the first two EOFs of the resulting set are found to correspond closely to EOFs 5 and 6 of the data set with season included. As with outgoing longwave radiation, most of the interannual variation is found over the tropical oceans...|$|R
40|$|The interannual {{variability}} {{of the top}} of the atmosphere net radiation budget as measured from the Nimbus- 7 earth radiation <b>budget</b> <b>instruments</b> was calculated for an eight-year period 1979 - 1986. The largest fluctuations are shown to occur in three tropical areas: the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa, the eastern Pacific near South America, and the western Pacific northeast of Indonesia. The variability in the Atlantic was 20 percent greater than in the eastern Pacific and 35 percent greater than in the Indonesian area. The maximum anomalies in these two Pacific regions occurred during the El Nino year 1982 - 1983, while the maximum Atlantic anomalies, south of the Gulf of Guinea, were during 1984. An independent data set of derived cloud type and amount from the Temperature Humidity Infrared Radiometer and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer instruments shows interannual changes in multilevel convective cloud systems have a minimal effect of the net balance. However, changes in middle and low clouds drastically affect the balance, and are the most likely cause of the maximum radiation balance variability in the Gulf of Guinea region. This observed interannual variation {{of the top of}} the atmosphere net balance denotes the most variable 'cloud radiative forcing' situation observed to date...|$|R

40|$|The Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) {{scanning}} radiometer is planned as the Earth radiation <b>budget</b> <b>instrument</b> for the Earth Observation System, to be flown {{in the late}} 1990 's. In order to minimize the spatial sampling errors of the measurements, {{it is necessary to}} select design parameters for the instrument such that the resulting point spread function will minimize spatial sampling errors. These errors are described as aliasing and blurring errors. Aliasing errors are due to presence in the measurements of spatial frequencies beyond the Nyquist frequency, and blurring errors are due to attenuation of frequencies below the Nyquist frequency. The design parameters include pixel shape and dimensions, sampling rate, scan period, and time constants of the measurements. For a satellite-borne {{scanning radiometer}}, the pixel footprint grows quickly at large nadir angles. The aliasing errors thus decrease with increasing scan angle, but the blurring errors grow quickly. The best design minimizes the sum of these two errors over a range of scan angles. Results of a parameter study are presented, showing effects of data rates, pixel dimensions, spacecraft altitude, and distance from the spacecraft track...|$|E
