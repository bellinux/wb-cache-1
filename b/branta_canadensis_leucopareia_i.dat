In 1997 the birds began using a new spring staging area adjacent to Humboldt Bay in northern California.

Numbers increased in the new area from 1997, and peaked at 19, 000 individuals (50...|$|R
40|$|The current {{endangered}} species list has its administrative beginnings in 1964 when the Department of the Interior 2 ̆ 7 s Committee on Rare and Endangered Wildlife Species published a preliminary list of 62 species at risk of extinction (Goble, forthcoming). Following {{the enactment of the}} Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 (ESPA), the secretary of the interior in 1967 published the first official list of 78 2 ̆ 2 native fish and wildlife threatened with extinction 2 ̆ 2 (ESPA sec. l(c); U. S. Department of the Interior 1967; Wilcove and McMillan, this volume). By the time the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was adopted in 1973, there were 392 species on the list (Yaffee 1982). These first lists included only vertebrate species. On the thirtieth anniversary of the ESA, the number stood at 1, 260 domestic species and 558 foreign species (USFWS 2003 a), with plant and invertebrate species outnumbering vertebrates. This chapter presents a graphical summary encapsulating thirty years of species protection and restoration under the ESA. The summary reveals both gains and losses. For some species, such as the Aleutian Canada goose (<b>Branta</b> <b>canadensis</b> <b>leucopareia),</b> the process worked as it was meant to, reversing decline and restoring populations to healthy levels (USFWS 2001 a); for others, such as the dusky seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens), the process failed, and despite being listed the species continued to spiral toward eventual extinction (USFWS 1983; Walters 1992). What follows is an assessment of the state of species protection as it has evolved under the ESA. This includes the taxonomie and demographie distribution of listed species, and the number of critical habitat designations. We also examine newer legal tools for conserving habitat on private land (such as habitat conservation plans), various measures of the act 2 ̆ 7 s success, and funding levels for species protection...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1980 A {{study to}} {{determine}} the migration and wintering ground distribution, ecology, and population status of the endangered Aleutian Canada goose (<b>Branta</b> <b>canadensis</b> <b>leucopareia)</b> was conducted from October 1975 to May 1978. Field investigations extended from the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to the. Central Valley of California. Prior to and during the study, 536 Aleutian geese were banded to document movement and survival. It was determined that the geese use traditional migration and wintering areas away from Alaska, returning to virtually the same fields annually. During September, Aleutian Canada geese migrate along the Aleutian Island chain from Buldir Island near the western end to the easternmost island of Unimak and then apparently shift southeast on a transoceanic flight. The geese arrive in California in early October; some stop near Crescent City, but most birds continue to the Sacramento Valley where over 95 {{percent of the population}} uses a small agricultural area in the Butte Sink. From mid-November to early December the geese move southward via the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to the grasslands of the upper San Joaquin Valley. Most of the birds are present as a single flock near Modesto from at least late December to early February. They begin shifting southward to an area near Los Banos in mid-January, and some are present until mid-March. Aleutian geese start moving northward to the Crescent City staging grounds as early as mid-January, with most of the birds arriving during March. They peak in number there in late March and early April when nearly the entire known iv population is present. In mid-April, geese begin to leave Crescent City to the breeding grounds, and by late April or early May all have left. Although a few Aleutian Canada geese have been reported near the mouth of the Columbia River, Washington, most apparently make a transoceanic flight to the eastern Aleutians. There, they continue westward to Buldir where they have been seen as early as the first week of May. During the study, hunting and avian cholera were found to be the main sources of winter mortality. Closure on Canada goose hunting enacted in three areas of California {{at the onset of the}} study has reduced mortality from an estimated preclosure rate of 22. 5 percent annually to approximately 11. 5 percent during winters 1975 - 76 and 1976 - 77. This winter mortality may comprise the majority of the annual loss. The spring population increased 45. 6 percent, from 790 in April 1975 to 1150 in March 1977. Management needs on the migration and wintering grounds include continuation of protection of the geese through hunting closures and maintenance of suitable habitat conditions on their major use areas...|$|R

50|$|The Canada goose (<b>Branta</b> <b>canadensis)</b> {{is a large}} wild goose {{species with}} a black head and neck, white patches on the face, and a brown body. Native to arctic and {{temperate}} regions of North America, its migration occasionally reaches northern Europe.
