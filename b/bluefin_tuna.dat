5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
50|$|This {{wide range}} of {{temperature}} and depth changes poses {{a challenge to the}} respiratory and circulatory systems of the southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> Tunas swim continuously and at high speeds and, therefore, have a high demand for oxygen. The oxygen concentration in the water changes with the change in temperature, being lower at high temperatures. Tunas are, however, driven by the availability of food, not by thermal properties of water. <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tunas,</b> unlike other species of tunas, maintain a fairly constant red muscle (swimming muscle) temperature over a {{wide range of}} ambient temperatures. So, in addition to being endotherms, <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> are also thermoregulators. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.|$|R

5000|$|Southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> are thermo-conserving and can {{function}} {{over a wide}} range of temperature conditions, which allows them to dive {{from the surface of the}} water to depths of 1000 m, in only a few minutes. They forage in temperate waters of the southern hemisphere oceans, during winter in Australia, and migrate to tropical areas in the north-western Indian Ocean, from spring to autumn, for the spawning season. Their preferred temperature range is 18-20 C, with most of their time (91%) spent below 21 C. Southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> experience a wide range of ambient water temperatures, from a minimum of 2.6 C to a maximum of 30.4 C. All species of tuna are reported to spawn in water temperatures above 24 C. [...] However, 24 C is outside, or at the upper limit, of temperature tolerances for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> Large individuals have been found to withstand temperatures of less than 10 C and as low as 7 C for over 10 hours, possibly to search for prey. [...] During the day they migrate through depths between 150-600 m, but at night they stay in waters that are 50 m or less in depth.|$|R
5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E

Among the species most widely pursued are striped bass, bluefish, <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> false albacore (little tunny), bonito, tautog, flounder and fluke. The Cape Cod Bay side of the Cape, from Sandwich to Provincetown, has numerous harbors, saltwater creeks, and shoals that hold bait fish and attract the larger game fish, such as striped bass, bluefish and <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b>|$|E

40|$|Tunas show a {{wide variety}} of life history strategies, spatial {{distributions}} and migratory behaviors, yet they share a common trait of spawning only in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The warm-water tuna species generally show significant overlap between spawning and feeding grounds, and longer spawning seasons of several months to near year-round. In contrast, the cool-water <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> migrate long distances between feeding and spawning grounds, and may spawn over periods as short as 2 months. Here, we examine the spatial distributions of tuna larvae in the world’s oceans, and examine interspecific differences in the light of adult behaviors and larval ecology. We discuss the links between larval tuna and their oceanographic environments and relate these to current knowledge of larval growth, feeding and trophodynamics, with a focus on the better-studied <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> We show that larval tunas have moderate to fast growth rates and selective feeding habits, and thus appear to be adapted for survival in warm, oligotrophic seas.

25|$|Off Japan, the {{collision}} of the Oyashio Current with the Kuroshio Current produces nutrient-rich upwellings. Cyclic changes in these currents resulted in {{a decline in the}} sardine sardinops melanosticta populations. Fisheries catches fell from 5 million tonnes in 1988 to 280 thousand tonnes in 1998. As a further consequence, Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> stopped moving into the region to feed.|$|E
25|$|In a 2001 study, the {{movements}} of Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from an area off North Carolina were studied {{with the help of}} special popup tags. When attached to a tuna, these tags monitored {{the movements}} of the tuna for about a year, then freed themselves, and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite. The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns. One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year. Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic, but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning. A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again. The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning. The study indicates that, while there is some differentiation by spawning areas, there is essentially only one population of Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} failure of fisheries management {{in recent times}} has perhaps been the events {{that lead to the}} collapse of the northern cod fisheries. More recently, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists produced a series of journalistic investigations called Looting the seas. These detail investigations into the black market for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> the subsidies propping up the Spanish fishing industry, and the overfishing of the Chilean jack mackerel.|$|E
25|$|The highly {{migratory species}} include: tuna and tuna-like species (albacore, Atlantic <b>bluefin,</b> bigeye <b>tuna,</b> skipjack, yellowfin, blackfin, little tunny, Pacific bluefin, {{southern}} bluefin and bullet), pomfret, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, saury and oceangoing sharks, dolphins and other cetaceans.|$|R
50|$|Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> reach {{maturity}} {{at about}} 5 years of age, the generation length {{is estimated at}} 7-9 years and based on two separate sources the longevity is 15 year or 26 years. At maturity it is about 1.5 m long and weighs about 60 kg. Individuals that are 2 m long are regularly seen, and the maximum reported is 3 m in length and 450 kg in weight. Elsewhere, a mass of up to 550 kg has been reported for the species. According to the International Game Fish Association, the all-tackle game fish record was a 411.6 kg individual (Donna Pascoe) caught on 19 February 2014 onboard charter boat Gladiator during the National Tournament.|$|R
40|$|The {{tremendous}} evolutionary {{success of}} fishes {{has resulted in}} an extreme diversity of form and design.

Specifically, elevated core temperatures have been demonstrated in 13 species of scombrid fishes of the tribe Thunnini, such as yellowfin and <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> (Carey, 1973; Graham, 1975; Graham and Dickson, 2000) as well as some sharks within the families Lamnidae (e. g. makos) and Alopidae (e. g. threshers) (Carey and Teal, 1969; Carey et al., 1982) and some billfish in the families Istiophoridae and Xiphiida...|$|R
25|$|Pelagic fish {{range in}} size from small coastal forage fish, such as {{herrings}} and sardines, to large apex predator oceanic fishes, such as <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> and oceanic sharks. They are usually agile swimmers with streamlined bodies, capable of sustained cruising on long-distance migrations. The Indo-Pacific sailfish, an oceanic pelagic fish, can sprint at over 110 kilometres per hour. Some tuna species cruise across the Pacific Ocean. Many pelagic fish swim in schools weighing hundreds of tonnes. Others are solitary, like the large ocean sunfish weighing over 500 kilograms, which sometimes drift passively with ocean currents, eating jellyfish.|$|E
25|$|Australia's 11 {{million square}} {{kilometre}} fishing zone {{is the third}} {{largest in the world}} and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods. Lobster, prawns, tuna, salmon and abalone are the main ocean species harvested commercially, while aquaculture produces more than 60 species for consumption, including oysters, salmonoids, southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> mussels, prawns, barramundi, yellowtail kingfish, and freshwater finifish. While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide some unique fresh water game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that swimming in groups enhances foraging success. This ability was demonstrated by Pitcher and others {{in their study of}} foraging behaviour in shoaling cyprinids. In this study, the time it took for groups of minnows and goldfish to find a patch of food was quantified. The number of fishes in the groups was varied, and a statistically significant decrease in the amount of time necessary for larger groups to find food was established. Further support for an enhanced foraging capability of schools is seen in the structure of schools of predatory fish. Partridge and others analysed the school structure of Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from aerial photographs and found that the school assumed a parabolic shape, a fact that was suggestive of cooperative hunting in this species.|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} new and highly valuable aquaculture industry focuses on three species of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas,</b> which are captured {{from the wild}} and fattened for several months in sea cages.

The samples were characterised by high content of marine wax esters (55 - 67 mol% of lipid classes), of docosahexaenoic (22 : 6 n- 3, 25 w%) and oleic (18 : 1 n- 9, 19 w%) fatty acids. Cholesterol was detected as 7 - 9 w% of lipids. Free fatty acids, index of lipid hydrolysis, represented 32 - 39 mol% over total fatty acids. Among metabolites, nutrients as taurine, nicotinamide and B-alanine, were found. The microflora comprised staphylococci, enterococci (2. 2 log(10) CFU/g) and lactic acid bacteria (3 log(10) CFU/g). The food-borne pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were not detected. These findings indicate tuna bottarga as valuable source of nutrients.

Albert also announced that Monaco would seek to award endangered species status to the Mediterranean bluefin Thunnus thynnus, (also called the Northern bluefin) under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

25|$|Fishing {{scenes are}} rarely {{represented}} in ancient Greek culture, {{a reflection of}} the low social status of fishing. However, Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably parrotfish) whereas Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> was three times as expensive. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish.|$|E

40|$|Long-distance {{migration}} {{is a widespread}} process evolved independently in several animal groups in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Many factors contribute to the migration process and of primary importance are intra-specific competition and seasonality in the resource distribution. Adaptive migration in direction of increasing fitness should lead to the ideal free distribution (IFD) which is the evolutionary stable strategy of the habitat selection game. We introduce a migration game which focuses on migrating dynamics leading to the IFD for age-structured populations and in time varying habitats, where dispersal is costly. The model predicts migration dynamics between these habitats and the corresponding population distribution. When applied to Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas,</b> it predicts their migration routes and their seasonal distribution. The largest biomass {{is located in the}} spawning areas which have also the largest diversity in the age-structure.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Top pelagic predators such as tunas, sharks, {{marine turtles}} and mammals have {{historically}} been difficult to study due to their large body size and vast range over the oceanic habitat. In recent years the development of small microprocessor-based data storage tags that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provide marine researchers a novel avenue for examining the movements, physiology and behaviors of pelagic animals in the wild. When biological and physical data obtained from the tags are combined with satellite derived sea surface temperature and ocean color data, {{the relationships between the}} movements, behaviors and physical ocean environment can be examined. Tag-bearing marine animals can function as autonomous ocean profilers providing oceanographic data wherever their long migrations take them. The biologging science is providing ecological physiologists with new insights into the seasonal movements, habitat utilization, breeding behaviors and population structures in of marine vertebrates. In addition, the data are revealing migration corridors, hot spots and physical oceanographic patterns that are key to understanding how organisms such as <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> use the open ocean environment. In the 21 st century as ecosystem degradation and global warming continue to threaten the existence of species on Earth, the field of physiological ecology will play a more pivotal role in conservation biology...|$|R

However, the fish stomach content record contents composition - by prey weight - of 1525 albacore caught in the Bay of Biscay and surrounding waters of the North Atlantic Drift Region in 2005 (n= 397), 2006 (n= 196), 2007 (n= 37), 2009 (n= 95), 2010 (n= 566) and 2011 (n= 234); and of 686 <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> caught in the Southeastern Bay of Biscay in 2004 (n= 32), 2005 (n= 36), 2006 (n= 3), 2009 (n= 257), 2010 (n= 233) and 2011 (n= 125).

40|$|Tunas {{are highly}} {{specialized}} predators that have evolved numerous adaptations for {{a lifestyle that}} requires large amounts of energy consumption. Here we review {{our understanding of the}} bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas.</b> Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and fishing impacts...|$|R
