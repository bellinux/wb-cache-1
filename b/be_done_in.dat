5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> this zone.|$|E
5|$|Both Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law {{assume that}} the running time of the serial {{part of the program}} is {{independent}} of the number of processors. Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount of work to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> parallel is also independent of the number of processors, whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> parallel varies linearly with the number of processors.|$|E

5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} must <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium {{in order to}} shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.|$|E
5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, {{it is possible to}} define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E

5|$|Once war was declared, Voorhis {{supported}} the internment of Japanese-Americans, though {{he suggested that}} the evacuations <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> as voluntary a manner as possible and that officials be appointed to administer their property to avoid forced sales at bargain prices. During the war, Voorhis advocated more efficiently taxing higher incomes and war profits, planning against postwar unemployment, and planning for the nutritional needs of Americans. Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E

5|$|The {{title was}} the first LucasArts {{adventure}} game to incorporate voice work on release. The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for CD-ROM was too low. As they neared the end of 1992, CD-ROM sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would not <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> time {{by the end of}} the year to make the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more time to complete the title.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, {{it is also possible}} to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E

5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line ticket hall, three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. This will <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create thousands of new homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its worksite for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not precisely specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be sure how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence precisely where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of what ought to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E

5|$|He {{imagined}} {{it as an}} homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, {{it would be the}} company's first film in which all characters are human.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate {{as soon as a}} flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert assets from a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E
