40|$|Silicon carbon nitride {{thin films}} have been {{deposited}} by reactive magnetron sputtering of silicon and graphite targets in mixed Ar/N 2 atmosphere at substrate temperature of 300 °C. The substrate bias voltage varied from - 50 up to + 50 Vand the nitrogen flow rate varied from 0 to 20 sccm. The as-deposited films {{were analyzed by}} Raman spectroscopy (RS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Raman analyses show that the film without nitrogen incorporation has mixed sp 2 –sp 3 -hybridized carbon structures while those with nitrogen introduction give rise to nitrogen-bound sp 1 -, sp 2 - and sp 3 -coordinated carbon structures as well as Si–N phase. The change of the D band position (~ 1360 cm- 1), FWHM and its relative intensity {{with respect to the}} G band (~ 1595 cm- 1), ID/IG, seem to be correlated with the formation of these phases and therefore to the deposition conditions. XPS analyses not only confirm the <b>bonding</b> <b>natures</b> revealed by Raman spectroscopy, but also give quantitatively the relative importance of the phases. It was shown that the area ratio of the nitrogen-bound sp 3 - to sp 2 -coordinated carbon bonds is: 1. 41 : 1. 38 : 1. 8 : 3. 19 and that of Si-N bonds to (Si-N+Si-C) bonds is 0. 4 : 0. 5 : 0. 9 : 1 for the Si–C–N films prepared with 5, 10, 15 and 20 sccm nitrogen flow rate, respectively...|$|E
30|$|The valence charge {{distribution}} for Li 3 NbS 4 was completely dominated by ionic <b>bond</b> <b>nature</b> between Li, Nb and S atoms (Fig.  9 a) calculated along (100) direction. However, there is sharing of valence electrons between Nb and S atoms {{which has been}} identified through the charge density plot along (112) direction as in Fig.  9 b. Hence, Li 3 NbS 4 also exhibit mixed bonding character, whereas the ionic <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> weakens the covalent character. To investigate the impact of Li+ extraction in the <b>nature</b> of chemical <b>bonding,</b> the charge density contour plot for the delithiated phase Li 2 NbS 4 was calculated. From Fig.  9 c, {{it is observed that}} the isolines are not shared by Nb, S and Li atoms. Therefore, the bonding along (100) direction is completely ionic. The sharing of valence electrons between Nb and S atoms along (112) direction in Fig.  9 d infer that the delithiated phase shows partially covalent and partially ionic <b>bonding</b> <b>nature.</b> From the electron charge density calculations, it is observed that the ionic bond character dominates the covalent nature in the host compounds Li 2 TiS 3 and Li 3 NbS 4, whereas covalent <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> dominates the ionic nature in their corresponding delithiated phases LiTiS 3 and Li 2 NbS 4.

The <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> of atoms in the optimized structures has been examined using a local analysis technique based on a self-consistent and environment-dependent semi-empirical Hamiltonian. Results of our studies reveal that stabilized SiC graphitic-like layer structures possess the sp 2 <b>bonding</b> <b>nature,</b> different from the sp 3 <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> in bulk SiC. Such flexibility in bonding configurations between Si and C atoms holds the possibility {{for a wide range of}} stable SiC-based structures, similar to those for carbon-based structures. In the case of SiC-based nanotubes, we have calculated quantities such as the strain energy, the degree of buckle in the cylindrical shell, and bond charges between Si and C atoms, to obtain an understanding of the optimized structures. The optimized interlayer spacing of SiC graphitic-like multilayer sheets has been found to depend on the ordering of atoms in different layers of the SiC graphitic-like structure (0. 37 nm for the Si-C sequence of bilayer arrangement versus 0. 48 nm for either the Si-Si or the C-C sequence of bilayer arrangement). These observations may be attributed to the Coulomb interactions due to the charge redistribution among Si and C atoms. On the other hand, the existence of two different ranges of interlayer separation in SiC double-walled nanotubes (0. 38 nm for zigzag and 0. 48 nm for armchair) is found to be related to whether the dominant interlayer neighbors are of the Si-C type or the Si-Si and C-C types.

40|$|Bulk {{tellurium}} (Te) {{is composed}} of one-dimensional (1 D) helical chains which have been considered to be coupled by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, based on first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we here propose a different <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> between neighboring chains: i. e., the helical chains made of normal covalent bonds are connected together by coordinate covalent bonds. It is revealed that the lone pairs of electrons of Te atom participate in forming coordinate covalent bonds between neighboring chains. Therefore, each Te atom behaves as both electron donor to neighboring chains and electron acceptor from neighboring chains. This ligand-metal-like <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> in bulk Te results {{in the same order}} of bulk moduli along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the chains, contrasting with the large anisotropy of bulk moduli in vdW crystals. We further find that the electron effective masses parallel and perpendicular to the chains are almost the same each other, consistent with the observed nearly isotropic electrical resistivity. It is thus demonstrated that the normal/coordinate covalent bonds parallel/perpendicular to the chains in bulk Te lead to a minor anisotropy in structural and transport properties, distinct from a strong anisotropy observed in the typical two-dimensional (2 D) vdW materials such as graphite and MoS$_ 2 $.

Short range order, charge transfer and the <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> are analyzed by means of density of states, Bader decomposition and pair distribution function analysis. A clear trend of a decrease in density and bulk modulus {{as well as a}} weaker cohesion was observed as the valence electron concentration is increased by replacing B with Si and further with P and S. These changes may be understood based on increased interatomic distances, variations in coordination numbers and the electronic structure changes; as the valence electron concentration of X is increased the X bonding becomes more ionic, which disrupts the overall metallic interactions, leading to lower cohesion and stiffness. The highest magnetic moments for the transition metals are identified for X=S, {{despite the fact that the}} presence of X generally reduces the magnetic moment of Co.
