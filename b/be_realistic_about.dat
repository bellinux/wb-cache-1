We just want to do well." [...] Choden spent time in Germany and Bangladesh preparing for the games. On July 28 Choden competed in the qualification round of her event. She finished 56th out of 56 athletes with a score of 381 points. She scored 18 points less the two equal highest scoring athlete, Sylwia Bogacka of Poland and Yi Siling of China. Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round. In an interview with Reuters after the games Choden said: [...] "I really enjoyed it. Now we can see how hard we need to work to be really good." ...|$|E
500|$|Nicola Muscat was the {{youngest}} person to compete for Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 18. She had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games. Muscat qualified for the Games after receiving a wildcard from FINA because her fastest time of 26.87 seconds was 1.11 second slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the 50 metres freestyle. Before the Games she said, [...] "Competing at international competitions makes you learn to <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> winning and making achievable aims. For example, my main aim at the Olympics is to break my own national record." [...] Muscat was drawn in the event's fifth heat on 3 August, finishing fourth out of eight athletes, with a time of 27.22 seconds. She finished in front of Jessica Teixeira Vieira of Mozambique (27.39 seconds) and Jordan's Talita Baqlah (27.45 seconds) but behind Chinyere Pigot from Suriname (26.30 seconds) in a heat led by Rūta Meilutytė of Lithuania (25.55 seconds). Overall she ranked 43rd out of 73 swimmers, and was unable to advance to the semi-finals after finishing 1.94 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who made the later stages.|$|E

The Institute preached the benefits of medical testing and stressed disciplined study as the best way for single men and women to prepare for marriage. Johnson’s work for the AIFR brought his thinking about reproduction full circle. In his 1948 book Looking Toward Marriage, he summarized decades of experience in counseling singles. Traits such as stability, sympathy, “self-mastery,” intelligence, and health produced the best chances for a successful marriage, he noted.

50|$|After the {{establishment}} of the People's Republic of China ("PRC") in 1949 and the retreat of the Republic of China ("ROC") government to Taiwan, Australia did not recognise the PRC. The United Kingdom proposed in 1949 that Britain, Australia and New Zealand should simultaneously recognise the new government. However, the Australian and New Zealand governments were concerned about electoral repercussions at a time when Communism was becoming a more topical issues, and did not do so immediately. Although Ben Chifley's Labor government preferred to <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> the new Chinese government and would have supported its admission to the United Nations, it lost the election. The British government went ahead with the recognition of the PRC alone in 1950, but the United States withheld recognition. The Korean War further solidified the United States' position of supporting the Republic of China regime in Taiwan instead of the PRC. Wavering between its two traditional allies, Australia chose to follow the lead of the United States, rather than Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, France, Canada, and Italy (all of which switched recognition to the PRC before 1970).|$|E

40|$|This text {{explores the}} re-visioning of {{literacy}} and literacy teacher {{education for the}} digital era, approached from an interdisciplinary and international perspective. Because the authors are experienced teacher educators as well as researchers, {{they are able to}} give extended examples of how to apply the theory in practice. The authors <b>are</b> <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> what <b>is</b> appropriate and feasible for teachers and teacher educators, rather than just jumping on a technology bandwagon. " Literacy learning continues to be central to schooling, and is currently of major concern to educators, policy developers, and members of the public alike. However, the proliferation of communication channels in this digital era requires a fundamental re-thinking of the nature of literacy and the pedagogy of literacy teaching and teacher education. This text brings together papers by experts in teacher education, literacy, and information technology to help chart a way forward in this complex area. Because of their background in teacher education, the authors <b>are</b> <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> what <b>is</b> appropriate and feasible – they do not just jump on a technology bandwagon – but they are also able to provide extended examples of how to embed technology in the practice of teacher education.

40|$|In <b>Being</b> <b>Realistic</b> <b>About</b> Reasons,T. M. Scanlon {{develops}} a non-naturalistic realist account of normative reasons. A {{crucial part of}} that account is Scanlon’s contention {{that there is no}} deep epistemological problem for non-naturalistic realists, and that the method of reflective equilibrium suffices to explain the possibility of normative knowledge. In this critical notice we argue that this is not so: on a realist picture, normative knowledge presupposes a significant correlation between distinct entities, namely between normative beliefs and normative facts. This correlation calls for an explanation. We show that Scanlon does not have the resources to offer such an explanation...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the general}} aims of any science is to concern itself with the {{distinction}} between what is real and actual {{as opposed to what}} is but merely apparent. In this sense it seems gratuitous to announce that one intends to <b>be</b> <b>realistic</b> <b>about</b> scientific endeavour: to adopt a scientific approach is simply to refuse to be the dupe of mere appearance. The zealous pursuit of the true, the real and the actual, or of the essential as opposed to the epiphenomenal can, however, be subverted and diverted in many ways. In this article we examine various aspects of this problem in relation to legal science, and more specifically to the theories and methodologies associated with Legal Realism...|$|E

In these dialogues experimental results are given, although Galileo may have found them inadequate for persuading his audience. Thought experiments showing logical contradictions in Aristotelian thinking, presented in the skilled rhetoric of Galileo's dialogue were further enticements for the reader.|$|R
