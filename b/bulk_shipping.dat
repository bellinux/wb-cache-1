25|$|Seattle Box and Tacoma Box sought new {{products}} and more efficient ways to produce them. Wooden boxes continued {{to be the main}} product, but paper and corrugated cardboard boxes were beginning to affect demand. The Tacoma plant set up a round conveyor system, which was then also implemented in the Seattle plant. The company adopted a new system for coloring boxes in 1957, and in 1958, began using clamp gluing and <b>bulk</b> <b>shipping</b> fasteners developed by North American Aviation. The Seattle and Tacoma plants both needed continuous foundation repairs.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, the {{thickness}} and area {{extent of the}} Arctic sea ice has experienced significant reduction, compared to the recorded averages. This {{has led to an}} increase in transit shipping. In 2011, four ships sailed {{the entire length of the}} NEP, 46 in 2012, and 19 in 2013. The number of trips is still very small compared to the thousands of ships each year through the Suez Canal. Mainstream container shipping is expected to continue to overwhelmingly use the Suez route, while niche activities like <b>bulk</b> <b>shipping</b> is expected to grow, driven by the mining industries of the Arctic.|$|E
25|$|A usable Northern Sea Route between {{northern}} Europe to North Pacific ports {{would cut}} time at sea (and resultant fuel consumption) {{by more than}} half. For the corporate players in <b>bulk</b> <b>shipping</b> of relative low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel may appear as a driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, and not necessarily reduced lead time. The Northern Sea Route allows economies of scale compared to coastal route alternatives, with vessel draught and beam limitation. Environmental demands faced by the maritime shipping industry may emerge as a driver for developing the Northern Sea Route. Increased awareness of environmental benefits and costs for both the Northern Sea Route and Suez routes will probably be important factors in this respect.|$|E
40|$|This article {{develops}} the optimal single step toll scheme which is levied to <b>bulk</b> <b>ships</b> for a queuing port. Bulk ships' arrival {{times at the}} port will be rationally dispersed after pricing this toll scheme. Consequently, the queuing time at the anchorage to all <b>bulk</b> <b>ships</b> will be rationally decreased. This article shows bulk ships' equilibrium arrival rate distributions during the queuing period before and after establishing the optimal single step toll scheme. This article also shows <b>bulk</b> <b>ship</b> owners' decisions of arrival time adjustments under the optimal single step toll scheme. Based on these results, we find some <b>bulk</b> <b>ships</b> that paid no toll under the optimal single step toll scheme to maintain the same arrival times at the anchorage {{as they did in}} the original nontoll equilibrium situation. New arrival times at the anchorage for other <b>bulk</b> <b>ships</b> that paid the toll are postponed when compared with their original arrival times in the nontoll equilibrium situation. ...|$|R

25|$|Vale's {{decision}} of constructing {{a fleet of}} 400,000-ton ore carriers was widely criticized by other shipping companies. The new Valemax ships, expected to cut the company's transportation costs by 20–25%, were blamed for driving down the freight rates for the entire industry, swelling the already oversupplied bulk transportation market and stalling {{the recovery of the}} shipping business after the financial crisis. The freight rates, down 80% from 2008, were expected to drop further down to the levels of 1977. According to the chief executive of BIMCO, the Valemax vessels could displace up to 168 150,000–180,000-ton capesize bulk carriers, around 15% of the existing fleet, from the long haul voyages and force them to less profitable shorter routes. Vale responded to the criticism by stating that the company aims to permanently cut the costs of Atlantic-Pacific dry <b>bulk</b> <b>shipping</b> to make Brazilian ore more competitive against iron ore produced in Australia, which is closer to major customers in Asia.|$|E
