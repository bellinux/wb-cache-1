5|$|The duality {{represents}} a major advance {{in our understanding}} of string theory and quantum gravity. This is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a non-perturbative formulation of string theory with certain boundary conditions and because it is the most successful realization of the holographic principle, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and promoted by Leonard Susskind.|$|E
5|$|Oligonucleotide {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides {{of the desired}} sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E

25|$|The theorem {{can be seen}} as {{a scheme}} for nondimensionalization <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a method for {{computing}} sets of dimensionless parameters from the given variables, even if the form of the equation is still unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Wisconsin law {{has been}} criticized as one having little or no real {{protection}} for property owners <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> protection against property condemnation for economic development but does allow property condemnation under a broadly defined description of blighted.|$|E
40|$|In this JEB Classics paper, Sir James Gray and G. J. Hancock {{explained}} how spermatozoa are propelled by flagellar bending waves (Gray and Hancock, 1955). This paper was a lasting success <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> an easy-to-understand {{solution to a}} complicated hydrodynamic problem, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> a quantitative prediction of the swimming speed that was almost identical to the swimming speed measured in Gray's accompanying paper on the movement of sea urchin spermatozoa (Gray, 1955) ...|$|R

25|$|Sorbitol is {{referred}} to as a nutritive sweetener <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> dietary energy: 2.6 kilocalories (11 kilojoules) per gram versus the average 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates. It is often used in diet foods (including diet drinks and ice cream), mints, cough syrups, and sugar-free chewing gum.|$|E
25|$|The {{optional}} suggestion service {{included in}} Google Chrome {{has been criticized}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an IP address.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} of the neural correlates of reciprocal imitation is extremely important <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) {{to address the issue}} of the sense of agency. There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a constitutive role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.|$|E
50|$|The Myvu Personal Media Viewer {{was popular}} in the {{wearable}} computer community <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provided</b> a cost effective and relatively easy path to a DIY, small, single eye, head-mounted display.|$|R

25|$|Proposition 13 {{alters the}} balance of the housing market <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> disincentives for selling property, in favor of {{remaining}} at the current property and modifying or transferring to family members to avoid a new, higher property tax assessment. More detailed evidence of this is provided in the book Property Taxes and Tax Revolts: The Legacy of Proposition 13.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Diamond Head was {{declared}} a National Natural Landmark. The crater, also called Diamond Head Lookout {{was used as}} a strategic military lookout in the early 1900s. Spanning over 475 acres (190 ha) (including the crater’s interior and outer slopes), it served as an effective defensive lookout <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> panoramic views of Waikīkī and the south shore of Oahu.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the Radio Authority renewed GWR FM's licence. It was due {{to expire}} in October 2009, but will now expire on 28 October 2013, {{according}} to GWR FM licensees page. However {{it is expected to}} be automatically renewed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a DAB simulcast signal.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{characteristics}} of female employment such as salary and employment type which are meaningful indicators of female economic participation and female economic stability. These indicators help clarify the economic status women hold in some majority Muslim nations and the permanence of their involvement in the economy. In development economics, great emphasis has been placed on salaried work <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a stable source of income.|$|E
25|$|The change-of-state {{property}} of Verb Phrases (VP) {{is a significant}} observation for the syntax of lexical semantics <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> evidence that subunits are embedded in the VP structure, and that {{the meaning of the}} entire VP is influenced by this internal grammatical structure. (For example, the VP the vase broke carries a change-of-state meaning of the vase becoming broken, and thus has a silent BECOME subunit within its underlying structure.) There are two types of change-of-state predicates: inchoative and causative.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{conflict}} resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as clear, nice, provocable, and forgiving. Firstly, It is a clear and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it {{is considered to be}} nice as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also provocable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is forgiving as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.|$|E

25|$|Instead of recalling {{something}} {{related to}} the spoken word, calligraphy for Muslims is a visible expression of the highest art of all, {{the art of the}} spiritual world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The Qur'an has {{played an important role in}} the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|The rape {{specific}} adaptation hypothesis {{suggests that}} rape is an evolved behaviour <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> direct {{benefits to the}} rapist. In this case, the benefit would be a higher chance of reproductive success through increasing mate number. The hypothesis suggests that rape behaviour {{is the result of}} psychological mechanisms designed specifically to influence males to rape, unlike in the by-product hypothesis. This theory suggests that rape by a man which offers no chance of reproductive success, i.e. the rape of any other person who is not a female of reproductive age, is a maladaptive byproduct of this evolutionary adaptation.|$|E
25|$|LogMAR {{is another}} {{commonly}} used scale, expressed as the (decadic) logarithm {{of the minimum}} angle of resolution (MAR). The LogMAR scale converts the geometric sequence of a traditional chart to a linear scale. It measures visual acuity loss: positive values indicate vision loss, while negative values denote normal or better visual acuity. This scale is rarely used clinically; it is more frequently used in statistical calculations <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> a more scientific equivalent for the traditional clinical statement of “lines lost” or “lines gained”, which is valid only when all steps between lines are equal, which is not usually the case.|$|E
