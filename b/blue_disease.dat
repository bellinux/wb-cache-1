40|$|Cotton bunchy top (CBT) {{disease has}} caused {{significant}} yield losses in Australia {{and is now}} managed by control of its vector, the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii). Its mode of transmission and similarities in symptoms to cotton <b>Blue</b> <b>Disease</b> suggested {{it may also be}} caused by a luteovirus or related virus. Degenerate primers to conserved regions of the genomes of the family Luteoviridae were used to amplify viral cDNAs from CBT-affected cotton leaf tissue that were not present in healthy plants. Partial genome sequence of a new virus (Cotton bunchy top virus, CBTV) was obtained spanning part of the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRP), all of the coat protein and part of the aphid-transmission protein. CBTV sequences could be detected in viruliferous aphids able to transmit CBT, but not aphids from non-symptomatic plants, indicating that it is associated with the disease and may be the causal agent. All CBTV open-reading frames had their closest similarity to viruses of the genus Polerovirus. The partial RdRP had 90 % amino acid identity to the RdRP of Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) that causes cotton <b>blue</b> <b>disease,</b> while other parts of the genome were more similar to other poleroviruses. The sequence similarity and genome organization of CBTV suggest that it should be considered a new member of the genus Polerovirus.

Urinary GAG excretion was also measured in normal controls, patients with osteoarthritis (OA), and patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Total GAG excretion was increased in the RA group and fell after second-line therapy (p< 001). More low than high molecular weight GAG was excreted in the active RA group, and this pattern was reversed after treatment. Excretion of total, high and low molecular weight GAG in the OA group {{did not differ significantly}} from controls. Total GAG excretion was increased in the MI group when compared with controls (p< 002) and consisted mainly of high molecular weight GAG.

40|$|Abstract Background Cotton <b>blue</b> <b>disease</b> (CBD), an {{important}} global cotton crop pathology responsible for major economic losses, is {{prevalent in the}} major cotton-producing states of Brazil. Typical CBD symptoms include stunting due to internodal shortening, leaf rolling, intense green foliage, and yellowing veins. Atypical CBD symptoms, including reddish and withered leaves, were also observed in Brazilian cotton fields in 2007. Recently, a Polerovirus named Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) was shown {{to be associated with}} CBD. Results To understand the distribution and genetic diversity of CLRDV in Brazil, we analyzed 23 CBD-symptomatic plants from susceptible cotton varieties originating from five of the six most important cotton-growing states, from 2004 – 2007. Here, we report on CLRDV diversity in plants with typical or atypical CBD symptoms by comparing viral coat protein, RNA polymerase (RdRp), and intergenic region genomic sequences. Conclusion The virus had a widespread distribution with a low genetic diversity; however, three divergent isolates were associated with atypical CBD symptoms. These divergent isolates had a CLRDV-related coat protein but a distinct RdRp sequence, and probably arose from recombination events. Based on the taxonomic rules for the family Luteoviridae, we propose that these three isolates represent isolates of a new species in the genus Polerovirus. </p...|$|E

Methods: CLRDV-infected cotton plants of different varieties were collected from five growing fields in Brazil and their P 0 sequences compared to three previously obtained isolates. P 0 ’s silencing suppression activities were scored based on transient expression experiments in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Results: High sequence diversity was observed among CLRDV P 0 proteins, indicating that some isolates found in cotton varieties formerly resistant to CLRDV should be regarded as new genotypes within the species. All tested proteins were able to suppress local and systemic silencing, but with significantly variable degrees. All P 0 proteins were able to mediate the decay of ARGONAUTE proteins, a key component of the RNA silencing machinery.

40|$|Cotton bunchy top virus (CBTV) and {{the related}} Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) have caused {{sporadic}} disease outbreaks in most cotton regions of the world. Until recently, little was known about the diversity of CBTV or its natural host range. Seven natural field hosts and one experimental host of CBTV have now been identified. These include cotton, Malva parviflora (Marshmallow weed), Abutilon theophrasti (Velvetleaf), Anoda cristata (Spurred anoda), Hibiscus sabdariffa (Rosella), Sida rhombifolia (Paddy’s lucerne), Chamaesyce hirta (Asthma plant) and Gossypium australe. These are currently the only eight known hosts of CBTV. However the virus may have a wider host range than originally thought and include further non-Malvaceae species like asthma plant (family Euphorbiaceae). There are two distinct strains of CBTV in Australia, -A and -B, which have been detected in cotton from numerous locations across almost all growing regions. From 105 samples of cotton that have been positive for CBTV, 6 were infections of strain A only, 60 were strain B only and 64 were a mixed infection of strains A and B.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{response}} to infection, viral genomes are processed by Dicer-like (DCL) ribonuclease proteins into viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) of discrete sizes. vsRNAs are then used as guides for silencing the viral genome. The profile of vsRNAs produced during the infection {{process has been}} extensively studied for some groups of viruses. However, nothing {{is known about the}} vsRNAs produced during infections of members of the economically important family Luteoviridae, a group of phloem-restricted viruses. Here, we report the characterization of a population of vsRNAs from cotton plants infected with Cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV), a member of the genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae. Results Deep sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) from leaves of CLRDV-infected cotton plants revealed that the vsRNAs were 21 - to 24 -nucleotides (nt) long and that their sequences matched the viral genome, with higher frequencies of matches in the 3 - region. There were equivalent amounts of sense and antisense vsRNAs, and the 22 -nt class of small RNAs was predominant. During infection, cotton Dcl transcripts appeared to be up-regulated, while Dcl 2 appeared to be down-regulated. Conclusions This is the first report on the profile of sRNAs in a plant infected with a virus from the family Luteoviridae. Our sequence data strongly suggest that virus-derived double-stranded RNA functions as one of the main precursors of vsRNAs. Judging by the profiled size classes, all cotton DCLs might be working to silence the virus. The possible causes for the unexpectedly high accumulation of 22 -nt vsRNAs are discussed. CLRDV is the causal agent of Cotton <b>blue</b> <b>disease,</b> which occurs worldwide.

40|$|Abstract—Diesel is {{a complex}} mixture {{containing}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which persist after a spill, pass readily from water into tissues, and are toxic to early life stages of fish. The bioavailability and chronic toxicity of hydrocarbons dissolved into water from floating diesel (water-accommodated fraction) and chemically dispersed diesel (chemically enhanced water-accommodated fraction) were measured by the extent of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and by the severity of <b>blue</b> sac <b>disease</b> in embryos. The water-accommodated fraction of floating diesel was virtually nontoxic to embryos at nominal concentrations up to 1, 000 mg/L, causing only small weight changes. Liver EROD induction in juvenile trout was only observed at the highest nominal water-accommodated fraction concentration (10, 000 mg/L). Chemical dispersion increased the bioavailability and toxicity of diesel to trout by 100 -fold. Diesel chemically enhanced wateraccommodated fraction induced EROD activity, caused <b>blue</b> sac <b>disease,</b> and impaired development and growth of embryonic trout at nominal concentrations as low as 10 mg/L; 88 % mortality occurred at 100 mg/L. However, when total hydrocarbon concentrations were measured, differences between dispersed and undispersed diesel disappeared, with a median lethal concentration of 8 mg/L of total hydrocarbons and sublethal median effective concentrations ranging from 1. 3 to 6. 1 mg/L. Dispersion of diesel by highenergy mechanical mixing was recently reported to cause acute lethality to juvenile trout between 40 and 200 mg/L. Therefore, dispersion of oil by any means increases the bioavailability and apparent toxicity of diesel to fish embryos without changing the toxicity of its components.
