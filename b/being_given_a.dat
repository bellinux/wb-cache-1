The film topped the Chinese box office in October 2006 and despite not <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> release in most European and North American countries, it grossed over US$20 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Subjective {{ownership}} {{would occur}} if subjects knowingly chose the letters {{from their own}} name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study {{were able to find}} a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> noncombatant role, {{she fought}} {{alongside}} {{the men of}} her unit in the battles of the Tarapacá Campaign in late 1879, at Pisagua and San Francisco. Her valor in these battles and her care for wounded men drew the attention of Chilean commander-in-chief Manuel Baquedano, who provided her with official recognition and the rank of a sergeant. She continued {{to serve in the}} army {{for the duration of the}} war and was famously courageous at the Battle of Tacna in 1880. After the war, she returned to civilian life and died in obscurity, aged only 25. Now considered one of Chile's greatest heroes of the war, her service only became widely known after her death.|$|E
5|$|In August, twelve {{engineers}} were hired on contract with Baneservice, {{at the time}} a subsidiary of the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The {{engineers were}} subsequently re-certified for the Y1 class, as well as <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> service course. While other engineers in the country are required to take an 18-month course, Timetoget felt it could meet sufficient safety standards with a six-week course. Arne Wam, chief executive officer of NSB, stated that he could not permit that a subsidiary ignore safety in such a way, and announced he would stop operations.|$|E
5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 {{was designed to be}} a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> special hyper-mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also changed, with the dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming.|$|E

Mary was welcomed back shortly before she gave birth to her first son by <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> bed in a private ward. Jim was not present at the birth as he was fighting a warehouse fire, but arrived at the hospital two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Olga Tufnell (26 January 1905 – 11 April 1985) was a British {{archaeologist}} who assisted on {{the excavation}} {{of the ancient}} city of Lachish in the 1930s. She had no formal training in archaeology, but {{had worked as a}} secretary for Flinders Petrie {{for a number of years}} before <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> field assignment. Olga then went on to join James Leslie Starkey in the expedition to find Lachish in 1929 and remained part of the team for the following seasons.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1829 a {{petition}} {{on behalf of}} James Wilson's mother and sister, protesting against Hare's immunity and intended release from prison, was given lengthy consideration by the High Court of Justiciary and rejected {{by a vote of}} 4 to 2. Margaret Hare was released on 19 January and travelled to Glasgow to find a passage back to Ireland. While waiting for a ship she was recognised and attacked by a mob. She was given shelter in a police station before <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> police escort onto a Belfast-bound vessel; no clear accounts exist of what became of her after she landed in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Rensselaerswyck {{continued}} {{as a legal}} entity until the mid-1840s, having survived Dutch and British colonial times, even <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> special patent by Queen Anne to confirm the patroon's fiefdom upon British takeover of the area. The end of the manor came with the Anti-Rent War, when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (who had died in 1839), having much influence on the Legislature elections of the time, and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to sell off most of its holdings.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{managers}} were appointed as caretaker managers prior to <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> permanent position; if so their caretaker appointment date is denoted in italics. Some managers listed {{have had more}} than one spell in charge at their current club or had spells at more than one club, however their time as manager is counted only from the date of their last appointment by their latest club. Only two managers have spent more than 10 years in their current jobs. This list includes every manager currently managing a club in the Premier League and The Football League, in order of the date that they took up their appointment.|$|E

Black then interviews Law and his crew individually, each time <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> contradicting {{story of how the}} woman came to be on board the ship. However, they all agree that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} the game was {{composed}} by Alexander Brandon and Todd Simmons; Brandon had previously worked on the original game. Brandon's guidance when composing the music for Invisible War was the sparse musical style of the Thief series, shifting away from the style used for the original game. The voice acting style also underwent changes, with the aim being for more professional performances. The improved voice acting was attributed to the team <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> larger budget. The soundtrack included six tracks from the album Trickster by industrial rock band Kidneythieves; the band's lead singer Free Dominguez provided voice work for the idol character NG Resonance. Dominguez described the experience of recording her voice work being fun.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> chance to prove her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving {{just in time to}} see his victims' final moments. What she does not expect, however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E

5|$|When {{considering}} {{joining the}} Western Interprovincial Football Union (now Canadian Football League), Pollard reported <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal of}} propaganda to turn him away.

He did not see much action with the Stampeders and ended his career due to health problems.|$|E
5|$|Disgruntled, Mau began {{recruiting}} for a coup, targeting Khánh, who {{had been}} moved to the I Corps in the far north of South Vietnam to keep him far away from Saigon. Khánh {{made no attempt to}} hide his annoyance at not <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> more important job, and had long been regarded as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer by his colleagues. Mau persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta by telling them that as Khánh had played a large part in putting down the 1960 coup attempt, Thi would still be harboring resentment. According to Mau, Thi would thus be an ideal mechanism for keeping the disliked Khánh in check. Privately, Mau predicted that Thi would act as a bridge between him in Saigon, and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant as allegiances shifted over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims.|$|E
5|$|Geneforges {{dialogue}} is delivered through on-screen text. Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player <b>being</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> series of pre-determined questions or responses.

The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E
