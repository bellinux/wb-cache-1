40|$|AbstractA {{linear mapping}} from a finite-dimensional linear space to another has a matrix representation. Certain multilinear {{functions}} are also matrix-representable. Using these representations, symbolic computations {{can be done}} numerically and hence more efficiently. This paper presents an organized procedure for constructing matrix representations for a class of linear operators on finite-dimensional spaces. First we present serial number functions for locating basis monomials in the linear space of homogeneous polynomials of fixed degree, ordered under structured lexicographies. Next basic lemmas describing the modular structure of matrix representations for operators constructed canonically from elementary operators are presented. Using these results, explicit matrix representations are then given for the Lie derivative and Lie-Poisson <b>bracket</b> <b>operators</b> defined on spaces of homogeneous polynomials. In particular, they are comprised of blocks obtained as Kronecker sums of modular components, each corresponding to specific Jordan blocks. At an implementation level, recursive programming is applied to construct these modular components explicitly. The results are also applied to computing power series approximations for the center manifold of a dynamical system. In this setting, the linear operator of interest is parameterized by two matrices, a generalization of the Lie-Poission bracket...|$|R

40|$|Two {{dynamical}} {{systems with}} same symmetry should have features in common, {{and as far}} as their shared symmetry is concerned, one may represent the other. The three light quark constituents of the hadrons, a) have an approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry, b) have an exact color SU(3) symmetry, and c) as spin 1 / 2 particles, have a Lorentz SO(3, 1) symmetry. So does a 3 D harmonic oscillator. a) Its Hamiltonian has the SU(3) symmetry, breakable if the 3 fundamental modes of oscillation are not identical. b) The 3 directions of oscillation have the permutation symmetry. This enables one to create three copies of unbreakable SU(3) symmetry for each mode of the oscillation, and mimic the color of the elementary particles.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} contribution, we derive from kinetic theory a unified fluid model for {{multicomponent}} plasmas by {{accounting for the}} electromagnetic field influence. We deal with a possible thermal nonequilibrium of the translational energy of the particles, neglecting their internal energy and the reactive collisions. Given the strong disparity of mass between the electrons and heavy particles, such as molecules, atoms, and ions, we conduct a dimensional analysis of the Boltzmann equation and introduce a scaling based on the square root of {{the ratio of the}} electron mass to a characteristic heavy-particle mass. We then generalize the Chapman-Enskog method, emphasizing the role of a multiscale perturbation parameter on the collisional operator, the streaming operator, and the collisional invariants of the Boltzmann equation. The system is examined at successive orders of approximation, each of which corresponding to a physical time scale. The multicomponent Navier-Stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles, which follow a hyperbolic scaling, and is coupled to first order drift-diffusion equations for the electrons, which follow a parabolic scaling. The transport coefficients are then calculated in terms of <b>bracket</b> <b>operators</b> whose mathematical structure allows for positivity properties to be determined. They exhibit an anisotropic behavior when the magnetic field is strong enough. We also give a complete description of the Kolesnikov effect, i. e., the crossed contributions to the mass and energy transport fluxes coupling the electrons and heavy particles. Finally, the first and second principles of thermodynamics are proved to be satisfied by deriving a total energy equation and an entropy equation. Moreover, the system of equations is shown to be conservative and the purely convective system hyperbolic, thus leading to a well defined structure. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The unique {{conditions}} of edge tokamak plasmas motivate {{the employment of}} efficient numerical methods that can robustly handle steep temperature and density gradients. To that end, we compare an Arakawa finite difference technique with some recent high-resolution upwind methods {{that are designed to}} minimize nonmonotonic overshoots while preserving the accuracy of solutions at smooth extrema. Versions of these algorithms are able to rigorously preserve positivity when that is physically relevant (such as for the advection of particle density or temperature). We explain in detail the use of these methods for the nonlinear Poisson <b>bracket,</b> an <b>operator</b> applicable to neutral fluid, gyrofluid, gyrokinetic, and general Hamiltonian simulations. For one-dimensional passive advection, the high-resolution upwind techniques maintain monotonicity and approach minimal levels of phase error and dissipation, especially at long wavelengths. In a two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes vortex merging problem we find that extrema-preserving methods can resolve details at lower resolution than the Arakawa technique, are less dissipative than traditional finite volume methods while still minimizing overshoots and ensuring positivity, and model nonlinear cascade behavior fairly well without additional subgrid damping...|$|R
