5000|$|Compound-miter saw - Compound {{adds the}} ability to rotate the <b>blade</b> <b>head</b> at a range of angles from the board {{allowing}} you to enter the wood at an angle other than 90 degrees. Creates a ramp angled cut {{into the side of}} the wood. Allows for more complex cuts and is commonly used in trim work for homes. A compound miter saw is known as a single compound miter saw, meaning that the head only rotates on one side requiring the user to flip the board to get angle cuts in the other direction.|$|E
5000|$|The parashu is {{the weapon}} {{of the god}} Shiva who gave it to Parashurama, sixth avatar of Vishnu, whose name means [...] "Rama with the axe" [...] and also taught him its mastery. He is {{regarded}} as the founder of the northern style of kalaripayat. Parashurama was the guru of Dronacharya, the guru who instructed the Pandavas in the epic of the Mahabharata. Bhishma and Karna, half brother of Pandava also took instruction in weaponry from Parashurama, a disciple of lord Shiva, and was known to have terrible temper having lost his father to the evil asura. In his anger, Parashurama used the parashu {{to get rid of the}} all the Earth's tyrannical kshatriya caste twenty-one times over. Parashurama's weapon had supernatural powers. It had four cutting edges, one on each end of the <b>blade</b> <b>head</b> and one on each end of the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Froes {{are similar}} in general form to axes, in that a froe is an L-shaped {{assembly}} of a <b>blade</b> <b>head</b> (typically steel) set at a right angle to a handle called a haft (traditionally wood). A froe {{can be thought of}} as an axe which is sharpened along the top of a long, narrow, rectangular head, instead of (as the axe is) at the end of a broad curved head. Some froes are made of a single piece of metal with no perpendicular haft. Instead, the handle is the unbeveled end of the blade which extends directly from the blade. These froes must be hammered through the entire piece of wood, as their lack of vertical haft makes it extremely difficult to lever the wood apart. A given froe can split a piece of wood no wider in its narrowest dimension than the length of the froe's blade; that is, when you place the froe, it must cross the surface of the wood completely.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional FE {{modelling}} {{and dynamic}} analysis of three-twisted-blade bunch connected mutually in <b>blade</b> <b>heads</b> by the dynamic contact with friction. The bunch was numerically tested under two dynamic regimes, such as resonance run-up excitation and vibration decay after short resonance run-up. In the contribution {{the influence of}} the blade responses, contact states, damping ratios on excitation level and excitation regimes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Paper is {{concerned}} with the steady state flexural vibrations of imperfect bladed circular disk by analytical and numerical solutions. Disk imperfection results from additional two groups of damping heads fixed on opposite ends of one diameter, which introduces point imperfections in mass, stiffness and nonlinear damping The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate influence of friction damping among adding <b>bladed</b> <b>heads</b> on decrease of resonance amplitudes. Examples based on application of equivalent linearized damping show the properties of such dampers...|$|R
5000|$|Nakaizumi Ryū ("Middle Spring Style") - A {{martial arts}} school {{that specializes in}} Kyūjutsu. The school {{utilizes}} three unique kinds of arrows to overcome the limitations of archery in combat. [...] "Destruction" [...] uses a heavy lead mass on the head to give it great speed and accuracy. [...] "Encircle" [...] uses special fletchings {{to allow it to}} turn in flight. [...] "Fang" [...] uses a crescent <b>bladed</b> <b>head</b> and multiple barbs to cause extreme damage. Grouped with the Ogame Style in the First Round.|$|R
25|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>heads</b> to the Arcan's {{mountain}} base. He infiltrates {{the facility}} and destroys the dark energy storage chambers. He then meets up with Grant, who he escorts {{to the dark}} energy receiver. However, before {{she is able to}} take it offline she is caught in an explosion. As she dies, she tells Blade he must destroy the core. He heads there, meeting Whistler, who plants a series of bombs. The duo flee the base and set off the explosions, destroying the core and putting an end to Project: Vorpal.|$|R
50|$|The {{splitting}} of {{the arrow}} story is refuted by Hollywood stuntman Buster Wiles, {{in his book}} My Days With Errol Flynn. In the book, Wiles revealed that although Hill had split the end off of several arrows, he {{had been unable to}} split the arrow exactly as scripted (from end to end), and finally a specially constructed arrow with a large <b>bladed</b> <b>head</b> had been used, shot along a concealed wire. Nevertheless, Hill's accuracy was so great, he regularly hit tiny targets in live performances and on film.|$|R

40|$|A detail {{analysis}} of dynamical properties of five-blades-bundle mathematical model {{was carried out}} with the aim to investigate how the damping elements made of special rubber inserted into slots between <b>blades</b> <b>heads</b> influence the response curves at different distribution of exciting harmonic forces. Viscous-elastic linear Voigt–Kelvin model was used for modeling the rheological properties of damping elements. Constant values of stiffness and damping parameters were supposed at analysis, but the frequency dependent parameters are mentioned as well. The effect of complicated form of higher modes of vibration on blades bundle amplitude resonance level is shown. The importance of orthogonality of excitation forces distribution to the other eigenmodes of blades bundle is discovered at isolating selected resonance...|$|R

50|$|The Louisville Tanks won {{championships in}} the three years of the {{existence}} of the Midwest Football League. Prior to joining the AFL, the St. Louis Gunners were an independent team that actually played three games in the NFL in 1934 as a replacement for the ill-fated Cincinnati Reds. After the demise of the AFL, the Gunners returned to an independent status. The Cincinnati Blades disbanded October 13, 1938 (after playing three games, all Blades victories); the scheduled games were not cancelled, and as a result, they were officially recorded as forfeit losses for the Blades. League requests for the Cincinnati Bengals (a team that was founded by <b>Blades</b> <b>head</b> coach Hal Pennington) to replace the Blades for the remaining games were rebuffed.|$|R
50|$|A remorhaz {{resembles a}} {{gigantic}} (5 feet (1.5m) wide and 20 feet (6m) long) centipede, only with longer legs. It is segmented, and each segment is jagged and heavily armored. The lower segments {{of its body}} bear legs, while the uppermost ones have webbed spines which look like a cobra's fan. Protruding from the back, with two on each segment, are big, red, jewel-like lumps which radiate extreme heat. The jagged, <b>bladed</b> <b>head</b> of the Remorhaz has four antenna-like growths, two coming from the chin/cheeks and two from the forehead. The Remorhaz is bluish-white in color, but has a reddish glow caused by its extreme body heat.

5000|$|The battle axe {{was popular}} amongst Norsemen in the Viking Age, however its {{popularity}} is often misunderstood in modern culture, the battle axe was {{not seen as}} a superior weapon to the spear and its use was rather limited from historical evidence. It was commonly used for agricultural purposes, as well as shipbuilding, and eventually adapted for use in Viking raids. [...] Axes varied in size from small handheld axes called broadaxes {{that could be used}} both for raids and in farming, to Danish Axes that were well over a meter in length. These axes had a wooden shaft, with a large, curved iron blade. They required less swinging power than expected, as the large <b>bladed</b> <b>heads</b> allowed gravity and momentum to do most of the work. The axe had points on each tip of the blade where the curve tapered off. This allowed the axe to be used to hook an opponent, while also doubling as a thrusting weapon.|$|R
