40|$|Objectives: To clarify {{whether the}} results of repair of a complex mitral lesion (Barlow valve) at the intermediate-term {{follow-up}} are independent of the mode of surgical access [minithoracotomy vs. median sternotomy (MS) ]. Methods: In a prospective randomized study of mitral repair for <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> using either a minimally invasive (MI) approach or MS, we achieved an average follow-up of 3 years (echocardiography, physical examination and quality of life). Mitral repair was achieved with polytetrafluoroethylene chordal implantation for both leaflets. Results: Both groups included 80 patients. Mechanical ventilation time and intensive care unit and hospital stay were shorter in the MI group (p = 0. 01, p = 0. 013 and p = 0. 02, respectively). During the follow-up, 5 patients in each group (6. 25 %) displayed mild mitral regurgitation, while 2 patients in each group (2. 5 %) developed recurrent regurgitation graded as at least moderate/severe. The rate of mitral reoperation was 2. 5 % in the MI group and 1. 25 % in the MS group (p = 0. 9). The overall follow-up mortality was 3. 75 % in both the MI and the MS groups. Conclusions: The 3 -year results of repair of Barlow valves were satisfactory irrespective of the approach used to repair the valve.

MethodsThe resection shape is that of an hourglass rather than a quadrangle. The vertical sides of the quadrangle curve inward, which helps to prevent the curtain effect or restriction that is common in the large triangular resection or folding plasty. We used hourglass resection for 26 tall posterior leaflets (53. 8 % were <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease)</b> and triangular resection for 23 posterior leaflets of normal height (without <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease).</b> ResultsAll surgeries were performed successfully. There was no mortality, no mitral regurgitation greater than moderate, and no systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet in the early postoperative period. One patient required a second pump run, and another required a second repair procedure. The mean follow-up period was 2. 3 years (0. 3 - 4. 9 years) for the hourglass resection and 2. 8 years (0. 1 - 4. 9 years) for the triangular resection. One patient in the triangular resection group died of rectal cancer. One patient treated with the hourglass resection via minithoracotomy required re-repair 1 month postoperatively due to suture dehiscence. For the hourglass and triangular resection groups, the most recent postoperative echocardiogram revealed no mitral regurgitation in 18 and 20 cases, respectively; mild mitral regurgitation in 7 and 3 cases, respectively; and moderate mitral regurgitation in 1 and 0 cases, respectively.

40|$|ObjectiveOwing to the {{complexity}} of the underlying lesions, <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> remains a challenge for surgeons performing mitral valve repair. We aimed to assess whether our most recent results involving several surgeons were comparable with those of a previous experience in which mitral valve repair was performed by a more limited group of surgeons. MethodsFrom September 2000 to January 2007, 200 patients with <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> (135 men and 65 women; mean age, 56 ± 13 years) were referred to our institution for surgical treatment of their mitral regurgitation. We retrospectively analysed the mitral lesions characteristics, the surgical techniques used, and clinical outcomes. Follow-up echocardiograms were biannually reviewed. ResultsLesions comprised annular dilatation, excess tissue, and leaflet prolapse in all cases. The most frequent prolapsed segments were P 2 (88. 5 %; n = 177) and A 2 (55. 5 %; n = 111). Annular calcifications and restrictive valvular motion were associated in 20 % (n = 40). Repair was feasible in 94. 7 % (n = 179 / 189) of non-redo interventions. Immediate postoperative echocardiography showed residual mitral regurgitation greater than 1 + in 6 cases; these patients were all reoperated on within the next months. Operative mortality was 1. 5 % (n = 3). Mean follow-up was 77. 5 ± 25. 6 months. At 8 years postoperatively, overall survival was 88. 6 % ± 3. 1 %, freedom from reintervention was 95. 3 % ± 1. 7 %, and freedom from late recurrent moderate mitral regurgitation (> 2 +) was 90. 2 % ± 3. 1 %ConclusionsProvided that the fundamental principles of mitral valve reconstruction are respected, the surgical techniques are highly reproducible with good long-term results, similar to those published during the pioneering phase of this surgery...|$|E

40|$|The {{mitral valve}} {{apparatus}} {{is a complex}} structure that incor-porates the leaflets, chordae tendinae, papillary muscles, annulus, and left ventricle (LV) in its function.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The use of {{artificial}} chordae techniques {{has increased the}} number of mitral valve lesions which are amenable to repair. Artificial chordae can be adapted {{for a wide range of}} mitral valve pathologies including restricting the motion of overly mobile ‘floppy’ <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> leaflets, replacing diseased chordae and improving coaptation in degenerative disease. There is continuing concern about the long-term performance {{of artificial}} chordae, which become endothelialized over time and may exhibit complications during the early or late follow-up period. METHODS: To address these issues, we reviewed the literature and extracted 17 papers reporting outcomes following artificial chordae re-placement. We discuss the evidence of the effect of artificial chordae on mortality, morbidity and valve performance as measured by echocardiography and complications related to the chordae. We discuss in detail studies comparing artificial chordae with more widely used quadrangular resection techniques. RESULTS: In general, outcomes with respect to mortality, morbidity, rates of reoperation, long-term function and complications of artificial chordae implantation are excellent in a range of pathological settings and in both children and adults. These results are comparable with classical Carpentier techniques and there is some evidence that chordal replacement techniques can in some respects improve the risk– benefit ratio for outcomes compared with the classical Carpentier techniques.

40|$|Myxomatous mitral-valve {{prolapse}} (MMVP), {{also called}} <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease,</b> {{is a common}} cardiac abnormality and affects up to 5 % of the population. It is characterized by an excess of tissue that leads to billowing of the mitral leaflets, sometimes complicated by prolapse. Typical histological findings include myxomatous degeneration and degradation of collagen and elastin. Previous reports have proposed an autosomal dominant inheritance of the trait, with age- and sex-dependent expression. By systematic echocardiographic screening of the first-degree relatives of 17 patients who underwent mitral-valve repair, we have identified four pedigrees showing such an inheritance. Genomewide linkage analysis of the most informative pedigree (24 individuals, three generations) showed a significant linkage for markers mapping to chromosome 16 p, with a two-point maximum LOD score for D 16 S 3068 (Zmax= 3. 30 at θ= 0). Linkage to D 16 S 3068 was confirmed in a second family (Zmax= 2. 02 at θ= 0) but was excluded for the two remaining families, thus demonstrating the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Multipoint linkage analysis performed, with nine additional markers, on the two families with linkage gave maximum multipoint LOD scores of 5. 45 and 5. 68 for D 16 S 3133, according to a conservative and a stringent model, respectively. Haplotype analysis defined a 5 -cM minimal MMVP- 1 locus between D 16 S 3068 (16 p 11. 2) and D 16 S 420 (16 p 12. 1) and a 34 -cM maximal interval between D 16 S 404 and D 16 S 3068 when recombination events were taken into account only in affected individuals.

The study aim was to review the authors' experience with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), using a standardized technique for length adjustment, and to analyze the long-term results in patients who underwent mitral valve repair. METHODS: A total of 111 patients (mean age 56. 2 +/- 16. 1 years) underwent mitral valve repair with PTFE neochordae, {{in addition to a}} variety of other surgical procedures. Etiologies were degenerative in 82 patients (73. 9 %), <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> in 13 (11. 7 %), rheumatic in 10 (9 %), and infection in six (5. 4 %). Prolapse of the anterior leaflet was present in 78 patients (70. 3 %), of the posterior leaflet in 15 (13. 5 %), a bileaflet prolapse was present in 12 (10. 8 %), and a commissural prolapse in six (5. 4 %). In all cases the anterior annulus was used as the reference level in order to assess the appropriate length of the PTFE neochordae. RESULTS: The mean number of PTFE neochordae used was 6 +/- 4 per patient. In-hospital mortality was 1. 8 % (n = 2); mean follow up was 36. 8 +/- 25. 6 months (range: 12 - 94 months). There were no late deaths.

40|$|Mitral valve {{prolapse}} (MVP) by <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> {{is recognized}} a genetic disease. Fibro-elastic deficiency (FED) -MVP {{is considered a}} pure degenerative condition. FLNA, the first gene involved in MVP, encodes for Filamin-A, a cytoskeleton associated protein. It interacts with a protein named Filgap, encoded by ARHGAP 24 (Chr. 4), in the mechanical transduction. We hypothesized that ARHGAP 24 mutations could elicit MVP with same pathway. Four probands with ARHGAP 24 mutations were identified among 96 MVP. By a familial echocardiographic screening we enrolled 19 adults of whom 13 had an ARHGAP 24 mutation. The mutated group was matched with a control group of 39 healthy adults. Anterior (AML) and posterior (PML) mitral leaflets length and thickness were measured. The coaptation point position was the ratio of coaptation height on the systolic annulus diameter. MVP (displacement> 2 mm above the annulus line), minimal systolic displacement (MSD, displacement< 2 mm) and abnormal antero-posterior coaptation position (AAC, ratio< 60 %) were assessed. The conjunction of MSD and AAC defines a MVP prodromal form (MVP-prod). There {{was no difference between}} the two groups on baseline characteristics. Leaflets were thin in the mutated group (PML: 2. 7 ± 1 vs 2. 2 ± 0. 5 mm in control, P= 0. 21, AML: 2. 5 ± 0. 9 vs 2. 1 ± 0. 4 mm, P= 0. 25), as reported in FEDMVP. Only the PML was elongated (8. 2 ± 1. 6 vs 6. 0 ± 1. 2 mm/m 2, P= 0. 0003) in the mutated group, leading to an anterior displacement of the coaptation point (51 ± 11 vs 66 ± 7 %, P= 0. 0003). Abnormal mitral phenotype (70 % of MVP, 23 % of MVP prod) and mitral regurgitation (93 vs 38 %, P= 0. 0007) were frequent in the mutated group. Two probands were operated for severe MR related to chordal rupture; histological examination confirmed the leaflets thinness. ARHGAP 24 is the first gene for autosomal dominant inherited MVP.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Repair of the prolapsing {{anterior}} leaflet (AML) in degenerative {{mitral valve}} disease is more demanding {{than that of}} the posterior leaflet. We reviewed our experience in the past eight years, to examine the safety, efficacy and stability of various repair artifices. METHODS: Between January 1989 and December 1997, 102 patients (mean age 64 years; range: 26 - 86 years) with mitral regurgitation (MR) due to prolapse of the anterior or both mitral leaflets underwent mitral valve repair. Sixty-six patients were in NYHA class > or =III, and 94 had MR grade >II. Acute endocarditis was present in 12 patients and <b>Barlow</b> <b>disease</b> in 16. Surgical techniques consisted of chordal shortening (n = 36), chordal transposition (n = 16), papillary muscle shortening or plication (n = 10), flip-over (n = 20) and artificial chordae implantation (n = 20). RESULTS: There was no early mortality; one patient required early mitral valve replacement (MVR) for late-appearing systolic anterior motion, and one patient benefited from a successful re-repair on day 8 for partial posterior leaflet desinsertion. Mean follow up was 30 months (range: 3 - 92 months); there were four late deaths (two valve-related cerebrovascular accidents); two patients required re-repair (one after three months for prosthetic ring thrombosis, and one after 10 months for rupture of shortened chordae (corrected by flip-over)). Five patients had MVR between four and 32 months later: one for mitral stenosis due to posterior leaflet calcification, and four for recurrent MR due to the rupture of shortened chordae (n = 3) or plicated papillary muscle (n = 1). One patient suffered bacterial endocarditis which was treated medically. Of the 92 remaining patients with valve repair, 81 are currently asymptomatic, five are in NYHA class II and four in class III. Transesophageal echocardiographic restudy (n = 76) at a mean of 30 months after surgery revealed no MR in 68 patients, and MR of grade <II in three.

40|$|Background. Barlow’s {{mitral valve}} (MV) disease re- mains a {{surgical}} challenge. We compared short- and medium-term outcomes of neochordal (“loop”) versus edge-to-edge (“Alfieri”) minimally invasive MV repair {{in patients with}} <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods. From January 2009 to April 2014, 123 consecutive patients with <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease</b> (defined as bileaflet billowing or prolapse [or both], excessive leaflet tissue, and annular dilatation with or without calcifica- tion) underwent minimally invasive MV operations for severe mitral regurgitation (MR) at our institution. Three patients (2. 4 %) underwent MV replacement {{during the study period}} and were excluded from subsequent anal- ysis. The loop MV repair technique was used in 68 pa- tients (55. 3 %) and an edge-to-edge repair was performed in 44 patients (35. 8 %). Patients who underwent a combi- nation of these 2 techniques (n [8 [6. 5 %]) were excluded. The median age was 48 years, and 62. 5 % of patients were men. Concomitant procedures included closure of a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect (n [19), tricuspid valve repair (n [5), and atrial fibril- lation ablation (n [15). Follow-up was performed 24. 7 ± 17 months postoperatively and was 98 % complete. Results. No deaths occurred perioperatively or during follow-up. Aortic cross-clamp time (64. 1 ± 17. 6 minutes versus 95. 9 ± 29. 5 minutes) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (110. 0 ± 24. 2 minutes versus 146. 4 ± 39. 1 mi- nutes) were significantly shorter (p < 0. 001) in patients who received edge-to-edge repair. Although patients who underwent edge-to-edge repair received a larger annulo- plasty ring (38. 6 ± 1. 5 mm versus 35. 8 ± 2. 7 mm; p < 0. 001), the early postoperative resting mean gradients were higher(3. 3 ± 1. 2 mmHgversus 2. 6 ± 1. 2 mmHg;p[0. 007) and the mitral orifice area tended to be smaller in this group (2. 8 ± 0. 7 cm 2 versus 3. 0 ± 0. 7 cm 2; p [0. 06). The amount of residual MR was similar between groups (0. 3 ± 0. 6 versus 0. 6 ± 1. 0 for edge-to-edge versus loop procedures, respectively; p [0. 08). More than mild MR requiring early MV reoperation was present in 3 patients who underwent loop procedures (4. 4 %) and in no patients who had edge-to-edge procedures (p [0. 51). During follow-up, 2 patients (1 in each group) required MV replacement for severe MR. The 4 -year freedom from MV reoperation was 92. 8 % ± 5. 0 % in the Alfieri group compared with 90. 9 % ± 4. 6 % in the loop group (p [0. 94). Conclusions. Minimally invasive MV repair can be accomplished with excellent early and medium-term outcomes in patients with <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease.</b> The edge- to-edge (Alfieri) repair can be performed with reduced operative times when compared with the loop technique, but it results in mildly increased transvalvular gradients and mildly decreased valve opening areas without any difference in residual MR...|$|R

40|$|Scurvy {{which is}} known to be an extinct entity but still specks of this disease still {{persists}} {{in various parts of the}} world which goes with the famous saying that says “history often repeats. ” Scurvy is sometimes referred to as <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease,</b> named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it. Scurvy is basically a disease that is known to occur because of inadequate supply of vitamin C to the body. To diagnose this disease without undergoing expensive investigations, history taking has been proven to be a powerful tool. We present a case of 2 -year-old patient visiting our department with bleeding gums, joint pain, and weakness. Clinical data along with a signifi cant improvement after administering vitamin C supplement confi rms the diagnosis. Hence, question remains still unanswered that whether and had to be carried to the OPD. His mother revealed history of severe pain and scurvy still persists or no...|$|R
40|$|A 54 -year-old man {{referred}} to our center with <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease</b> and severe mitral regurgitation. He had atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm, with a mildly enlarged left atrium (LA). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed no clot in the LA and LA appendage; {{there was only}} mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LA appendage. The patient underwent mitral valve repair and the Maze operation, during which the LA appendage was ligated with the double suture technique. He was discharged from the hospital in good condition and in sinus rhythm. He was recommended Warfarin and PT control. One month later, he returned with the complaint of vision loss twice in the left eye each time for a few seconds. The AF rhythm had returned. TEE demonstrated a fresh and mobile thrombus entrapped in the LA appendage with a small portion in the LA (Figures 1 and 2). Laboratory tests showed therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). The patient refused re- operation.   Plavix was added to his medication, and he was discharged. </p...|$|R
40|$|PERHAPS {{the best}} way I can join in a tribute to Joseph Hersey Pratt— the {{clinical}} physician^—is to offer a sketch of another clinical physician, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, with some sidelights on contemporary medical London when I was a student there half a century ago. The names of great physicians have often been linked by their admirers with recently recognized forms of disease, and also with favourite prescriptions—the least of their achievements. Samuel Jones Gee {{is an example of}} this eponymous association. Fifty years ago what is now known as posterior basal meningitis or, as Still showed in 1898, chronic meningococcal menin-gitis of infants was colloquially known in London as " Gee and <b>Barlow's</b> <b>disease</b> " after their account in 1878 of cervical opisthotonos in infants which in his aphorisms Gee later summarized as follows: " not a tuberculous affec-tion; it is due to a chronic meningitis, of the medulla. It may, however, occur as a symptom in tuberculous affections of this region. " In 1899 Sir Thomas Barlow (1845 -) and David Bridge Lees (1846 - 1915) gav...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of annuloplasty systems {{available}} now. However, controversy concerning the choice of annuloplasty device persists. We analyzed our preliminary experience in mitral valve repair using the Cosgrove–Edwards annuloplasty ring. To correct their mitral insufficiency (MI), 118 consecutive patients (mean age, 60. 4 ^ 15. 1 years) underwent mitral repair using this annuloplasty device. NYHA functional class 3 or 4 were present in 86. 4 %. Degenerative heart disease was the cause of MI in 36. 6 % of the patients, ischemic heart disease in 25. 4 %, <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease</b> in 17. 8 %, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 7. 6 %. Mitral surgical procedures included quadrangular resection and sliding of the posterior leaflet, posterior leaflet decalcification, anterior leaflet repair, the edge-to-edge technique, and chordal repair. Mean follow-up was 25. 1 ^ 14. 0 months. There were four in-hospital non-valve-related cardiac deaths, and one in-hospital non-cardiac death. No cases of systolic anterior motion were observed. NYHA functional class improved from 3. 3 ^ 0. 7, before repair, to 1. 3 ^ 0. 6, at follow-up (P 0 : 00012), MI from 3. 6 ^ 0. 5 to 0. 5 ^ 0. 6 (P 0 : 0096), and left ventricular ejection fraction from 52. 0 ^ 12. 2 % to 55. 4 ^ 12. 0 % (P 0 : 044). Three-year actuarial rates of survival, freedom from thromboembolism, and freedom from mitral reoperation were 96. 9, 97. 9, and 96. 4 %, respectively. The Cosgrove–Edwards annuloplasty ring does not combine with systolic anterior motion. It minimizes MI secondary to all causes, and preserves left ventricular function...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveAnterior leaflet {{prolapse}} {{is still}} a challenge. Various techniques have been described, but very little is known of the long-term outcome. We describe the long-term results of papillary muscle repositioning, with up to 15 years’ follow-up. MethodsFrom 1989 through 2005, 120 patients with anterior leaflet prolapse (97 bileaflet and 23 isolated anterior leaflet) were treated with papillary muscle repositioning when chordae were elongated. All patients had severe mitral regurgitation. The mean left ventricular end-systolic diameter on echocardiography was 39. 4 ± 5. 2 mm. The predominant cause was degenerative: dystrophic disease in 62 and <b>Barlow’s</b> <b>disease</b> in 43. Papillary muscle repositioning was carried out on the posterior papillary muscle in 92. 5 % and on the anterior papillary muscle in 31. 7 %. A ring annuloplasty was performed in 117 cases. Fifty-seven (47. 5 %) patients had a tricuspid annuloplasty. ResultsThere were no in-hospital deaths or patients lost to follow-up. Mean follow-up was 6. 3 ± 0. 4 years (maximum, 15. 6 years). Cumulative actuarial survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 97. 2 %, 94. 1 %, and 81. 4 %, respectively. Two (1. 7 %) patients required reoperation at 1 and 5 years after repair. No significant risk factor was identified for late mortality or reoperation. At the latest assessment, 88 (73. 3 %) patients were asymptomatic. Echocardiography showed no or trivial mitral regurgitation in 89 (74. 2 %) patients, mild mitral regurgitation in 8 patients, and moderate mitral regurgitation in 9 patients. ConclusionsAnterior leaflet prolapse caused by elongated chordae can always be addressed with papillary muscle repositioning. Results indicate {{that it is a}} safe and durable technique, providing good long-term results in the management of degenerative pathology of the anterior leaflet...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{results of}} mitral repair for complex Barlow valves are {{adequate}} and support earlier intervention. It is unknown whether {{these results are}} reproducible {{in the context of}} minimally invasive surgery via right minithoracotomy. MethodsWe randomized patients with <b>Barlow</b> mitral <b>disease</b> (bileaflet prolapse) to have conventional open repair via median sternotomy (MS group) or minimally invasive (MI group) repair. Repair was done using polytetrafluoroethylene chordal reimplantation for both leaflets. In the MI group, we adopted right minithoracotomy, peripheral cannulation, external aortic clamping, and surgery under direct vision. ResultsBoth groups comprised 70 patients. The operative and the cardiopulmonary bypass times were significantly longer in the MI group (P = . 003 and P = . 012). Mitral repair was successful in 98. 5 % MI patients and 100 % MS patients. Operative mortality was comparable. The mean mechanical ventilation time, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay were lower in the MI group (P = . 014, P =. 02, and P = . 03,). Mean pain score was lower in the MI group at postoperative days 2 and 4. At follow-up, the freedom from moderate (2 +) or severe (3 + or 4 +) mitral regurgitation was 98 % versus 97 % (P = . 9). Two patients underwent reoperation (1 in each group) for late failure of repair. The Kaplan–Meier analysis confirmed these results. ConclusionsOur data indicate that the optimal standard-of-care results of mitral repair for complex <b>disease</b> (<b>Barlow)</b> are reproducible in the minimally invasive settings through right minithoracotomy and direct vision. The minimally invasive technique can be proposed for complex mitral disease and early referral of these patients can be encouraged...|$|R
