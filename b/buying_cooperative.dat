In the early 1970 s, farmers and community members in several European countries, who were concerned about the industrialization of their food system, started the Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model as we know it. Farmers were losing their market share and their ability to produce diversified crops. CSA proved to support family farms, provide healthy, fresh food and promote a sense of community land stewardship. Today, farmers and consumers in the United States face similar challenges and CSAs offer similar opportunities. In 1986, two farms in the eastern United States began CSAs based on the European model. More than 1, 500 CSA farms exist today across the United States...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the {{literature}} have suggested {{a change in the}} relative importance of the international dimension in the innovation process. International companies need to sense new market and technology trends worldwide, and respond to them adequately through generating new ideas which are then implemented around the world. This has important implications for the role of subsidiaries in global innovative strategies and consequent international know-how flows. This paper tries to empirically assess how technology flows are structured in international firms, using Belgian company data from the Eurostat Community Innovation Survey. While all types of international firms, including subsidiaries, are found to be more innovation active than local firms, companies which are part of an international group, as affiliates but especially as headquarters, have the widest innovation strategy, relying on internal as well as external sources. These external sources are located nationally as well as internationally, and are accessed through <b>buying</b> and <b>cooperative</b> strategies. In addition, internal transfers and intra-group cooperation are quite pervasive in these companies, although the evidence for transfers from headquarters to subsidiaries is stronger than for the reverse flow from subsidiaries to headquarters. The analysis further suggests the importance of reciprocity in know-how flows, through the importance of cooperative R&D agreements which relies on mutual exchange, and the complementary occurrence of selling and buying technology. An important implication for the host economy is that transfers to the local economy are more likely to come from subsidiaries that are integrated into the MNEs innovation process. Subsidiaries which are independent from the group's innovative process, are found to be less integrated with the local economy as well. Companies; International; Manufacturing; Strategy;...|$|R
40|$|Köpet av en bostadsrätt är för de flesta människor den största investering i deras liv. Som bostadsrättsinnehavare förvaltas huset och fastigheten av en bostadsrättsförening. För att finansiera driften och underhållet tar föreningen ut en avgift från bostadsrättsinnehavaren, en månadsavgift. Månadsavgiften, tillsammans med eventuella räntekostnader som uppstår om finansiering skett genom lån, utgör den sammanlagda boendekostnaden för bostadsrättsinnehavaren. Därför bör det vara av stor vikt att köparen försäkrar sig om att föreningen har god ekonomi och har skötts på ett bra sätt, för att undvika stora och oväntade höjningar av månadsavgiften vilket medför ökade boendekostnader. Den här uppsatsen syftar till att undersöka i vilken omfattning aktörer på bostadsmarknaden använder årsredovisningen som beslutsunderlag vid köpet av bostadsrätt samt att ge förslag på hur man kan göra årsredovisningen mer lättläst och förståelig. Data insamlades genom fastighetsekonomisk facklitteratur, myndigheter och organisationer som är verksamma inom området. Frågeställningarna ovan besvarades genom empiriska undersökningar i form av enkäter och intervjuer samt en jämförelsestudie av tre stycken bostadsrättsföreningar i Stockholms innerstad. Resultaten från enkäterna indikerade på att endast de med ekonomisk utbildning använde sig av och kunde tolka årsredovisningarna inför köpet av sin bostadsrätt. I de mer diskuterande intervjuerna framgick att även de med ekonomisk utbildning saknade kunskaperna som krävdes för att analysera föreningarnas årsredovisning på djupet, även om de hade större förståelse än de utan ekonomisk utbildning. Jämförelsestudien illustrerade hur nyckeltal kan användas för att analysera en bostadsrättsförenings ekonomiska status. Slutsatsen är att aktörer på bostadsrättsmarknaden utan ekonomisk utbildning inte använder sig av årsredovisningen som beslutsunderlag vid köp av bostadsrätter. De med ekonomisk utbildning använder sig av föreningens årsredovisning men saknar förmågan att analysera föreningens ekonomi på djupet. Uppsatsen föreslår att de behandlade nyckeltalen med tillhörande förklarande text bör presenteras i varje årsredovisning, förslagsvis under förvaltningsberättelsen. Det skulle medföra att samtliga aktörer på bostadsrättsmarknaden kan analysera föreningens ekonomi på djupet och försäkra sig om att göra ett välgrundat köp. The {{purchase}} of a cooperative apartment is for most people the largest venture in their life. The housing cooperative {{is responsible for the}} running expenses and maintenance of the property and the house. To finance these costs, the owner of the cooperative apartment has to pay a monthly fee.

Therefore it should be of importance to analyze the economic status of the housing cooperation prior the purchase. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the extent to which buyers use the annual reports of the housing cooperatives as decision-making material for the purchase, and provide suggestions on how to make the annual report more readable and understandable. Data were collected by literature, government agencies and other organizations in the real estate economic field.

5000|$|The {{household}} name Four Square {{emerged in the}} 1920s out of the Foodstuffs grocery buying co-operative. Foodstuffs’ founder, Mr J Heaton Barker, became concerned at {{the activities of the}} grocery chain stores of the day that were making life very difficult for independent grocers in Auckland. On 6 July 1922, Heaton Barker called together members of the Auckland Master Grocers Association and discussed their plans for forming a <b>cooperative</b> <b>buying</b> group of independent grocers. On 1 April 1925, this buying group registered a company called Foodstuffs Ltd, which was the first of three regional cooperatives based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The name Four Square emerged when Mr Barker, while talking on the telephone to one of the buying group members on 4 July 1924, drew a square around the 4 of the date on his calendar. He immediately realised he had a suitable name for the buying group, stating that [...] "they would stand ’Four Square’ to all the winds that blew". By the end of 1924 products were appearing under the Four Square name, and by 1929, discussions were underway on the use of a common branding on stores. Early versions of the Four Square sign were produced in the form of red and gold hand painted glass panels for display in members’ stores. In February 1948, New Zealand's first self-service grocery store was opened in Onehunga by Phil Barker (the son of the founder of the group) and Ray McGregor. This soon became the norm for grocery retailing.|$|R
40|$|B 2 B is a {{business-to-business}} {{market place}} that uses internet to connect each other business. It {{has gotten a}} lot more attention recently in Japan {{as well as in}} the U. S. because it is possible to lower the procurement costs of raw material and accomplish several procompetitive effects such as communication efficiencies. However, in spite of these pro transactional natures of B 2 B, it could also cause anticompetitive effects on market place. In other words, the fact that buyers communicate easily through the internet means they could easily form a cartel or conclude an agreement to restrain the free competition and it is easy to detect deviation from those agreements. There must have been buyers’ anticompetitive agreements long before B 2 B and these agreements were concluded without using the internet-based communication. However, the potential for B 2 B to aid buyers’ agreements is worth to get attention. Despite this importance, there have been little cases and studies concerning buyers’ agreement even in the U. S. and, in Japan, there have been neither cases nor the detail examination by the governmental agencies about buyers’ anticompetitive agreements. This is because traditionally sellers have had a strong bargaining power over purchasers. Therefore, little attention has been focused on anticompetitive effects which might be caused by buyers’ agreements. The internet, however, drastically changed the bargaining power balance between sellers and purchasers. It has made possible for purchasers to form a cartel to decrease the input purchased and lower the price through the web-based communication. The paper examines the competitive aspects of B 2 B from the view point of the antitrust law and analyzes oligopsony, that is, buyers’ collusion to exercise their market power to decrease the price of the products they are going to buy from suppliers by depressing the quantity of input purchased artificially. Drawing on microeconomic theory and antitrust law, the interdisciplinary work in the paper explores the implications of oligopsony, or buying power, for antitrust policy. The paper offers a systematic treatment of the topic, demonstrating that whether or not oligopsony power exists because of a dominant buyer or collusion among buyers, it can cause social welfare losses analogous to those occasioned by monopoly. The paper also discusses bilateral monopoly and offers a principled basis for distinguishing between socially desirable and undesirable <b>cooperative</b> <b>buying.</b> In addition, the paper analyzes the legal response to an oligopsony agreement in the U. S. as well as in Japan in order to examine how an oligopsony agreement should be treated. Further, the paper discusses tangential facts and circumstantial evidence to find an oligopsony agreement, because, in the antitrust practice, whether or not it is possible to find an agreement is sometimes the decisive point. The paper tries to provide the practical precepts to find an agreement which would be concluded on B 2 B...|$|R
