Initially, between 1981-1985, the band was like a holiday hobby for the members who were all students. In 1985 they begun to curtain raise for then big music performers before they decided to begin recording some of their compositions in 1986. Werrason's musical ability begun to show very early in Wenge Musica BCBG 4x4. In 1988, the band released an album, <b>Bouger</b> <b>Bouger</b> that topped charts in Congo for three years and propelled Werrason and his friends to national fame. In this five song album <b>Bouger</b> <b>Bouger</b> Werrason was credited with composing the song [...] "Nicky D". The album had a theme chant called [...] "mulolo", which was elected Song of the Year, but which until today it is not clear who between Werrason and JB Mpiana, composed though each of the two claim it was their original idea. In 1991 the group produced another master class titled'Kin e Bouge' an album that was voted 'Album of the Year 1991'. In it Werrason composed the song [...] "Kaskin". However 1993 was the year that Werrason gained international recognition when he composed the song"Kala Yi Boeing", which was also the title of the group album, an album which received international acclaim. For ten years (between 1987 and 1997) the band enjoyed incredible success throughout Africa and Europe. As the deputy band leader of Wenge Musica 4x4 Tout Terrain Bon Chic Bon Genre, Werrason was credited with composition of key beats that took the African music scene by storm, bringing in great talents like Ferre Gola to the band and also his energy during live performances.|$|E

30|$|The gravity anomaly map, which {{presents}} the main geophysical data, {{is used to}} identify lineaments. We utilize the upward continuation map which {{is applied to the}} <b>Bouger</b> anomaly map to identify the effects of the bodies at different depths and dimensions to constrain better the likely fault systems. In this study, HT is used to extract lineaments after upward continuation of the Bouguer gravity data to 5 km. With the Hough transform, the lineaments (SL) obtained from the surface gravity values (<b>Bouger</b> anomaly map) are superimposed with the lineaments (SSL) obtained from the 5 -km-upward continuation map to check whether the structures extend deeper in the crust. Also, taking into consideration the previous studies, the lineaments are determined manually (ML). In {{the northern part of the}} study area the ML 1, in the central part ML 7, in the southern part ML 5, ML 8, and ML 9, lineaments are found to extend from the surface to the deeper part downward, but the rest of the lineaments continue partially downward.|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} for calculating {{spectral}} irradiance from standard meteorological inputs is presented, named ASPIRE (All-sky SPectral IRadiancE). The <b>Bouger</b> law-based transmittance approach for modelling clear-sky spectra has been augmented with an extended empirical process {{to account for}} variation with cloud cover. Unlike previous clear-sky models, this new tool separates the effects of air mass from cloud cover within the clearness index by comparing measured solar spectra {{with the results of}} clear-sky modelling. The intended use of the ASPIRE model is to allow investigation of spectral effects on PV device output under realistic operating conditions, for which measured spectral irradiance data is rarely available. These investigations are important to refine the energy yield calculations for PV systems operating under seasonally varying spectra, especially wide band gap materials...|$|E
