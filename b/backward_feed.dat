Each effect in the process is represented {{by a number of}} variables which are related by the energy and material balance equations for the feed, product and liquor flow. In the present study dynamic equations are being written for the MEE system for a Paper Industry. In this study a generalized model is given which could be applied to any number of effects in the MEE system with simple modifications it could also be applied for Forward Feed, <b>Backward</b> <b>Feed</b> {{as well as for the}} Mixed Feed. For such situation basic equations for an effect will be same but the equations for the parameters like density, boiling point elevation and specific heat etc. should be changed and then the model can be used for the other type of evaporator also...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{wide range}} of {{mathematical}} models for multiple effect evaporators in process industry including paper industry are well {{reported in the literature}} but not so extensive work on the dynamic behavior of MEE system is available in the literature. In the present study dynamic behavior of multi-effect evaporator system of a paper industry is obtained by disturbing the feed flow rate, feed concentration, live steam temperature and feed temperature. For this purpose an unsteady-state model for the multi-effect evaporator system is developed. Each effect in the process is represented by a number of variables which are related by the energy and material balance equations for the feed, product and vapor flow. A generalized mathematical model which could be applied to any number of effects and all kinds of feeding arrangements like forward feed, <b>backward</b> <b>feed,</b> mixed feed and spilt feed in the MEE system with simple modifications was finally obtained. Finally model for mixed feed sextuple effect falling film evaporators system was solved using MATLAB. For the steady state and dynamic simulation the ‘fsolve’ and ‘ode 45 ’ solvers in MATLAB source code is used respectively...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{investigations}} on {{thermal properties}} of multieffect distillation (MED) are presented to approach lower capital costs and more distillated products. A mathematical model, {{based on the}} energy and mass balance, is developed to (i) evaluate the influences of variations in key parameters (effect numbers, evaporation temperature in last effect, and feed salinity) on steam consumption, gained output ratio (GOR), and total heat transfer areas of MED and (ii) compare two operation modes (<b>backward</b> <b>feed</b> (BF) and forward feed (FF) systems). The result {{in the first part}} indicated that GOR and total heat transfer areas increased with the effect numbers. Also, higher effect numbers result {{in the fact that the}} evaporation temperature in last effect has slight influence on GOR, while it influences the total heat transfer areas remarkably. In addition, an increase of feed salinity promotes the total heat transfer areas but reduces GOR. The analyses in the second part indicate that GOR and total heat transfer areas of BF system are higher than those in FF system. One thing to be aware of is that the changes of steam consumption can be omitted, considering that it shows an opposite trend to GOR...|$|E

Rather, it applies cyclic downward pressure onto the material onto the feed dogs, in time with the feed dogs, so as to increase the friction between layers of the material. The increased friction reduces the slipping of lower layers (which contact the feed dogs) versus the upper layers (which tend to be held in place by the presser foot).|$|R

The final concentrate is collected in the hottest effect, which provides an advantage in that the product is highly viscous in the last stages, and so the heat transfer is better. Since some years there are also in operation multiple-effect vacuum evaporators with heat pump, well known to be energetically and technically more effective than systems with mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) because due to the lower boiling temperature they can handle highly corrosive liquids or which may form incrustations.|$|R

40|$|All networks, {{including}} biological networks, computer networks, {{social networks}} and {{more can be}} represented as graphs, which include {{a number of small}} module such as subgraph, also called as network motifs. Network motifs are subgraph which recur themselves in a specific network or different networks. In biological networks, these network motifs plays very important role to identify diseases in human beings. In this paper we have developed a module to identify common network motifs types from cancer pathways and Signal Transduction Networks (STNs). It also identifies the topological behaviors of cancer networks and STNs. In this study, we have implemented five motif algorithms such as Auto-Regulation Loop (ARL), <b>Feed</b> <b>Backward</b> Loop (FBL), <b>Feed</b> Forward Loop (FFL), Single-Input Motif (SIM) and Bi-fan. These algorithms gives correct results in terms of network motifs for human cancer and STNs. Finding network motifs by using online tool is limited to three nodes, but our proposed work provides facility to find network motifs up to any number of nodes. We applied five motif algorithms to human cancer networks and Signal Transduction Networks (STNs) which are collected from KEGG database as a result we got ”Frequent Occurrences of Network Motifs (FONMs) ”. These FONMs acts as a references for an oncologist in order to find type of cancer in human being...|$|R
40|$|Organizational {{security}} involves assuring data confidentiality, {{integrity and}} availability. These security principles have been captured by standards like ISO 17799 [1] which provides guidelines in {{the format of}} objectives to be achieved and controls to be implemented. Each organization interprets and selects applicable controls according to their culture, infrastructure and business to define its security policies. Cobit [2] provides orientations for enterprise security governance and considers control over information and technology (IT) as a core factor for the alignment between business objectives, IT goals and IT processes. In the format of control objectives Cobit aims to assure that i) ”business objectives are achieved, undesired events are prevented or detected and corrected”, ii) {{a measure of the}} security level and improvements required are in place. It is again up to individual organizations to define their overall security policies based on the Cobit best practices. However, security policies must be somehow enforced as these standards are at the paperwork level of security. This means that security policies have to be translated or refined to different domains either by means of human expertise or by means of tools. I assume that this refinement process is already in place and focus on the three key points of control defined by Cobit: i) business objectives enforced, ii) events monitored and iii) measures integrating objectives and events implemented. The IPID 1 project [3] aims to link these three factors by establishing a feed forward management loop and a <b>feed</b> <b>backward</b> compliance loop. The latter loop is the main focus of my research since it is absent in large organizations while, as prescribed by Cobit, it represents a key element of IT governance. This paper claims that goal-driven requirements which are subject to continuous evolution when triggered by correlated security events (detected by several security devices) achieve the <b>feed</b> <b>backward</b> loop. In order to meet this claim I propose: 1. A method to formalize security policies as goal-driven requirements. This formalism should also allow the formalization of events in a comparable way to facilitate the relationship between security policies and events. 2. A model of the policy evolution process. 3. A method to correlate events and extract information to be used as triggers to the evolution process. 4. A method to actually trigger the evolution process. The first, third and fourth items of our approach are design problems. Thus, I will focus on the analysis of related work in the literature to either extract the requirements of the solution and identify opportunities to reuse existing approaches. After this initial stage, I will propose a framework which incorporates each of these modules as building blocks. The second item, however, is a knowledge problem and a case study will be used as an exploratory method [4] to provide insights about the state-of-affairs of the evolution process in the real world. I believe that currently, this process is not triggered by security events. Therefore, the model to be built is prescriptive rather than a descriptive model of the security policy evolution process...|$|R
40|$|A {{relevant}} standard adoption for Laboratory Automation Control is currently developed within an OMG (Object Management Group) {{to improve the}} quality and utility of software and information systems used in Life Sciences Research by using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and the Object Management Architecture (OMA). The scope of this approach covers many aspects related to life sciences research, including genomics, bioinformatics, genetics, structural biology or computational molecular biology. An emerging new industry must focus on high end information technology solution to enable high quality process control, data acquisition, data feed forward and <b>feed</b> <b>backward</b> for process optimization. The deve loped software must conform to existing standards such as GLP, GMP, GAMP, FDA, ISO 9000 etc. Many of the expected advantages are already foreseeable. The report encourages other companies to make the paradigm shift to the new technologies described herein. An existing la boratory production system requires different processing ways and material handling control systems. In order to have a competitive advantage in the strongly contested laboratory automation market some automation operations ("Business Objects") need highly labor-configurated or even proprietarily implemented information technology (IT) solutions. The suggested approach is a state of the art IT architecture with a forward-looking, easy expandable framework. This framework should be able to manage nowadays company-internal IT projects, fulfilling both a modern IT architecture with prospects for the future and projects which are visible at a glance. Such a framework will guarantee the best balance between the integration effort of buyable and self developed ("high end") IT solutions...|$|R
40|$|Background. Syngnathid fishes produce {{three kinds}} of sounds, named click, growl and purr. These sounds are {{generated}} by different mechanisms to give a consistent signal pattern or signature which is believed {{to play a role}} in intraspecific and interspecific communication. Commonly known sounds are produced when the fish feeds (click, purr) or is under duress (growl). While there are more acoustic studies on seahorses, pipefishes have not received much attention. Here we document the differences in feeding click signals between three species of pipefishes and relate them to cranial morphology and kinesis, or the sound-producing mechanism. Methods. The feeding clicks of two species of freshwater pipefishes, Doryichthys martensii and Doryichthys deokhathoides and one species of estuarine pipefish, Syngnathoides biaculeatus, were recorded by a hydrophone in acoustic dampened tanks. The acoustic signals were analysed using time-scale distribution (or scalogram) based on wavelet transform. A detailed time-varying analysis of the spectral contents of the localized acoustic signal was obtained by jointly interpreting the oscillogram, scalogram and power spectrum. The heads of both Doryichthys species were prepared for microtomographical scans which were analysed using a 3 D imaging software. Additionally, the cranial bones of all three species were examined using a clearing and double-staining method for histological studies. Results. The sound characteristics of the feeding click of the pipefish is species-specific, appearing to be dependent on three bones: the supraoccipital, 1 st postcranial plate and 2 nd postcranial plate. The sounds are generated when the head of the Dorichthyes pipefishes flexes <b>backward</b> during the <b>feeding</b> strike, as the supraoccipital slides backwards, striking and pushing the 1 st postcranial plate against (and striking) the 2 nd postcranial plate. In the Syngnathoides pipefish, in the absence of the 1 st postcranial plate, the supraoccipital rubs against the 2 nd postcranial plate twice as it is pulled backward and released on the return. Cranial morphology and kinesis produce acoustic signals consistent with the bone strikes that produce sharp energy spikes (discrete or merged), or stridulations between bones that produce repeated or multimodal sinusoidal waveforms. Discussion. The variable structure of the sound-producing mechanism explains the unique acoustic signatures of the three species of pipefish. The differences in cranial bone morphology, cranial kinesis and acoustic signatures among pipefishes (and seahorses) could be attributed to independent evolution within the Syngnathidae, which warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|HIV / AIDS is {{an incurable}} disease. More than {{millions}} of people have HIV positive. However, new medications not only can slow&# 13; the progression of the infection, but also can suppress the virus, thereby restoring the body’s immune function and permitting many HIV infected individuals to lead a normal, disease-free life. Many research are going on to predict a better treatment for HIV patients, such as HIV drug prediction, drug resistance testing, predicting side effects for certain regimens etc. The prediction of regimen specification is a challenging research. Since all the patients are unique in their medical history, side effects and allergic in patricular drugs, the physician cannot treat all the patient in the same way. It is common that if a patient with set of certain sympotms consult the physician, the patient may get different opinions&# 13; regarding the type of the underlying disease. A physician judegement is {{an important role in}} this regard. Recent research shows that computational intelligence has been widely used on medical diagonosis to solve complex problem by developing decision support system with the application of Neural Network algorithms. Neural Network is very good area to practice most of the medical problems. It has many algorithms for classification, prediction, image processing etc. A proper utilization of a Neural Network technique to implement a large – scale health services research dataset {{is one of the most}} difficult areas in the Neural Network field. It is further complicated due to ill-defined and illstructured factors affecting a functional health status of HIV /AIDS patients. Many of the studies have applied Neural Network technique to classify and predict desired solution or to improve methodological aspects. In this proposed work, we have taken 300 HIV / AIDS patient’s&# 13; medical history and constructed a model to predict the appropriate regimen specification, which could help the patient to prolong their for maximum years. To construct this model we had been implemented Back Propagation Neural Network algorithm, ART 1 Network and Radial Basis Function Network. Back Propagation Neural Network algorithm is used for classification and prediction purpose and also it would work&# 13; with huge amount of data with large number of iterations. Due to its <b>feed</b> <b>backward</b> nature it could be act as better prediction algorithm. &# 13; &# 13; Similary the ART 1 Neural Network algorithm has used to classify the patients into two groups active and inactive based on their regimen&# 13; specification and the Radial Basis Neural Network has also used to prdict the regimen specification.

40|$|Ethanol, {{the common}} name for ethyl alcohol, is fuel grade alcohol that is predominately {{produced}} through the fermentation of simple carbohydrates by yeasts. In the United States, the carbohydrate feedstock {{most commonly used}} in the commercial production of ethanol is yellow dent corn (YDC). The use of ethanol in combustion engines emits less greenhouse gasses than its petroleum equivalent, and it is widely hoped that the increased substitution of petroleum by ethanol will reduce US dependence on imported oil and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Production of ethanol within the United States is expected to double, from 3. 4 billion gallons in 2004, to about seven billion gallons {{in the next five}} years. Two processes currently being utilized to produce ethanol from YDC are dry milling and wet milling. The wet mill process is more versatile than the dry mill process in that it produces a greater variety of products; starch, corn syrup, ethanol, Splenda, etc., which allows for the wet mill to better react to market conditions. However, the costs of construction and operation of a wet mill are much greater than those of a dry mill. If ethanol is the target product, then it can be produced at a lower cost and more efficiently in a dry mill plant than in a wet mill plant, under current economic conditions. Of the more than 70 US ethanol plants currently in production, only a few are of the wet mill variety. A descriptive engineering spreadsheet model (DM model) was developed to model the dry mill ethanol production process. This model was created to better understand the economics of the ethanol dry mill production process and how the profitability of dry mill plants is affected under different conditions. It was also developed to determine the economic and environmental costs and benefits of utilizing new and different technologies in the dry mill process. Specifically, this model was constructed to conduct an economic analysis for novel processes of obtaining greater alcohol yields in the dry mill process by conducting a secondary fermentation of sugars converted from lignocellulosics found in the dry mill co-product, distiller’s grains. This research is being conducted at Purdue University, Michigan State, Iowa State, USDA, and NCAUR under a grant from the US Department of Energy. The DM model is more technically precise, and more transparent, than other models of the dry mill process that have been constructed for similar purposes. The Tiffany and Eidman model (TE model) uses broad generalities of the dry mill process, based on the current state of production, to approximate the sensitivities of the process to changes in variables. The TE model parameters were well researched, but the model suffers from several drawbacks. The main limitations of this model are that the results are very sensitive to the input values chosen by the user. Unlike the DM model, complex manipulations, such as determining the effect of new technologies would require accurate parameter estimates using the TE model. The McAloon model [11]. uses highly technical engineering software (ASPEN) that acts essentially as a “black box” in the dry mill production process. This very exact model does not allow for a more general examination of the dry mill process. Changes in the production process would necessitate precise engineering plans. Similar to the TE and McAloon models, the DM model is a spreadsheet model, but unlike the McAloon model it is completely self-contained. The DM model is a <b>feed</b> <b>backward</b> model, input requirements (corn, enzymes, chemicals, utilities, etc) are calculated based on the user entered values for annual production and process parameters. The mass flow rates, in pounds per hour were then calculated and used in estimating the size, in dimension or power, of each major piece of equipment. The cost associated with each piece of major equipment was then calculated as an exponential function of its corresponding size. Total capital costs associated with a dry mill plant were then estimated using the percentage of equipment costs method [13]. It was found that the DM model estimates of the total capital costs associated with medium to large dry mill plants (those with the capacity to produce between 10 and 100 million gallons of ethanol a year) were within 5 % of total fixed costs estimated by BBI [2]. Operating costs were compared with the 2002 USDA survey results and also found to be very close [15]. A companion document, “Economic and Technical Analysis of Dry Milling: Model User’s Manual,” staff paper no 06 - 05, explains how the model is used to conduct analysis of dry milling alternatives.
