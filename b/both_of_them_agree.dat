40|$|Abstract—A key {{agreement}} protocol is {{a protocol}} whereby {{two or more}} communicating parties can agree on a key or exchange information over an open communication network {{in such a way}} that <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> on the established session keys for use in subsequent communications. Recently, several key agreement protocols based on chaotic maps are proposed. These protocols require a verification table to verify the legitimacy of a user. Since this approach clearly incurs the risk of tampering and the cost of managing the table and suffers from the stolen-verifier attack, we propose a novel key agreement protocol based on chaotic maps to enhance the security. The proposed protocol not only achieves mutual authentication without verification tables, but also allows users to anonymously interact with the server. Moreover, security of the proposed protocol is modelled and analyzed with Petri nets. Our analysis shows that the proposed protocol can successfully defend replay attacks, forgery attacks, and stolen-verifier attacks...|$|E

By employing various approaches designed by several international organisations it takes an aggregate perspective to assess both the current well-being and its sustainability into the future. All employed indicators that relate to current well-being evaluate the well-being in the Czech Republic as moderate among the OECD countries. The {{results indicate that the}} position in well-being rankings improves with the growing number of dimensions or subjective factors included in the well-being measure, mainly due to the reduction in relative importance of income dimension and higher emphasis on the multidimensionality and complexity of well-being. In the case of sustainability, large differences can be identified in evaluation stemming from Happy Planet Index and Sustainable Society Index perspective. Although <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> on unfavourable situation as regards environmental sustainability in the Czech Republic, different accent on economic area alters the final result substantially.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{focus on the}} {{experience}} of cooperation between parents, Centre for Social Work and the residential treatment institution during a child’s stay in residential care. In the theoretical part of the thesis I present characteristics and vulnerability of those families where the majority of the youth placed in residential care come from. Later on, I explain the role of involved professional services and their methods of work with family before, during and in the time of institutional stay of a child or an adolescent. I focus on the variety of ways of cooperation between parents and professional services and furthermore mention the cooperation between services themselves. The theoretical part ends with proposed amendments and the presentation of successful foreign practices in this field. In the empirical part of the thesis I focus on the study of a concrete example of the cooperation between professional services and the parent, whose child stays in residential care. The results of the qualitative research illustrate that the parent is content with the cooperation with professional services and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> that their cooperation is successful.

40|$|The {{frequent}} {{phenomena in}} the society find {{that there are many}} ex-couples who have poor communication after divorce. This causes both of couples being awkward in maintaining an effective interaction to one another. Ideally, we shall keep good communication with everyone, including with the ex (boyfriend or girlfriend). It is because we may meet the ex or even need his/her help in the future. Using a qualitative approach, this research has a purpose to describe about “Interpersonal Communication for Relationship Maintenance after Divorce”. Moreover, this research refers to a post-positivistic paradigm with applying a phenomenology method. The subjects of this research are two ex-couples as the main informants. In addition, this research applies mostly about Relational Maintenance Theory since it discusses the ways to maintain good communication with everyone and also with the ex. The result of this research shows that interpersonal communication with the ex will happen if <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> to reestablish communication after divorce. This interaction is started by having a motivation to keep in touch and to help one another even when they already became an ex-couple. Also, the ex-couple should still give attention, raise spirit, and be open to each other in order to easily create a friendship among them. Besides verbal communication which is done by texting, calling or using social media, the ex-couple also establishes non-verbal communication by dating. Dating is used to know their intimacy through getting close, having eye contact, having the touch, and showing gestures. The informants of an ex-couple who agreed to divorce will sit side by side, look at each other, and have the touch when they meet again. On the other hand, another ex-couple as the next informants who have a conflict after divorce tend to sit face to face, avoid looking at one another, and have no the touch. Nevertheless, the two ex-couples admit that they are still nervous when they meet again. In short, this research discovers that an initiative to break up a relationship can be decided by the woman or the man...|$|E
40|$|Eddy current {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) is usually {{carried out by}} exciting a time harmonic field using an inductive probe. However, a viable alternative is to use transient eddy current NDE in which a current pulse in a driver coil produces a transient field in a conductor that decays at a rate dependent on the conductivity and the permeability of the material and the coil configuration. By using transient eddy current, {{it is possible to}} estimate the properties of the conductive medium and to locate and size potential flaws from the measured probe response. The fundamental study described in this dissertation seeks to establish a theoretical understanding of the transient eddy current NDE. Compared with the Fourier transform method, the derived analytical formulations are more convenient when the transient eddy current response within a narrow time range is evaluated. The theoretical analysis provides a valuable tool to study the effect of layer thickness, location of defect, crack opening as well as the optimization of probe design;Analytical expressions have been developed to evaluate the transient response due to eddy currents in a conductive plate based on two asymptotic series. One series converges rapidly for a short time regime and the other for a long time regime and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> with the results calculated by fast Fourier transform over all the times considered.

The resulting expression has three parts; a free space term, multiple image terms and partial reflection terms. The dyadic Green 2 ̆ 7 s function serves as the kernel of an electric field integral equation which defines the interaction of an ideal crack with the transient eddy currents in a conductive plate. The crack response is found using the reciprocity theorem. Good agreement is observed between the predictions of the magnetic field due to the crack and experimental measurements...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} about Religious Ethic Concept {{by comparing}} the thought Ibn Miskawaih and Immanuel Kant. Both of them were ethic figures whose thoughts still influenced until nowadays. Ibn Miskwaih was famous {{as the father of}} Islamic ethic, because he was the first Muslim figure who discussing about ethic philosophically in which Muslim thinkers previously never discuss about ethic in philosophical field. According to them, it was sufficient referred to the Qur’an and Hadits as ethic foundation source. However, Ibn Miskawaih was bravely to arrange Islamic ethic concept that was based on Greek philosophers thinking, yet still stayed on Islamic law sources, namely the Qur’an and Hadits. Meanwhile, Immanuel Kant was western philosopher in the 18 th century whose thought is being discussed up to now. As a western philosopher who used rationality as basic thinking, he also used religious values in his thinking formation, especially in studying about ethic. According to him,ethic came from God, while human as God’s creature whose mind had autonomy right to have ethic in line with the law he made. It did not mean that human was free to do everything he wanted, but here was actually placed the sacred of moral action itself. In this thesis, the researcher has limited the theme on the thoughts of the two thinkers about religious ethic, although Ibn Miskawaih for example discussing also about other themes in his opuses, such as the soul healthy, love, friendship, and etc. and so does Immanuel Kant who discusses about state, religion, and etc. However, the researcher only focuses on religious ethic. Afterwards, the researcher tries to compare their thought and later will be discussed about its similarities and differences. After comparing their thoughts, apparently there are similarities in concept, although it is delivered in different thinking method. For example, in the ethic concept, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> that the deed which including in ethic category is the deed done without any consideration, motives, and certain purposes except for good values itself. So does in the other topics, both figures has many similairty except in God’s existence topic. For Ibn Miskawaih everything in this world comes from the emanation of God. So, God is the sources of everything in this world. But, for Immanuel Kant, God is not the prime cause of everything in this world because if God become the prime cause, it means God include the part of this world. So for Kant God is positioned on the intellectual experience...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the decline of}} reading comprehension in Swedish schools, and also aims to {{provide insight into the}} debate concerning a literary canon and its usage in schools. While some claim that the literary canon is only a list of irrelevant white dead men which only serves to perpetuate feelings of alienation in, for example, female students, others see it as a means to bring society together using the only literature that stood the test of time. This essay will look to studies concerning reading comprehension, and questions regarding reading habits which our own students answered. It will also explain the different viewpoints of both sides of the canon debate. There are several studies that show this decline in reading comprehension, PISA and PIRLS being the foremost of them. They point to a trend where the reading skills of boys are much worse than those of girls, a trend which still has not panned out. Bloom and the different researchers who are the basis for Verhaest's thesis are of the opinion that canonical literature serves a purpose in that it teaches students aesthetic literary values. The researchers believe that the literary canon is a necessary counterweight for commercialism and popular fiction. Bloom believes that the canonical literature has progressed naturally and that including new books into it would only serve to dilute it. Mikaela Lundahl takes an opposing standpoint, she is of the opinion that while the canon is an important framework it is also necessary to question it and remodel it in order for it to work in a more heterogeneous society. She is joined in this belief by Anna Williams and Magnus Persson. Helen Schmidl and Maria Ulfgard are both researchers of didactic methodology, and while they do not agree on whether there is a canon in Swedish schools or not, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agree</b> that it is important that teachers have the ability to choose literature based on their students' needs and wants {{in order for them to}} progress their reading skills. Our students were not avid readers; their reading habits mirrored the results of PISA. Also, like in PISA and PIRLS, there was a noticeable difference between girls' and boys' habits. The girls to a higher degree also found the books read in school to be relevant to their interests. However, they could see the importance of reading, both new and old literature, and many of them made a connection between reading literature and good grades. The most important thing in choosing literature for them, however, would be that the book is exciting. It is also a good thing, the majority agreed, to read books written by both male and female authors, and to have a gender critical perspective when reading. Conclusively, students appear to have a lot of opinions about what literature they read in schools, and if they do not read their reading skills will not improve. School literature today seems to cater mostly to the girls, as they are more positive towards it. Therefore it could be problematic to have a politically ordained canon imposed on teachers, removing their possibility to look to individual needs in their students, despite the loss of proper understanding of aesthetic values...|$|E

50|$|The {{evidence}} of Bimla Khalsa, wife of Beant Singh indicates that on October 17, 1984, Beant Singh and Kehar Singh were combined and conspiring together. Satwant Singh later joining them for meals lends credence to this conclusion. She had revealed {{what she was}} told and what she had witnessed on October 17, 1984, in her own house. In {{the first week of}} September, 1984, when a falcon(baaz) happened to sit on a tree near the main reception of PM's house, at about 1.30 P.M. Balbir Singh spotted the falcon, and called Beant Singh there and pointed out to the falcon. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>agreed</b> that it had brought the message of the Tenth Guru of the Sikhs and that they should do something by way of revenge of the 'Bluestar Operation'. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> the above accused performed ardas then and there. The visit of Kehar Singh and Beant Singh along with their family members to Amritsar on October 20. 1984 assumes importance and it is significant, to show how the appearance of the falcon motivated them. Since the 'Bluestar Operation', Balbir Singh was planning to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi and discussed his plans with Beant Singh, who had similar plans to commit the offence. Balbir Singh also shared his intention and prompted Satwant Singh to commit the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi and finally discussed this matter with him on 30 October 1984. However Balbir Singh, was acquitted on appeal to the Supreme Court in August. The main conspiracy, which was that of making Khalistan, as alleged by the officially commissioned report on the killing, raises questions about the prosecution's case.|$|R
