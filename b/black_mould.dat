Five major Alternaria toxins can be found as natural contaminants in foodstuffs: the benzopyrene derivatives alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethylether (AME), altenuene (ALT), the tetramic acid tenuazonic acid (TA) and the perylene derivative altertoxin I (ATX I) (Barkai-Golan 2008).

60|$|Well, {{the answer}} is that without {{vegetation}} {{there is no such thing}} as soil on earth anywhere. The top layer of the land in all ordinary and well-behaved countries is composed entirely of vegetable mould, the decaying remains of innumerable generations of weeds and grasses. Earth to earth is the rule of nature. Soil, in fact, consists entirely of dead leaves. And where there are no leaves to die and decay, there can be no mould or soil to speak of. Darwin showed, indeed, in his last great book, that we owe the whole earthy covering of our hills and plains almost entirely to the perennial exertions of that friend of the farmers, the harmless, necessary earthworm. Year after year the silent worker is busy every night pulling down leaves through his tunnelled burrow into his underground nest, and there converting them by means of his castings into the <b>black</b> <b>mould</b> which produces, in the end, for lordly man, all his cultivable fields and pasture-lands and meadows. Where there are no leaves and no earth-worms, therefore, there can be no soil; and under those circumstances we get what we familiarly know as a desert.|$|E

40|$|Prevention of {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) accumulation through pre-harvest {{management is}} the best method to control mycotoxin contamination; however, the contamination should occur, so the hazards associated with the toxin must be managed through post-harvest procedures. The assignment of CCPs is important to make HACCP effective and is essential to prevent or to eliminate a food safety hazard or to reduce it to an acceptable level. Grapes selection is a preventive measure and the good manufacture practices in winemaking can work as corrective action for reducing contamination. According to all the experiments that were conducted under “Wine-Ochra Risk” {{the results show that}} no OTA is produced during winemaking, but each operation during winemaking can modify OTA content. OTA passes from grapes into the juice during crushing, the maceration increases OTA content, the alcoholic and malo-lactic fermentation cause an OTA reduction. During all clarification steps (either natural sedimentation or by the use of adjuvant), the level of ochratoxin A decreases because of its adsorption into the sediment. The ochratoxin A reduction due to the natural sedimentation is small, while the decrease due to the use of adjuvant depends on the type and amount of adjuvant. In order to manage the hazard of OTA in winemaking and to verify if OTA content in wine is lower than the legal limit of 2 ug/L, it would be enough to analyze OTA in must and in wine at the end of alcoholic fermentation, since the following steps cause the OTA reduction. According to the results, it is expected that a significant decrease in ochratoxin A concentration occur from grape at harvest to wine if the following good manufacture practices are achieved: •	Minimize the time interval between harvest and crushing; refrigerate the grapes when crushing will not take place in a short time •	Discard bunches with visible <b>mould</b> grown (specially <b>black</b> <b>moulds)</b> •	Add sulphur dioxide to grapes •	Control OTA level in must after crushing •	In case of high OTA risk, reduce the maceration time, use yeast, lactic acid bacteria, and chemical adjuvants proven to be effective against OTA...|$|R

60|$|I may here append {{a modern}} {{instance}} of the sinking of a pavement, communicated to me in 1871 by Mr. Ramsay, Director of the Geological Survey of England. A passage without a roof, 7 feet in length by 3 feet 2 inches in width, led from his house into the garden, and was paved with slabs of Portland stone. Several of these slabs were 16 inches square, others larger, and some a little smaller. This pavement had subsided about 3 inches along {{the middle of the}} passage, and two inches on each side, as could be seen by the lines of cement by which the slabs had been originally joined to the walls. The pavement had thus become slightly concave along the middle; but there was no subsidence at the end close to the house. Mr. Ramsay could not account for this sinking, until he observed that castings of <b>black</b> <b>mould</b> were frequently ejected along the lines of junction between the slabs; and these castings were regularly swept away. The several lines of junction, including those with the lateral walls, were altogether 39 feet 2 inches in length. The pavement did not present the appearance of ever having been renewed, and the house was believed to have been built about eighty-seven years ago. Considering all these circumstances, Mr. Ramsay does not doubt that the earth brought up by the worms since the pavement was first laid down, or rather since the decay of the mortar allowed the worms to burrow through it, and therefore within a much shorter time than the eighty-seven years, has sufficed to cause the sinking of the pavement to the above amount, except close to the house, where the ground beneath would have been kept nearly dry.|$|E

60|$|A {{space was}} {{selected}} (October 9th, 1870) {{for one of}} the squares on a broad, grass-covered terrace, which had been mowed and swept during many years. It faced the south, but was shaded during part of the day by trees. It had been formed at least a century ago by a great accumulation of small and large fragments of sandstone, together with some sandy earth, rammed down level. It is probable that it was at first protected by being covered with turf. This terrace, judging from the number of castings on it, was rather unfavourable for the existence of worms, in comparison with the neighbouring fields and an upper terrace. It was indeed surprising that as many worms could live here as were seen; for on digging a hole in this terrace, the <b>black</b> vegetable <b>mould</b> together with the turf was only four inches in thickness, beneath which lay the level surface of light-coloured sandy soil, with many fragments of sandstone. Before any castings were collected all the previously existing ones were carefully removed. The last day's collection was on October 14th, 1871. The castings were then well dried before a fire; and they weighed exactly 3.5 lbs. This would give for an acre of similar land 7.56 tons of dry earth annually ejected by worms.|$|R
60|$|If earth were {{swallowed}} {{only when}} worms deepened their burrows or made new ones, castings would be thrown up only occasionally; {{but in many}} places fresh castings may be seen every morning, {{and the amount of}} earth ejected from the same burrow on successive days is large. Yet worms do not burrow to a great depth, except when the weather is very dry or intensely cold. On my lawn the <b>black</b> vegetable <b>mould</b> or humus is only about 5 inches in thickness, and overlies light-coloured or reddish clayey soil: now when castings are thrown up in the greatest profusion, only a small proportion are light coloured, and it is incredible that the worms should daily make fresh burrows in every direction in the thin superficial layer of dark-coloured mould, unless they obtained nutriment of some kind from it. I have observed a strictly analogous case in a field near my house where bright red clay lay close beneath the surface. Again on one part of the Downs near Winchester the vegetable mould overlying the chalk was found to be only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness; and the many castings here ejected were as black as ink and did not effervesce with acids; so that the worms must have confined themselves to this thin superficial layer of mould, of which large quantities were daily swallowed. In another place at no great distance the castings were white; and why the worms should have burrowed into the chalk in some places and not in others, I am unable to conjecture.|$|R
