25|$|Cryofixation – {{freezing}} {{a specimen}} so rapidly, in liquid ethane, and maintained at liquid nitrogen or even liquid helium temperatures, {{so that the}} water forms vitreous (non-crystalline) ice. This preserves the specimen in a snapshot of its solution state. An entire field called cryo-electron microscopy has branched from this technique. With the development of cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), {{it is now possible}} to observe samples from virtually any <b>biological</b> <b>specimen</b> close to its native state.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{is limited to}} imaging 1 to 2mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering {{is too small to}} be detected. No special preparation of a <b>biological</b> <b>specimen</b> is required, and images can be obtained ‘non-contact’ or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also {{important to note that the}} laser output from the instruments is low – eye-safe near-infra-red light is used – and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.|$|E

40|$|AbstractScanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) {{has been widely}} used to examine <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> of bacteria, viruses and proteins. Until now, atmospheric and/or wet <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> have been examined using various atmospheric holders or special equipment involving SEM. Unfortunately, they undergo heavy radiation damage by the direct electron beam. In addition, images of unstained biological samples in water yield poor contrast. We recently developed a new analytical technology involving a frequency transmission electric-field (FTE) method based on thermionic SEM. This method is suitable for high-contrast imaging of unstained <b>biological</b> <b>specimens.</b> Our aim was to optimise the method. Here we describe a high-resolution FTE system based on field-emission SEM; it allows for imaging and nanoscale examination of various <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> in water without radiation damage. The spatial resolution is 8  nm, which is higher than 41  nm of the existing FTE system. Our new method can be easily utilised for examination of unstained <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> including bacteria, viruses and protein complexes. Furthermore, our high-resolution FTE system {{can be used for}} diverse liquid samples across a broad range of scientific fields, e. g. nanoparticles, nanotubes and organic and catalytic materials...|$|R

40|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy (SEM) {{is a powerful}} tool for the direct visualization of <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> at nanometre-scale resolution. However, images of unstained specimens in water using an atmospheric holder exhibit very poor contrast and heavy radiation damage. Here, we present a new form of microscopy, the frequency transmission electric-field (FTE) method using SEM, that offers low radiation damage and high-contrast observation of unstained biological samples in water. The wet <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> are enclosed in two silicon nitride (SiN) films. The metal-coated SiN film is irradiated using a focused modulation electron beam (EB) at a low-accelerating voltage. A measurement terminal under the sample holder detects the electric-field frequency signal, which contains structural information relating to the <b>biological</b> <b>specimens.</b> Our results in very little radiation damage to the sample, and the observation image is similar to the transmission image, depending on the sample volume. Our developed method can easily be utilized for the observation of various <b>biological</b> <b>specimens</b> in water...|$|R
