50|$|A {{properly}} equipped C-Series half-ton class pickup could tow up to 8,000 lbs (4 tons) of <b>braked</b> <b>trailer,</b> while {{a properly}} equipped C-Series three quarter-ton or one-ton class pickup could tow up to 12,000 lbs (6 tons) of <b>braked</b> <b>trailer.</b> Adding four-wheel drive reduced towing capability {{due to increased}} curb weight, which resulted from additional driveline components (transfer case, front axle, front differential, front propeller shaft, and so on) needed to facilitate four-wheel drive. A properly equipped K-Series half-ton or three quarter-ton class pickup could tow up to 6,500 lbs (3.25 tons) of <b>braked</b> <b>trailer,</b> whilst a properly equipped K-Series one-ton class pickup could tow 500 lbs more, up to 7,000 lbs (3.5 tons) of <b>braked</b> <b>trailer.</b>|$|E
50|$|With all {{the seats}} removed the Viano Extra-Long can {{accommodate}} up to 4610 L of cargo with a payload of 930 kg. It can tow a 2500 kg <b>braked</b> <b>trailer</b> and a 750 kg unbraked trailer. An adjustable self-levelling rear suspension is included on higher specification models.|$|E
5000|$|The SEAT Inca had two {{rear wing}} doors which, {{because they were}} non symmetrical, were {{supposed}} to facilitate loading and unloading. Capable of carrying a payload of 550 kg [...] and drawing a 1000 kg [...] <b>braked</b> <b>trailer</b> the Inca {{proved to be a}} strong work horse in many markets.|$|E

50|$|With {{adjustable}} +/- <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> gain in {{a digital}} readout from 0.0 (no <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes)</b> to 10.0 (full <b>trailer</b> <b>braking)</b> in 0.5 increments and a manual override lever (to test <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> action), the Ford 'built into the dash' TBC provides smooth braking even when pulling up to a 15,000 lb 4-axle conventional (receiver mounted) or 26,000 lb 4-axle 5th Wheel (bed/frame mounted) trailer. TowCommand being different from most aftermarket TBCs, ties into the trucks' computer and hydraulics, so it senses truck brake pressure and can apply <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> {{as fast as the}} truck's brakes. Master Brake Systems 'BrakeSmart' TBC is the only other TBC that taps into the trucks hydraulic lines in modern trucks.|$|R
50|$|No major {{cosmetic}} changes. Only three trims, XLT, Limited and King Ranch are offered. The Sirius XM with Navlink and HD {{radio is}} added to the XLT as an optional feature. A new, quieter, mechanical Nivomat adaptive hydraulic load-leveling suspension system is available, in place of the adaptive pneumatic air-ride load-leveling suspension. When properly equipped the Expedition continues to offer top-end towing capability with a <b>braked</b> <b>trailer</b> towing capacity of 9,200 lbs (4,173 kg or 4.6 tons).|$|E
50|$|Expedition (U553) is {{certified}} by the Society of Automotive Engineers' independent SAE J2807 towing standard to tow a maximum 9,300 lbs (4.65 tons) of <b>braked</b> <b>trailer.</b> The tow rating increases by 100 lbs over the previous generation {{and continues to be}} the highest tow rating among full-size SUVs. Expedition will also feature Pro Trailer Backup Assist, a semi-autonomous system that allows the Expedition to reverse itself with a trailer coupled. The driver directs the system via a control dial, while the Expedition handles all steering and limits reversing speed.|$|E
50|$|Since its introduction, the Expedition's <b>braked</b> <b>trailer</b> towing {{capacity}} {{has grown from}} 8,100 lbs (3,674 kg or 4.05 tons) to a current rating of 9,200 lbs (4,173 kg or 4.6 tons) when properly equipped. The list of towing features is also ever growing. Towing features common to all generations of the Expedition include: smallest possible turning radius for increased trailer maneuverability, large side view mirrors to improve rearward visibility, rearward-facing lane departure indicators which are helpful to other motorist when the Expedition is towing a long trailer providing added visual safety, heavy-duty flashers, heavy-duty large disc brakes to withstand prolonged braking while towing, and an available heavy-duty trailer towing package which includes necessary additions for heavy-duty towing.|$|E

50|$|For the 2013 model year, Expedition {{received}} the TowCommand electronic <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller system, {{which is now}} equipped at the factory, included with the heavy-duty trailer towing package. The Expedition's <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller features +/- gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated <b>trailer</b> drum <b>brakes</b> and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc <b>brake</b> systems. The <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).|$|R
50|$|According to DIN 72552 pin 54G was {{initially}} intended for electrical control of <b>brakes</b> on <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moving to a {{monocoque}} body usually {{has a negative}} impact on towing capacity. The new Explorer will be available with an optional trailer tow package. The package includes a Class III trailer hitch, engine oil cooler, trailer electrics connector, trailer sway control (TSC), wiring harness and a rear-view camera with trailer alignment assistance to help in backing up to a trailer. If equipped with the trailer tow package the new 2011 Explorer will be able to tow up to 5000 lb of <b>braked</b> <b>trailer.</b> That is 1500 lb greater than the towing capacity stated for the Explorer America concept and 2115 lb less than the outgoing Explorer's towing capacity, although that was only available with the 4.6 L V8 engine.|$|E
50|$|Tractors used to {{be fitted}} with a lever in the cab to operate the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes.</b> The vehicle could be slowed down or stopped using the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> only. Theoretically this was a sure way to prevent {{jackknifing}}, but this lever was often the cause of jackknifing in a roundabout way. Frequent use of the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> alone caused them to overheat and fade while the tractor brakes remained fresh. In {{the event of an}} emergency stop, the driver would go straight for the foot brake and the truck would surely jackknife because the tractor brakes would lock while the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> would be ineffective due to previous overheating.|$|R
50|$|Brakes were {{air over}} {{hydraulic}} with drum brakes on all wheels. Air brake connections at the rear were used for <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes.</b> The M815, M818, and M819 had separate controls to apply the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> separately from the service brakes.|$|R
25|$|Prime {{movers and}} tankers had 10.00x22 size tires, while bridge, crane, and semi-tractor trucks had 14.00x20s {{with a larger}} cross-section. All had dual rear tires. Brakes were full air with drum brakes on all wheels. Prime movers had {{adjustable}} electrical <b>brake</b> connections for <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 970 {{dump truck}} {{was built on}} the {{standard}} G509 chassis. The spare tires were mounted between the cab and bed. The tailgate could be opened at the top or bottom. Originally the dump trucks were not fitted with front winches in order to reduce front axle loading. After a Corps of Engineers request, winches were fitted from June 1944 onwards. The trucks had air <b>brakes</b> and <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> controls.|$|R
5000|$|Interference {{is known}} as 'pulsating brakes' which may occur when braking while also having the turn {{indicator}} flashing. There are different ways to minimize this problem, and it ranges from using a special pulse preventer to having a separate electric <b>brake</b> <b>trailer</b> connector with a brake circuit completely separated {{from the rest of}} the trailer wiring. Be aware that if you do a completely separate wiring the brake ground must be separated from the lighting ground. That includes the breakaway protection circuits and battery. (Think of what Kirchhoff's circuit laws says).|$|R

50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{eliminated}} by minimising slack spring travel, and by {{reducing the amount of}} <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> force applied for a given drawbar force. However this results in the towing vehicle bearing some of the <b>trailer</b> <b>braking</b> load, something the towing vehicle is often not designed to do. The result is compromised braking.|$|R
50|$|Electric Friction Brake, often {{referred}} to as just Electric <b>Brake</b> or Electric <b>Trailer</b> <b>Brake</b> is a brake controlled by an electric current and are seen on medium duty trailers like caravans/RVs and Consumer-Grade Car Trailers. It is related to the Electromagnetic track brake used in railroad applications which also uses electric current to directly control the brake force.|$|R
50|$|A {{manually}} operated pneumatic <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> system and exhaust brake were optional accessories.|$|R
5000|$|Truck drivers {{call the}} lever control for {{air-operated}} <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> [...] "Johnson bars".|$|R

50|$|In the US, {{trailer lights}} {{usually have a}} shared light for brake and turn indicators. If such a trailer is to be {{connected}} to a car with separate lamps for turn indicator and <b>brake</b> a <b>Trailer</b> light converter is needed.|$|R
50|$|Australia uses {{basically}} the same wiring with the exception for pin 5 and pin 2. The problematic part here is that pin 5 is used for <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> which means that if you for some reason connect an Australian trailer to a towing vehicle with ISO wiring you will get into trouble with the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> being applied {{as soon as you}} turn on the lights.|$|R
5000|$|Before ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) came to {{trucks in}} the 1980s, most TBCs were {{activated}} by the trucks' brake hydraulic action. In an emergency {{situation with the}} trucks ABS activated, Ford's TowCommand can automatically reduce the <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> pressure (gain) as it communicates with the truck's computer for faster reaction time with proportional <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> control, to prevent the <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> from locking up even though trailers do not have ABS sensors. TowCommand will also inform the driver with an audible alarm and in the digital readout if the trailer wires and/or trailer disconnects from the truck. Next to the TowCommand is an empty storage tray or the $85 optional 4 AUX (auxiliary) toggle switches for winches, snow plow, off-road lights, etc.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{to having a}} <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> lever in the cab is to fit the trailer with an electromagnetic brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{high powered}} (3,200 hp) EMU tractor units were {{classified}} 4-REP (Restaurant Electro-Pneumatic <b>brake),</b> the <b>trailer</b> units 3-TC and 4-TC (Trailer Control) and the push-pull equipped diesel locomotives were converted from 19 of the Southern's native BRCW type 3 1,550 hp fleet (eventually to become designated class 33/1).|$|R

50|$|The CP (Crystal Palace stock) {{units were}} built in 1911-1913 to provide the {{electric}} train stock required for the LBSCR AC overhead electrification to Crystal Palace and the surrounding area. This stock comprised some 90 cars, which were used in three-car formations, usually (Driving <b>Trailer</b> Composite+Driving Motor <b>Brake</b> Third+Driving <b>Trailer</b> Composite).|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{trailers}} will contain <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> (for example; larger boat trailers, horse trailers, covered utility trailers, enclosed trailers, travel trailers including small 10-foot and longer tent trailers and car carriers). Smaller trailers may not contain <b>trailer</b> <b>brakes</b> (for example; basic 4'x8' utility trailers). It is highly recommended that, if the total trailer weight is over a couple thousand pounds, the trailer {{have some sort of}} braking system, and the tow vehicle be equipped with a brake controller.|$|R
50|$|A brake {{controller}} is usually an OEM or aftermarket installed device or module. It is mounted to the tow vehicle's driver's-side dashboard area, and engages a <b>trailer’s</b> electrical <b>braking</b> system either time delayed, or {{in proportion to}} the tow vehicle's brake engagement when slowing down or coming to a halt. A {{brake controller}} is not needed with a <b>trailer</b> surge <b>braking</b> system unless using modern electric over hydraulic devices. The trailer in this case usually has either electric friction <b>brakes</b> or electric-hydraulic <b>trailer</b> <b>brake</b> actuators.|$|R
50|$|This {{controller}} {{uses the}} air {{pressure of the}} brake system on a vehicle with pneumatic brakes to provide a current to control the electric <b>brakes</b> of a <b>trailer.</b>|$|R
