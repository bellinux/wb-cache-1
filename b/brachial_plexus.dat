5|$|After {{lying on}} the ice for {{approximately}} 10 minutes, Moore {{was removed from the}} playing surface on a stretcher. He was treated for three fractured vertebrae in his neck, a grade three concussion, vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> nerves, and facial lacerations. He was also suffering from amnesia. Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b> Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
25|$|The <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> {{is formed}} by the ventral rami of C5-C6-C7-C8-T1, {{occasionally}} with small contributions by C4 and T2. There are multiple approaches to blockade of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus,</b> beginning proximally with the interscalene block and continuing distally with the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. The concept behind all of these approaches to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> is {{the existence of a}} sheath encompassing the neurovascular bundle extending from the deep cervical fascia to slightly beyond the borders of the axilla.|$|E
25|$|Many {{important}} structures {{relate to}} the sternocleidomastoid, including the common carotid artery, accessory nerve, and <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depending on the circumstances, {{alternatives}} to <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block may include general anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care, Bier block, or local anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> {{block is}} a {{regional}} anesthesia technique that is sometimes employed {{as an alternative}} or {{as an adjunct to}} general anesthesia for surgery of the upper extremity. This technique involves the injection of local anesthetic agents in close proximity to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus,</b> temporarily blocking the sensation and ability to move the upper extremity. The subject can remain awake during the ensuing surgical procedure, or s/he can be sedated or even fully anesthetized if necessary.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{clinical}} experience with <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive, and {{new approaches to}} this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro {{was the first to}} describe a continuous <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block technique. He secured a needle in the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic. The subclavian perivascular block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964. This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj. In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block using an intravenous catheter secured in the axilla.|$|E
25|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. The axillary block {{is also the}} safest of the four main approaches to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus,</b> as it does not risk paresis of the phrenic nerve, nor does it {{have the potential to}} cause pneumothorax. In the axilla, the nerves of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> and the axillary artery are enclosed together in a fibrous sheath which is a continuation of the deep cervical fascia. The easily palpated axillary artery thus serves as a reliable anatomical landmark for this block, and the injection of local anesthetic close to this artery frequently leads to a good block of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b> The axillary block is commonly performed due to its ease of performance and relatively high success rate.|$|E

25|$|Providing a rapid {{onset of}} dense {{anesthesia}} {{of the arm}} with a single injection, the supraclavicular block is ideal for operations involving the arm and forearm, from the lower humerus down to the hand. The <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> is most compact {{at the level of}} the trunks formed by the C5–T1 nerve roots, so nerve block at this level has the greatest likelihood of blocking all of the branches of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b> This results in rapid onset times and, ultimately, high success rates for surgery and analgesia of the upper extremity, excluding the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Emily B. Giffin {{observed}} that the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> of the tyrannosaurid neural canal was smaller than those of other theropods, suggesting that tyrannosaurids really did have reduced forlimb function.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{associated}} with <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block include intra-arterial or intravenous injection, {{which can lead}} to local anesthetic toxicity. This may be characterized by serious central nervous system problems such as epileptic seizure, central nervous system depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects of local anesthetic toxicity include slowing of the heart rate and impairment of its ability to pump blood through the circulatory system, which may lead to circulatory collapse. In severe cases, cardiac dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death may occur. Other rare but serious complications from <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block include pneumothorax and persistent paresis of the phrenic nerve.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} {{procedure}} involving {{disruption of the}} integrity of the skin, <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block can be associated with infection or bleeding. In people who are using anticoagulant agents, there is a greater risk of complications related to bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically lateral to (outside) the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and above the clavicle, with the first rib generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the pleural cavity and uppermost part of the lung are located at this level). Palpation or ultrasound visualization of the subclavian artery just above the clavicle provides a useful anatomic landmark for locating the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus,</b> which is lateral to the artery at this level. Proximity to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> can be determined using by elicitation of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, or ultrasound guidance.|$|E
25|$|Microsurgery is {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} reconstruction of missing tissues by transferring a piece of tissue to the reconstruction site and reconnecting blood vessels. Popular subspecialty areas are breast reconstruction, head and neck reconstruction, hand surgery/replantation, and <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{skin around}} the {{shoulder}} is supplied by C2-C4 (upper), and C7 and T2 (lower area). The <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> emerges as nerve roots from the cervical vertebrae C5-T1. Branches of the plexus, in particular from C5-C6, supply {{the majority of}} the muscles of the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|DeLoach has {{actively}} participated with UBPN (United <b>Brachial</b> <b>Plexus</b> Network) Camp 2007 in Auburn, Washington as an invited speaker and {{together with his}} wife as donors. He resides in Herndon, Virginia with his wife Jodi whom he met in 1978 at a dance at the Naval Academy. They have two grown daughters, Jessica and Jaclyn.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} for blocking the nerves of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b> These techniques are classified by {{the level at}} which the needle or catheter is inserted for injecting the local anesthetic — interscalene block on the neck, supraclavicular block immediately above the clavicle, infraclavicular block below the clavicle and axillary block in the axilla (armpit).|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} fetal birth injury include fetal macrosomia (big baby), {{maternal}} obesity, {{the need for}} instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant. Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and shoulder dystocia. Most fetal birth injuries resolve without long term harm, but <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injury may lead to Erb's palsy or Klumpke's paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the close}} {{proximity}} of the lung to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> {{at the level of}} the clavicle, the complication most often associated with this block is pneumothorax — with a risk as high as 6.1%. Further complications of supraclavicular block include subclavian artery puncture, and spread of local anesthetic to cause paresis of the stellate ganglion, the phrenic nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
25|$|Temporary paresis (impairment of the function) of the {{thoracic}} diaphragm {{occurs in}} virtually all people who have undergone interscalene or supraclavicular <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block. Significant respiratory impairment can be demonstrated in these people by pulmonary function testing. In certain people — such as those with severe {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} — this can result in respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation until the block dissipates.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} first use of cocaine for topical anesthesia, blocks on {{peripheral}} nerves were described. <b>Brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> anesthesia by percutaneous injection through axillary and supraclavicular approaches {{was developed in the}} early 20th century. The search for the most effective and least traumatic approach for plexus anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks continues to this day. In recent decades, continuous regional anesthesia using catheters and automatic pumps has evolved as a method of pain therapy.|$|E
25|$|Finally, doctors {{managed to}} save {{both mother and}} child. The baby, however, {{suffered}} damage at the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus,</b> and the nerves in his arm were injured. As he grew, it failed to develop normally, {{and by the time}} he was an adult, William's left arm was 15cm shorter than the right. There is also speculation that the difficult labour caused fetal distress, which deprived the future emperor of oxygen for eight to ten minutes and might have brought about other neurological problems.|$|E
25|$|The interscalene {{block is}} {{performed}} by injecting local anesthetic to the nerves of the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> {{as it passes}} through the groove between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, {{at the level of}} the cricoid cartilage. This block is particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the clavicle, shoulder, and arm. Advantages of this block include rapid blockade of the shoulder region, and relatively easily palpable anatomical landmarks. Disadvantages of this block include inadequate anesthesia in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, which makes this an unreliable block for operations involving the forearm and hand.|$|E
25|$|Hand {{surgery is}} {{concerned}} with acute injuries and chronic diseases of the hand and wrist, correction of congenital malformations of the upper extremities, and peripheral nerve problems (such as <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> injuries or carpal tunnel syndrome). Hand surgery {{is an important part}} of training in plastic surgery, as well as microsurgery, which is necessary to replant an amputated extremity. The hand surgery field is also practiced by orthopedic surgeons and general surgeons. Scar tissue formation after surgery can be problematic on the delicate hand, causing loss of dexterity and digit function if severe enough. There have been cases of surgery to women's hands in order to correct perceived flaws to create the perfect engagement ring photo.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E
25|$|In January 1910, at age 23, {{he settled}} in Paris and found {{work with a}} series of watchmakers. The day before enlisting, he married his girlfriend of three years, Anna Render, a fellow {{immigrant}} from Odessa. On August 24, 1914, Schwartzbard and his brother enlisted in the French Foreign Legion. As a legionnaire, he entered the fray in November 1914 and participated in the Second Battle of Artois, near Arras in May 1915. On account of his excellent military record, in early 1915, he was moved to the regular French 363rd régiment d’infanterie and transferred south to the Vosges Forest. While there, he was shot through the left lung, fracturing his scapula and tearing his <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b> The doctors gave him little hope of surviving the wound, but he slowly improved over the next year and a half until he was in good enough shape to return to Russia. His left arm was left virtually useless, and he was awarded the Croix de guerre for his courage in the World War.|$|E
2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{may result}} in low blood pressure, undesirable decreases in cardiac output, central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, loss of protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), need for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and residual anesthetic effects. The most important advantage of <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block {{is that it allows}} for the avoidance of general anesthesia and therefore its attendant complications and side effects. Although <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block is not without risk, it usually affects fewer organ systems than general anesthesia. <b>Brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> blockade may be a reasonable option when all of the following criteria are met: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1855, Friedrich Gaedcke (18281890) {{became the}} first to {{chemically}} isolate cocaine, the most potent alkaloid of the coca plant. Gaedcke named the compound [...] "erythroxyline". In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (18571944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented {{a few weeks later}} at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (18521922) performed the first <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block. Using a surgical approach in the neck, Halsted applied cocaine to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus.</b> In January 1900, Harvey Cushing (18691939) — who was at that time one of Halsted's surgical residents — applied cocaine to the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> prior to dividing it, during a forequarter amputation for sarcoma.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> is {{a bundle}} of nerves innervating the {{shoulder}} and arm and can be blocked at different levels {{depending on the type}} of upper extremity surgery being performed. [...] Interscalene <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> blocks can be done before shoulder, arm, and elbow surgery. The interscalene block is done at the neck where the <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> emerges between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. [...] Lidocaine is injected first to numb the skin and then a blunt needle is used to protect the nerves from damage as the physician places the needle very close to the nerves. The needle goes in about 3–4cm and a single shot of local anesthetic is injected or a catheter is placed. The most common local anesthetics used at the site of the nerves are bupivicaine, mepivicaine, and chloroprocaine. [...] There is a very high chance that the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, will be blocked so this block should only be done on patients who have use of their accessory respiratory muscles. The block may not affect the C8 and T1 roots which supply part of the hand, so it is usually not done for hand surgeries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{axillary}} {{block is}} indicated for elbow, forearm, and hand surgery. It anesthetizes the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. [...] This block is useful {{because it has}} less risk than the interscalene (spinal cord or vertebral artery puncture) or supraclavicular (pneumothroax) <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Cervical disc herniations {{occur in}} the neck, most often between the fifth & sixth (C5/6) and the sixth and seventh (C6/7) {{cervical}} vertebral bodies. Symptoms [...] can affect {{the back of the}} skull, the neck, shoulder girdle, scapula, arm, and hand. The nerves of the cervical plexus and <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> can be affected. Usually, a posterolateral disc hernia will affect the nerve root exiting {{at the level of the}} disk. Nerves roots are numbered according to the vertebral body below them (except the C8 nerve root). Thus, a C5/6 disc hernia will normally affect the C6 nerve root.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that people have been {{performing}} <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> blocks for over a hundred years, there is as yet no clear evidence to support the assertion that one method of nerve localization is better than another. There are however numerous case reports documenting cases in which use of a portable ultrasound scanning device has detected abnormal anatomy that would otherwise not have been evident using a [...] "blind" [...] approach. On the other hand, use of ultrasound may create {{a false sense of security}} in the operator, which may lead to errors, especially if the needle tip is not adequately visualized at all times.|$|E
2500|$|The {{duration}} of a [...] "single-shot" [...] <b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> block is highly variable, commonly lasting anywhere from 45minutes to 24hours. The block {{can be extended}} by placing an indwelling catheter, which may be connected to a mechanical or electronic infusion pump for continuous administration of local anesthetic solution. A catheter may be inserted at the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or axillary location, depending on the desired location of nerve block. The infusion of local anesthetic can be programmed to be a continuous flow or patient-controlled analgesia. In some cases, people can maintain the catheters and infusions at home after release from the facility where the surgery was performed.|$|E
2500|$|Following the release, The Dillinger Escape Plan began {{a two-year}} touring cycle, {{headlining}} tours {{of their own}} or occasionally providing support for acts such as Slipknot, System of a Down, and Megadeth. These tours were replete with injuries; in late 2004, guitarist Benoit suffered nerve damage (<b>brachial</b> <b>plexus</b> neuritis) in his left hand, and other than a short return to the stage in 2005, he has not played with the band since. Former Fenix*TX guitarist James Love ended up playing most shows in the late 2004–2006 period. In 2005, the band was forced {{to drop out of}} Dave Mustaine's [...] "Gigantour" [...] slightly early due to a rotator cuff injury and fractured vertebrae Weinman had sustained performing in Anaheim, California at all-ages venue Chain Reaction; Weinman took time off performing with the band to undergo surgery.|$|E
