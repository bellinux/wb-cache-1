5|$|<b>Bastnäsite,</b> LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the <b>bastnäsite</b> is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Europium is {{not found}} in nature as a free element. Many {{minerals}} contain europium, with the most important sources being <b>bastnäsite,</b> monazite, xenotime and loparite-(Ce).|$|E
5|$|The La3+ ion is similarly-sized to {{the early}} {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those up to samarium and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and <b>bastnäsite</b> (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y). <b>Bastnäsite</b> is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride: the product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{few large}} {{deposits}} produce or produced {{a significant amount}} of the world production. The Bayan Obo iron ore deposit contains significant amounts of <b>bastnäsite</b> and monazite and is, with an estimated 36 million tonnes of rare-earth element oxides, the largest known deposit. The mining operations at the Bayan Obo deposit made China the largest supplier of rare-earth elements in the 1990s. Only 0.2% of the rare-earth element content is europium. The second large source for rare-earth elements between 1965 and its closure in the late 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine. The <b>bastnäsite</b> mined there is especially rich in the light rare-earth elements (La-Gd, Sc, and Y) and contains only 0.1% of europium. Another large source for rare-earth elements is the loparite found on the Kola peninsula. It contains besides niobium, tantalum and titanium up to 30% rare-earth elements and is the largest source for these elements in Russia.|$|E
5|$|The Pr3+ ion {{is similar}} in size to the early {{lanthanides}} of the cerium group (those from lanthanum up to samarium and europium) that immediately follow in the periodic table, and hence it tends to occur along with them in phosphate, silicate and carbonate minerals, such as monazite (MIIIPO4) and <b>bastnäsite</b> (MIIICO3F), where M refers to all the rare-earth metals except scandium and the radioactive promethium (mostly Ce, La, and Y, with somewhat less Nd and Pr). <b>Bastnäsite</b> is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides, and the purification of the light lanthanides from it is less involved. The ore, after being crushed and ground, is first treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid, evolving carbon dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, and silicon tetrafluoride. The product is then dried and leached with water, leaving the early lanthanide ions, including lanthanum, in solution.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and <b>bastnäsite,</b> cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including monazite, <b>bastnäsite,</b> cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and <b>bastnäsite</b> are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{commercially viable}} ore of lutetium is the rare-earth phosphate mineral monazite, (Ce,La,etc.)PO4, which contains 0.003% of the element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Pure lutetium metal {{is one of}} the rarest and most expensive of the rare-earth metals with the price about 10,000 USD/kg, or about one-fourth that of gold. Lanthanum is much more common, being the second most abundant rare earth, and in addition to monazite can also be extracted economically from <b>bastnäsite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Samarium was {{discovered}} in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran and named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was earlier named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thereby became {{the first person to}} have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a rare-earth element, samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as tin. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and <b>bastnäsite,</b> the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.|$|E
25|$|Well-known {{minerals}} containing cerium and {{the light}} lanthanides include <b>bastnäsite,</b> monazite, allanite, loparite, ancylite, parisite, lanthanite, chevkinite, cerite, stillwellite, britholite, fluocerite, and cerianite. Monazite (marine sands from Brazil, India, or Australia; rock from South Africa), <b>bastnäsite</b> (from Mountain Pass, California, or several localities in China), and loparite (Kola Peninsula, Russia) have been the principal ores of cerium {{and the light}} lanthanides.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} rare-earth elements are the minerals <b>bastnäsite,</b> monazite, and loparite and the lateritic ion-adsorption clays. Despite their high relative abundance, rare-earth minerals {{are more difficult}} to mine and extract than equivalent sources of transition metals (due in part to their similar chemical properties), making the rare-earth elements relatively expensive. Their industrial use was very limited until efficient separation techniques were developed, such as ion exchange, fractional crystallization and liquid–liquid extraction during the late 1950s and early 1960s.|$|E
500|$|Carbonate and {{fluoride}} containing ores {{such as the}} LREE <b>bastnäsite</b> (...) {{contain an}} average of 0.1% of yttrium compared to the 99.9% for the 16 other REEs. The main source for <b>bastnäsite</b> from the 1960s to the 1990s was the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California, making the United States the largest producer of REEs during that period.|$|E
500|$|When the europium-doped yttrium {{orthovanadate}} red phosphor {{was discovered}} in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause {{a revolution in the}} color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp <b>bastnäsite</b> deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors. Californian <b>bastnäsite</b> now faces stiff competition from Bayan Obo, China, with an even [...] "richer" [...] europium content of 0.2%.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of ion-exchange {{separation}} technology in the 1950s, samarium had no commercial uses in pure form. However, a by-product of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium {{was a mixture of}} samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of [...] "Lindsay Mix" [...] after the company that made it. This material is thought to have been used for nuclear control rods in some early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name [...] "samarium-europium-gadolinium" [...] (SEG) concentrate. It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from <b>bastnäsite</b> (or monazite). Since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used, they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare-earth producers who process <b>bastnäsite</b> do so on a large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of SEG, which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore. Such producers will therefore be making SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in phosphor manufacture. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. , being in oversupply, samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.|$|E
500|$|Lanthanum usually occurs {{together}} with cerium {{and the other}} rare earth elements. Lanthanum was first found by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander in 1839 as an impurity in cerium nitrate – hence the name lanthanum, from the Ancient Greek λανθάνειν (lanthanein), meaning [...] "to lie hidden". Although it is classified as a rare earth element, lanthanum is the 28th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, almost three times as abundant as lead. In minerals such as monazite and <b>bastnäsite,</b> lanthanum composes {{about a quarter of}} the lanthanide content. It is extracted from those minerals by a process of such complexity that pure lanthanum metal was not isolated until 1923.|$|E
500|$|Europium is {{associated}} with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements {{is a step in the}} later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals <b>bastnäsite,</b> loparite-(Ce), xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. <b>Bastnäsite</b> is an orthophosphate mineral [...] (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.|$|E
500|$|Although usually trivalent, {{europium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual to most lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an electron configuration 4f7 because the half-filled f-shell gives more stability. In terms of size and coordination number, europium(II) and barium(II) are similar. For example, the sulfates of both barium and europium(II) are also highly insoluble in water. Divalent europium is a mild reducing agent, oxidizing in air to form Eu(III) compounds. In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that {{it tends to}} be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the [...] "negative europium anomaly", the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the chondritic abundance. <b>Bastnäsite</b> tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today. The development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from the other (trivalent) lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration, as it usually is.|$|E
500|$|Cerium is {{the most}} {{abundant}} of all the lanthanides, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust; this value is just behind that of copper (68ppm), and cerium is even more abundant than common metals such as lead (13pm) and tin (2.1ppm). Thus, despite its position {{as one of the}} so-called rare-earth metals, cerium is actually not rare at all. Cerium content in the soil varies between 2 and 150ppm, with an average of 50ppm; seawater contains 1.5 parts per trillion of cerium. Cerium occurs in various minerals, but the most important commercial sources are monazite and <b>bastnäsite,</b> where it makes up about half of the lanthanide content. Cerium is the easiest lanthanide to extract from its minerals because it {{is the only one that}} can reach a stable +4 oxidation state in aqueous solution. Because of the decreased solubility of cerium in the +4 oxidation state, cerium is sometimes depleted from rocks relative to the other rare-earth elements and is incorporated into zircon, since Ce4+ and Zr4+ have the same charge and similar ionic radii. In extreme cases, cerium(IV) can form its own minerals separated from the other rare-earth elements, such as cerianite, (Ce,Th)O2.: a new rare-earth oxide mineral | url = | journal = American Mineralogist | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 560–564 }} ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lanthanide}} contraction {{is responsible for}} the great geochemical divide that splits the lanthanides into light and heavy-lanthanide enriched minerals, the latter being almost inevitably associated with and dominated by yttrium. This divide is reflected in the first two [...] "rare earths" [...] that were discovered: yttria (1794) and ceria (1803). The geochemical divide has put more of the light lanthanides in the Earth's crust, but more of the heavy members in the Earth's mantle. The result is that although large rich ore-bodies are found that are enriched in the light lanthanides, correspondingly large ore-bodies for the heavy members are few. The principal ores are monazite and <b>bastnäsite.</b> Monazite sands usually contain all the lanthanide elements, but the heavier elements are lacking in <b>bastnäsite.</b> The lanthanides obey the Oddo-Harkins rule – odd-numbered elements are less abundant than their even-numbered neighbors.|$|E
2500|$|NdCl3 is {{produced}} from minerals monazite and <b>bastnäsite.</b> The synthesis is complex {{because of the}} low abundance of neodymium in the Earth's crust (38mg/kg) and because of difficulty of separating neodymium from other lanthanides. The process is however easier for neodymium than for other lanthanides because of its relatively high content in the mineral - up to 16% by weight, which is the third highest after cerium and lanthanum. Many synthesis varieties exist and one can be simplified as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Neodymium(III) {{chloride}} or neodymium trichloride is {{a chemical}} compound of neodymium and chlorine with the formula NdCl3. [...] This anhydrous compound is a mauve-colored solid that rapidly absorbs water on exposure to air {{to form a}} purple-colored hexahydrate, NdCl3·6H2O. Neodymium(III) chloride is produced from minerals monazite and <b>bastnäsite</b> using a complex multistage extraction process. The chloride has several important applications as an intermediate chemical for production of neodymium metal and neodymium-based lasers and optical fibers. Other applications include a catalyst in organic synthesis and in decomposition of waste water contamination, corrosion protection of aluminium and its alloys, and fluorescent labeling of organic molecules (DNA).|$|E
50|$|The <b>bastnäsite</b> ore was finely ground, and {{subjected}} to froth flotation to separate {{the bulk of the}} <b>bastnäsite</b> from the accompanying barite, calcite, and dolomite. Marketable products include each of the major intermediates of the ore dressing process: flotation concentrate, acid-washed flotation concentrate, calcined acid-washed <b>bastnäsite,</b> and finally a cerium concentrate, which was the insoluble residue left after the calcined <b>bastnäsite</b> had been leached with hydrochloric acid.|$|E

The lanthanides that dissolved {{as a result of the}} acid treatment were subjected to solvent extraction, to capture the europium, and purify the other individual components of the ore. A further product included a lanthanide mix, depleted of much of the cerium, and essentially all of samarium and heavier lanthanides. The calcination of <b>bastnäsite</b> had driven off the carbon dioxide content, leaving an oxide-fluoride, in which the cerium content had become oxidized to the less basic quadrivalent state. However, the high temperature of the calcination gave less-reactive oxide, and the use of hydrochloric acid, which can cause reduction of quadrivalent cerium, led to an incomplete separation of cerium and the trivalent lanthanides. By contrast, in China, processing of <b>bastnäsite,</b> after concentration, starts with heating with sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the richest}} {{commercial}} sources of terbium are the ion-adsorption clays of southern China; the concentrates with about two-thirds yttrium oxide by weight have about 1% terbia. Small amounts of terbium occur in <b>bastnäsite</b> and monazite; when these are processed by solvent extraction {{to recover the}} valuable heavy lanthanides as samarium-europium-gadolinium concentrate, terbium is recovered therein. Due to the large volumes of <b>bastnäsite</b> processed relative to the ion-adsorption clays, {{a significant proportion of}} the world's terbium supply comes from <b>bastnäsite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gadolinium is {{produced}} both from monazite and <b>bastnäsite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The mineral <b>bastnäsite</b> (or bastnaesite) {{is one of}} {{a family}} of three carbonate-fluoride minerals, which {{includes}} bastnäsite-(Ce) with a formula of (Ce, La)CO3F, bastnäsite-(La) with a formula of (La, Ce)CO3F, and bastnäsite-(Y) with a formula of (Y, Ce)CO3F. Some of the bastnäsites contain OH&minus; instead of F&minus; and they receive the name of hydroxylbastnasite. Most <b>bastnäsite</b> is bastnäsite-(Ce), and cerium {{is by far the most}} common of the rare earths in this class of minerals. <b>Bastnäsite</b> and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium and other rare earth elements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bastnäsite</b> has cerium, {{lanthanum}} and yttrium in its generalized formula but officially {{the mineral}} {{is divided into}} three minerals based on the predominant rare earth element.

There is little difference in the three in terms of physical properties and most <b>bastnäsite</b> is bastnäsite-(Ce). Cerium in most natural bastnäsites usually dominates the others. <b>Bastnäsite</b> and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium, an important industrial metal.|$|E
