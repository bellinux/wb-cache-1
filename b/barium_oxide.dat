5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% <b>barium</b> <b>oxide.</b>|$|E

500|$|Carl Scheele {{determined}} that barite contained a new element in 1774, {{but could not}} isolate barium, only <b>barium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Johan Gottlieb Gahn also isolated <b>barium</b> <b>oxide</b> two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called [...] "barote" [...] by Guyton de Morveau, a name that was changed by Antoine Lavoisier to baryta. Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist William Withering noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of Cumberland, now known to be witherite. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy in England. Davy, by analogy with calcium, named [...] "barium" [...] after baryta, with the [...] "-ium" [...] ending signifying a metallic element. Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride.|$|E
