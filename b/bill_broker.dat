By 1830 Richardson owned 141 S&DR shares; Richardson was also director of companies such as the Middlesbrough and Redcar and Wear Valley Railway, which were formed to expand the S&DR.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{collapse}} of Overend Gurney {{and the ensuing}} crisis of 1866 {{was a turning point}} in British financial history: this was the last time a serious disruption took place in the London money market until 2007 - 8. The achievement of relative stability was due to the Bank’s willingness to offer generous assistance to the market in a crisis, combined with an elaborate system for discouraging moral hazard. The Bank’s assistance was not anonymous because it monitored the names on its discounted bills. When Overend Gurney sought extraordinary assistance from the Bank, their request was refused {{on the grounds that the}} bills offered did not comply with standard eligibility rules. The Bank’s refusal forced Overend to suspend payments and there was a general panic in the market. The Bank responded by lending freely and raising Bank rate to very high levels. The new policy was crucial in allowing for the establishment of sterling as an international currency. When in 1890 Baring Bros got into trouble, however, the Bank reacted differently and set up a bailout of the failing institution. Such such a contrasting attitude was dictated by the dissimilar position occupied by Overends (a <b>bill</b> <b>broker)</b> and Barings (an accepting house) within the London money market...|$|E

50|$|Isabella Gilmore {{was born}} in London in 1842. Her mother was Emma Morris née Shelton, {{daughter}} of Joseph Shelton, a teacher of music in Worcester. Her father was William Morris, {{a partner in the}} firm of Sanderson & Co., <b>bill</b> <b>brokers</b> in the City of London; he died when she was 5 years old. She did have five brothers to whom she was close; one of the older ones was William Morris. In adulthood, she had a happy marriage to a naval officer, Arthur Gilmore. Her middle class life took a turn when she was widowed at the age of 40. Childless, she began training as a nurse at Guy's Hospital in London. Two years later in 1884, she took on as her own eight orphaned nieces and nephews from her late brother Randall.|$|R

Raised into a wealthy middle-class family, he was named after his father, a {{financier}} {{who worked as a}} partner in the Sanderson & Co. firm, <b>bill</b> <b>brokers</b> in the City of London. His mother was Emma Morris (née Shelton), who descended from a wealthy bourgeois family from Worcester. Morris was the third of his parents' surviving children; their first child, Charles, had been born in 1827 but died four days later. Charles had been followed by the birth of two girls, Emma in 1829 and Henrietta in 1833, before William's birth. These children were followed by the birth of siblings Stanley in 1837, Rendall in 1839, Arthur in 1840, Isabella in 1842, Edgar in 1844, and Alice in 1846. The Morris family were followers of the evangelical Protestant form of Christianity, and William was baptised four months after his birth at St. Mary's Church, Walthamstow.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we use the}} {{original}} ledgers of the Bank of England to document which institutions received liquidity during the crisis of 1866. The so-called Overend-Gurney panic is when the Bank began adopting lending of last resort policies (Bignon, Flandreau and Ugolini 2011). We compare 1865 (a 'normal' year) to 1866. Important findings include: (a) the statistical predominance of foreign bills in the material brought to the Bank of England; (b) {{the correlation between the}} geography of bills and British trade patterns; (c) a marked contrast between normal times lending and crisis lending in that main financial intermediaries and the 'shadow banking system' only showed up at the Bank's window during crises; (d) the importance of money market investors (<b>bills</b> <b>brokers)</b> as chief conduit of liquidity provision in crisis; (e) the importance of Bank of England's supervisory policies in ensuring lending-of-last-resort operations without enhancing moral hazard. These features call for important and interesting parallels with recent policies adopted by the Federal Reserve to deal with the sub-prime crisis.

50|$|A company named Lizardi & Co,then in {{good credit}} in the City, sold four bills of {{exchange}} to Mr Misa, drawn from a bank in Cadiz. Mr Currie {{was the owner of}} the banking firm and the plaintiff bringing the action. The {{bills of exchange}} were sold on the 11th of February, and by the custom of <b>bill,</b> <b>brokers</b> were to be paid for on the first foreign post-day following the day of the sale. That first day was the 14th of February. Lizardi & Co. was much in debt to his banking firm, and being pressed to reduce his balance, gave to the banker a draft or order on Mr Misa for the amount of the four bills. This draft or order was dated on the 14th, though it was, in fact, written on the 13th, and then delivered to the banker. On the morning of the 14th the manager of Misa's business gave a cheque for the amount of the order, which was then given up to him. Lizardi failed, and on the afternoon of the 14th the manager, learning that fact, stopped payment of the cheque.|$|R

He returned to Montreal in 1866, working for MacDougall & Davidson (run by his brother Lorn), stock and <b>bill</b> <b>brokers,</b> and MacDougall & Budden (run by his brother Leigh), produce brokers. By the late 1860s, in partnership with a younger brother, (Hartland) St. Clair MacDougall (brother-in-law of both Sir Hugh and Andrew Allan), he formed the firm of MacDougall Brothers, stockbrokers, of St. Francois Xavier Street, Montreal. The firm sold stocks and bonds through New York City, London, Montreal and Toronto. In 1876, he assisted his brothers, Lorn and St. Clair, in winning {{a major role in the}} $500,000 stock issue by the Bell Telephone Company of Canada which cemented Lorn's reputation as the leader of Montreal's financial community. Campbell and St. Clair MacDougall's firm gained an extensive clientele and turned over a large amount of business. Campbell died aged forty nine, but in his comparatively short life he had achieved distinction in the financial world, serving as Chairman of the Montreal Stock Exchange.

50|$|For lawyers, legal cost finance {{provides}} the assurance of on-time bill payment and minimisation of disputes over legal costs. A third-party arranger (specialised broker) installs the payment plan facility and settles legal costs on the client's behalf using the credit funds (usually held in escrow accounts). If {{a dispute over}} a legal <b>bill</b> arises, the <b>broker</b> can 'quarantine' the dispute to prevent stalling of the legal matter. That is, the disputed bill is placed in abeyance until a later date (usually after completion of the legal case) whilst the lawyer continues to be paid from the credit facility. The disputed bill is later revisited {{in the context of}} the case outcome - normally the client will forfeit the dispute in the event of a successful case result, and vice versa (i.e. the lawyer will forfeit the dispute in the event of an unsuccessful case outcome).|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} soft dollar arrangement, a {{security}} broker provides an institutional portfolio manager with credits to buy research from independent vendors in {{consideration for the}} manager's promise to send the broker premium commission business when trading his portfolio securities. Because portfolio investors implicitly pay for brokerage, critics argue soft dollars reflect a breach of loyalty in which the manager unjustly enriches himself by shifting to investors the research bill he should pay {{out of his own}} pocket. We hypothesize, to the contrary, that by paying the manager's research <b>bill</b> up-front the <b>broker</b> posts a quality-assuring performance bond that efficiently subsidizes the manager's investment research. Our database of private money managers shows premium commissions are positively related to risk-adjusted performance, suggesting soft dollars benefit investors. Premium commissions are also positively related to management fees, suggesting soft dollars are not a pure wealth transfer from investors that is competed away in the managerial labor market. ...|$|R
5000|$|From 1999 to mid-2001, {{approximately}} 8,000 {{asylum seekers}} had landed on Australian shores.

When the Tampa entered Australian waters, the Prime Minister ordered the ship be boarded by Australian special forces. This brought censure from the government of Norway who said the Australian Government failed to meet obligations to distressed mariners under international law at the United Nations.
