5|$|Before long, Nerva's {{expenses}} strained {{the economy}} of Rome and, although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by Syme, necessitated {{the formation of a}} special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures. The most superfluous religious sacrifices, games and horse races were abolished, while new income was generated from Domitian's former possessions, including the auctioning of ships, estates, and even furniture. Large amounts of money were obtained from Domitian's silver and gold statues, and Nerva forbade that similar images <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> his honor.|$|E
5|$|By 1855, the {{economic}} climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to {{large groups of}} workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide variety of}} conventional businesses.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, an {{experiment}} showed that when natural 209Bi is bombarded with neutrons, 210Bi is created, which then decays to 210Po via beta-minus decay. The final purification is done pyrochemically followed by liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Polonium may now <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> milligram amounts {{in this procedure}} which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors. Only about 100grams are produced each year, practically all of it in Russia, making polonium exceedingly rare.|$|E

5|$|Negative {{oxidation}} {{states can}} occur as Zintl phases, as either free lead anions, as in Ba2Pb, with lead formally being lead(−IV), or in oxygen-sensitive ring-shaped or polyhedral cluster ions {{such as the}} trigonal bipyramidal Pb52− ion, where two lead atoms are lead(−I) and three are lead(0). In such anions, each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals, the other two being an external lone pair. They may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May General Winkelman {{remained}} moderately optimistic. He still assumed a firm defence line could eventually be established in North Brabant {{with the help of}} the French and expected good progress could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> eliminating the airborne forces, while not being aware of any special danger to the Grebbe Line. During the day his hopes would be dashed.|$|E

5|$|Rescued by Rover {{contains}} more than twenty shots; this is a considerable advance when compared with Hepworth's own How it Feels to be Run Over (1900), which contains a single shot. This not only made the film longer, but demonstrated that advances in film language could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> editing as well as shooting. Additionally, the editing of Rescued by Rover is notable in its use of time contractions, which made Rover's journeys take considerably less time by portrayal {{than they would have}} in reality.|$|E
5|$|The British {{preparations}} {{could not}} <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> secret, and by March 1915, the Turks {{were aware that}} a force of fifty thousand British and thirty thousand French troops was gathering at Lemnos.
