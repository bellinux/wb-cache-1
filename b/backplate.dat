5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a <b>backplate</b> and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E
25|$|A <b>backplate</b> and wing {{is a type}} of scuba harness with an {{attached}} buoyancy compensation device (BCD) which establishes {{neutral buoyancy}} underwater and positive buoyancy on the surface. Unlike most BCDs, the <b>backplate</b> and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. The core components of this system are the <b>backplate,</b> usually made from metal, which is held against the diver’s back by the harness, and to which the diver’s primary cylinder or cylinders are attached, and inflatable buoyancy bladder known as a wing, sandwiched between the <b>backplate</b> and the cylinder(s), used for adjusting the buoyancy of the diver when in the water. This arrangement clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum width}} of a PCI card is 15.24mm (0.6inches). Two bracket heights have been specified, known as full-height and low-profile. The bracket or <b>backplate</b> is the part that fastens to the card cage to {{stabilize}} the card. It also usually contains external connectors, so it attaches in a window in the computer case so any connectors are accessible from outside. The <b>backplate</b> is typically fixed to the case by either a 6-32 or M3 screw, or with a separate hold-down bracket {{that is part of}} the case.|$|E
25|$|Metal <b>backplates</b> {{made from}} {{stainless}} steel, {{which may be}} used with wing style buoyancy compensators, move the center of mass upward and backward. Some <b>backplates</b> are fitted with an additional weight, often mounted in the central channel, also called a keel weight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{single-crystal}} silicon capacitive accelerometer is put forward. The accelerometer {{is composed of}} a {{single-crystal silicon}} vibration head and two <b>backplates,</b> forming a sandwich structure. With damping holes fabricated on <b>backplates,</b> the squeeze-film damping effect is reduced and a Q factor around 0. 7 is obtained. This accelerometer has a simple fabricating process including wet and dry etching and ambient pressure packaging. Its tested sensitivity is 22. 6 pF/g and calculated noise level is lower than 100 ng/√Hz, thus meets the demand of seismic applications...|$|R

25|$|Apple {{announced}} a battery replacement program on November 14, 2003, {{a week before}} a high publicity stunt and website by the Neistat Brothers. The initial cost was US$99, and it was lowered to US$59 in 2005. One week later, Apple offered an extended iPod warranty for US$59. For the iPod Nano, soldering tools are needed because the battery is soldered onto the main board. Fifth generation iPods have their battery attached to the <b>backplate</b> with adhesive.|$|E
50|$|Screws {{were used}} in the 15th century to {{construct}} screw-cutting lathes, for securing breastplates, <b>backplates,</b> and helmets on medieval jousting armor—and eventually for multiple parts of the emerging firearms, particularly the matchlock. Screws, hence screwdrivers, were not used in full combat armor, most likely to give the wearer freedom of movement.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the back}} of the {{computer}} case, some major changes were made to the AT standard. Originally AT style cases had only a keyboard connector and expansion slots for add-on card <b>backplates.</b> Any other onboard interfaces (such as serial and parallel ports) had to be connected via flying leads to connectors which were mounted either on spaces provided by the case or brackets placed in unused expansion slot positions.|$|R
25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{installation}} of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner back plate over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner front plate. The spinner dome is then mounted over this assembly and secured with screws to the back and front plates. Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller {{to fill in the}} spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the <b>backplate</b> again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the front plate, although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines.|$|E
25|$|These are weights which {{attach to}} the harness directly, but are {{removable}} by disengaging the clip mechanism. They {{can also be used}} to temporarily increase the weight of a conventional weight belt. Various sizes have been available, ranging from around 0.5 to 5kg or more. The larger models are intended as ditchable primary weights, and are used in the same way as BCD integral weights or weight harness weighs, but clipped to the <b>backplate</b> or sidemount harness webbing, and the smaller versions are also useful at trim weights.|$|E
25|$|A SPAD {{indicator}} is {{a separate}} indicator which may be positioned after a main signal {{where there is a}} likelihood of a serious collision at a junction if a SPAD (signal passed at danger) occurs at the main signal. SPAD indicators are mounted against a blue <b>backplate</b> or surround. They are normally unlit but following a SPAD they display a steady red light between two flashing red lights arranged vertically. Any driver who sees a SPAD indicator illuminated must stop their train immediately, even if they can see that the signal pertaining to their line is showing a proceed aspect.|$|E
40|$|The Center for Transportation Research and Education {{performed}} a traffic signal inventory {{study for the}} Iowa Department of Transportation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the level of compliance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and other industry standards of traffic signals on the state highway system. Signals were randomly selected throughout the State of Iowa. Only signals in cities with a population less than 5, 000 were considered. Several intersections need to be addressed immediately to correct clearance timing settings. Red clearance intervals were frequently too short. A handful of intersections had inadequate pedestrian clearance times. Six intersections had at least one yellow clearance interval that did not meet Institute of Transportation Engineers standards. Some of the intersections likely would not meet traffic signal warrants and should be investigated for possible removal. The most common problem found with traffic signals was a lack of maintenance. Many of the signals had at least one of the following problems: burned out lights (signals and/or pedestrian heads), pedestrian lenses in need of replacement, dirty cabinet/missing or poor filter, missing visors, or inoperative pedestrian push buttons. Timing sheets were frequently missing or out of date. Another frequent noncompliance issue was the use of <b>backplates.</b> The MUTCD states that <b>backplates</b> should be used on signals viewed against a bright sky. The majority of signals inventoried did not have <b>backplates</b> on the mast-arm mounted signals. The timing at some intersections could likely be improved by reducing the cycle length. Where there were multiple signals in close proximity rarely was there any attempt at signal coordination. Finally, a number of intersections had equipment that by today’s standards would be considered obsolete...|$|R
40|$|Engine testing, ceramic {{component}} fabrication and evaluation, component performance rig testing, {{and analytical}} studies comprised AGT 100 activities during the 1985 year. Ten experimental assemblies (builds) were evaluated using two engines. Accrued operating time was 120 hr of burning and 170 hr total, bringing cumulative total operating time to 395 hr, all devoid of major failures. Tests identified the generator seals {{as the primary}} working fluid leakage sources. Power transfer clutch operation was demonstrated. An alpha SiC gasifier rotor engine test resulted in blade tip failures. Recurring case vibration and shaft whip have limited gasifier shaft speeds to 84 %. Ceramic components successfully engine tested now include the SiC scroll assembly, Si 3 N 3 turbine rotor, combustor assembly, regenerator disk bulkhead, turbine vanes, piston rings, and couplings. A compressor shroud design change to reduce heat recirculation back to the inlet was executed. Ceramic components activity continues {{to focus on the}} development of state-of-the-art material strength characteristics in full-scale engine hardware.

25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a <b>backplate.</b> Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} a micromachined air-coupled ultrasonic capacitance transducer, using <b>backplates</b> made from chemical etching, ion-beam and laser machining in copper, steel, aluminium and silicon. A series of <b>backplates</b> were produced with micro machined holes on the surface of different depths, diameters and pitch. The resultant characteristics were found to be consistent with previous work. Peak pressure field variations of the capacitance transducers were measured by scanning a detector throughout the radiated field in both air and water. The resulting field compared favourably to a theoretically-generated peak pressure field variation for a plane piston (a FORTRAN program was written which convolved the simulated motion of the membrane with an impulse response for the transducer). Experimental and theoretical peak pressure field variations were measured for an annulus and zoneplate apertures with single and toneburst driving signals. In all cases the experimental field agreed well with the computed theoretical field in air and water. Additionally, with the increase in bandwidth when operated in water, the transducers were used for a pulse-echo C-scan of an artificial defect. Furthermore, the transducers were used to determine the elastic constants in air for glass-epoxy, ceramic and paper card, where the results for glass-epoxy were in good agreement for the values obtained using immersion technique. The transducers were modified by use of a Mica membrane for high temperature use, and were successfully used to monitor the burnout rate of the polymer binder from an injection moulded ceramic...|$|R
5000|$|Another type {{of shell}} {{fastening}} {{is simply a}} large-diameter fine thread.

This method is commonly used on the 2" [...] or 3" [...] boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only M03, never M04, or in pre-CNC terminology, [...] "only forward, never reverse". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).|$|R

Not only was the car one of the 29 finishers {{from the field of}} 66, but also finished in fourth place. This outstanding achievement sealed Healey’s contract with Nash for a limited production run of the road cars. Roger Menadue, head of Healey’s experimental department, {{played a significant role in}} the success: He filed slots in the <b>backplates</b> of the brakes and extended the adjusting mechanism to a small exterior lever. Thus in a matter of seconds he could adjust the brakes during pit stops without jacking the car up—an innovation that was said to save as much as half an hour at each stop.|$|R

40|$|Silicon {{micromachining}} {{has successfully}} {{been applied to}} fabricate piezoelectric, piezoresistive and capacitive microphones. The use of silicon has allowed the fabrication of microphones with integrated electronic circuitry {{and the development of}} the new FET microphone. The introduction of lithographic techniques has resulted in microphones with very small (1 mm’) diaphragms and with specially shaped <b>backplates.</b> The application of corrugated diaphragms seems apromising future development for silicon microphones. It is concluded from a noise consideration that the FET microphone shows a high noise level, which is mainly due to the small sensor capacitance. From this noise consideration, it can be shown that integration of a capacitive microphone and a preamplifier wig result in a further reduction of the noise. 1. IntroducGon Microphones are transducers that convert acoustic energy into electrical energy.

40|$|A pair of air-coupled {{ultrasonic}} capacitance transducers with polished metal <b>backplates</b> {{have been}} used to image temperature and Bow fields in gases using ultrasonic tomography. Using a filtered back-projection algorithm and a difference technique, cross-sectional images of spatially variant changes in ultrasonic attenuation and slowness caused by the presence of temperature and Bow fields were reconstructed. Temperature fields were produced in air by a commercial soldering iron, and the subsequent images of slowness variations used to reconstruct the air temperature at various heights above the iron. When compared to measurements made with a thermocouple, the tomographically reconstructed temperatures were found to be accurate to within 5 %. The technique was also able to resolve multiple heat sources within the scan area. Attenuation and Velocity images were likewise produced for flow fields created by an air-jet from a l-mm-diam nozzle, at both 90 and 45 degrees to the scanning plane. The fact that temperature and flow fields can be measured in a gas without the need to insert any measuring devices into the image region is an advantage that may have many useful applications.

50|$|The {{plates of}} lorica segmentata armour were soft iron inside and (some at least) were mild steel on the outside, making the plates {{hardened}} against damage without becoming brittle. This {{was a deliberate}} act, called case hardening, and is carried out by enriching the surface iron with carbon from organic materials packed tightly around the piece which is then heated in a forge. The strips were arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at the front and back. The upper body and shoulders were protected by additional strips ("shoulder guards") and breast- and <b>backplates.</b> The form of the armour allowed it to be stored very compactly, since {{it was possible to}} separate it into four sections each of which would collapse on itself into a compact mass. The fitments that closed the various plate sections together (buckles, lobate hinges, hinged straps, tie-hooks, tie-rings, etc.) were made of brass. In later variants dating from around 75-80 A.D., the fastenings of the armour were simplified. Bronze hinges were removed in favour of simple rivets, belt fastenings utilised small hooks, and the lowest two girdle plates were replaced by one broad plate.|$|R
