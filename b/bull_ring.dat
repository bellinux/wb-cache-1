The race was the eighth round of the 2015 season, and marked the 29th running of the Austrian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Traces {{of medieval}} Birmingham {{can be seen}} in the oldest churches, notably the {{original}} parish church, St Martin in the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring.</b> A few other buildings from the medieval and Tudor periods survive, among them the Lad in the Lane and The Old Crown, the 15th century Saracen's Head public house and Old Grammar School in Kings Norton and Blakesley Hall.|$|E
5|$|Greaves Motorsport {{achieved}} sixth {{place in}} the LM P2 class, and a top ten finish overall, in the team’s Nissan-powered Ligier JS P2 prototype during the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June 2016; three of their drivers completed 348 laps. The team also achieved a top-six finish with the Ligier JS P2 in the 4 Hours of Red <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring</b> in July, {{the third round of}} the 2016 European Le Mans Series.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bull</b> <b>rings</b> {{are usually}} about [...] in diameter, {{depending}} on the size of the <b>bull.</b> [...] <b>Bull</b> <b>rings</b> are commonly made from aluminium, stainless steel or copper, in the form of a pair of hinged semicircles, held closed by a small brass bolt whose head is broken off during installation. [...] If a ring needs to be removed (for example, if the bull has grown out of it), it is cut or unscrewed.|$|R

5|$|Rindt was commemorated in many ways. The {{early season}} BARC 200 Formula Two race was renamed the Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy {{for as long}} as the series existed. In 2000, on the 30th anniversary of his death, the city of Graz {{unveiled}} a bronze plaque in remembrance of Rindt, with wife Nina and daughter Natasha present. The penultimate corner at the Red <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring</b> in Austria is named after Rindt.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{extensively}} redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s. This included {{the construction of}} large tower block estates, such as Castle Vale. The <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring</b> was reconstructed and New Street station was redeveloped. In the decades following World War II, the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly, as it received waves of immigration from the Commonwealth of Nations and beyond. The city's population peaked in 1951 at 1,113,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|St Philip's Cathedral was {{upgraded}} {{from church}} status when the Anglican Diocese of Birmingham {{was created in}} 1905. There are two other cathedrals: St Chad's, seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham and the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God and St Andrew. The Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Midlands is also based at Birmingham, with a cathedral under construction. The original parish church of Birmingham, St Martin in the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring,</b> is Grade II* listed. A short distance from Five Ways the Birmingham Oratory was completed in 1910 {{on the site of}} Cardinal Newman's original foundation.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the year}} in [...] "Condado del Alhama [...] " [...] there are festivals such as markets with small concerts and days to {{celebrate}} the Spanish culture these usually consist of paellas being served to tourists, <b>bull</b> <b>rings</b> and traditional Spanish dancing.|$|R

50|$|Pig rings usually {{consist of}} open copper or steel wire rings with sharp ends, about one inch (about 2.5 cm) in diameter. These are clipped {{to the rim}} of the nose, not through the nostrils. Typically an adult pig will be given three or four rings, as they may {{sometimes}} become dislodged. Alternatively a ring may be placed through the septum, similarly to a <b>bull's</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of Birmingham into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166, when the Lord of the Manor Peter de Bermingham obtained a charter {{to hold a}} market at his castle, and followed this {{with the creation of}} a planned market town and seigneurial borough within his demesne or manorial estate, around the site that became the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring.</b> This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau {{at a time when the}} area's economy was expanding rapidly, with population growth nationally leading to the clearance, cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land. Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen. By 1327 it was the third-largest town in Warwickshire, a position it would retain for the next 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the fastest}} time in Q2 at 1:06.228, the fastest time set in any {{session at the}} Red <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring.</b> However, both Ferrari and Red Bull set their fastest times in Q2 on the supersoft tyres, unlike Mercedes, who used the ultrasoft compound, meaning that both teams were able to start the race on the harder tyre. Realizing this, Mercedes tried to counter the move and sent their cars back out on supersoft tyres, but were unable to improve on their times due to rain {{starting}} to fall. Jenson Button moved into Q3, while his teammate Fernando Alonso did not, ending up 14th on the grid. In 12th place, Wehrlein equalled Manor's highest ever qualifying result, being between the two Haas drivers Esteban Gutiérrez and Romain Grosjean on the grid. Following their problems in Q1, Pérez and Sainz were unable to set a time and were thus eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or bottoming out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring.</b> In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E

In Quilalí, the Patron Saint is Saint Joseph, and his corresponding saint day is March 19. For the week before the 19th and the weekend afterwards, the town celebrates with pilgrimages to communities within Quilalí as well as the traditional hípica, or horse parade, which is traditionally held the Sunday after the 19th. <b>Bull</b> <b>rings,</b> Ferris wheels, and makeshift bars are all common sights at the Quilalí fairgrounds around the 19th.|$|R
5000|$|... 15 seconds {{into the}} game, Bulls QB BJ Flowers hit WR Rodney Flowers on a 67 yard bomb and the rout was {{essentially}} on. The Bulls kept scoring and scoring and scoring {{in front of}} gleeful home crowd and a national audience. The Bearcats could seemingly do little to stop the Bulls onslaught. The <b>Bulls</b> <b>rang</b> up 51 {{points in the first}} half alone and trampled the Bearcats with 361 rushing yards. The Bulls scored each of the five times they got into the Red Zone. The loss prevented the Bearcats from becoming bowl-eligible.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century a new {{architectural}} movement emerged in Madrid as {{a revival of}} the Mudéjar architecture. The Neo-Mudéjar soon spread to other regions of the country. Such architects as Emilio Rodríguez Ayuso perceived the Mudéjar art as characteristical and exclusive Spanish style. They started to construct buildings using some of the features of the ancient style, as horse-shoe arches {{and the use of the}} abstract shaped brick ornamentations for the façades. It became a popular style for <b>bull</b> <b>rings</b> and for other public constructions, but also for housing, due to its cheap materials, mainly brick for exteriors.The Neo-Mudéjar was often combined with Neo-Gothic features.|$|R

50|$|Since the 19th century, Spanish-style corridas {{have been}} {{increasingly}} popular in Southern France where they enjoy legal protection {{in areas where}} there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights, particularly during holidays such as Whitsun or Easter. Among France's most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of Nîmes and Arles, although there are <b>bull</b> <b>rings</b> across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts. Bullfights of this kind follow the Spanish tradition and even Spanish words are used for all Bullfighting related terms. Minor cosmetic differences exist such as music. This {{is not to be}} confused with the bloodless bullfights referred to below which are indigenous to France.|$|R

25|$|In 1839, the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring</b> was the {{location}} of the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring</b> Riots, which resulted in widespread vandalism and destruction of property. It prompted fears amongst the town's residents at the council's inability to prevent or control the riots and led to speculation that the council was tolerant of lawlessness. Because of disorderly behaviour at fairs, in 1861 the area, along with Smithfield and Digbeth, became the only place in central Birmingham where fairs were permitted. In 1875, all fairs were banned from the town.|$|E

25|$|Although place-name {{evidence}} indicates that Birmingham was established by the early 7th century, {{the exact location of}} the Anglo-Saxon settlement is uncertain and no known trace of it survives. The modern settlement of Birmingham was established by Peter de Birmingham in 1166 as a planned town around the triangular marketplace that would become the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring.</b> Traces of this 12th century settlement survive in the foundations of the Birmingham Manor House, now buried under the Birmingham Wholesale Markets, and in Norman fabric from the original church of St Martin in the <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring,</b> discovered when the church was rebuilt in the 1870s.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, Chrisp Street Market was {{the first}} {{pedestrian}} shopping area built with a road at the shop fronts.

Known as <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring</b> Centre (now <b>Bull</b> <b>Ring,</b> Birmingham), it was officially dedicated in May 1964. A notable example is the Halton Lea Shopping Centre (originally known as Shopping City) in Runcorn, which opened in 1972 and was conceived as the center point for the new town's development. Another early example is the Brent Cross Centre, Britain's first out-of-town shopping mall and located on the northern outskirts of London, which was opened in March 1976.|$|E
50|$|A {{nose ring}} is a ring made of metal {{designed}} to be installed through the nasal septum of domestic cattle, usually <b>bulls.</b> Nose <b>rings</b> are often required for bulls when exhibited at agricultural shows. There also is a clip-on ring design used for controlling other cattle for showing or handling. Nose rings are also used to prevent pigs rooting, and to encourage the weaning of young calves and other livestock by discouraging them from suckling.|$|R
