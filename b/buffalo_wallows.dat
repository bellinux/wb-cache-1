It was a royal road--a native road--a Raj road of the roughest, and, through all its jolts and bangs and bumps and dips and heaves, the eye of Ram Baksh rolled in its blood-shot socket, seeking for the [...] "big horses" [...] he had so rashly sent into the wilderness.

50|$|Originally {{this would}} {{have served as a}} {{temporary}} watering hole for wildlife, including the American bison. Wallowing buffalo that drank from and bathed in these naturally occurring shallow water holes gradually changed the pristine watering hole into a buffalo wallow. Each time they went away, they carried mud with them from the hole, thus enlarging the wallow. Furthermore, wallowing action caused abrasion of hair, natural body oils and cellular debris from their hides and left the debris in the water and especially in the soil after the water evaporated. Every year the debris accumulated in the soil in increasing concentration and formed a water-impenetrable layer that prevented the rain water and runoff from percolating into the lower layers of the soil. Ultimately the water remained for long periods which attracted more wildlife. Even when stagnant, the water would be eagerly drunk by thirsty animals. Though thriving buffalo herds roamed and grazed the great prairies of North America for thousands of years, they have left few permanent markings on the landscape to recall their past presence. Exceptions are the somewhat rare yet still visible ancient <b>buffalo</b> <b>wallows</b> found occasionally on the North American prairie flatlands.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of disturbance in prairie {{has long been}} recognized. Increasingly interest and research {{have focused on the}} action and interaction of multiple disturbances. The distribution of Flodman 2 ̆ 7 s thistle [Cirsium flodmanii (Rydb.)

Ordway Jr. Memorial Prairie in northcentral South Dakota. In the lightly grazed pasture, Flodman 2 ̆ 7 s thistle occurred most frequently on hilltops and ridges, but in the moderately grazed pasture it occurred with equal frequency on hilltops and ridges, and low areas surrounding potholes. Flodman 2 ̆ 7 s thistle was common on earthen mammal mounds and was less abundant on thatching ant mounds and <b>buffalo</b> <b>wallows.</b> No thistles were sampled in potholes. Relative availability of light may explain the thistle 2 ̆ 7 s distribution.

40|$|East Sumba is a {{district}} in Sumba Island with high endemicity of malaria. The environment condition and geographical location can support {{the spread of}} malaria infection. This is a cross-sectional design research. The result shows that the spreading of malaria case is in 0 to 1000 meters from human settlements and spread evenly in remote villages. Breeding habitat are buffalo footprints, puddles, rice fields, rivers, <b>buffalo</b> <b>wallows,</b> gutters and trenches. With pH of water around 7 until 9 and the highest salt concentration is 1 ppm. It’s breeding habitat is more in the turbid water and exposed by sunlight directy. Types of water biota which is exist on the breeding habitat are alga, moss, grass, paddy, Aplocheilus panchax, Oreochromis sp. and water hyacinth. As the conclusion, malaria case spreads indigenously and the area is very potential for  Anopheles spp. to breed. </em...|$|E
40|$|Elevations {{range from}} 1, 300 to 4, 000 feet. Temperatures range between {{extremes}} of hot summers and cold winters that {{are typical of}} a continental climate. Precipitation increases from west (12 in.) to east (24 in.). Two-thirds of the precipitation occurs during the growing season. Soils vary, but are generally aridicols {{in the west and}} mollisols in the east. Soils in the northern Great Plains, west of the Missouri River in the Dakotas, northwestern Nebraska, northeastern Wyoming and Montana are formed from sandstone and shales. These soils range from clayey, fine-loamy, to fine silty soils of mixed origin in level and hilly-undulating lands with major contributions from loess, eolian sand, alluvium, and mountain outwash. Vegetation Description This vegetation type is characterized by the dominance of cool-season grasses such as western wheatgrass and needlegrasses. Warm-season grasses like grama grasses and buffalo grass are common and usually increase in dominance following heavy disturbance. Needleleaf sedge is very common throughout this vegetation type, especially in sandy soils. Needleleaf sedge tends to be very drought-resistant. Disturbance Description The northern mixed-grass prairie is strongly influenced by wet-dry cycles.

5000|$|Chapman {{was born}} in 1837 in Michigan, to white and Native American parents. He began acting as a scout for the U.S. Army and {{settlers}} in the 1860s. In 1868 he moved to Oklahoma, and {{was attached to the}} Seventh Cavalry during General Alfred Sully's actions against the Cheyenne out of Fort Dodge. Subsequently, Camp Supply was set up and Chapman worked there as an interpreter.He married Mary Longneck, the daughter of the Cheyenne Chief Stone Calf, and had six children with her. He lived for a time with her tribe. In July 1874, he volunteered to scout for the U.S. Army once more, and scouted for Lt. Frank Baldwin. On September 12, he was involved in an action which would earn him a Medal of Honor. Chapman, fellow civilian Billy Dixon and four soldiers were confronted with a force of over a hundred Comanches and Kiowas. At Battle of <b>Buffalo</b> <b>wallow,</b> as it became known, the small group made its way to a defensive position in a <b>buffalo</b> <b>wallow,</b> where it held out until the weather caused the Native American force to break off their attack. What happened during the battle is disputed. At one point either Dixon or Chapman was injured and stranded outside of the wallow and the other ventured out to retrieve his fellow scout. Chapman's story goes that he pulled Dixon up onto his back, and had to stop on his return several times to eliminate the Native Americans who were attempting to shoot him and Dixon. With {{a quarter of a mile}} to go before they reached the wallow, Chapman was shot in shin on his right leg, which shattered the bone. He continued to drag himself and Dixon the rest of the way back to the wallow, whilst under fire. However, Dixon's story is that Chapman was already injured and Dixon retrieved him and pulled him back to the wallow. Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles would later say of Chapman's actions that they were [...] "one of the bravest deeds in the annals of the army." [...] Chapman's leg was amputated by a surgeon at Camp Supply, and all the survivors were awarded a Medal of Honor.|$|R
