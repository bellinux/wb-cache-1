5|$|According to Stodart, the fess checquy and buckles, {{prominent}} in 'MacAulay heraldry', {{are derived from}} the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Stewarts. The <b>basic</b> Stewart <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent. The buckles used in 'Stewart heraldry' are ultimately derived from the canting <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> Alexander Boncle (d. by 1300), blazoned: gules, three buckles Or. Boncle's daughter (who in time became his heiress) married Sir John Stewart (d. 1298), younger son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. Together the couple founded the 'Bonkyl' Stewart branch of the clan, and their descendants tended to use the 'Bonkyl' buckles as their heraldic differencing. One of the couple's sons, Sir Allan Stewart of Dreghorn (d. 1333), founded the Stewart of Darnley branch of the clan, which in time became the earls and dukes of Lennox.|$|R
5000|$|No <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> a {{chief of}} the clan has ever been matriculated by the Lord Lyon King <b>of</b> <b>Arms.</b> Even so, in the 19th century, several heraldists listed {{different}} arms for the MacAulays of Ardincaple. The 19th century Ulster King <b>of</b> <b>Arms,</b> Sir John Bernard Burke listed the (undated) <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Macaulay (Ardincaple, co. Argyll)", blazoned: gules two arrows in saltire argent surmounted of a fess chequy of the second and first between three buckles Or. The 19th century heraldist Robert Riddle Stodart published an undated facsimile <b>of</b> a different <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Mc: aula of Arncapelle" [...] (which is also pictured above within the article). The seal of Aulay Macaulay of Ardincaple, in 1593 bore: a fess chequy and in chief a buckle. An early grant <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> {{to a member of}} the clan and descendant of the MacAulays of Ardincaple, was that of George M'Alla, merchant <b>of</b> Edinburgh. His <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> was registered by Lyon Court in 1672 and is blazoned: gules, two arrows in saltire argent surmounted of a fess checquy of the second and first between three buckles or, a bordure indented of the last; crest: a boot couped at the ankle thereon a spur all proper; motto: dulce periculum. The celebrated 19th-century historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay was granted (English) arms that alluded to those of the MacAulays of Ardincaple. This was despite his having no connection at all with Clan MacAulay; he was descended from the unrelated Macaulays of Lewis.According to Stodart, the fess checquy and buckles, prominent in 'MacAulay heraldry', are derived from the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Stewarts. The <b>basic</b> Stewart <b>coat</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent.
