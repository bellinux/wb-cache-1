5|$|After {{screening}} at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 {{was released}} direct-to-video in the United States on January 8, 2008; {{it was later}} released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. In the 2010 Tour, any hors catégorie, first-, or second-category climb awarded double points if it was the last of the stage. In 2011, only the summit stage finishes awarded double points, specifically stages 12, 14, 18 and 19. Pre-race analysis speculated that the winner would be more likely, under this system, to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> classification contender than in years past. This speculation proved accurate, as Samuel Sánchez, who finished sixth in the general classification, won the mountains classification, and the top three finishers in the general classification were in the top five of the mountains classification. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E

25|$|The LDS Church's {{disavowal}} of {{the doctrine}} contributes to what fundamentalists perceive to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> intellectual or spiritual retreat by the church from doctrines felt to be excessively challenging to their preconceptions.

25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{are known}} for being {{gigantic}} Ichthyosaurs. According to the paleontologist Michael Maisch, species of Temnodontosaurus were large, exceeding 12 meters (39ft) in length. There {{is a possibility that}} they reached a similar size to another giant Ichthyosaur, Shonisaurus popularis, which was previously considered the largest ichthyosaur. There seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> consensus between paleontologists that they could at least have reached 9m.|$|E

25|$|The LOE prescribes the {{formation}} of a mandatory IC to monitor and check the ownership and executive powers. Members of the IC must minimally possess professional qualifications or accounting/auditing work experience, and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies. This ensures impartiality and prevents conflict of interests. However, in SCs, while members of the IC cannot hold any managerial positions in the company, they are allowed to own company shares or <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> employee of the Company.|$|E
25|$|Following the German {{occupation}} of the Low Countries and France in May–June 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army began to show dissatisfaction with Yonai's anti German policy. The disagreement became apparent in early July 1940, as Minister of War Shunroku Hata began to criticize the Prime Minister openly. When Hata resigned, Yonai was subsequently forced to resign on July 21, 1940. The Japanese Constitution required the Minister of War to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> from the Army, and no other general would accept the position, due to the pro-Axis stance of the Imperial Japanese Army. The Tripartite Pact was signed on September 27, 1940.|$|E
25|$|After intense {{lobbying}} both in Australia {{and in the}} United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally {{approved the}} draft constitution, albeit with an altered section 74, which represented a compromise between the two sides: there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, except that the Parliament of Australia {{would be able to}} make laws restricting this avenue, and also that appeals in inter se matters (matters concerning the boundary between and limits of the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of the states) were not as of right, but had to be certified by the High Court.|$|E

25|$|Apollinaire first {{intended}} {{this book}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> collection of his writings on art entitled Méditations Esthétiques rather than specifically on Cubism. In {{the fall of}} 1912 he revised the page proofs to include more material on the Cubist painters, adding the subtitle, Les Peintres Cubistes. When the book went to press, the original title was enclosed in brackets and reduced in size, while the subtitle Les Peintres Cubistes was enlarged, dominating the cover. Yet Les Peintres Cubistes appears only on the half t.p. and t.p. pages, while every other page has the title Méditations Esthétiques, suggesting the modification was made so late that only the title pages were reprinted.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{one such}} {{consequence}} of the halting problem's undecidability is that there cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> algorithm that decides whether a given statement about natural numbers is true or not. The {{reason for this is}} that the proposition stating that a certain program will halt given a certain input can be converted into an equivalent statement about natural numbers. If we had an algorithm that could find the truth value of every statement about natural numbers, it could certainly find the truth value of this one; but that would determine whether the original program halts, which is impossible, since the halting problem is undecidable.|$|E
25|$|For their part, the German {{high command}} misread the Allied objectives, believing the Allied assault to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> {{pressure}} {{along the front}} designed to induce collapse at any given point. Hitler had agreed to a partial withdrawal in the north (the Erstein salient) during the night of 28 January but forbade a general withdrawal over the Rhine. German outposts in the Vosges Mountains were pulled back, but the confusion of the withdrawal and {{the pressures of the}} battlefield resulted in many units becoming mixed with one another. While this did not affect the numbers available for combat, it did lower the defensive cohesion of the German units. On 29 January, Heeresgruppe Oberrhein was dissolved as a headquarters, and the units in the Colmar Pocket were again subordinated to Heeresgruppe G (Army Group G), under the command of SS-Obergruppenführer Paul Hausser.|$|E

25|$|This {{led to a}} {{worrying}} scenario {{coming to}} dominate US strategic thinking through the 1970s and 80s. If the Soviets launched a sneak attack on the US using {{only a portion of}} their missile fleet, about , aimed solely at US silos and airbases, they could hope to destroy as much as 90% of the US's fleet. This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US {{would not be able to}} respond with a counterforce attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in kind with their remaining fleet. In this situation, the Soviets would be in an extremely advantageous position for a negotiated peace.|$|E
25|$|In 644, when Emperor Taizong {{planned a}} major {{campaign}} against Goguryeo, Zhang repeatedly advised against it, but Emperor Taizong {{did not accept}} his advice. Zhang himself thereafter requested to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> on the campaign, and he {{was put in charge}} of the 40,000 soldier fleet that would depart from Lai Prefecture to head directly toward the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang. In summer 645, Zhang's fleet attacked and captured Bisa (卑沙, in modern Dalian, Liaoning), and then headed to the mouth of the Yalu River in anticipation of the army also arriving there. When his forces subsequently marched past Geonan (建安, in modern Yingkou, Liaoning), Goguryeo forces made a surprise attack against his forces—shocking him so much that he froze, but his failure to react was interpreted by his own soldiers to be a show of resolve and bravery, and his assistant Zhang Jinshu (張金樹) subsequently counterattacked and repelled the Goguryeo attack. Later, however, when Emperor Taizong's own main forces became bogged down in sieging Ansi (安市, in modern Anshan, Liaoning) and was eventually forced to abandon the offensive with winter arriving, Zhang withdrew as well.|$|E
