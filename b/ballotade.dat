5000|$|The {{horses were}} trained to perform a number of airs above the ground (or [...] "sauts d'Ã©cole") movements, which could enable their riders to escape if surrounded, or to fight more easily. These {{included}} movements such as levade, capriole, courbette, and <b>ballotade.</b> Movements still seen today in competitive dressage include the piaffe, passage, and half-pass.|$|E
50|$|In the {{capriole}} (meaning leap of a goat), {{the horse}} jumps from a raised {{position of the}} forehand straight up into the air, kicks out with the hind legs, and lands more or less on all four legs at the same time. It requires an enormously powerful horse to perform correctly, and is considered {{the most difficult of}} all the airs above the ground. It is first introduced with the croupade, in which the horse does not kick out at the height of elevation, but keeps the hind legs tucked tightly under, and remains parallel to the ground. The horse is then taught the <b>ballotade.</b> In this movement, the horse's hind hooves are positioned so one can see its shoes if watching from behind, but the horse is not asked to kick out. When the horse demonstrates proficiency in the <b>ballotade,</b> the capriole is introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "high school" [...] or ''''haute ecole'''' school jumps, {{popularly known}} as the [...] "airs above the ground," [...] include the courbette, capriole, levade, and <b>ballotade.</b> Though these {{movements}} are said to come from when the horse was used in war, in their modern form, it is unlikely the airs were used in actual battle, as all but the Capriole expose the horse's sensitive underbelly to the weapons of foot soldiers, and {{it is more likely}} that they were training exercises used off the battlefield.|$|E
