50|$|Simple clay vessels such as {{bowls and}} cups {{of various sizes}} can be formed and shaped by hand using a methodical {{pinching}} {{process in which the}} clay walls are thinned by pinching them with thumb and forefinger. It is a <b>basic</b> <b>pot</b> making method often taught to young children or beginners.|$|E
50|$|The heads share a <b>basic</b> <b>pot</b> like {{formation}} with {{subtle differences}} {{in the way they}} were each shaped. The base formed at the bottom of all the heads was completed like the rim of a pot. Parts of the rim are rounded, however some parts of the base reflects a flat squared shape. While the Basal rings may be incised or moulded the neck rings above these basal rings contain diagonally incised rings that circle the entire neck. The incised pattern constitutes hatch marks that alternate in direction producing a herringbone pattern. While the specimens are similar in manufacture, they also have varying characteristics. Some specimens are better preserved than others, {{as in the case of}} the ears. The ears were all manufactured in the same way. A plate of clay was moulded to the side of the specimen where the ear would be anatomically. The outer edge of the ears were rounded and sloped down and slighly forward. Ear lobes are not presented in any of the specimens however there is a small peg of clay placed above the area where the ear attached to the head. This clay peg is postulated to represent the cartilaginous projection usually found in the a normal human ear. Each head features similar notched ridges made by applying wet strips of clay and incising lines before the clay had dried. These notches vary in position and shape along the face. Other similar features include the eyes, mouth and nose; these characteristics are detailed below.|$|E

5000|$|A Potting bench or {{gardening}} {{table is}} a kind of workbench used for small gardening tasks such as transplanting seedlings. A <b>basic</b> <b>potting</b> bench has a work surface at bench height, comfortable for a standing person; and storage for potting soil, pots, and tools. The same furniture is often also used to display potted plants, even indoors.|$|R

50|$|In Anji Play’s current implementation, {{children}} {{have at least}} two hours of free play every day. Play environments are outdoors with minimal structuring, and simple tools made of natural materials (i.e., ropes, light bamboo ladders, <b>basic</b> clay <b>pots)</b> are provided as toys, instead of objects sold and marketed as toys. During play time, teachers observe, document, and act as parallel participants.|$|R
5000|$|One {{field where}} [...] "fine" [...] remains a valid {{technical}} term is pottery, especially in archaeology. [...] "Fine wares" [...] are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, {{and in many}} periods distinguished from [...] "coarse" [...] wares, which are <b>basic</b> utilitarian <b>pots</b> used by {{the mass of the}} population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.|$|R

2500|$|While Pakimé pottery is {{inspired}} by pre-Hispanic pottery, {{it is not an}} exact copy. Unlike other parts of Mexico, the pottery tradition broke completely here sometime during the colonial period. The current residents do not consider themselves to be the descendents of the Casas Grandes culture nor do their traditions tie to it. No one before Quezada's generation was involved with pottery. This has allowed the potters to experiment and test the limits of form and design, unlike many other Mexican potters who are constrained by generations of tradition. However, Quezada's recreation is interesting because he recreated two of the <b>basic</b> <b>potting</b> techniques from the pre-Hispanic period, the coil and molding methods. The raw clay is dug with a pick and shovel in the rugged foothills outside the town. It is cleaned by soaking it in water until it can be poured through a sieve. White clay is a favorite to work with but many colors are used. A potter's wheel is not used. The bottom of the pot is molded and the upper part is created by the coil method. When the pot is dry, it is rubbed with a stone or other hard object to make it shine. This can take days. Pots are fired on the open ground using wood and manure for fuel. Paints are made with mineral pigments collected locally. The pigments are ground into a powder using a metate grinding stone, then mixed with clay to [...] make a milky fluid paint. Many use traditional colors such as red, white and earth tones, but brighter colors have also been used. Brushes are made from dog, cat and even human hair.|$|R

5|$|In Poland, the {{earliest}} archeological sites considered Slavic include {{a limited number}} of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area. It is {{on the basis of the}} different varieties of these <b>basic</b> clay <b>pots</b> and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished. The largest of {{the earliest}} Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bachórz, Rzeszów County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 on the average) square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found. 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.|$|R
40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in neonatal care and monitoring, asphyxia globally accounts for 23 % of the 4 million annual deaths of newborns, and leads to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Occurring in five of 1000 live-born infants globally and even more in developing countries, HIE {{is a serious problem}} that causes death in 25 %– 50 % of affected neonates and neurological disability to at least 25 % of survivors. In order to prevent the damage caused by HIE, our invention provides an effective whole-body cooling of the neonates by utilizing evaporation and an endothermic reaction. Our device is composed of <b>basic</b> electronics, clay <b>pots,</b> sand, and urea-based instant cold pack powder. A larger clay pot, lined with nearly 5 cm of sand, contains a smaller pot, where the neonate will be placed for therapeutic treatment. When the sand is mixed with instant cold pack urea powder and wetted with water, the device can extract heat from inside to outside and maintain the inner pot at 17 °C for more than 24 hours with monitoring by LED lights and thermistors. Using a piglet model, we confirmed that our device fits the specific parameters of therapeutic hypothermia, lowering the body temperature to 33. 5 °C with a 1 °C margin of error. After the therapeutic hypothermia treatment, warming is regulated by adjusting the amount of water added and the location of baby inside the device. Our invention uniquely limits the amount of electricity required to power and operate the device compared with current expensive and high-tech devices available in the United States. Our device costs a maximum of 40 dollars and is simple enough to be used in neonatal intensive care units in developing countries. ...|$|R
