40|$|Low crop {{productivity}} in western Kenya {{can be attributed}} to low soil fertility and limited use of organic and inorganic fertilizers. This is attributed to high costs of fertilizer, inconsistent application and duration of use. Efforts to improve and maintain soil productivity through use of manure and fertilizer among others has been ongoing in western Kenya for years. Despite these efforts low crop yield associated with limited use of common compound fertilizers is still prevalent. Remarkable increases in yield have been noted with compound fertilizers which offer additional benefits in terms of nutrient supply. Mavuno a locally <b>blended</b> <b>fertilizer</b> promoted in western Kenya offers such benefits. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of mavuno phosphorus-based fertilizer and manure on maize and stover yields in Nyalgunga, Nyabeda and Emusutwi sub-locations, western Kenya; where low soil fertility, coupled particularly with low available phosphorus has been pointed out as the major factor limiting {{crop productivity}}. The study was carried out on fields where mavuno fertilizer at 20 kg P ha- 1 and manure at 2 t ha- 1 has been applied for six years. A randomized block design was used and maize grain and stover yields calculated from the four treatment fields; control (no input), manure (2 t ha- 1), mavuno (20 kg P ha- 1) and manure (2 t ha- 1) + mavuno (20 kg P ha- 1). There was a remarkable increase in maize grain yield (control 904 kg ha- 1, manure+ mavuno 2238 kg ha- 1) a 148 % increase in yield above control plot (p=< 0. 001...|$|E
40|$|Background: Broadcast {{fertilizer}} distribution using spinner-disc spreaders equipped with variable-rate technology {{has become a}} widely adopted practice. However, a few spinner-disc spreaders provide dual bins permitting the independent metering of two products. The questions at hand does the individual {{fertilizer distribution}} pattern vary if two products are applied in blended form or independently metered onto the spinner discs. Therefore, this study compares the distribution uniformity of a common phosphorus and potassium fertilizers applied using variable-rate technology in blended versus independently metered forms. Methods: A common US spinner-disc spreader with a dual bin, {{and the ability to}} independently meter two products onto the spinner-discs was used for this study. Prior to spreading fertilizer, particle analysis determined that the bulk density of diammonium phosphate (DAP), muriate of potash, and a <b>blended</b> <b>fertilizer</b> (10 - 26 - 26) were 1009, 1105, and 1025 kg m- 3, respectively. All three fertilizer mixtures were broadcast and nutrient distributions determined using standard procedures. Different spinner disc speeds (600, 700 and 800 RPM) and application rates (220 and 440 kg ha- 1) were included as treatments. Results and discussions: Results indicated differences between independently metered DAP and potash versus blended. Distribution patterns did not vary at the different application rates. Also, {{it was found that the}} application rate and divider position had no effect on the efficiency of fertilizer distribution, while the disc speed improved distribution uniformity. Conclusion: These results indicate that while spinner-disc spreaders are inefficient by nature, opportunities exist to increase distribution uniformity through using newer technology such as dual bin spreaders...|$|E

Effect of blending various N-fertilizers; urea, U, ammonium sulfate, AS, ammonium nitrate, AN and di-ammonium phosphate, DAP; with elemental sulfur, on fertilizer-N utilization and quality of lettuce yield were studied. The results of lettuce yield grown in greenhouse showed significant increase in lettuce fresh yield (ranging from 9. 8 - 18. 9 %) of treatments received S comparing with those received no S. The effect of S on dry matter of leaves and stems was insignificant. Total N content of leaves and stems showed a significant increase varied between 10. 4 - 20. 6 and 8. 4 - 18. 5 %, respectively. Total-N uptake by lettuce plants treated with sulfur-blended fertilizers was increased by 20 %(U) - 52 (AN) %. Also, an increase in N recovery reached 70 % of the applied was observed for sulfur- blended N- fertilizer treatments, instead of 39 - 52 % of those received no S. Nitrate and sulfate contents of lettuce dry matter were significantly increased using S-blended fertilizers particularly in the case of ammonium nitrate (AN) and ammonium sulphate (AS).

40|$|Teff {{is a major}} {{staple food}} crop in Ethiopia whose yield is {{constrained}} by plant lodging, declining soil fertility due to nutrient depletion caused by farming without replenishing nutrients over time, leaching due to inadequate runoff management, removal of crop residue, low level of fertilizer use and unbalanced application of nutrients. Teff is well adapted to highland soils. Yields are low (in average about 1280 kg ha- 1) even though fertilization with recommended rate of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers is applied. This experiment was conducted {{with the objective of}} evaluating different rates of NPK, and Zn and B <b>blended</b> <b>fertilizers</b> on yield, nutrient uptake (N, P, K and Zn) and nutrient use efficiency of teff crops, during 2013 main cropping season in Dedessa District of southwestern Ethiopia.

40|$|The cost of feed {{fuel and}} other {{material}} inputs in the dairy industry rose sharply in 2000 {{and continued to}} rise thereafter particularly between 2005 and 2008. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze and to clarify how these rising costs have impacted dairy farming. The following results were obtained. First, these costs rose rapidly over a short period of time. The cost of formula feed, bulk <b>blended</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> and diesel fuel rose by factors of 1. 6, 1. 4, and 2. 1 respectively. Second, for dairy operations of under 100 head of cattle, purchases of concentrated feed were reduced by 10 - 20 %. On the other hand, while operations of 101 head or more also tended to reduce purchase amounts, the quantity of concentrated feed per animal per day continued to be high. Third, by reducing purchases of concentrated feed and chemical fertilizer, operating costs fell by 0. 4 - 5. 5 million yen. Fourth, the bigger the operation the higher the cost increases, particularly for feed, with agricultural income showing a decrease of 0. 3 - 8. 9 million yen. This decrease was especially severe for large-scale operators. Fifth, although interest payments and land rent payments could be met by increases in the price of milk, this price rise could cover only a part of the family labor portion of production costs. This was particularly true for larger operators. In conclusion, due to the rising input costs of recent years, economic risk loomed greatest for large-scale farms. For this reason, when looking into the future of pasture-style dairy farm operations, it will be necessary to begin with the premise that the behavior of dairy farm operators under these cost challenges will not be uniform...|$|E

30|$|The data, therefore, {{provides}} {{useful information}} for planning soil management strategies that can address {{adverse effects of}} land use on soil characteristics. First and foremost, application of more balanced <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizer</b> that contains N, P, K and Zn combined with liming to raise the soil pH remains crucially important. In this connection, research needs to generate NPS and Zn-B <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizer</b> applications rates for different crops, soil types and land use systems. Increasing the rate of fertilizer application is particularly crucial in the agroforestry based system where current rates of fertilizer use are far too low. However, given the very high levels of Zn in the soil, Zn-blend should not be extended to farmers in the agroforestry system. Secondly, organic matter management including restitution of crop residues and recycling of farm yard manure is fundamental in order to reverse the OC depletion and increase water holding capacity of the soil. Third, although Nitisols have high structural aggregate stability that are fairly resistant to erosion, their landform of occurrence (i.e., high to mountainous relief hills with steep slopes) makes the soils susceptible to degradation by water erosion. This calls {{for the implementation of}} integrated soil and water conservation measures that combine physical, biological and agronomic measures mainly in the cereal system. In addition, soil textural fractionation analysis indicates that repeated tillage practice is found to predispose the soil to erosion by adversely affecting the soil textural fractions. Therefore, minimum tillage combined with legume rotation (maize-tef-bean) observed in some parts of west Gojam (e.g., South Achefer and Bure) need to be widely disseminated among farmers in the cereal-livestock highlands.|$|R
40|$|Bulk <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are {{a mixture}} of {{different}} kinds of fertilizers in order to obtain a predicted N-P-K chemical composition. Although this production method has some advantages, segregation appears at different stages, from the production to the final spreading on the field. An experiment has been implemented to predict and quantify the influence of some physical properties on the occurrence of segregation. The principle was to <b>blend</b> two <b>fertilizers</b> having identical physical properties except for one, such as size, shape or density and to measure the segregation of the blend following various operations, such as filling or emptying a container. Results show that the spread of the fragment size distribution has a big influence on the segregation of the generated heap. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the granulometric spread index (GSI) [(d(84) -d(16)) / 2 d(50) ] must be smaller than 10. Other properties don't seem to have an influence. The granulometric segregation can lead to a chemical heterogeneity. The absolute sum of the difference between d(16) and d(84) must be limited around 0. 5 mm. Above this value, the chemical segregation begins to be excessive. It seems also {{that if there is a}} limited difference in size for the components, the chemical segregation is amplified if the density of the fertilizer with the biggest particles is lower. It is not the case for the difference in shape. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Appropriate use of {{fertilizer}} in crop production {{to limit the}} environmental impact is essential for sustainable agriculture. While much {{is known about the}} environmental impact {{of fertilizer}} production only a limited amount of data is available covering the whole fertilizer supply chain. Up to now no comparison was done on the environmental impact of different fertilizer types (i. e., complex <b>fertilizer,</b> bulk <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and single nutrient fertilizer). A cradle-to-field life cycle assessment (LCA) for the fertilizer supply chain in Germany, from extraction of raw materials, via fertilizer production, transportation and storage until final application in the field was carried out. Two different complex fertilizers were compared with single nutrient fertilizers (containing only one nutrient) and bulk <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (containing more than one nutrient as a dry mixture). The five most relevant impact categories (i. e., climate change, acidification, eutrophication, fossil fuel depletion and resource depletion) were selected to cover different environmental impacts. Additionally, a scenario analysis was carried out focusing on nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, as new catalytic reduction techniques for the manufacturing of nitrogen (N) containing fertilizers are available that can lead to drastic reductions of N 2 O emissions. Production of fertilizers causes high values in the impact categories climate change, fossil fuel depletion and acidification, whereas resource depletion is dominant for production and transportation. For the impact category eutrophication, the application of fertilizer is the most important factor. For a fertilizer strategy with low phosphorus application rate, a bulk blend or single nutrient fertilizer with calcium ammonium nitrate is the most sustainable choice, while for a fertilizer strategy with a balanced nutrient formula, a bulk blend or single nutrient fertilizer with calcium ammonium nitrate or a standard complex fertilizer are sustainable options. Scenario calculations with reduced N 2 O emission during the production process reveals that this reduction technique is not relevant for urea based fertilizers leading to the conclusion that products containing urea need different emission reduction techniques {{to keep up with the}} environmental improvements of other nitrogen fertilizers. With an optimized fertilization strategy the environmental burden can be reduced up to 15 %. As nitrogen application rates strongly affect the LCA results it is essential that the right amounts of N are used and that for N fertilizer production the best available technique should be installed. Furthermore, a careful consideration concerning the fertilizer product type should be part of every LCA of food and agricultural products, as this has a great impact on LCA results...|$|R

Aboveground biomass production increased 43 â€“ 82 % {{as a result}} of three annual applications of urea or balanced nutrient <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizer</b> beginning near canopy closure. There were no production differences between the type of fertilizer used, indicating that N was the major limiting nutrient. Responses were consistent from site to site, indicating that hybrid poplar stands in this region at this stage of development would be very responsive to fertilization. Leaf tissue N, P, and K concentrations increased in response to both fertilizer treatments; P and K increased more frequently in response to the blend treatment compared to the N-only urea treatment.

To understand what nutrients other than nitrogen may limit forest productivity in this region, we tested six fertilizer treatments for their ability to increase stem volume growth response of dominant and co-dominant trees in young Douglas-fir plantations across a range of foliar and soil chemistry in western Oregon and Washington. We evaluated responses to single applications of urea, lime, calcium chloride, or monosodium phosphate at 16 sites, and to two site-specific nutrients blends at 12 of these sites. Across sites, the average stem volume growth increased marginally with urea, lime, and phosphorus fertilization. Fertilization responses generally aligned with plant and soil indicators of nutrient limitation. Response to nitrogen addition was greatest on soils with low total nitrogen and high exchangeable calcium concentrations. Responses to lime and calcium chloride additions were greatest at sites with low foliar calcium and low soil pH. Response to phosphorus addition was greatest on sites with low foliar phosphorus and high soil pH. <b>Blended</b> <b>fertilizers</b> yielded only marginal growth increases at one site, with no consistent effect across sites.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fertilizers}} on methane emission rates was investigated using an automated closed chamber system in Chinese rice fields (Hunan Province). Each of three experiments compared two fields {{treated with a}} first uniform fertilizer dose and a second fertilizer dose which was different {{for each of the}} two fields. The uniform fertilizer doses for both fields in each experiment comprised mineral (experiment 1), organic (experiment 2) and combined mineral plus organic components (experiment 3). In all three experiments the second fertilizer dose comprised organic amendments for field 1 and no organic amendments for field 2. The rate of increase in methane emission with a given amount of organic manure was found to depend on the total amount of organic manure applied. A single dose of organic manure increased the emission rates by factors of 2. 7 to 4. 1 as compared to fields without organic manure (experiment 1). In rice fields that had already been treated with organic manure, the appl ication of a second dose of organic manure only slightly enhanced the emission rates in experiment 2 by factors of 1. 1 to 1. 5 and showed no detectable increase in experiment 3. The net reduction achieved by separation of organic and mineral fertilizers was maximized by concentrating the organic amendments in the season with low emission rates, i. e. early rice, and using exclusively mineral fertilizers on late rice when emission rates were generally higher.

40|$|<b>Blending</b> <b>fertilizers</b> with {{nitrification}} inhibitors (NI) is a technology to reduce nitrogen (N) losses. The application of NI {{could increase the}} soil N supply capacity over time and contribute to an enhancement of N-fertilizer recovery in some cropping systems. During two seasons, a field experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) was fertilized with ammonium sulfate nitrate (ASN) and DMPP (3, 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate) blended ASN (ENTEC) at two levels (130 and 170 kg N ha- 1) under Mediterranean conditions. A control treatment with no added N fertilizer was also included. Maize yield, grain quality, nutritional state and fertilizer use efficiency were evaluated. Due to the observation of a soil residual effect, a non-fertilized sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) was planted in the same plots to study the cumulative effect during a third experimental season. Laboratory determinations were performed in order to elucidate the possible sources of residual N. The second year, DMPP application allowed a 23 % reduction of the fertilizer rate without decreasing crop yield or grain quality. In addition, the non-fertilized sunflower planted after the maize scavenge more N in treatments previously treated with ENTEC than with traditional fertilizers, increasing N use efficiency in the cropping systems. After DMPP application, N was conserved in non-ready soil available forms during {{at least one year}} and subsequently released to meet the sunflower crop demand. The potential N mineralization obtained from aerobic incubation under controlled conditions of soil samples collected before sunflower sowing was higher for ENTEC than ASN or control treatments. A higher Î´ 15 N in the soil indicated larger non-exchangeable NH 4 + fixation in soils from the plots treated with ENTEC or ASN- 170 than from the ASN- 130 or the control.

In this study, we investigated the seasonal changes of C, N and P concentrations, accumulation, partitioning, and C:N:P stoichiometric ratios in different plant tissues (root, stem-leaf, and panicle) of late-season rice under two irrigation regimes (continuous flooding, CF; alternate wetting and drying, AWD) and four N managements (control, N 0; conventional urea at 240 kg N ha 21, UREA; controlled-release bulk <b>blending</b> <b>fertilizer</b> at 240 kg N ha 21, BBF; polymer-coated urea at 240 kg N ha 21, PCU). We found that water and N treatments had remarkable effects on the measured parameters in different plant tissues after transplanting, but the water and N interactions had insignificant effects. Tissue C:N, N:P and C:P ratios ranged from 14. 6 to 52. 1, 3. 1 to 7. 8, and 76. 9 to 254. 3 over the rice growing seasons, respectively. The root and stem-leaf C:N:P and panicle C:N ratios showed overall uptrends with a peak at harvest whereas the panicle N:P and C:P ratios decreased from filling to harvest. The AWD treatment did not affect the concentrations and accumulation of tissue C and N, but greatly decreased those of P, resulting in enhanced N:P and C:P ratios. N fertilization significantly increased tissue N concentration, slightly enhanced tissue P concentration, but did not affect tissue C concentration, leading to a significant increase in tissue N:P ratio but a decrease in C:N and C:P ratios.

The research was conducted during 2009 - 2010, in a two-way experience. It was located at the Research Institute for Fruit Growing Pitesti. Experimental factors were: A - cultivars: a 1 â€“ â€˜Oneborâ€™, a 2 â€“ â€˜Realâ€™, a 3 â€“ â€˜Elsantaâ€™, a 4 â€“ â€˜Miraâ€™, a 5 â€“ â€˜Albaâ€™, a 6 â€“ â€˜Premialâ€™; B â€“ Fertilizer with 6 graduations: b 1 - unfertilized, and for graduations b 2 - b 6 were applied mixtures ofthe below fertilizers the amounts becoming increasingly larger, thus: b 2 - 6. 4 kg / ha / week, b 3 - 14. 3 kg / ha / week, b 4 - 21. 4 kg / ha / week, b 5 - 28. 5 kg / ha / week and b 6 - 35. 8 kg / ha / week. The fertilizers applied were: Polyfeed (N 19 : P 19 : K 19), K nitrate (N 12 : P 0 : K 43 : Mg 2) and Magnesia (N 11 : P 0 : K 0 : Mg 15). Mixtures were applied at 2 weeks intervals, as follows: 1 April to 15 May (flowering), 2 applications, containing macroelements N: P: K: Mg 14 : 6, 3 : 20, 7 : 5, 7 g / 100 g mixed fertilizers, May 15 -June 15 (in the picking period), 2 applications of N: P: K: Mg 10, 2 : 6, 3 : 13, 5 : 2, 83 g/ 100 g <b>blend</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and August 1 to September 15 (2 applications) with N: P: K: Mg 12, 2 : 6, 3 : 20, 7 : 31, 6 g/ 100 g mixed fertilizers. Following determinations were made: average weight of fruit (g) by weighing a sample of 250 fruits, fruit soluble dry matter (%), refractive, total acidity (g of Malic acid/ 100 g fresh matter) iodometric method. Experimental treatments have led to differences in the acidity of the fruit. Thus, the analysis of fertilizer doses on the chemical components of the fruits of the six studied cultivars, we concluded that V 5 and V 6 treatments had a positive influence on pH of the fruits of â€˜Premialâ€™ cv. (3. 460), â€˜Elsantaâ€™ (3. 400) and â€˜Miraâ€™ (3. 460). Treatments induced also, highest average fruit weight in variety â€˜Miraâ€™ (45, 025 g), weight varies as compared to the control (32. 795 g) and from other experimental versions of the same variety. Average dose of fertilizer belonging V 4 and V 5 variants showed the highest values of fruit dry matter content of the variety â€˜Premialâ€™ (65. 55 %), respectively (7. 570 %), higher values the witness variant and other variants analyze...|$|R
40|$|About $ 2 {{billion is}} spent {{each year in}} the Australian economy on fertilizers. About 55 per cent of this {{expenditure}} is on domestically manufactured fertilizers and 45 per cent on imported fertilizers. Value added in basic fertilizer production in 1999 - 2000 is estimated at around $ 260 million â€” about 0. 04 per cent of Australiaâ€™s national income (GDP). A further $ 150 million of value added is generated by <b>fertilizer</b> <b>blending</b> activities, which modify both domestically produced and imported fertilizers for customers. These represent the direct contributions of the fertilizer industry to national income. To measure the total contribution of the fertilizer industry to the economy, both the direct and flow-on effects need to be accounted for. An economy-wide model is used for this purpose. Flow-on effects occur through value added generated in industries that supply inputs to fertilizer manufacture and industries that transform and deliver fertilizers from factories or ports to final users. The model accounts for production and use of domestic and imported fertilizers, th...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{contaminated}} with petroleum by-products {{can now be}} effectively remediated {{using a variety of}} technologies. Among these are in-situ bioremediation, land farming, and landfill/replacing of soil. The range of efficiencies and cost effectiveness of these technologies has been well documented. Exsorbet Plus is showing promise as an in-situ bioremediation agent. It is made of naturally grown Spaghnum Peat Moss which has been activated for encapsulation and <b>blended</b> with nitrogen-rich <b>fertilizer.</b> In its initial field test in Caracas, Venezuela, it was able to remediate crude oil-contaminated soil in 90 days at {{less than half of the}} cost of competing technologies. Waste Solutions, Corp and the US Department of Energy signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to test Exsorbet Plus at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center near Casper, Wyoming. As part of the test, soil {{contaminated with}} crude oil was treated with Exsorbet Plus to aid the in-situ bioremediation process.

40|$|An {{investigation}} to compare sugar blend 1 plus with straight fertilizers (single super phosphate and muriate of potash) as basal fertilizer {{was carried out}} at Hippo Valley Estates in the 2012 / 13 growing season. A 2 x 3 factorial experiment in a Randomised Complete Block Design with 3 replications was used. The first factor was fertilizer type which consisted of two levels, sugar blend 1 plus and straight fertilizer and the second factor was variety with the following levels N 14, Zn 10 and Nco 376. The results showed {{that there was no}} interaction (p< 0. 05) between fertilizer type and variety on number of sugarcane tillers, stalks, sugarcane height and yield. However, there was significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the fertilizer types on number of sugarcane tillers, stalks, sugarcane height and yield. Also varieties had significant difference on yield. Sugar <b>blend</b> 1 plus <b>fertilizer</b> increased the number of tillers, primary stalks, cane height and yield when compared to straight fertilizer. The cane yield in treatments applied sugar blend 1 plus increased by 24 % when compared to use of straight fertilizer, from 87. 2 to 108. 4 tonnes / hectare...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) are {{compounds}} that retard the biological oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by depressing {{the activity of}} Nitrosomonas bacteria in the soil. Many popular NIs such as nitrapyrine (NP), dicyandiamide (DCD) and 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are produced and used in agricultural soils. Dicyandiamide is a very popular NI {{in some of the}} world countries. It delays nitrification process in the soil through its bacterial static property. It is easy to <b>blend</b> with commercial <b>fertilizers</b> such as urea, due to its low volatile nature. Application of urea in combination with nitrification inhibitor DCD lengthens nitrogen presence in soil as ammonium form. It has several beneficial effects for agriculture and enhances environmental protection. Studying the ammonium oxidation kinetics in the presence of nitrification inhibitor DCD can provide the experts in agriculture with very useful information regarding the ammoniumdurability in different soils. This research has been done to study the effect of using NI dicyandiamide on the kinetics of ammoniumloss in some calcareous soils of Chaharmahal Va Bakhtiari province, Iran. Materials and Methods: This research was conducted as factorial using completely randomized design with two factors of nitrogen fertilizer type and soil type with three replications at laboratory conditions. In this experiment, nitrogen fertilizer type included 2 levels of: 1 - urea 2 - urea plus nitrification inhibitor DCD (3. 2...|$|R

The experiment was carried out in a complete randomized block design with four replications, in a (6 x 4) + 1 factorial arrangement: six N sources (ammonium nitrate; urea; 50 % urea + 50 % ammonium sulfate; urea + urease inhibitor - NBPT; urea + slow-release polymer; and ammonium sulfonitrate + nitrification inhibitor - dimetil pirazol phosphate), four times of broadcast application (100 % right after emergence; 50 % right after emergence + 50 % in phase B 1 - first floral bud; 100 % in phase B 1; and 50 % in phase B 1 + 50 % in phase F 1 - first flower), and one control. None of the alternative N sources tested resulted in yields higher than the conventional sources (urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate). The highest yield was achieved when the N was applied earlier and split into two applications (50 % right after emergence + 50 % in phase B 1). Single N application was more efficient only when using urea + slow-release polymer. 201...|$|R
