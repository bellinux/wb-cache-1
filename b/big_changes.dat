5|$|The 1940s, {{including}} World War II and its aftermath, brought <b>big</b> <b>changes</b> to BGSU. The war {{caused a}} drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing {{the lack of}} male students. The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falcon’s Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport. Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities {{to take part in}} the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war. The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college courses as well as naval training. Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs. Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives.|$|E
5|$|In his {{autobiography}} Belgrano {{declared that he}} did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment took him by surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to make <b>big</b> <b>changes</b> in the social order. One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Games, she competed {{in a warm}} up event in Switzerland, and set Australian records in the 100m, 400m and 800m events. At the 2004 games, she won a bronze medal in the T53 100m, behind Tanni Grey-Thompson and Francesca Porcellato. Her goal for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics was to set a {{personal}} best, but she also had eyes on a medal. She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her team mates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100m relay. In the individual events, she finished fifth in the women's T53 100m event (a race won in world record time by Huang Lisha), seventh in the women's T53 200m event (also won in a world record time by Huang), seventh in the women's T53 400m event, and led out the women's 800m final, eventually finishing sixth. After a couple of sub-par competition results in 2011, Ballard made <b>big</b> <b>changes</b> to her diet, gloves, technique, chair position, and training regime. She entered the 2012 London Paralympics ranked world number one in both the T53 100m and 200m. At the games, Ballard participated in the T53 class events for 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m events. She won two silver medals in the 200m and 400m T53 events, and a bronze medal in the 100m T53 event.|$|E

25|$|One of Democritus' {{arguments}} {{in support of}} atomism was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam.

The presence of Castillo de San Marcos, a coquina fort built by the Spanish and now controlled by the U.S. military and renamed Fort Marion, brought a larger military presence to town. A decade after Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, {{the need for more}} and better visitor accommodations became pressing. Local residents began advertising rooms for rent with board (meals) included. This kind of lodging was in most cases a step above staying at a hotel.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, in a {{move that}} heralded <b>big</b> <b>changes</b> within the sport, one of the {{original}} VFL clubs, South Melbourne, relocated to Sydney and became known as the Sydney Swans. In the late 1980s, due to the poor financial standing of many of the Victorian clubs, the VFL pursued a more national competition. Two more non-Victorian clubs, West Coast and Brisbane, joined the league in 1987. In their early years, the Sydney and Brisbane clubs struggled both on and off-field because the substantial TV revenues they generated by playing on a Sunday went to the VFL. To protect these revenues the VFL granted significant draft concessions and financial aid to keep the expansion clubs competitive. Each club was required to pay a licence fee which allowed the Victorian-based clubs to survive.|$|E
