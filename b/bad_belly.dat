5000|$|Overall, Badjelly's Bad Christmas {{received}} {{very good}} reviews, {{and all the}} critics seemed to agree {{that it was a}} very good show, if a little crazy.The Stage magazine said [...] "The nonsense of Spike Milligan meets the madness of Chickenshed and the results are suitably deranged." [...] They went on to say [...] "Dave Carey has achieved the playwright's equivalent of nailing jelly to a wall", and as for the signers, they said [...] "it's all duplicated just to the side of the main action as three brilliant young performers not just sign but enact the entire piece in a virtual mini play within a play." [...] However, they also said [...] "A little more fire in its <b>bad</b> <b>belly</b> in the first half and a little less from the band - in danger of drowning out those hilarious lyrics - and Iâ€™m sure Milligan will be dancing and blowing raspberries from the wings."A Younger Theatre said [...] "It's a little off-the-wall, but absolutely a joy and delight to watch." [...] and commented on the energy of the cast, [...] "It's fun, it's bursting with imagination, and the cast gives more energy in one single show than half of the shows I saw last year put together", the staging [...] "Where Badjelly really excels is the continual revealing of new devices, characters, and methods of presenting the story to the audience", and the signers [...] "The on-stage signing ... was excellently presented to be part of the action". They also commented on the attitude of the performers and staff [...] "It's not often that a venue affects me as much as a show, but you can tell that rooted at the heart of Badjelly's Bad Christmas is the support, determination and love from the staff and the young people involved." [...] This was generally considered one of the best reviews the show got.|$|E
5000|$|In Shaun Healey's webcomic EverAfter, Little Red Riding Hood is {{depicted}} as having gone insane inside the Big <b>Bad</b> Wolf's <b>belly,</b> and emerged a violent sociopath who chopped up the woodsman with his own saw, {{and needed to be}} placed in the EverAfter Maximum Security Asylum, along with other twisted fairy tale characters ranging from Tom Thumb to Goldilocks, Hansel and Gretel, Miss Muffet, etc., all under the care of President Humpty Dumpty and Dr. Crooked (from a nursery rhyme).|$|R
5000|$|As noted earlier, Tulu {{is one of}} {{the five}} Dravidian languages. It is unclear exactly where it is derived from however it is {{believed}} to have come from a predecessor such as one of the elder languages in the Dravidian family. Many of the words, however, are unique to the Tuluvas. These include the words for house, good, <b>belly,</b> <b>bad.</b> The unique part of Tulu is that it uses many other languages and incorporates certain words and phrases. The blend makes for a special originality that other languages simply don't possess. The openness reflects its people mentality and overall outlook on life. 1 words include patience, bundle, and trust which are all verbal derivatives of the language. Other derivatives include stupidity, goodness, and greatness.|$|R
