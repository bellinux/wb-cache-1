5|$|In 1987, the Norwegian Polar Institute sent five {{scientists}} to spend eleven {{days on the}} island. The main focuses were aerial photography and topographical measurements to allow an accurate map of the island to be produced. The second important area was marine biological investigations, although also geological, biological and other surveys were conducted. The team also built an automatic weather station. Three DX-peditions have <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, in 1987, 1994 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Polish Jews was aware that Bełżec and Treblinka had been closed, dismantled and all remaining prisoners had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gas-chambers and they suspected that Sobibor would be next. There was a great urgency in {{coming up with a}} good escape plan, and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. The escape had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant Gustav Wagner went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover the escape plan.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakr {{was born}} around 1321 to his sultan father an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310–1341) and his {{concubine}} mother, Narjis. Narjis also {{gave birth to}} Abu Bakr's younger full brothers Ramadan (died 1343) and Yusuf (died 1346). Information about Abu Bakr's early childhood is unavailable in the Mamluk sources. The first mention of Abu Bakr came in 1332. At that time, Abu Bakr had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> desert fortress of al-Karak to join his half-brothers Ahmad and Ibrahim in their military training. Also during that year, Abu Bakr left al-Karak to accompany his father and half-brothers Anuk and Ahmad at al-Aqaba {{and from there to}} Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, an-Nasir Muhammad had them return to al-Karak before the trek to Mecca.|$|E
5|$|During {{a series}} of combats held to {{celebrate}} King Joffrey Baratheon's name day, the captive Sansa Stark saves the drunkard Ser Dontos Hollard's life by convincing Joffrey {{to make him a}} fool instead of killing him. The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Tyrion Lannister, who has <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital to act as Hand of the King in his father's stead. Cersei is furious, but accepts the new situation after her brother assures her that he will only act as an advisor. When Tyrion learns that Cersei has let Arya Stark escape after the execution of her father, he mocks her for throwing away two valuable hostages, as he'd planned to trade the girls for Jaime.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the RAAF airmen operating {{as part of the}} RAF in the UK, hundreds of Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel were serving with the Royal Navy (RN) {{at the time of the}} Battle of Normandy. No Australian warships took part in the operation, however. Most of the Australian officers serving with the RN were members of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RANVR). Four RAN sub-lieutenants who had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK to undergo training were also assigned to RN landing craft units to help address a shortage of officers capable of coordinating operations by these vessels.|$|E

The Claws' best known player, Mel Daniels, was disappointed at the Claws' fate and retired rather than play for another team. In Terry Pluto's book on the ABA, [...] "Loose Balls", Daniels recalled that the Claws' players were allowed to take equipment and furniture from the team office in lieu of payment.|$|R
5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September Sercey raided Banda Aceh, {{capturing}} {{a number}} of merchant ships and on 7 September seized the small merchant ship Favourite off the northeastern coast of Sumatra en route to attack the British port of Penang. The following morning, as his squadron transferred rice from the prize, two large sails appeared in {{the distance to the}} northeast. These sails belonged to the 74-gun British ships of the line HMS Arrogant under Captain Richard Lucas and HMS Victorious under Captain William Clark. These ships had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Indies from the Cape at the start of August on orders from Elphinstone and were engaged in protecting British trade with China. When news reached Penang that Sercey was in the region, Lucas ordered Clark to join him in a search for the French in the Straits of Malacca.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Naktong Bulge area.

Elements of the 35th Division subsequently fought in the Battles of Biak and Sansapor, {{but most of the}} division was stationed on the Vogelkop Peninsula where it was isolated from September 1944. The 32nd Division was retained at Halmahera to garrison the island. Much of the division later saw action on the neighboring island of Morotai, where it suffered heavy losses while trying to counterattack an Allied force which had established a base there during September and October 1944.|$|E

5|$|The White Guards {{executed}} Red Guard {{and party}} leaders, common Red troopers, socialist {{members of the}} Finnish parliament and local Red administration, and those active in the Red terror. The level of killings varied over the months as they conquered southern Finland, and initially did not encounter marked resistance in White Finland. The comprehensive White terror started with the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918, increased constantly, culminated {{in the end of}} the war and ceased soon after the enemy had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prison camps. During the peak of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White terror hit strong against the Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the aftermath of the Battle for Viipuri.|$|E

5|$|The {{highly trained}} 4th Division faced a mediocre German unit {{composed}} of conscripts; {{all the best}} troops had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front. The Allies achieved and maintained air superiority, which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of preparations underway in Britain prior to the invasion and were unable to launch airborne counterassaults on D-Day. Extensive Allied reconnaissance provided the attackers with detailed maps of the defenses and terrain. Unlike neighboring Omaha, the preliminary aerial bombardment was highly effective at Utah. Indecisiveness and an overcomplicated command structure {{on the part of}} the German high command was also a factor in the Allied success at Utah and throughout the Normandy campaign.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Roman Catholic minority, Phát joined the French-backed Vietnamese National Army which became the ARVN after the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) was established. After having <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. for further {{training}} in 1958, Phát returned home to head the Civil Guard, a paramilitary force then mostly used to protect the ruling family of President Ngô Đình Diệm, rather than to counteract the communist Việt Cộng insurgency. Later commanding the 2nd Division, he {{was known for his}} loyalty to Diệm, who favored fellow Catholics. In 1963, Diệm knew some of the generals were about to launch a coup against him. He appointed Phát to command the 7th Division, located near the capital, Saigon, so he could help in the fighting, but the plotters successfully used delaying tactics so that the paperwork for the transfer of the division leadership could not occur before they proceeded to overthrow and execute Diệm. Despite Phát's pro-Diệm allegiance he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Division.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} capture of Schuckmannsburg in the Caprivi Strip by a {{combined}} force of BSAP and Northern Rhodesia Police on 21 September 1914, the British South Africa Company's own armed forces and police remained almost totally uninvolved in the war until the following month. The South African Prime Minister, the former Boer general Louis Botha, had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South-West Africa without help, so the Imperial garrison had <b>been</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Western Front. Lieutenant-Colonel Manie Maritz—an ex-Boer commander who now headed a column of Afrikaans-speaking Union troops—defected to the Germans in mid-September, hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old Boer Republics. Botha requested the 500-man column that the Chartered Company had raised, hoping to reduce the possibility of further defections by interspersing his own forces with firmly pro-British Rhodesians. The expeditionary force was promptly formalised in Salisbury, and named the 1st Rhodesia Regiment after the unit of Southern Rhodesian volunteers that had fought in the Anglo-Boer War. Apart from a small contingent of Matabele (or Ndebele) scouts, the unit was all white.|$|E
