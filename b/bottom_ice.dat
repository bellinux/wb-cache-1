This method to estimate the oceanic heat flux is only controlled by observed ice thickness, which can overcome the calculated bias caused by the technique error of observed temperature and the empirical parameters in other methods.

40|$|Extreme {{seasonal}} {{changes in}} light conditions {{are among the}} key characteristics of high Arctic ecosystems with far-reaching implications for their potential to generate biomass via photosynthetic primary production. As a result, Arctic ecosystems are usually characterized by a very short productive period during spring/summer that provides the entire annual biomass production available for higher trophic levels. Of particular ecological importance is the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> algae bloom, which provides a pulse of primary production when no other significant food source exists in the marine ecosystem.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{short-term}} variations of sea ice microalgal biomass and nutrients, in Adélie Land coastal area (Antarctica). The annual land-fast ice, platelet ice-like layer (PLI) and under-lying seawater were sampled during the 1999 austral spring. The study was conducted during 33 days preceding the ice break-up, with a daily sampling when the meteorological conditions were favourable. Time-series for salinity, chlorophyll a (Chl a), NH 4 +, NO 2 &# 8722;, NO 3 &# 8722;, PO 4 &# 8722; and Si(OH) 4 are shown. We also provide satellite data and meteorological variables for the same period. During the study period, the solid ice thickness varied from 1. 47 to 1. 05 m. Pigments were concentrated in <b>bottom</b> <b>ice,</b> but progressively invaded the PLI. Phaeo a increased in the PLI during the last weeks, in parallel with increasing NO 2 &# 8722; concentration. Si(OH) 4, in lowest concentrations in <b>bottom</b> <b>ice,</b> increased progressively in the under-ice water (UIW) and PLI, this was because of offshore water inputs. NH 4 + concentrations were high in every sea ice component (particularly in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice)</b> and were inversely correlated to pigments in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice.</b> NH 4 + concentrations progressively increased in the PLI and underlying seawater just before the break-up. In the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice,</b> PO 4 &# 8722; concentrations were related to high pigment concentrations, but with a short lag close to the break up period, indicating in situ regeneration. Neither NO 3 &# 8722; nor NH 4 + concentrations were exhausted in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice.</b> NO 2 &# 8722; and NH 4 + concentrations increased in PLI and under-ice water just before the break-up period, which might indicate strong inorganic nitrogen recycling in land-fast ice.

40|$|We {{monitored}} the spatiotemporal progression of chromophoric {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) in first-year sea ice in the western Canadian Arctic between mid-March and early July 2008. CDOM abundance in <b>bottom</b> <b>ice,</b> as quantified by absorption coefficient at 325 nm, a(CDOM) (325), showed a positive, linear relationship with the concentration of chlorophyll a, being low {{at the start of}} ice algal accumulation, highly enriched during the peak bloom and early post-bloom, and depleted again during sea ice melting. Vertical profiles of CDOM in early and late spring were typically characterized by slight to moderate elevations at both the surface and bottom and rather constancy within the interior ice. In the ice algae-thriving mid-spring, L-type profiles prevailed due to extremely high CDOM in the lowermost 10 -cm layer. Bottom-layer CDOM in landfast ice (a(CDOM) (325) : 15. 8 m(- 1)) more than doubled that in drift ice (a(CDOM) (325) : 6. 6 m(- 1)). CDOM in the ice cover, except the bottom layer, was generally lower than or similar to that in the under-ice surface water. Salinity accounted for 58 % of the CDOM variability in drift ice having minimal terrestrial and ice algal signatures. CDOM absorption spectra of algaerich <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> samples exhibited ultraviolet (UV) absorption shoulders attributable to mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). These compounds were readily photodegradable by solar UV radiation. Our results suggest that 1) inclusion of organic solutes and in situ biological production are the dominant processes controlling the distribution of CDOM in sea ice in the study area, 2) biological production in <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> is a minor source of CDOM to the underlying surface water; 3) CDOM plays a critical role in shielding sympagic organisms in <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> against UV radiation; 4) the MAAs are effective photoprotectants only under low-UV conditions.

40|$|The coastal sea {{ice in the}} {{vicinity}} of Davis Station, Antarctica (68 * 35 ' S, 77 * 58 ' E), supported a diverse microbial community which varied in composition and biomass in response to increasing insolation and temperature during the austral summer. To understand more fully the fate of photosynthetically fixed carbon in sea ice, we examined the dynamics of community composition, biomass and production in autotrophs, heterotrophic protozoa and bacteria. The microbial community inhabiting the bottom few centimeters of land fast ice differed markedly from the interior communities in taxonomic composition and biomass and in the timing and fate of production. Total microbial biomass integrated throughout the ice depth declined during the season from a mean of 1150 mg C m- 2 on 17 November to 628 mg C m- 2 by 22 December. This largely reflected a decrease in the biomass of the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> community which was dominated by the diatom Entomoneis spp. In contrast, the biomass of the interior ice community increased during summer and was dominated by autotrophic forms < 20 um in length with a small dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium sp., becoming particularly abundant. Heterotrophic protozoa, composed of mainly nanoflagellate, euglenoid and dinoflagellate taxa, contributed between 16 and 19 % of the total integrated microbial biomass in the interior ice and between 1 and 11 % in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice.</b> The biomass of heterotrophic protozoa increased throughout the ice depth during summer and estimated taxon-specific net growth rates ranged between 0. 168 d- 1 for a heterotrophic euglenoid and 0. 05 d- 1 for the heterotrophic nanoflagellate population over a 23 d period. Bacterial biomass varied by several orders of magnitude between ice depths mainly due to the occurrence of an abundant population of large epiphytic bacteria attached to Entomoneis spp. in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice.</b> However, bacterial biomass contributed a similar proportion of between 4 and 16 % of the total microbial biomass in both interior and <b>bottom</b> <b>ice.</b> The biomass of unattached bacteria increased throughout the ice depth during summer and exhibited an estimated net growth rate of 0. 05 d- 1.

Our observations revealed significant changes in sea ice and sackhole brine carbonate system parameters that were associated with increasing temperatures and the buildup of chlorophyll a in <b>bottom</b> <b>ice.</b> The warming sea-ice column could be separated into distinct geochemical zones where biotic and abiotic processes exerted different influences on inorganic carbon and pCO 2 distributions. In the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice,</b> biological carbon uptake maintained undersaturated pCO 2 conditions throughout the time series, while pCO 2 was supersaturated in the upper ice. Low CO 2 permeability of the sea ice matrix and snow cover effectively impeded CO 2 efflux to the atmosphere, despite a strong pCO 2 gradient. Throughout the middle of the ice column, brine pCO 2 decreased significantly with time and was tightly controlled by solubility, as sea ice temperature and in situ melt dilution increased. Once the influence of melt dilution was accounted for, both CaCO 3 dissolution and seawater mixing were found to contribute alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon to brines, with the CaCO 3 contribution driving brine pCO 2 to values lower than predicted from melt-water dilution alone. This field study reveals a dynamic carbon system within the rapidly warming sea ice, prior to snow melt. We suggest that the early spring period drives the ice column toward pCO 2 undersaturation, contributing to a weak atmospheric CO 2 sink as the melt period advances.

By pigment analysis, β-carotene, chlorophylls a and c, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and fucoxanthin were detected as major pigments, which suggests that diatoms dominated as ice algae during this study. When such ice algae were exposed to irradiance nearly 4 {{times higher than the}} daily maximum level at the <b>ice</b> <b>bottom,</b> the interconversion between diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin continued for ca. 20 min immediately after the onset of irradiation in spite of the sub-zero Celsius ambient temperature.

40|$|Abstract Sea ice covers {{approximately}} 5 % of {{the ocean}} surface {{and is one of}} the most extensive ecosystems on the planet. The microbial communities that live in sea ice represent an important food source for numerous organisms at a time of year when phytoplankton in the water column are scarce. Here we describe the distributions and physiology of sea ice microalgae in the poorly studied Amundsen Sea sector of the Southern Ocean. Microalgal biomass was relatively high in sea ice in the Amundsen Sea, due primarily to well developed surface communities that would have been replenished with nutrients during seawater flooding of the surface as a result of heavy snow accumulation. Elevated biomass was also occasionally observed in slush, interior, and <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> microhabitats throughout the region. Sea ice microalgal photophysiology appeared to be controlled by the availability of both light and nutrients. Surface communities used an active xanthophyll cycle and effective pigment sunscreens to protect themselves from harmful ultraviolet and visible radiation. Acclimation to low light microhabitats in sea ice was facilitated by enhanced pigment content per cell, greater photosynthetic accessory pigments, and increased photosynthetic efficiency. Photoacclimation was especially effective in the <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> community, where ready access to nutrients would have allowed ice microalgae to synthesize a more efficient photosynthetic apparatus. Surprisingly, the pigment-detected prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica was an important component of surface communities (slush and surface ponds) where its acclimation to high light may precondition it to seed phytoplankton blooms after the sea ice melts in spring...|$|E

In the presence of high <b>bottom</b> <b>ice</b> algal biomass in mid-spring, DOC and CO exhibited high concentrations in the bottom (DOC: 563 +/- 434 mu mol L- 1; CO: 82. 9 +/- 84 nmol L- 1) relative to the surface (DOC: 56 +/- 26 mu mol L- 1; CO: 16. 8 +/- 7 nmol L- 1). Landfast ice contained higher levels of DOC and CO than drifting ice. Cruise-mean DOC and CO inventories in sea ice were 87 +/- 51 mu mol m(- 2) and 13. 9 +/- 10 mu mol m(- 2), respectively. Net productions of DOC and CO linked to the ice algal bloom were assessed to be 75 mu mol m(- 2) and 13. 2 mu mol m(- 2). Sea ice in the study area was estimated to contribute 7. 4 x 10 (7) moles of CO a(- 1) to the atmosphere. This study suggests that sea ice plays important roles in the cycling of organic carbon and trace gases...|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} theory {{states that the}} canyon was likely formed by either water or lava, with the flow from south to north and {{additional}} material flowing from the slope toward the valley floor. According to the most popular theory, linear features on the valley <b>bottom</b> indicate possible <b>ice</b> flows and that ice may currently be plentiful. Mamers Valles is dated to the early Hesperian period, about 3.8 billion years ago.|$|R
5000|$|Simon Lake {{equipped}} Nautilus {{with several}} clever devices for under-ice operations. One was a mechanical probe, {{much like a}} trolley pole, that would scrape along the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>ice</b> cap to indicate how much clearance the submarine had below the ice. Others included drills supposedly capable of cutting through 13 ft of ice to reach fresh air. [...] These innovations were tested only cursorily before the boat put to sea.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, {{the hull}} {{was divided into}} eight {{watertight}} compartments protected by a continuous double <b>bottom.</b> The <b>ice</b> belt consisted of [...] thick shell plating and transverse frames every [...] The main and auxiliary engine rooms were located amidships below the main deck with the propulsion motors in their own watertight compartments. The remaining space was taken up by tanks for fuel and lubricating oil, fresh water and ballast. While Sisu was designed to operate with a crew of 51 during the winter season, she could accommodate more than 100 persons during the summer season when the vessel operated as a submarine tender. Like the other Finnish icebreakers, Sisu was fitted with a towing winch and a notch where {{the bow of the}} escorted ship could be pulled.|$|R
