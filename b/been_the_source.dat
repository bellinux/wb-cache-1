5|$|The US media's {{links to}} Thảo have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of {{historical}} debate. The journalists' reporting of Diệm's authoritarian rule, military failures, and attacks on Buddhists shifted American {{public opinion and}} put pressure on Washington to withdraw support for the Ngô family and seek a change of leadership. William Prochnau felt that the fall of Diệm was the biggest influence of the media on American foreign policy in over six decades. Thảo and Phạm Xuân Ẩn had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> {{of much of the}} media's information. Conservative revisionist historians have accused the media of bringing down Diệm by publishing reports that, according to them, were based on false data disseminated by communist propagandists to unfairly malign Diệm's rule, which they claim was effective and fair towards the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Asteroids in the {{asteroid}} belt are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as their partners. The asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets, which may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of Earth's water.|$|E

Chris also appears in the 2017 {{computer}} animated film , set in the same continuity as the video games, {{as one of the}} co-protagonists. The character has been well received by critics, being {{considered one of the most}} important characters in the franchise, and recognized for his sex appeal. His redesign in Resident Evil 5 has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of both praise and criticism from critics and fans alike.|$|E

5|$|In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved {{north to}} attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took {{advantage}} of the situation to return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788.

5|$|Molluscs {{have been}} and still are an {{important}} food source for anatomically modern humans. However {{there is a risk}} of food poisoning from toxins which can accumulate in certain molluscs under specific conditions, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. Molluscs have, for centuries, also <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to {{get a copy of}} the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava. Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte lava flows and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, sulfide-bearing rhyolitic tuffs and a few thin hawaiite lava flows. This activity was concentrated at {{the summit of the}} volcano as shown by the increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A hydrothermally altered aphyric trachyte dike, which forms a narrow ridge linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for these eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.|$|E

5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential confirmation {{of the need to}} reform the Julian calendar. The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Opel {{had also}} <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of many Holden models. To {{increase}} profitability, Holden {{looked to the}} South Korean Daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a 44.6percent stake—worth US$251million—in the company in 2002 {{as a representative of}} GM. This was increased to 50.9percent in 2005, but when GM further increased its stake to 70.1percent around the time of its 2009 Chapter 11 reorganisation, Holden's interest was relinquished and transferred to another (undisclosed) part of GM.|$|E

5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a cypher {{clerk at}} the Soviet Union's embassy in Ottawa, and his family {{defected}} to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing Soviet intelligence (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and uranium-235 to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; Fred Rose, a member of parliament; and NRC scientists Israel Halperin, Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith. Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence {{that he was a}} Soviet agent has ever been established, but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn May could not have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source,</b> and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect. When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more cautious about sharing information with Britain and Canada.|$|E
