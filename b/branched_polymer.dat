40|$|The {{behavior}} of annealed <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> near adsorbing surfaces plays {{a fundamental role in}} many biological and industrial processes. Most importantly single stranded RNA in solution tends to fold up and self-bind {{to form a}} highly branched structure. Using a mean field theory, we both perturbatively and numerically examine the adsorption of <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> on surfaces of several different geometries in a good solvent. Independent of the geometry of the wall, we observe that as branching density increases, surface tension decreases. However, we find a coupling between the branching density and curvature in that a further lowering of surface tension occurs when the wall curves towards the polymer, but the amount of lowering of surface tension decreases when the wall curves away from the polymer. We find that for <b>branched</b> <b>polymers</b> confined into spherical cavities, most of branch-points are located {{in the vicinity of the}} interior wall and the surface tension is minimized for a critical cavity radius.

50|$|Catalytic {{polymerization}} {{appears to}} have the most control compared to other polymerization methods for randomly functionalized polyolefins. Catalytic routes predominantly undergo a coordination/migratory insertion pathway. The functionality of the olefin highly affects the reactivity of the olefin, and hence its relative rate of coordination. Examples of early transition metal catalysts includes titanium and zirconium complexes. Early transition metals can easily form oxides; therefore, protection groups, like the use of methylaluminoxane (MAO) due to its Lewis acidity, can be used to prevent side reactions from happening. As a cocatalyst, MAO is well known for their use in metallocene chemistry as they activate metallocene complexes for olefin polymerization. To remove the MAO protecting group, the reaction can be treated with acid. Instead of MAO, trimethylsilyl (TMS) have also been used to protection functional groups such as amine, since the amine functionality can easily react with other olefins to form <b>branched</b> <b>polymer</b> chains.|$|E
5000|$|Practically all polyolefins {{that are}} of any {{practical}} or commercial importance are poly-alpha-olefin (or poly-α-olefin or polyalphaolefin, sometimes abbreviated as PAO), a polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. An alpha-olefin (or α-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the α-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule. Alpha-olefins such as 1-hexene {{may be used as}} co-monomers to give a alkyl <b>branched</b> <b>polymer</b> (see chemical structure below), although 1-decene is most commonly used for lubricant base stocks. [...] Many poly-alpha-olefins have flexible alkyl branching groups on every other carbon of their polymer backbone chain. These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous conformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align themselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact surface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular interactions between molecules. Therefore, many poly-alpha-olefins do not crystallize or solidify easily and are able to remain oily, viscous liquids even at lower temperatures. [...] Low molecular weight poly-alpha-olefins are useful as synthetic lubricants such as synthetic motor oils for vehicles and can be used over a wide temperature range.|$|E

He has contributed {{at the highest}} level to particle physics, computer science, fluid mechanics, theoretical immunology, etc. etc. Today we honor him for his outstanding contributions to statistical physics, and particularly to the theories of phase transitions and of disordered systems. Among these many contributions, I would specifically mention Parisi's early work in which he showed how conformal invariance {{can be used in a}} quantitative way to calculate critical exponents. He was also the first to really understand that one can derive critical exponents through expansions of the beta function at fixed dimensions, avoiding the convergence problems of the epsilon-expansion. The opened the way to the current best theoretical estimates of exponents. Another important achievement concerns the mapping of the <b>branched</b> <b>polymer</b> problem in d dimensions onto that of the Lee-Yang edge singularity on d &minus; 2 dimensions. Most recently, Parisi's work on interfaces in disordered media and on the dynamics of growing interfaces has had a large impact on these fields. However, Parisi's deepest contribution concerns the solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean field model for spin glasses. After the crisis caused by the unacceptable properties of the simple solutions, which used the [...] "replication trick", Parisi proposed his replica symmetry breaking solution, which seems to be exact, although much more complex than anticipated. Later, Parisi and co-workers Mezard and Virasoro clarified greatly the physical meaning of the mysterious mathematics involved in this scheme, in terms of the probability distribution of overlaps and the ultrametric structure of the configuration space. This achievement forms one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of disordered systems. This discovery opened the doors to vast areas of application. e.g., in optimization problems and in neural network theories.The Boltzmann Medal for 1992 is hereby awarded to Giorgio Parisi for his fundamental contributions to statistical physics, and particularly for his solution of the mean field theory of spin glasses." ...|$|E
