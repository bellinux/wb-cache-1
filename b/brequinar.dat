In this study investigating the pharmacokinetic and toxicity of <b>brequinar</b> in combination with cisplatin, patients were initially treated with weekly <b>brequinar,</b> in combination with an every-three-week administration of cisplatin. Due to toxicity, the schedule was modified to a 28 -day cycle with <b>brequinar</b> given on days 1, 8, 15, and cisplatin on day 1. A total of 24 patients (16 male, 8 female; median age 57; median performance status 1) received 69 courses of therapy. Six dose levels were explored, with cisplatin/ <b>brequinar</b> doses, respectively, of 50 / 500, 50 / 650, 50 / 860, 60 / 860, 75 / 650, and 75 / 860 mg/m 2. The serum concentration versus time curves for <b>brequinar</b> were biphasic. A comparison of the pharmacokinetic results after the first and third doses of <b>brequinar</b> indicate that the presence of 50, 60, and 75 mg/m 2 cisplatin did not change the protein binding and the pharmacokinetics of <b>brequinar</b> in any of the three brequinar-dose groups. Total cisplatin plasma pharmacokinetic followed a triphasic-shape curve and unbound cisplatin decayed at a very rapid rate. Since pharmacokinetic parameters for total cisplatin in this study were similar to those reported in the literature, the presence of <b>brequinar</b> is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin. Main dose-limiting toxicities included myelosuppression (including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and mucositis. Cisplatin/brequinar doses of 50 / 500, 50 / 650, 50 / 860, 60 / 860, 75 / 650, and 75 / 860 mg/m 2, were associated with dose limiting toxicity in 0 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3, 2 / 4, 2 / 5, and 4 / 6 patients, respectively. This study shows that co-administration of <b>brequinar</b> and cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetic properties of either drug and that the MTDs of cisplatin/brequinar combinations are 60 / 860 mg/m 2 or 75 / 650 mg/m 2.

Using dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV- 2) as a model, we found that <b>brequinar</b> suppressed the viral infection cycle mainly at the step of RNA synthesis. Supplementing the culture medium with pyrimidines (cytidine or uridine) but not purines (adenine or guanine) could be used to reverse the inhibitory effect of the compound. Continuous culturing of DENV- 2 in the presence of <b>brequinar</b> generated viruses that were partially resistant to the inhibitor. Sequencing of the resistant viruses revealed two amino acid mutations: one mutation (M 260 V) located at a helix in the domain II of the viral envelope protein and another mutation (E 802 Q) located at the priming loop of the nonstructural protein 5 (NS 5) polymerase domain. Functional analysis of the mutations suggests that the NS 5 mutation exerts resistance through enhancement of polymerase activity. The envelope protein mutation reduced the efficiency of virion assembly/release; however, the mutant virus became less sensitive to <b>brequinar</b> inhibition at the step of virion assembly/release.

This result was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assays and analysis of time-regulated expression of a reporter gene under the control of a virus promoter. Both assays revealed nearly 90 % inhibition of late gene expression. BQR also blocked virus DNA replication, which accounted for the subsequent inhibition of virus late gene expression. The ablation of virus DNA replication, late gene expression and infectious progeny production was restored to control levels when infected cells were co-treated with uridine (URD) and BQR.

Their general structure is characterized by a biphenyl moiety joined through an amide bridge with an acidic hydroxyazole scaffold (hydroxylated thiadiazole, pyrazole and triazole). Molecular modelling suggested that these structures should adopt a brequinar-like binding mode involving interactions with subsites 1, 2 and 4 of the hDHODH binding site. Initially, the inhibitory activity of the compounds was studied on recombinant hDHODH. The most potent compound of the series in the enzymatic assays was the thiadiazole analogue 4 (IC 5016 nM).

As rapidly proliferating human T cells have an exceptional requirement for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, small molecule DHODH inhibitors constitute an attractive therapeutic approach to autoimmune diseases, immunosuppression, and cancer. Neither the structure of human DHODH nor any member of its family was known. Results: The high-resolution crystal structures of human DHODH in complex with two different inhibitors have been solved. The initial set of phases was obtained using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing with selenomethionine-containing DHODH. The structures have been refined to crystallographic R factors of 16. 8 % and 16. 2 % at resolutions of 1. 6 Å and 1. 8 Å for inhibitors related to <b>brequinar</b> and leflunomide, respectively. Conclusions: Human DHODH has two domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms {{the opening of a}} tunnel leading to the active site. Both inhibitors share a common binding site in this tunnel, and differences in the binding region govern drug sensitivity or resistance. The active site of human DHODH is generally {{similar to that of the}} previously reported bacterial active site.

Table I gives an overview of currently inves-tigated or already clinically tested new therapeutic approaches in autoimmune diseases. New developments {{in the area of}} immunosuppressive drugs can be divided into agents inhibiting lymphokine synthesis such as cyclosporin A or FK 506; agents suppressing lymphokine signal transduction including rapamycin and the isoxazol-derivative leflunomide; compounds inhibiting nucleoside synthesis such as mizorbine, <b>brequinar</b> and mycophenolic acid, and finally agents affecting lymphocyte differentiation such as 15 -deoxyspergualin [1]. Most of these new pharma-cological compounds have to date been tested in transplant medicine; only cyclosporin A has thus far been shown to be an efficient immunosuppressive agent also in autoimmune disease. Furthermore, new nitrogenoxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors such as N-monomethyl-i-argininc have successfully been ap-plied in, for example, the streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis [2]. With regard to treatment approaches to inhibit lymphokine synthesis it was recently demonstrated that two antisense oligonucle-otides complementary to the mRNAs of interleukin (IL) - 2 and ICAM- 1 effectively inhibited immune re-sponses, both in vivo and in vitro [3]. This molecular therapeutic approach offers a new possibility for a selective therapy of autoimmune diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Brequinar</b> sodium (BQR) {{has been}} shown {{recently}} to be a potent immunosuppressive agent. This property {{has been attributed to}} the capacity of BQR to inhibit de novo pyrimidine nucleoside biosynthesis and consequently, to blockade the synthesis both of DNA and RNA. The influence of this new immunosuppressant on lymphocyte function has not been fully characterized. To determine the potential efficacy of BQR for the control of antibody-mediated graft rejection, which is of particular significance in the context of xenotransplantation, we have examined the influence of the drug on interleukin- 6 -dependent IgM production by the human B-cell line, SKW 6. 4. At concentrations up to 10 micrograms/ml, BQR did not affect concanavalin A (Con A) -induced human peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation or IL- 6 production by blood mononuclear leucocytes. In contrast, the drug was very effective in inhibiting IL- 6 -stimulated IgM production by SKW 6. 4 cells, with an optimal inhibitory concentration of 0. 3 microgram/ml. As expected, addition of exogenous uridine (0. 1 mM), the precursor of uridine triphosphate (UTP), reversed the inhibitory effect of BQR on antibody production, while cytidine (0. 1 mM) potentiated the inhibitory activity of the drug. It was further demonstrated that the inhibition of IgM production was unrelated to DNA synthesis, indicating that BQR may affect IL- 6 signal transduction and IgM production in SKW 6. 4 cells independent of any effect on cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The flavin enzyme dihydroorotate {{dehydrogenase}} (DHOD; EC 1. 3. 99. 11) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate, {{the fourth}} {{step in the}} de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis of UMP. The enzyme is a promising target for drug design in different biological and clinical applications for cancer and arthritis. The first crystal structure of the class 2 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from rat has been determined in complex with its two inhibitors <b>brequinar</b> and atovaquone. These inhibitors have shown promising results as anti-proliferative, immunosuppressive, and antiparasitic agents. A unique feature of the class 2 DHODs is their N-terminal extension, which folds into a separate domain comprising two α-helices. This domain serves as the binding site for the two inhibitors and the respiratory quinones acting as the second substrate for the class 2 DHODs. The orientation of the first N-terminal helix is very different in the two complexes of rat DHOD (DHODR). Binding of atovaquone causes a 12 Å movement of the first residue in the first α-helix. Based on {{the information from the}} two structures of DHODR, a model for binding of the quinone and the residues important for the interactions could be defined. His 56 and Arg 136, which are fully conserved in all class 2 DHODs, seem to {{play a key role in}} the interaction with the electron acceptor. The differences between the membrane-bound rat DHOD and membrane-associated class 2 DHODs exemplified by the Escherichia coli DHOD has been investigated by GRID computations of the hydrophobic probes predicted to interact with the membrane...|$|E
40|$|Viral {{replication}} {{relies on}} the host to supply nucleosides. Host enzymes involved in nucleoside biosynthesis are potential targets for antiviral development. Ribavirin (a known antiviral drug) is such an inhibitor that suppresses guanine biosynthesis; depletion of the intracellular GTP pool was shown to be the major mechanism to inhibit flavivirus. Along similar lines, inhibitors of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway could be targeted for potential antiviral development. Here we report on a novel antiviral compound (NITD- 982) that inhibits host dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme required for pyrimidine biosynthesis. The inhibitor was identified through screening 1. 8 million compounds using a dengue virus (DENV) infection assay. The compound contains an isoxazole-pyrazole core structure, and it inhibited DENV with a 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) of 2. 4 nM and a 50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC 50) of > 5 μM. NITD- 982 has a broad antiviral spectrum, inhibiting both flaviviruses and nonflaviviruses with nanomolar EC 90 s. We also show that (i) the compound inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant DHODH, (ii) an NITD- 982 analogue directly bound to the DHODH protein, (iii) supplementing the culture medium with uridine reversed the compound-mediated antiviral activity, and (iv) DENV type 2 (DENV- 2) variants resistant to <b>brequinar</b> (a known DHODH inhibitor) were cross resistant to NITD- 982. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the compound inhibits DENV through depleting the intracellular pyrimidine pool. In contrast to the in vitro potency, the compound did not show any efficacy in the DENV-AG 129 mouse model. The lack of in vivo efficacy is likely due to the exogenous uptake of pyrimidine from the diet or to a high plasma protein-binding activity of the current compound...|$|E
40|$|Heterotopic hamster hearts transplanted to unmodified LEW rats {{underwent}} humoral rejection in 3 days. Survival was prolonged to {{a median}} of 4 days with 2 mg/kg/day FK 506. As monotherapy, 15 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide greatly prolonged graft survival-far more than could be accomplished with RS- 61443, <b>brequinar</b> (BQR), mizoribine, methotrexate, or deoxyspergualin. However, when FK 506 treatment, which was ineffective alone, was combined with a short induction course (14 or 30 days) of subtherapeutic BQR, RS- 61443, or cyclophosphamide, routine survival of heart xenografts was possible {{for as long as}} the daily FK 506 was continued. In addition, a single large dose of 80 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 10 days preoperatively allowed routine cardiac xenograft survival under FK 506. The ability of these antimetabolites to unmask the therapeutic potential of FK 506 correlated, although imperfectly, with the prevention of rises of preformed heterospecific cytotoxic antibodies immediately postoperatively. As an adjunct to FK 506, azathioprine was of marginal value, whereas mizoribine, methotrexate, and deoxyspergualin (DSPG) were of intermediate efficacy. After orthotopic hepatic xenotransplantation, the perioperative survival of the liver with its well-known resistance to antibodies was less dependent than the heart on the antimetabolite component of the combined drug therapy, but the unsatisfactory results with monotherapy of FK 506, BQR, RS- 61443, or cyclophosphamide were changed to routine success by combining continuous FK 506 with a short course of any of the other drugs. Thus, by breaking down the antibody barrier to xenotransplantation with these so-called antiproliferative drugs, it has been possible with FK 506 to transplant heart and liver xenografts with consistent long-term survival of healthy recipients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDehydrogenases {{that use}} {{ubiquinone}} as an electron acceptor, including complex I of the respiratory chain, complex II, and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, {{are known to}} be direct generators of superoxide and/or H 2 O 2. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase oxidizes dihydroorotate to orotate and reduces ubiquinone to ubiquinol during pyrimidine metabolism, but it is unclear whether it produces superoxide and/or H 2 O 2 directly or does so only indirectly from other sites in the electron transport chain. Using mitochondria isolated from rat skeletal muscle we establish that dihydroorotate oxidation leads to superoxide/H 2 O 2 production at a fairly high rate of about 300 pmol H 2 O 2 ·min− 1 ·mg protein− 1 when oxidation of ubiquinol is prevented and complex II is uninhibited. This H 2 O 2 production is abolished by <b>brequinar</b> or leflunomide, known inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Eighty percent of this rate is indirect, originating from site IIF of complex II, because it can be prevented by malonate or atpenin A 5, inhibitors of complex II. In the presence of inhibitors of all known sites of superoxide/H 2 O 2 production (rotenone to inhibit sites in complex I (site IQ and, indirectly, site IF), myxothiazol to inhibit site IIIQo in complex III, and malonate plus atpenin A 5 to inhibit site IIF in complex II), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase generates superoxide/H 2 O 2, at a small but significant rate (23 pmol H 2 O 2 ·min− 1 ·mg protein− 1), from the ubiquinone-binding site. We conclude that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase can generate superoxide and/or H 2 O 2 directly at low rates and is also capable of indirect production at higher rates from other sites through its ability to reduce the ubiquinone pool...|$|E
40|$|Pyrimidine {{biosynthesis}} {{represents an}} attractive target for chemotherapeutic {{intervention in the}} treatment of a number of diseases. The enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which catalyses the fourth reaction in the de novo pyrimidine. biosvnthesis pathway, has for many years received particular attention as a drug target. Human DHODH is the target of the antirheumatic drug leflunomide, and other inhibitors of this enzyme, such as <b>brequinar,</b> have been extensively investigated for their anticancer properties. Furthermore, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum lacks the ability to salvage pyrimidines, meaning that the de novo synthesis pathway represents a potential target for the development of novel anttmalarials. Recent studies have shown that inhibitors of P. falciparum DHODH are able to suppress parasite growth in mice, validating this approach as a means of combating malaria. In this study, X-ray crystallography has been used to rationalise the inhibition patterns observed in two series of compounds that inhibit human and P. falciparum DHODHs, as well as aiding the design of inhibitors with increased potency. The best compounds from a set of human DHODH inhibitors were co-crystallised with their target enzyme, and were found to induce a small conformational change in the N-terminal helix of the enzyme that has not been observed previously. A new crystal form of PfDHODH has been discovered, leading to the determination of a 'number of eo-crystal structures at higher resolution than has been achieved by other groups. These structures reveal a subtle change in the rotamer adopted by a key arginine residue, allowing these compounds to form an additional hydrogen bond to the enzyme, relative to what has previously been reported with similar inhibitors. Virtual high-throughput screening has also been used to discover novel inhibitors of human and P. falciparum DHODHs. Biochemical assays showed a number of naphthoquinone-based compounds to be inhibitors of DHODH, and in silico docking has been used to try and explain their activity.

40|$|Based on its {{capacity}} to inhibit de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis by blocking dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity, the antitumor agent <b>brequinar</b> sodium (BQR) {{has emerged as a}} new immunosuppressive agent. Since BQR is known to prevent the synthesis of nucleotides during cell proliferation, we hypothesized that it would be highly effective in controlling strong lymphocyte proliferative responses but might be less effective in controlling comparatively weak responses that do not necessarily involve new nucleotide synthesis. We addressed this question by culturing murine spleen cells with different types of stimuli, including Con A, phorbol myristate acetate ± ionomycin, anti-CD 3, and anti-Igs. Addition of BQR (0. 001 μg/ml to 10 μg/ml) {{at the start of a}} 72 -hr culture period caused dose-dependent inhibition of strong proliferative responses, induced either by Con A (5 μg/ml) or PMA + ionomycin. A residual degree of proliferation persisted, however, even at the highest BQR concentrations. In contrast, no impairment of low-concentration Con A (0. 5 or 0. 1 μg/ml) anti-CD 3, or anti-Igs responses was observed. In order to ascertain its role in arresting nucleotide synthesis, we attempted to reverse the inhibitory effect of BQR by adding exogenous uridine or cytidine to lymphocyte cultures. BQR's inhibitory activity was reversed completely by adding uridine at 0. 1 mM. In contrast, combination of BQR and cytidine (0. 1 mM) potentiated BQR's activity and abrogated anti-CD 3 or anti-Igs-induced lymphocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. A synergistic inhibitory action between BQR and cytidine was observed when the BQR concentration was higher than 0. 1 μg/ml and with cytidine at 0. 1 mM. Production of interleukin- 2 and IL- 4 was only slightly affected by BQR, but was significantly suppressed by coadministration of BQR and cytidine. Neither BQR (5 μg/ml) on its own, however, nor combination of BQR with cytidine affected production of mRNA for IL- 2, IL- 4, or interferon-Γ, as determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Our observations suggest that BQR may not only affect dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity, but may also inhibit the enzyme cytidine deaminase, which converts cytidine to uridine. These antimetabolic effects of BQR complement the well-known cytokine synthesis inhibitory actions of FK 506 or CsA. The combination of BQR and cytidine, however, offers a further possibility for inhibition of both cytokine production and T and B cell proliferation, and may have potential for the control of graft rejection. © 1993 by Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
