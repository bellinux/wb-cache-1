5|$|Argentina was a {{fragmented}} nation (since the 1852 downfall of Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas), with the Argentine Confederation and the State of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> each vying for supremacy. Flores approached the <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Minister of War, Bartolomé Mitre, agreeing {{to throw the}} support of the Colorados behind <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> in exchange for subsequent Argentine assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in Montevideo (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> with fierce determination. They played a decisive role in the Battle of Pavón on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once he {{returned}} to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> Larrea avoided political activities and concentrated on business activities. He established a mailing service between <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and Le Havre (France), but the venture failed. He then worked in animal husbandry, both in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and in Montevideo. He was appointed consul of the United Provinces by governor Manuel Dorrego, and moved back to Bordeaux to strengthen commerce with France.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> name {{a street in}} his honor in 1822. In 1910, during the Argentina Centennial, a statue of him was erected in Barrancas de Belgrano, a neighborhood at the north of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> The district of Manuel Alberti, in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Province, is also named after him.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} of May 1810 in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> intended {{to win the}} independence of Argentina from Spain, also had the consequence of emancipating the province of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> from Argentina or, rather, of imposing the authority of this province upon the whole nation emancipated from Spain. That day, Spanish power over the Argentine provinces ended and that of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> was established.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after his arrival in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> in the United Provinces (formally named the Argentine Republic in 1826), San Martín was interviewed by the First Triumvirate. They {{appointed}} him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, {{and asked him to}} create a cavalry unit, as <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers with Alvear and Zapiola. As <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> lacked professional military leaders, San Martín was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept focused in the task of building the military unit.|$|E
5|$|Between 1812 and 1816 {{divisions}} {{developed between}} an Unitarist faction centred on <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and a Federalist faction in the provinces, which {{eventually led to}} a series of civil wars that ended with the conquest of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{rebellion}} of Justo José de Urquiza against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat {{at the battle}} of Caseros and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Martín's remains to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Martín, despite the conflict. <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> seceded from Argentina as the state of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> dominated by Unitarians who despised San Martín. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Miguel de Azcuénaga {{was born}} in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> on June 4, 1754. He {{was the son of}} Vicente de Azcuénaga Iturbe, a Spanish {{businessman}} from Biscay, and María Rosa de Basavilbaso y Urtubia, from <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> The Azcuénaga-Basavilbaso had 4 sons and 3 daughters. Miguel de Azcuénaga was sent to Spain at an early age, to complete his elementary studies in Málaga and then attend the University of Seville. He returned to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> in 1774, and made a new journey to Spain to oversee the business of his father.|$|E
5|$|The British {{returned}} in 1807. Cornelio Saavedra marched to Montevideo, but was informed at Colonia del Sacramento of {{the capture of}} the city. The British planned {{to use it as}} a lodgement for the invasion of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> To give difficulty to the British operations, Saavedra ordered the withdrawal of all military hardware from Colonia, considered indefensible at that point, and mobilized those troops and equipment to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> to fortify the city. The renewed attack to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> took place shortly afterwards, the invading army had 8,000 soldiers and 18 cannons—significantly more than the 1,565 men, 6 cannons and 2 howitzers used for the first British invasion attempt. After an initial victory in the pens of Miserere, the invading army entered into <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> on July 5.|$|E
5|$|After his exile, Larrea {{moved to}} Bordeaux in France, and did {{business}} {{with some of}} his old associates. He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia, and in 1818 he moved to Montevideo, under Brazilian control at that time, and strengthened his contacts in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> from there. He was finally able to return to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> in 1822 due to the oblivion law.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{invasion}} of 1806, Santiago de Liniers successfully reconquered <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> The population {{did not allow}} Rafael de Sobremonte to continue as Viceroy. He had escaped to Cordoba with the public treasury while the battle was still in progress. A law enacted in 1778 required the treasury to be moved to a safe location {{in the case of}} a foreign attack, but Sobremonte was still seen as a coward by the population. The Royal Audiencia of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> did not allow his return to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and elected Liniers, acclaimed as a popular hero, as an interim Viceroy. This was an unprecedented action, the first time that a Spanish viceroy was deposed by local government institutions, and not by the King of Spain himself; King CharlesIV ratified the appointment at a later time. Liniers armed the entire population of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> including criollos and slaves, and defeated a second British invasion attempt in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> had {{suffered}} a difficult period in its war for independence, its prospects were improving by 1812. Even though the defeats of Manuel Belgrano during the Paraguay campaign and Juan José Castelli in the first Upper Peru campaign had generated a political crisis, Belgrano's victory at Tucuman had given new fresh hope to the revolution, which would be strengthened shortly afterwards with the victory at the Battle of Salta. Montevideo, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata since the May Revolution, was under siege by both an army from <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> led by José Rondeau and an Uruguayan one led by José Gervasio Artigas. The city, however, maintained its naval supremacy over <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and their ships raided the coasts of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers to gather supplies, despite the siege. Montevideo organized a navy to destroy the gun batteries at Rosario and Diamante, two population centers along the Parana, but were prevented from doing so as <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> dismantled them knowing {{that they could not}} defend them.|$|E
5|$|Bence died on 8 February 2016 in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> {{at the age}} of 101.|$|E
5|$|<b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> {{faced the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806, when British forces led by William Carr Beresford invaded the city. Saavedra {{was still a}} {{civilian}} by then. Santiago de Liniers organized an army in Montevideo to liberate <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> and Saavedra was among the civilians that joined Liniers, {{despite the lack of}} military instruction. His role in this battle was a minor one. Liniers successfully liberated <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> and organized the resistance against a likely British counter-attack. All the male population of the city aged from 16 to 50 was drafted into the army, and divided in battalions by casta or origin. The largest one was the Regiment of Patricians, made up of volunteer infantrymen born in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> The Regiment was composed of three infantry battalions, commanded by Esteban Romero, Domingo Urien and Manuel Belgrano, who would later pass that command to Juan José Viamonte. Each battalion could elect their own leaders, including their commander, and the Regiment of Patricians elected Saavedra.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa was {{the first}} chief of {{government}} of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> to be elected by popular vote, a change introduced by the amendment of the Constitution. He expanded the <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Underground, adding new stations to Line D, starting the expansion of Line B, and establishing Line H. He established Roberto Goyeneche Avenue and the city's first bicycle path.|$|E
5|$|Delesio Antonio Berni (Rosario, 14 May 1905 - <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> 13 October 1981) was an Argentine figurative artist. He is {{associated}} with the movement known as Nuevo Realismo ("New Realism"), a Latin American extension of social realism. His work, including a series of Juanito Laguna collages depicting poverty and the effects of industrialization in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> has been exhibited around the world.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari died on 30 October 1956 in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1838 {{there was}} a new {{currency}} crisis, and the peso papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Lacroze Hermanos company won a {{concession}} to build another Underground line. The company was a competitor to the Anglo-Argentine company, operating tramways in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> {{as well as the}} <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Central Railway, which later became part of the Urquiza Line. Construction began in 1927 and this line became Line B when it was inaugurated on 17 October 1930. During 17–18 December 380,000 passengers travelled on the line's then 32 cars. The line was originally intended to continue above ground, with the current Federico Lacroze station to be the central terminal of the <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Central Railway (today the General Urquiza Railway), however nowadays the overground service forms part of the Urquiza Line instead.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> Argentina, Mengele {{worked as}} a {{carpenter}} while residing in a boarding house in the suburb of Vicente López. After a few weeks {{he moved to the}} house of a Nazi sympathiser in the more affluent neighborhood of Florida, <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> He next {{worked as a}} salesman for his family's farm equipment company, and beginning in 1951 he made frequent trips to Paraguay as sales representative for that region. An apartment in the center of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> became his residence in 1953, the same year he used family funds to buy a part interest in a carpentry concern. In 1954 he rented a house in the suburb of Olivos. Files released by the Argentine government in 1992 indicate that Mengele may have practiced medicine without a license, including performing abortions, while living in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Genoa, Italy, {{there is}} a {{commemorative}} statue of Belgrano, {{at the end of}} the Corso <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b>|$|E
5|$|Juan Manuel de Rosas forced Lavalle {{to leave}} the province, and the federals ruled <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> until 1852. Rosas {{modified}} a number of policies of the Rivadavian period but maintained others: he set a customs law with protectionist policies, but kept the port under the exclusive control of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and refused to call a constituent assembly.|$|E
5|$|May25 was {{designated}} as a patriotic date in 1813, but the Argentine Declaration of Independence suggests July9 as an alternative national day. At first this added to the conflicts between <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and the provinces during the Argentine Civil War, because the date in May related to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> and the date of July9 related to the whole country. Thus the unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia canceled the celebration of July9, and the federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas allowed it again, but maintained the May celebrations. By 1880, the federalization of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> removed the local connotations and the May Revolution was considered {{the birth of the}} nation.|$|E
5|$|San Martín left O'Higgins {{in charge}} of the Army, and {{returned}} to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> to request resources for the campaign to Peru. He did not have a good reception this time. Pueyrredón thought that Chile should compensate <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> for the money invested in their liberation, as the support to San Martín reduced the support to Belgrano, and the Portuguese-Brazilian invasion of the Eastern Bank menaced <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> Incapable of financial support, <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> sent lawyer Manuel Aguirre to the United States, to request aid and acknowledge the declaration of independence. However, the mission failed, as the United States stayed neutral in the conflict because they negotiated the purchase of Florida with Spain. The Chilean José Miguel Carrera had obtained ships on his own after the disaster of Rancagua, which he intended to use to liberate Chile; but as San Martín had already done that, he refused to place his fleet under the Army of the Andes. Carrera was an enemy of O'Higgins and sought to navigate to Chile and depose him, so Pueyrredón imprisoned him, and confiscated his ships.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{requested}} {{help from}} British Admiral William Bowles. He wrote from Chile {{and expected to}} find him in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> but Bowles had embarked for Río de Janeiro. Bowles considered that San Martín was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism. San Martín did not obtain the ships and interrupted the correspondence with Bowles for some months. He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> or foreign powers, San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.|$|E
5|$|San Martín was {{not well}} {{received}} in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> Pueyrredón initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos {{and the organization of}} a huge royalist army in Cádiz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> San Martín discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza with his wife and daughter and received a letter from Pueyrredón, who said that <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Martín resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> still considered San Martín vital to the national defense, so Pueyrredón agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Martín to withdraw his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Oribe, the Allied forces split into two groups, the plan being for one force to maneuver upriver and sweep down on <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> from Santa Fe, while the other would make a landing {{at the port of}} <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> itself. The first of these groups, was composed of Uruguayan and Argentine troops, along with the 1st Division of the Brazilian Army under Brigadier General Manuel Marques de Sousa (later the Count of Porto Alegre). It was initially based in the town of Colonia del Sacramento in the south of Uruguay across the Río de la Plata estuary from the city of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Caseros the San Nicolás Agreement was signed. It {{was meant to}} comply with the {{constitutional}} mandate of the Federal pact that presided over the Argentine Confederation, convening a Constitutional Assembly to meet in Santa Fe. This agreement was not accepted by the province of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> since it reduced its influence and power over the other provinces. <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> thereupon seceded from the confederation, thus Argentina got divided into two rival, independent states which fought to establish dominance. On the one side were the Federalists of the Argentine Confederation, led by Justo José de Urquiza. On the other, the Autonomists of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> The civil war was only brought to an end with the decisive victory of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> over the Federation at the 1861 Battle of Pavón. The bonaerense liberal leader Bartolomé Mitre was elected the first President of a united Argentine Republic in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust last {{flight was}} the final leg of BSAA Flight CS59, which had started in London on an Avro York named Star Mist on 29 July 1947, landing in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> on 1 August. Marta Limpert {{was the only one}} of the six {{passengers}} known for certain to have initially boarded Star Mist in London before changing aircraft in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> to continue on to Santiago with the other passengers.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Israeli Embassy {{attack in}} <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> killing 29, in Argentina. Hezbollah {{operatives}} boasted of involvement.|$|E
5|$|The 2017 <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> ePrix (formally the 2017 FIA Formula E <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> ePrix) was a Formula E motor race held on 18 February 2017 at the Puerto Madero Street Circuit in Puerto Madero, <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> Argentina {{in front}} of a crowd of 21,000 people. It was the third round of the 2016–17 Formula E season and the third running of the event. The 37-lap race was won by e.Dams-Renault driver Sébastien Buemi after {{starting}} from third position. Jean-Éric Vergne finished second for the Techeetah team and Audi Sport ABT driver Lucas di Grassi came in third.|$|E
5|$|The date, {{as well as}} {{a generic}} image of the <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Cabildo, are used in {{different}} variants to honor the May Revolution. Two of the most notable are the Avenida de Mayo and the Plaza de Mayo in <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> near the location of the Cabildo. The May Pyramid was erected in the Plaza a year after the revolution, and was rebuilt in its present form in 1856. Veinticinco de Mayo ("May25") is the name of several administrative divisions, cities, public spaces and landforms of Argentina. There are departments of this name in the provinces of Chaco, Misiones, San Juan, Rio Negro and <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> the latter holding the town of Veinticinco de Mayo. The cities of Rosario (Santa Fe), Junín (<b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires)</b> and Resistencia (Chaco) have eponymous squares. King George Island, which is claimed by Argentina, Britain and Chile, as part of the Argentine Antarctica, the British Antarctic Territory and the Chilean Antarctic Territory respectively, is referred to as Isla 25 de Mayo in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{governors}} were installed and replaced beginning in 1828 with {{the appointment of}} Federalist Manuel Dorrego as the governor of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> However, Dorrego's government was very soon overthrown and replaced by that of Unitarist Juan Lavalle. Lavalle's rule ended when he was defeated by a militia of gauchos led by Rosas. By the end of 1829, the legislature had appointed Rosas as governor of <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> Under Rosas's rule, many intellectuals fled either to Chile, as did Sarmiento, or to Uruguay, as Sarmiento himself notes.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{casualties}} of the Army of the North were not substantial, {{it was left}} demoralized and disbanded. Goyeneche pursued the fleeing patriots, and captured Huaqui after his victory. The inhabitants of Upper Peru welcomed the royalists back, so the army had to quickly leave those provinces. However, the resistance of Cochabamba prevented the royalists from proceeding to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires.</b> Castelli moved to the post of Quirbe, and received orders to return to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> for trial. However, {{by the time he}} was notified, new orders had been issued: Castelli should be confined at Catamarca, while Saavedra himself took charge of the Army of the North. Saavedra was deposed as soon as he left <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> and was confined to San Juan. The First Triumvirate, which had commenced governing by then, required Castelli to return.|$|E
5|$|Alvear ordered Saavedra to move {{immediately}} to <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires,</b> {{to close the}} case. He arrived to the city in time, and Alvear was sympathetic to his situation. However, Alvear {{was forced to resign}} a few days later, before being able to rule the case. The <b>Buenos</b> <b>Aires</b> Cabildo, the interim government, restored Saavedra's military rank and honours, but the rule was abolished by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, the following supreme director. He moved then to the countryside, to live with his brother Luis. He kept requesting to the government the restoration of his rank.|$|E
