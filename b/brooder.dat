5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch. Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth <b>brooder</b> and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
500|$|Each starfish arm {{contains}} two gonads that release gametes through openings called gonoducts, {{located on the}} central disc between the arms. Fertilization is generally external but in a few species, internal fertilization takes place. In most species, the buoyant eggs and sperm are simply released into the water (free spawning) and the resulting embryos and larvae live {{as part of the}} plankton. In others, the eggs may be stuck to the undersides of rocks. In certain species of starfish, the females brood their eggs – either by simply enveloping them or by holding them in specialised structures. Brooding may be done in pockets on the starfish's aboral surface, inside the pyloric stomach (Leptasterias tenera) or even in the interior of the gonads themselves. Those starfish that brood their eggs by [...] "sitting" [...] on them usually assume a humped posture with their discs raised off the substrate. Pteraster militaris broods a few of its young and disperses the remaining eggs, that are too numerous to fit into its pouch. In these brooding species, the eggs are relatively large, and supplied with yolk, and they generally develop directly into miniature starfish without an intervening larval stage. The developing young are called lecithotrophic because they obtain their nutrition from the yolk as opposed to [...] "planktotrophic" [...] larvae that feed in the water column. In Parvulastra parvivipara, an [...] <b>brooder,</b> the young starfish obtain nutrients by eating other eggs and embryos in the brood pouch. Brooding is especially common in polar and deep-sea species that live in environments unfavourable for larval development and in smaller species that produce just a few eggs.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The homeothermic {{capacity}} of chicks varied {{as a function}} of <b>brood</b> size, age, and air temperature. Commit-ment to <b>brooding</b> by parents also varied {{as a function of}} <b>brood</b> size, age of the young <b>brooded,</b> and prevailing air temperature. It was experimentally determined that parents altered their <b>brooding</b> commitment in direct response to the achieved mean homeothermic {{capacity of}} the <b>brood</b> rather than energy demands of the <b>brood</b> per se. Because larger <b>broods</b> achieved a given level of homeothermic ca-pacity earlier than smaller <b>broods,</b> parents pent less time <b>brooding</b> larger <b>broods.</b> This "freed " time represented an increase in potential foraging time by the parents.

Daily energy expenditure (DEE) of females feeding nestlings of 6 and 12 days of age was measured using the doubly-labeled water technique. Females adjusted their <b>brooding</b> behavior to the age of the young. The data are consistent dth the idea that <b>brooding</b> behavior was determined primarily by the thermoregulatory requirements of the <b>brood.</b> Female DEE did not differ with nestling age; when differences in body mass were controlled for, it was lower during the <b>brooding</b> period than later. In enlarged <b>broods,</b> both parents showed significantly higher rates of food provisioning to the <b>brood.</b> Female DEE was affected by <b>brood</b> size manipulation, and it did not level off with <b>brood</b> size. There was no significant effect of nestling age on the relation between DEE and manipulation. Birds were able to raise a larger <b>brood</b> than the natural <b>brood</b> size, although larger <b>broods</b> suffered from increased nestling mortality rates during the peak demand period of the nestlings. Offspring condition at fledging was negatively affected by <b>brood</b> size manipulation, but recruitment rate per <b>brood</b> was positively related to <b>brood</b> size, suggesting that the optimal <b>brood</b> size exceeds the natural <b>brood</b> size in this population...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn many bird species, females {{undergo a}} marked decline in body {{condition}} {{during the first}} days of the nestling period. This decline may be because <b>brooding</b> young chicks reduces the time available for foraging. Alternatively, it might be viewed as an adaptive way to reduce flight costs when the food demand of the <b>brood</b> is highest. To test these hypotheses we modified the <b>brooding</b> commitment of House Sparrows Passer domesticus by manipulating <b>brood</b> size to see if changes in time spent <b>brooding</b> affects adult body condition. During the nestling period, females provided on average three times as much <b>brooding</b> as males. Reduced <b>broods</b> received 14 % more <b>brooding</b> than large <b>broods</b> and time spent <b>brooding</b> declined with <b>brood</b> size and chick age according to an exponential decay function. Male body condition was unaffected by <b>brood</b> size and remained stable throughout the reproductive period. Body condition of females with enlarged <b>broods</b> decreased gradually during the nestling period, whereas that of females tending reduced <b>broods</b> dropped abruptly and significantly upon hatching. This resulted in females with reduced <b>broods</b> having lower body condition {{during the first half of}} the nestling period than those with enlarged <b>broods.</b> The sharp drop in body condition of females with reduced <b>broods</b> coincided with the period that <b>brooding</b> was most intensive. Indeed, female body condition at the end of the nestling period was negatively correlated with the proportion of time they spent <b>brooding</b> during the first half of the nestling period. Thus, the probable lower homeothermic capacities of reduced <b>broods</b> implies a higher <b>brooding</b> commitment for female House Sparrows that, in turn, may reduce their opportunity to forage and consequently also their body condition...|$|R

60|$|If we may {{trust his}} own report, Henry James {{had reached the}} age of {{seventeen}} with a curiously vague understanding of his own talent. No doubt it is possible to read the 'Notes' too literally; and indeed I have the fortunate opportunity of giving a side-light upon this period of his youth which proves as much. But if he was not quite the indeterminate <b>brooder</b> he depicts, he was far from rivalling the unusual precocity and decision of his brothers, and he was only now beginning to take real stock of his gifts. He had been provided with almost none of the sort of training by which he might have profited; and it is not to be supposed that his always indulgent parent would have neglected the taste of a literary son if it had shewn itself distinctly. He had been left to discover his line of progress as best he might, and his advance towards literature was slow and shy. Yet it would seem that by this time he must have made up his mind more definitely than he suggests in recalling the Newport years. The side-light I mentioned is thrown by some interesting notes sent me by Mr. Thomas Sergeant Perry, who made the acquaintance of the family at Newport and was to remain their lifelong friend. His description shews that Henry James had now his own ambitions, even if he preferred to nurse them unobtrusively.|$|E
6000|$|Beautiful, horrible, haunted: that is {{the essence}} of what, about itself, Capri says to you--dip again into your Tacitus and see why; and yet, while you roast a little under the awning and in the vaster shadow, it is not because the trail of Tiberius is ineffaceable that you are most uneasy. The trail of Germanicus in Italy to-day ramifies further and bites perhaps even deeper; a proof of which is, precisely, that his eclipse in the Blue Grotto is inexorably brief, that here he is popping out again, bobbing enthusiastically back and {{scrambling}} triumphantly back. The spirit, in truth, of his effective appropriation of Capri has a broad-faced candour against which there is no standing up, supremely expressive as it is of the well-known [...] "love that kills," [...] of Germanicus's fatal susceptibility. If I were to let myself, however, incline to that aspect of the serious case of Capri I should embark on strange depths. The straightness and simplicity, the classic, synthetic directness of the German passion for Italy, make this passion probably the sentiment in the world that is in the act of supplying enjoyment in the largest, sweetest mouthfuls; and there is something unsurpassably marked in the way that on this irresistible shore it has seated itself to ruminate and digest. It keeps the record in its own loud accents; it breaks out in the folds of the hills and on the crests of the crags into every manner of symptom and warning.

6000|$|That {{day three}} {{powerful}} impressions were forced upon Lane, {{never to be}} effaced. First {{he found that the}} change in him was vast and incalculable and vague. He could divine but not understand. Secondly, the men of the service, disabled or not, were old stories to New Yorkers. Lane saw soldiers begging from pedestrians. He muttered to himself: [...] "By God, I'll starve to death before I ever do that!" [...] He could not detect any aloofness on the part of passers-by. They were just inattentive. Lane remembered with sudden shock how differently soldiers had been regarded two or three years ago. He had read lengthy newspaper accounts of the wild and magnificent welcome accorded to the first soldiers to return to New York. How strange the contrast! But that was long ago--past history--buried under the immense and hurried and inscrutable changes of a nation. Lane divined that, as he felt the mighty resistless throb of the great city. His third and strongest impression concerned the women he met and passed on the streets. Their lips and cheeks were rouged. Their dresses were cut too low at the neck. But even this fashion was not nearly so striking as the short skirts, cut off at the knees, and in many cases above. At first this roused a strange amaze in Lane. [...] "What's the idea, I wonder?" [...] he mused. But in the end it disgusted him. He reflected that for two swift years he had been out of the track of events, away from centers of population. Paris itself had held no attraction for him. Dreamer and <b>brooder,</b> he had failed to see the material things. But this third impression troubled him more than the other two and stirred thoughts he tried to dispel. Returning to the barracks he learned that he and his friends would be free on the morrow; and long into the night he rejoiced in the knowledge. Free! The grinding, incomprehensible Juggernaut and himself were at the parting of the ways. Before he went to sleep he remembered a forgotten prayer his mother had taught him. His ordeal was over. What had happened did not matter. The Hell was past and he must bury memory. Whether or not he had a month or a year to live it must be lived without memories of his ordeal.|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{aggression}} was studied inOreochromis mossambicus {{during the}} mouthbrooding cycle. <b>Brooding</b> females {{were observed in}} heterosexual captive groups, and their agonistic interactions and behavioural activities were registered. <b>Brooding</b> females were classified into three classes according to the developmental stage of the <b>brood</b> they were incubating: phase 1, <b>brooding</b> eggs; phase 2, <b>brooding</b> fry with yolk-sac; phase 3, <b>brooding</b> fry with exogeneous feeding.

In barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), male tail streamer length is a phenotypic quality trait, which is related to reproductive decisions, resulting in pairs with long-tailed males showing higher annual output than those with short-tailed males. We predict that the extent of <b>brood</b> overlap in barn swallows is positively associated with the male's tail ornamentation. Using radiotelemetry, we assessed the duration of postfledging care and juvenile survival and quantified <b>brood</b> overlap with unprecedented accuracy. <b>Broods</b> of pairs with highly ornamented males overlapped to a larger extent than those of pairs with short-tailed males. <b>Brood</b> overlap depended on the reproductive value of the previous <b>brood</b> and on female phenotypic quality. Clutch initiation after a short interbrood interval was associated with a great <b>brood</b> overlap. Short duration of postfledging care but not <b>brood</b> overlap reduced fledgling survival in first <b>broods,</b> and earlier second <b>broods</b> were associated with enlarged clutches. Thus, pairs with long-tailed males managed to increase clutch size and survival of the second <b>brood</b> by an early onset without incurring survival costs in the first <b>brood.</b> This is in line with the hypothesis that <b>brood</b> overlap enforces differential annual reproductive output among individuals varying in phenotypic quality.
