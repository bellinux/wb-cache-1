40|$|Compressor and turbine <b>bladed</b> <b>wheels</b> {{interact}} with the fluid distributed by the stator vanes. They are subject to vibration and fatigue loading, especially when resonance conditions are excited. Avoiding resonance is fundamental when designing <b>bladed</b> <b>wheels.</b> The Campbell diagram approach is too conservative since <b>bladed</b> <b>wheels</b> show many close frequency natural modes, thus {{it is almost impossible}} to avoid frequency matching. Singh's Advanced Frequency Evaluation (SAFE) diagram, or interference diagram, also introduces shape matching in addition to the frequency, for resonance prediction, therefore many frequency matching cases can be identified as non-critical and thus tolerated. The present paper explains and demonstrates the SAFE diagram by introducing an analytical expression to identify <b>bladed</b> <b>wheel</b> resonance conditions. The mode shape matching with a harmonic component is investigated by means of specific examples.

40|$|Application of pulse {{excitation}} for {{forced vibration}} of selected eigenmode of <b>blade</b> <b>wheel</b> under rotation. The paper {{deals with a}} solution of multipoint electromagnetic pulse excitation of turbine <b>blade</b> <b>wheel</b> under rotation for analysis of its dynamic behaviour. Since a width of electromagnetic pulses should decrease with revolution speed, magnetomotoric forces acting to the blades decrease, too. So, the application of more “high-speed” electromagnets distributed along a circumference of the wheel that multiply the excitation potential seems to be inevitable for such a stiff structure. It, however, requires accurate synchronization of the electromagnets with wheel revolutions and with a dynamic response of the selected blade. Furthermore impulse excitation causes, in general, transient oscillations of many superposed eigenmodes of the wheel. Therefore an attention, herein, was paid to develop an appropriate control algorithm for the pulse excitation of electromagnets and to find a proper strategy of electromagnet interconnections to gain a multiplepoint excitation for excitation of selected eigenmodes...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of rim cooling of gas-turbine blades; that is, reducing the temperature {{at the base}} of the <b>blade</b> (<b>wheel</b> rim), which cools the blade by conduction alone. Formulas for temperature and stress distributions along the blade are derived and, by the use of experimental stress-rupture data for a typical blade alloy, a relation is established between blade life (time for rupture), operating speed, and amount of rim cooling for several gas temperatures. The effect of blade parameter combining the effects of blade dimensions, blade thermal conductivity, and heat-transfer coefficient is determined. The effect of radiation on the results is approximated. The gas temperatures ranged from 1300 F to 1900 F and the rim temperature, from 0 F to 1000 F below the gas temperature. This report is concerned only with blades of uniform cross section, but the conclusions drawn are generally applicable to most modern turbine blades. For a typical rim-cooled blade, gas temperature increases are limited to about 200 F for 500 F of cooling of the blade base below gas temperature, and additional cooling brings progressively smaller increases. In order to obtain large increases in thermal conductivity or very large decreases in heat-transfer coefficient or blade length or necessary. The increases in gas temperature allowable with rim cooling are particularly small for turbines of large dimensions and high specific mass flows. For a given effective gas temperature, substantial increases in blade life, however, are possible with relatively small amounts of rim cooling...|$|E

40|$|The article proposes the {{theoretical}} framework of ventilation processes emerging {{and going on}} in the stages of TPP steam turbines during the operating regimes with small-quantity volumetric flow rates in the low-pressure cylinder. The basic theory includes new physicomathematical models for estimating the ventilating capacity losses and ventilation heatings-up of the steam and the air-gas channel of the turbine; search and investigation of the factors causing the increased momental loads on the blade wheels of the finale stages which are likely to lead to destruction of the rotating blades. The paper renders the practical results of utilizing {{the theoretical}} framework of ventilation processes. The author obtains a new mathematical relation for high-accuracy assessment of the ventilating capacity losses accounting for all the diversification of parameters defining the level of these losses (it is established that the Coriolis force contributes twice as much to the ventilating capacity losses as the centrifugal force). Seven ordinary formulae obtained on its basis provide a separate stage ventilation-losses immediate evaluation (with rotation blades of the finale stage not unwinding from the turning, with rotation blades of the finale and intermediate stages unwinding from the turning), in the turbine altogether-vapor-evacuated including by readings of the regular instruments located at the connecters of the exhaust part of the lowpressure cylinder. As the cornerstone of the new ventilation heating-up evaluation system the author lays two experimentally established facts: the ventilating capacity losses are practically constant at working steam negligible volumetric flow rates; symmetrical ventilating flows in the blade channel mingle entirely to the moment of their split up at the periphery. This renders possible estimating the complete enthalpy increment of the steam being discharged from a stage in relation to the enthalpy of the steam being drawn into the blade channel of the <b>blade</b> <b>wheel</b> out of the vapor space of the condenser. The research establishes and acknowledges the influence of a wide spectrum of parameters on the ventilating capacity losses level and ventilation heatings-up in a turbine stage, indicates the measures for them. The estimation results of ventilating losses and ventilation heatings-up are close to the experimental findings of different researchers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka is {{an island}} in the Indian Ocean and water is freely {{available}} around the island. Most of the people from rural areas are farmers and they cultivate in large areas. But they do not have electricity for pumping water to their agricultural. Normally channels are used to convey water into land {{but most of the time}} agricultural lands are situated at higher positions than the channels which make it difficult to transport water. The kinematic energy of water flow in those channels could be converted into useful energy, which in turn could be used for pumping water to higher elevations. For this purpose a simple method such as water wheel could be easily employed to generate electricity. This study mainly focused on to carry out a feasible study based on the existing details of water wheel with related accessories and improves the overall working efficiency while developing a new system or modification of the present system and transfer the technology to the rural community. A theoretical analysis of the water wheel was done based on 6 blades straight type wheel. The performance testing of water wheels in open channel were carry out for three types of blades and two different numbers of blades(6 and 12). Based on the results It shows that 5 % deviation between theoretical and experimental values of power and 36 % deviation between theoretical and experimental values of R. P. M.

Product development often leads the machine to work in really severe conditions.

At design stage, some tools are needed to predict dangerous working conditions or possible resonances. Once the wheels are designed and machined, a validation step is also needed to ensure the specification fulfillment in terms of vibrational response. Finite element analysis are surely useful, but experimental analysis are also essential. Modal analysis can be conducted in order to validate FE results, and harmonic response analysis can help to estimate the component response under specific simulated working conditions. In this dissertation a study of the commonly adopted resonance prediction methods for <b>bladed</b> <b>wheels</b> is firstly presented. Then, two test bench are described along with experimental results: a robotic station for automatic modal analysis and a test bench for harmonic response analysis.
