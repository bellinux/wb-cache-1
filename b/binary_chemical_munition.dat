50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>{{chemical}}</b> {{weapons or}} <b>munitions</b> are <b>chemical</b> weapons which contain the toxic agent in its active state as chemical precursors which are significantly less toxic than the agent. This improves {{the safety of}} storing, transporting, and disposing of the weapon. Commonly, firing the munition removes a barrier between two precursors. These react to form the intended agent which is then aerosolized and distributed by a bursting charge.|$|R

The {{lack of information}} causes public concern {{about the issue of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions.</b> Using data obtained from the expedition to the <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions</b> dumpsite, a preliminary survey to access the potential hazard of a <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions</b> dumpsite in the Lithuanian economic zone was made. Hydrological, hydrochemical, ecotoxicological, biological, and sedimentological parameters were investigated. None of the measured parameters showed sharp anomalies, although some parameters, like arsenic, arsenic tolerating bacteria, and zooplankton didn’t give a well-defined answer. An analysis of arsenic data showed that there were elevated arsenic values at some stations at the dumpsite. However, arsenic concentrations are low relative to other investigations of sediments in the Baltic and the North Seas. Although not apparently a problem, further studies would be necessary to make unequivocal conclusions about the leakage of <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions</b> at this dumpsite...|$|R

40|$|A ABSTRACT, 2 A manual was {{prepared}} to aid the governmenO in designing an explosion containment structure (ECS) {{to be used for}} the demilitarization of <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions.</b> Other manuals are available for the prediction of blast and frag-ent loadings; however, these are directed toward bare explosives and 4 =o- [...] ventional <b>munitions.</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>munitions</b> combine the non-ideal effects of casing, chemical agent around the charge, and non-spherical charge shape. This manual {{was prepared}} to direct the user on the procedures to be followed to predict The blast and fragment loading from <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions.</b> Specifi-cally, the loadings are those {{to be used in the}} design of an ECS in a demil-itarizatioa facility. During the preparation of this manual, tests were performed at NSWC, Dahlgren, Virginia, to supplement the very limited pre-vious data base for both blast and fragments and to confirm the applicabil-ity of the prediction procedures presented here. The munitions tested are those planned for demilitarization at Johnston Island (JI) " however, the manual is written to be general for all <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions</b> and demilitari- f":ation facilities.

30|$|Briefly, Umatilla is a 19, 728 -acre {{military}} reservation {{established in}} 1941 as an ordnance depot for the storage, renovation, and demilitarizing of conventional munitions, {{and for the}} storage of <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions.</b> As of 1994, the Umatilla site only stored <b>chemical</b> <b>munitions</b> awaiting destruction. A washout plant operated at the site in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Discharges to unlined lagoons consisted of an estimated 85 million gallons washout water laden with RDX and TNT. The water table is present about 47 feet beneath the bottoms of the lagoons. The resulting soil and groundwater contamination caused the placement of Umatilla on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) in 1984.

5000|$|BIGEYE (an {{acronym for}} <b>Binary</b> Internally Generated <b>chemical</b> weapon within the [...] "EYE" [...] series of 500 pound {{canister}} weapons) was the common {{name for the}} BLU-80/B, a concept conceived during the 1950s. During the 1970s at Pine Bluff Arsenal around 200 test articles were produced. Initial production contracts for the BIGEYE were awarded in June, 1988, to The Marquardt Company of Van Nuys, CA, the project's prime contractor {{for most of the}} program. The original timeline for the U.S. <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons program called for the BIGEYE to be deployed by September 1988. President Reagan authorized the spending of more than $59 million in 1986 to revive the <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons program. Under the original timeline, the BIGEYE was to be the second <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> weapon to be produced (the first being a binary artillery shell) with <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> agent rockets to follow. After a General Accounting Office (GAO) report pointed out numerous flaws in the program the U.S. Senate moved to effectively kill the <b>binary</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons program, including the BIGEYE bomb. In 1989 President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. would retain the option to produce such binary weapons. At the time of his announcement, 1992 was the earliest date BIGEYES were expected to be deployed.|$|R
