25|$|During World War I, {{there were}} {{persistent}} rumors that German soldiers had crucified a Canadian soldier {{on a tree}} or <b>barn</b> <b>door</b> with bayonets or combat knives. The event was initially reported in 1915 by Private George Barrie of the 1st Canadian Division. Two investigations, one a post-war official investigation, and the other an independent investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, {{concluded that there was}} no evidence to support the story. However, British documentary maker Iain Overton in 2001 published an article claiming that the story was true, identifying the soldier as Harry Band. Overton's article was the basis for a 2002 episode of the Channel 4 documentary show Secret History.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>doors</b> {{are mounted}} with a ring that fits {{inside of the}} color gel slot on the instrument. Because of this, <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> have a gel slot built into them, so the light can still be colored.

50|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>doors,</b> or {{occasionally}} {{a set of}} <b>barn</b> <b>doors,</b> are an attachment fitted {{to the front of}} a Fresnel lantern, a type of lantern used in films, television, and theatres. The attachment has the appearance of a large set of <b>barn</b> <b>doors,</b> but in fact there are four leaves, two larger and widening on the outside, two smaller and getting narrower towards the outside. They facilitate shaping of the beam of light from the fixture, and prevent the distinctive scatter of light created by the Fresnel lens from spilling into areas where it is not wanted, such as the eyes of audience members.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>doors</b> are {{generally}} not used with [...] "profile" [...] or [...] "ellipsoidal reflector" [...] spotlights such as the Source Four because they have internal shutters which work more effectively. <b>Barn</b> <b>doors</b> are not effective at shaping {{the light of a}} PAR lights and a narrower lens would be a better way to do this.|$|R

It {{had been used to}} drive farm machinery, such as the winnowing machine in the corn barn which removes the husk from grain, powered via a rotating horizontal axle drive from the gin. As already stated, prior to using horse driven machines a flail was used by the farm workers to separate the grain from the husk.

500|$|First flight {{claims are}} made for Clément Ader, Gustave Whitehead, Richard Pearse, and Karl Jatho for their {{variously}} documented tests in years prior to and including 1903. Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 {{are made for}} Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights. Those techniques were: a launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques. The late aviation historian Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith was {{a supporter of the}} Wrights' claim to primacy in flight. He wrote that a <b>barn</b> <b>door</b> can be made to [...] "fly" [...] for a short distance if enough energy is applied to it; he determined that the very limited flight experiments of Ader, Vuia and others were [...] "powered hops" [...] instead of fully controlled flights.|$|E
500|$|Handlen {{felt that}} the {{character}} development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; [...] "Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying neatness, {{and serves as a}} reminder that for all their talk, Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make." [...] Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; [...] "Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia," [...] asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded {{that it was one of}} the episode highlights, writing, [...] "He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, but ever since the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that <b>barn</b> <b>door,</b> he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself." [...] Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he [...] "realizes [...] that he's still very much a kid".|$|E

5000|$|His sophomore album, <b>Barn</b> <b>Doors</b> and Concrete Floors was {{released}} on March 29, 2011. The album was recorded {{during the summer of}} 2010 on a small farm located in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York. Nash recruited Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley to co-produce the album and play drums on all the tracks. Ted Young engineered the album. For this album, Nash drew from his circle of friends to form his backing band including Joey McClellan (Midlake, The Fieros) on lead guitar, Aaron McClellan (The Fieros) on bass guitar, and Eric Swanson on bass, mandolin, and banjo. Released by Continental Record Services, the album garnered further attention in Europe and the UK and received positive reviews in publications like The Independent. [...] <b>Barn</b> <b>Doors</b> and Concrete Floors was also chosen as the top album of 2011 by the Euro Americana Charts. Extensive touring in Europe in support of <b>Barn</b> <b>Doors</b> helped Nash gain greater exposure.|$|R

In [...] "Fragile", Lois continues her duties under Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole), who is requested by the Governor to take Jonathan's place after he suffers a fatal heart attack. In season six's [...] "Sneeze", Lois discovers an interest in journalism after she is almost struck by a <b>barn</b> <b>door</b> that falls out of the sky while she is jogging. Her story is bought by the Inquisitor, a tabloid newspaper that gives her a job as a reporter.

Clark and Oliver are wise to her plan, however, and Clark dresses up as Green Arrow to throw Lois off Oliver's trail. When Oliver is forced to leave Metropolis to track down all of Lex's experimental facilities, in the episode [...] "Justice", his relationship with Lois comes to an end.

2500|$|In August 2005, after Alan Greenspan {{expressed}} concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance {{to regulate the}} mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that [...] " [...] {{like a man who}} suggests leaving the <b>barn</b> <b>door</b> ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up." [...] Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and Phil Gramm are the two individuals most responsible for causing the subprime crisis. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping derivatives, financial markets, and investment banks unregulated, and to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed Great Depression era safeguards that prevented commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies from merging.|$|E
2500|$|Huxley's {{arguments}} with Owen {{continued in the}} Athenaeum so that each Saturday Darwin could read the latest ripostes. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an [...] "advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape", {{and one of his}} contributions was titled [...] "Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on [...] "pithecoid man" [...] – ape-like man, and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. He was determined to indict Owen for perjury, promising [...] "before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a <b>barn</b> <b>door,</b> an example to all evil doers." [...] Darwin egged him on from Down, writing [...] "Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side".|$|E

2500|$|The {{floor plan}} of aisled barns {{resembles that of}} an aisled church. However, the nave in farm {{buildings}} is called an aisle thus a [...] "three aisled barn". Aisled barns have the big <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> on the gable end of the building giving access to the center aisle, often called the drive floor or threshing floor. The side aisles may be the same widths making the barn symmetrical or the aisle where animals were housed may be narrower which is apparent outside the barn because the <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> are then off-center. The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle.|$|R

2500|$|A Fresnel lantern (UK), {{or simply}} Fresnel (US), employs a Fresnel lens to wash light over {{an area of}} the stage. The lens is named after French {{physicist}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel, and consequently pronounced with a silent [...] "s". The distinctive lens has a 'stepped' appearance instead of the 'full' or 'smooth' appearance of those used in other lanterns. The resulting beam of light is wide and soft-edged, creating soft shadows, and is commonly used for back light, top light, and side light. Another method of controlling the spread of light is to use either a top hat (also referred to as a snoot), which generally limits the light coming out, or a <b>barn</b> <b>door,</b> whose flaps work as though they were shutters on an ERS (shown on the right). These methods limit light output and keep excess light from spilling into the eyes of audience members or where it is not desired.|$|E
2500|$|To Thomas Henry Huxley {{the claim}} about the {{hippocampus}} minor {{appeared to be}} a significant blunder by Owen, and Huxley began systematically dissecting the brains of monkeys, determined that [...] "before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a <b>barn</b> <b>door,</b> an example to all evil doers." [...] He did not discuss this in public at this stage, but continued to attack Owen's other ideas, aiming to undermine Owen's status. At his 17 June 1858 Royal Institution Croonian Lecture [...] "On the Theory of the Vertebrate Skull", Huxley directly challenged Owen's central idea of archetypes shown by homology, with Owen in the audience. Huxley's aim was to overcome the domination of science by wealthy clergymen led by Owen, {{in order to create a}} professional salaried scientific civil service and make science secular. Under Darwin's influence he took up transmutation as a way of dividing science from theology, and in January 1859 argued that [...] "it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt".|$|E

Other uses are closet <b>doors,</b> <b>barn</b> <b>doors,</b> storm doors, etc. All uses require hold backs of some sort to keep shutter or door from [...] "flapping in the wind".|$|R
