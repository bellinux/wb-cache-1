30|$|Jezierska and Witeska (2006) {{concluded}} that {{the difference in the}} amounts of various metal ion accumulation in fish body result from different affinity of metals to fish tissues, different uptake, deposition, and excretion rates. Studies related to the <b>bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in tissues demonstrated the variation of metal accumulations (Watanabe et al., 2003, Masoud et al., 2007 and Younis et al., 2015). Moreover, Koca et al. (2005) postulated that the accumulation patterns of contaminants in fish and other aquatic organisms depend on both uptake and elimination rates of contaminants. <b>Bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> may lead to high mortality rate or cause many biochemical and histological alterations in the survived fish (Rashed, 2001 a; Rashed, 2001 b and Soltan et al., 2005). It has been indicated that BCFs from environment to fish tissue changes according to the species of the chemical, the metabolite properties of the tissues, and the pollution degree of the environment (Ayas, 2007; Ozmen et al., 2008 and Younis et al., 2015).|$|E
40|$|Mollusks {{living in}} seas can {{accumulate}} heavy metals, and {{may serve as}} excellent passive biomonitors. During a period of I year, bioaccumulation of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn was examined in nine kinds of mollusks (Rapana venosa, Neverita didyma, Scapharca subcrenata, Mytilus edulis, Aniusium, Crassostrea talienwhanensis, Meretix meretrix, Ruditapes philippinarum, and Mactra veneriformis), which were collected at eight coastal sites along the Chinese Bohai Sea. Metal concentrations were directly determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Two certified reference materials, dogfish muscle (DORM- 2) and mussel (GBW 08571), were used to validate the methods, and the recoveries were within 83. 72 - 112. 30 % of the certified values. <b>Bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> varied strongly among sampling sites and species. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA) indicated that different species examined showed different <b>bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals,</b> and perhaps they {{could be used as}} potential biomonitors to investigate the contamination levels of heavy metals. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis were used to study the relationships between these heavy metals. The results showed that, in nine mollusks' tissues, there are significant correlations between these elements in adjacent main group or subgroup in periodic table of elements. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Good motility and no mortality of E. fetida were found in all treatments after 28 d of exposure.

Body concentration of metals as a function of body size was then simulated by the kinetic model and compared with the actual measurements. The uptake rate constants decreased with increasing fish size. with an allometric exponent (b) of 0. 615 to 0. 662. Ingestion rate was also negatively correlated with the fish size (b = - 0. 604). Assimilation efficiencies of Cd were independent of body size, whereas those of Se and Zn increased with fish size. In contrast. efflux rate constants and growth rate constants for metals were comparable in different sizes of fish. Predicted concentrations of Cd and Zn were comparable to actual measurements and were negatively correlated with fish size.

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 18 th May 2005 A multidisciplinary approach has been adopted in order to investigate the <b>bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and organometals in macrobenthic populations. A complete method coupling a sampling strategy and classification of benthic organisms with a performant analytical procedure {{for the analysis of}} both metals and organometals has been developed. A single sample preparation method using a TMAH extraction and species specific isotope dilution makes it possible to analyse metals and organometals in the same extract, which is especially interesting for situations where only a limited amount of sample is available. Low detection limits have been obtained in the range of 12 – 250 pg g 1 for mercury and butyltin compounds and 0. 4 – 50 ng g 1 for metals with good precision (1 – 10 % RSD) even for a very low mass of sample (0. 02 g). This method has been applied for monitoring contamination and <b>bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and organometals as well as the biodiversity and trophic structure of the macrobenthic population of the Adour Estuary (South-West, France). The benthic macrofauna diversity indicates that inner estuarine stations are moderately polluted whereas outer estuarine stations are less impacted.

Moreover, the bioaccumulation has been determined in relation to the feeding guild of benthic organisms. The result...|$|E

While {{there have been numerous}} studies on the whole-body <b>bioaccumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> by organisms, {{little is known about the}} kinetics of organ-specific bioaccumulation. This study used the radioisotope 109 Cd to explore the internal uptake kinetics of this non-essential metal following accumulation from solution by the freshwater decapod crustacean Macrobrachium australiense. The first stage of the study involved exposing 24 organisms for up to 2 weeks to 0. 55 µg Cd/L in synthetic river water with three individuals being removed at pre-defined time points. Following exposure, animals were rinsed in a 0. 1 mM EDTA solution to remove any loosely-bound metal, rapidly frozen and the anatomical distribution of the radionuclide visualised from fresh frozen sections (20 um) using autoradiography. The second phase of the study consisted of exposing organisms to the same radiotracer solution for a short period (6 h) and long period (7 d), followed by depuration in metal- and isotope-free water for up to 3 weeks. Organisms were removed from depuration at pre-defined time points, rapidly frozen, the anatomical distribution of the radionuclide determined as above. Preliminary results suggest that the gills appeared to saturate after 7 d exposure, with negligible increase over another 7 d of exposure. However, the ratio of Cd between the hepatopancreas and gills increased over time, suggesting the organism was actively processing accumulated metal. Rates of accumulation into different internal compartments in response to changes in uptake and depuration durations will be discussed. The findings of the study provide new information on the processing of a non-essential metal by M. australiense and could potentially be used to estimate the exposure history of field-caught organisms...|$|E
