50|$|Some runways have ILS beams {{intended}} for use in one direction only. However, as the localizer beam by its nature also goes backwards, it can still be of some use. This is called <b>back</b> <b>beam.</b> It's of help during the approach, {{but the use of}} <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> localizer gives less precision compared to normal use.|$|E
5000|$|A {{localizer}} (like a glideslope) {{works as}} a cooperation between the transmitting airport runway and the receiving cockpit instruments. An older aircraft without ILS receiver cannot take advantage of any ILS facilities at any runway, and much more importantly, the most modern aircraft have no use of their ILS instruments at runways which lack ILS facilities. In parts of Africa and Asia large airports may lack any kind of transmitting ILS system. Some runways have ILS only in one direction, this can however still be used (with a lower precision) known as <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> or [...] "Back Course" [...] which is not associated with a glide slope.|$|E
50|$|The {{black and}} white cotton warp threads first need to be wound onto the loom. This is done in 64m lengths, and the threads are wound onto the <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> of the loom. The warp has 60 threads per inch and is {{approximately}} 20 inches wide, each thread needs to be threaded through a heddle {{in the middle of}} the loom, and then through the reed at the front of the loom. This threading process is done by hand using a threading hook. Once the machine is threaded up, the warp threads are secured at the front of the loom onto the front beam. The loom then needs to be calibrated to advance the warp threads at the correct speed to weave 84 threads per inch.|$|E

50|$|At 1:46 a.m. in Mumbai on 28 July 1963 (20:16 GMT on 27 July), the Comet crew {{reported}} being overhead the Santa Cruz VOR beacon at 7000 feet and were cleared to descend to 4000 feet. The crew requested an Instrument Landing System approach to Runway 09 {{and that they}} would follow the <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> procedure. The controller advised them the procedure was not available and they should carry out an approach using the VOR beacon. The crew agreed to use the procedure and reported leaving 7000 feet in the descent on the 272-degree radial from the VOR. The controller advised them that they might encounter heavy turbulence if they went more than six or seven miles west of the airport. The crew requested a left-hand procedure rather than the more normal right-hand one because of the weather. Permission was granted and the aircraft, already in severe turbulence, entered a left-hand turn and then crashed into the sea at 1:50 a.m., nine nautical miles from Madh Island.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{in use in}} 1850. It was reconfigured in 1893. It was driven by a {{condensing}} stationary steam engine which required a reservoir or mill lodge to contain water to condense the steam; this was filled in the 1970s. The mill {{took advantage of the}} copious soft water to engage in finishing yarn or fabric. The processes involved bleaching, mercerising and dyeing.The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914-1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonys to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Ainsworth Mill, Breightmet was one of 104 mills bought last by the LCC. It one of the 53 mills that LCC owned in 1950, and was extensively refurbished to provide a mercerising facility. They established a research and quality control laboratory here to service the group and ensure the stability of the colour. Yarn was received from other mills in the group in warp or in hank, and is mercerised, bleached and dyed, then wrapped into hank, cone, quiller pirn, <b>back</b> <b>beam,</b> weaver's beam, cheese or precision wound multiple end cheese as required. On LCC demise, Ainsworth Mill continued in business as a bleaching and dyeing work until the dyeing company that went into liquidation in 2006. The works is derelict, but surveys have been done showing an intention to bring the mill back into industrial use.|$|E
30|$|The mining {{technology}} {{is the same as}} the traditional mining. Backfilling and mining work in parallel. Backfill proceeds from the tail to the head of the backfilling conveyor. After the material is accumulated to a certain height the next unloading hole is open and a machine rammer presses a tamping slab to tamp the material. This process would be repeated until the material has been sufficiently tamped and in general, it takes two or three cycles. The first round of backfilling would pause after the face has been fully filled. The backfilling conveyor then moves forward toward the head of the <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> and the compactor pushes all of the material that remains under the backfilling conveyor back and above till solid material reaches the roof. In this way, the material is being pushed toward the roof and compacted. Finally, close the unloading holes to back fill the space below the conveyor headpiece. After the first back filling cycle is completed, the conveyor would be pushed to the end of the <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> to start another cycle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sandwich {{composite}} panel with {{high strength steel}} face can reduce {{the weight of the}} automotive structural parts. Unlike the parts in aerospace application, the automotive parts are made by the forming process for mass production. The CAE simulation can predict the failures caused by forces and deformation during the forming process. Since the material properties are very important factor for the simulation, we performed the tensile test to get the material properties. The inspections by the optical microscope at each strain level show the states of the polymer resin. The material properties measured by the tensile tests are used for the input data of simulation. The simulation predicts the forming process of the bumper <b>back</b> <b>beam</b> very exactly compared with the try out results...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} model on {{electromechanical coupling coefficient}} and the length optimization of a bending piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer are proposed. The piezoelectric transducer consists of 8 PZT elements sandwiched between four thin electrodes, and the PZT elements are clamped by a screwed connection between fore beam and <b>back</b> <b>beam.</b> Firstly, bending vibration model of the piezoelectric transducer {{is built based on}} the Timoshenko beam theory. Secondly, the {{analytical model}} of effective electromechanical coupling coefficient is built based on the bending vibration model. Energy method and electromechanical equivalent circuit method are involved in the modelling process. To validate the analytical model, sandwich type piezoelectric transducer example in second order bending vibration mode is analysed. Effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of the transducer is optimized with simplex reflection technique, and the optimized ratio of length of the transducers is obtained. Finally, experimental prototypes of the sandwich type piezoelectric transducers are fabricated. Bending vibration mode and impedance of the experimental prototypes are tested, and electromechanical coupling coefficient is obtained according to the testing results. Results show that the analytical model is in good agreement with the experimental model...|$|E

Without careful estimation of the magnetic loading on the drive sys-tems or the mechanical parts such as keeper, <b>backing</b> <b>beam,</b> and support frame of an EPU device, the polarized spectral performance may be degraded due to unexpected structure deformation, or even the device might be damaged. In part II of the conference paper, we address our efforts on the de-termination of the maximal magnetic loading on the individ-ual magnetic arrays, and on the estimation of the resulting structure deformation by using the 3 D finite element code ANSYS. The formula for estimation of the spectral inten-sity degradation due to structure deformation are given. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} {{test method}} {{for determining the}} mode I fracture toughness of adhesive joints with dissimilar substrates will be discussed. The test method {{is based on the}} familiar Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen geometry, but overcomes limitations in existing techniques that preclude their use when testing joints with dissimilar substrates. The test method is applicable to adhesive joints where the two bonded substrates have different flexural rigidities due to geometric and/or material considerations. Two specific features discussed are the use of <b>backing</b> <b>beams</b> to prevent substrate damage and a compliance matching scheme to achieve symmetric loading conditions. The procedure is demonstrated on a modified DCB specimen comprised of SRIM composite and thin-section, e-coat steel substrates bonded with an epoxy adhesive. Results indicate that the test method provides a practical means of characterizing the mode I fracture toughness of joints with dissimilar substrates...|$|R
