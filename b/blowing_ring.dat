60|$|I {{have now}} come, {{as those who}} read will see, to look upon smoking with my wife's eyes. My old {{bachelor}} friends complain because I do not allow smoking in the house, but I am always ready to explain my position, and I have not an atom of pity for them. If I cannot smoke here neither shall they. When I visit them in the old inn they take a poor revenge by <b>blowing</b> <b>rings</b> of smoke almost in my face. This ambition to <b>blow</b> <b>rings</b> is the most ignoble known to man. Once I {{was a member of}} a club for smokers, where we practised <b>blowing</b> <b>rings.</b> The most successful got a box of cigars as a prize at the end of the year. Those were days! Often I think wistfully of them. We met in a cozy room off the Strand. How well I can picture it still. Time-tables lying everywhere, with which we could light our pipes. Some smoked clays, but for the Arcadia Mixture give me a brier. My brier was the sweetest ever known. It is strange now to recall a time when a pipe seemed to be my best friend.|$|R

The <b>blows</b> <b>rang</b> out spang--spang--spang! Strong music, full of meaning! When his turn came to be a spiker, he would love that hardest work of all.|$|R

60|$|Ned cast {{a single}} glance backward, and beheld the people pushing and {{buffeting}} his uncle {{in a most}} unceremonious manner. His helmet was knocked down over his eyes, and the coat--so much too small for him--was rendered an easy fit by being ripped up behind to the neck. Ned could not stand this. He was stout of limb and bold as a lion, although not naturally addicted to fighting, so he turned suddenly round and flew to the rescue.

50|$|Smokers may <b>blow</b> smoke <b>rings</b> {{from the}} mouth, {{intentionally}} or accidentally.

"Seeing {{that he took}} {{no notice}} of my words, I dug my spurs into my horse and hurled myself against him; then {{at the very moment}} my horse struck his with a {{tremendous}} shock, I brought down my iron whip-handle with all the force that was in me upon his head. The <b>blow</b> <b>rang</b> as if I had struck upon an anvil, while at the same moment he, without swerving, clutched my cloak with both hands. I could feel that they were bony, hard hands, armed with long, crooked, sharp talons like an eagle's, which pierced through my cloak into my flesh. Dropping my whip, I seized him by the throat, which seemed scaly and hard, between my hands, and thus, locked together in a desperate struggle, we swayed this way and that, each trying to drag the other from his seat till we came down together with a crash upon the earth. In a moment we were disengaged and on our feet. Quick as lightning flashed out his long, sharp weapon, and, finding I was too late to draw mine, I hurled myselfagainst him, seizing his armed hand in both mine before he could strike.|$|R

60|$|So far I had not {{dared to}} look out, but now I gently parted the {{division}} of the curtains {{in front of me and}} peeped through. From the pressure of Holmes's shoulder against mine, I knew that he was sharing my observations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long, black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket, claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long, legal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion, <b>blowing</b> <b>rings</b> of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude.|$|R

60|$|My {{present state}} is {{so happy that}} I can only look back with wonder at my {{hesitation}} to enter upon it. Our house was taken while I was still arguing {{that it would be}} dangerous to break myself of smoking all at once. At that time my ideal of married life was not what it is now, and I remember Jimmy's persuading me to fix on this house, because the large room upstairs with the three windows was a smoker's dream. He pictured himself and me there in the summer-time <b>blowing</b> <b>rings,</b> with our coats off and our feet out at the windows; and he said that the closet at the back looking on to a blank wall would make a charming drawing-room for my wife. For the moment his enthusiasm carried me away, but I see now how selfish it was, and I have before me the face of Jimmy when he paid us his first visit and found that the closet was not the drawing-room. Jimmy is a fair specimen of a man, not without parts, destroyed by devotion to his pipe. To this day he thinks that mantelpiece vases are meant for holding pipe-lights in. We are almost certain that when he stays with us he smokes in his bedroom--a detestable practice that I cannot permit.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{my first}} {{experience}} of travelling with a fellow passenger in a compartment of an English train, and I admit now that I was as yet ignorant of the proper method of conduct. Later on I became fully conversant with the rule of travel as understood in England. I should have known, of course, that I must on no account speak to the man. But I should have let down the window {{a little bit in}} such a way as to make a strong draught on his ear. Had this failed to break down his reserve I should have placed a heavy valise in the rack over his head so balanced that it might fall on him at any moment. Failing this again, I could have <b>blown</b> <b>rings</b> of smoke at him or stepped on his feet under the pretence of looking out of the window. Under the English rule as long as he bears this in silence you are not supposed to know him. In fact, he is not supposed to be there. You and he each presume the other to be a mere piece of empty space. But let him once be driven to say, [...] "Oh, I beg your pardon, I wonder if you would mind my closing the window," [...] and he is lost. After that you are entitled to tell him anything about the corn crop that you care to.|$|R
60|$|There was {{the gleam}} of an axe from above, a sharp <b>ringing</b> <b>blow,</b> and the jaws came {{together}} with a clash which rang from bank to bank. He had missed her! Swerving beneath the blow, his snout had passed beneath her body, and smashed up {{against the side of}} the canoe, as the striker, overbalanced, fell headlong overboard upon the monster's back.|$|R
60|$|Carroll {{sat beside}} the latter, {{alternately}} holding a stout plank {{up to the}} blaze and dabbling its hot surface with a dripping mop. His face was scorched, and he coughed as the resinous-scented smoke drifted about his head and floated in heavy, blue wisps half-way up the giant trunks behind him. A big sea canoe lay drawn up not far away, {{and one of its}} copper-skinned Siwash owners lounged on the shingle, stolidly watching the white men. His comrade was then inside the sloop, holding a big stone against one of her frames, while Vane crouched outside, swinging a hammer. Her empty hull flung back the thud of the <b>blows,</b> which <b>rang</b> far across the trees.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this point}} the {{proceedings}} of the modern highwayman might have passed as gentle. Now they turned in an instant to savagery. The chauffeur, a burly, capable fellow, incited by that raucous voice behind him, sprang from the car and seized the advancing robber by the throat. The latter hit out with the butt-end of his pistol, and the man dropped groaning on the road. Stepping over his prostrate body the adventurer pulled open the door, seized the stout occupant savagely by the ear, and dragged him bellowing on the highway. Then, very deliberately, he struck him twice across the face with his open hand. The <b>blows</b> <b>rang</b> out like pistol-shots in the silence of the night. The fat traveller turned a ghastly colour and fell back half senseless {{against the side of the}} limousine. The robber dragged open his coat, wrenched away the heavy gold watch-chain with all that it held, plucked out the great diamond pin that sparkled in the black satin tie, dragged off four rings--not one of which could have cost less than three figures--and finally tore from his inner pocket a bulky leather notebook. All this property he transferred to his own black overcoat, and added to it the man's pearl cuff-links, and even the golden stud which held his collar. Having made sure that there was nothing else to take, the robber flashed his lantern upon the prostrate chauffeur, and satisfied himself that he was stunned and not dead. Then, returning to the master, he proceeded very deliberately to tear all his clothes from his body with a ferocious energy which set his victim whimpering and writhing in imminent expectation of murder.|$|R

2500|$|The design {{popularized by}} von Liebig thus {{consisted}} of an inner, straight tube {{surrounded by an}} outer straight tube, with the outer tube having ports for fluid inflow and outflow, and with the two tubes sealed in some fashion at the ends (eventually, by a <b>blown</b> glass <b>ring</b> seal). Its simplicity made it convenient to construct and inexpensive to manufacture, the higher heat capacity of the circulating water (vs. air) allowed for maintaining near to constant temperature in the condenser, and so the Liebig type {{proved to be the}} more efficient condenser—capable of condensing liquid from a much greater flow of incoming vapor—and therefore replaced retorts and air condensers. An added benefit of the simplicity of the straight inner tube design of this condenser type is that it can be [...] "packed" [...] with materials that increase the surface area (and so the number of theoretical plates of the distillation column, see section below), e.g., plastic, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc. [...] See Fractional Distillation.|$|R
