5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
2500|$|Hedberg {{was known}} to be a drug user, {{mentioning}} it in some of his jokes (e.g., [...] "I used to do drugs. I still do, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to, too"). In May 2003 he was arrested in Austin, Texas, for heroin possession.|$|E
2500|$|She later reconsidered her {{characterization}} {{that it was}} a consensual relationship. In {{an interview}} on HLN's The Joy Behar Show, she said: [...] "As I was writing the book, I thought, this word, it kept sitting wrong with me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> it {{for lack of a better}} word. Since then, I've been schooled by thousands of incest survivors all across the world that there really is no such thing as consensual incest due to the inherent power a parent has over a child. So, I wouldn't necessarily call it a consensual relationship at this time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Poulidor {{has several}} times {{accepted}} that {{his career was}} handicapped {{by a lack of}} ambition and by the psychological domination of Jacques Anquetil. Poulidor {{said in an interview in}} 1992: I knew straight away that I was getting places everywhere. I got all the leaders' jerseys <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to lose them. Tonin [...] said to me [...] "Raymond, you're always in a daydream!" [...] And was that true? Were you distracted? It was true. I thought what was happening to me was already marvellous enough. I never thought of winning. Never, ever, did I get up in the morning with the idea of winning! ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton said, [...] "I've never studied acting or {{anything}} because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm convinced I {{got the chance}} to be on One Tree Hill because I did a guest thing on Dawson's Creek as myself, when the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House." [...] She added, [...] "And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?" [...] With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, [...] "Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> {{to dream}} that I had broken down, {{and had no}} money, and was {{starving}} in London. I thought about it all day, and it frightened me--oh, how it frightened me!' ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding vocal processors, Harrell says [...] "it's {{the sound}} of today in pop music. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> it as an {{enhancement}} and not to create the sound. My role is to capture the artist's personality. To trick them out with Auto-Tune would defeat that purpose, but consumers are used to hearing things pitch perfect so <b>I</b> <b>use</b> pitch correction to ensure that I have a flawless performance." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{for many}} years. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to think I {{was a regular}} rip-snorter when I was a youngster up in Eastern Oregon, sneaking away from camp to ride with the cattle and break cayuses {{and that sort of}} thing." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{whole world}} of ideas {{and a host of}} people and their mannerisms can all be {{suggested}} by a flicker of an eyelid, a flourish of the hand and the attitude of the body.

6000|$|... "True, Tommy, that's {{only right}} an' fair. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> ain't <b>used</b> to lookin' up when discoorsin'. Couldn't {{you come down}} here an' lay alongside?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> {{to think}} {{you were trying to}} do it. Well, Link wrote about it, and he wanted to know if I would help him in a scheme to pay you back. He said he had a dandy scheme to pay you off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The girl amazes me," [...] said Schneider, {{with a look}} of astonishment. [...] "I {{never saw}} her, it is true, till yesterday; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> no force: her father gave her to me with his free consent, and she yielded as gladly. Speak, Edward Ancel, was it not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, Ebony, so you did; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> {{to think}} your {{energetic}} praise {{was due to}} your enthusiastic disposition, and so {{paid no attention to}} your invitations to go for'ard an' listen. Well, I confess I was a loser. You must have played the instrument a long time, surely?"--turning to the seaman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>use</b> it. Now, good-bye, {{my little}} friend.--What {{will you do}} with {{yourself}} to-day, when you are gone from me?' he lingered to ask.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} {{the construction of}} Dynamic SHA- 2 family of cryptographic hash functions. They are built with design components from the SHA- 2 family, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> the bits in message as parameters of function G, R and ROTR operation in the new hash function. It enabled us to achieve a novel design principle: When message is changed, the calculation will be different. It makes the system can resistant against all extant attacks...|$|R

[...] "I don't know if I have ever mentioned it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to suffer from headaches at one time. Extraordinarily severe headaches.

6000|$|... "A {{few hundred}} pounds were insufficient," [...] Sabatini {{answered}} coolly, [...] "and {{my uncle was}} a coward. I waited my opportunity, and although three times I was denied an audience, on the fourth I found him alone. He would have driven me out <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> the means which I have never known to fail. I {{left him with a}} small but sufficient fortune." ...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{wonderful}} honor to be here today, to speak in praise of my hero, the great Lou Henkin. You will notice that in describing Lou <b>I</b> <b>use</b> two vastly overused words, 2 ̆ 2 great 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 hero, 2 ̆ 2 <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> both terms advisedly. As the late John Hart Ely used to say, you don 2 ̆ 7 t need many heroes if you choose carefully. And along with my father, and the late Harry Blackmun, Lou Henkin has been my hero for nearly 30 years...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean that}} of course. You'd never laugh at children, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought--I <b>used</b> to think--that perhaps you might laugh about them. So now I beg your pardon.... What {{are you going}} to laugh at?" ...|$|R

60|$|GRACE. Well, {{since you}} ask me, I never {{was in love}} with Tranfield, though I only found that out when I fell in love with you. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to like him for being in love with me. It brought out all the good in him so much that I have wanted to be in love with some one ever since. I hope, now that I am in love with you, you will like me for it just as I liked Tranfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{met some}} Boston people in Italy, and I thought I {{should like to}} live where that kind of people lived. That's the way I came to be in Boston. It all seems very simple now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> to think it might look romantic from the outside. I've had a happy life; and I'm glad it began in the country. I shouldn't care if it ended there. I don't know why I've bothered you with my autobiography, though. Perhaps because I thought you knew it already." ...|$|E

He never offered to speak to me or take my arm, but he stood to see me go by. Do you know, if I go into a country church today, that scent of wilted flowers and linen and mingled perfumes almost makes me weep?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} the film and book are taken from the first {{paragraph}} of Steven's written police statement, given during {{the early hours of}} March 2, 1980 in Ukiah.
