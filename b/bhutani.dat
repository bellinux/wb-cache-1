40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship of}} delivery type, maternal anesthesia, feeding modalities, and first feeding and meconium passage times with early bilirubin levels of healthy infants. Methods. Cord, 24 hours’ and 48 hours’ total bilirubin levels were measured in 388 study infants. Results. Infants born with cesarean section were fed later and more often had mixed feeding. First meconium passage was delayed with general anesthesia. Cord, 24 and 48 hours’ bilirubin levels {{were not correlated with}} first feeding time, meconium passage time, mode of delivery, existence and type of anesthesia, and feeding modalities. Being in high intermediate risk zone at 72 hours of <b>Bhutani’s</b> nomogram was only related to first feeding time and high cord bilirubin level. Late preterm infants were more frequently born with cesarean section and offered supplementary formula. Therefore, first meconium passage times and bilirubin levels were similar in the late preterm and term infants. Conclusions. Type of delivery or anesthesia, late prematurity, feeding modalities, and first meconium passage time were not related to early bilirubin levels in healthy neonates, but delayed first feeding and high cord bilirubin levels were related to be in higher risk zone for later hyperbilirubinemia...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transcutaneous {{bilirubin}} (TcB) has {{the potential}} to reduce serum bilirubin sampling. During a recent survey on the use of TcB in postnatal units in the Republic of Ireland, we identified that only 58 % of the 19 units were using TcB and that only two devices were in use, the BiliChek(R) and JM 103 (R). We aimed to evaluate and compare these two devices in a regional postnatal unit. METHODS: To evaluate and compare the accuracy of the BiliChek(R) and JM 103 (R), we studied simultaneous TcB and total serum bilirubin (TSB) measurements from a population of jaundiced term and near term infants. We evaluated each device with regard to correlation with TSB and potential to safely reduce serum bilirubin testing. RESULTS: Both TcB devices strongly correlated with TSB (r = 0. 88 for BiliChek(R) and r = 0. 70 for JM 103 (R). The BiliChek(R) and JM 103 (R) were accurate up to cut-off values of 200 mumol/L and 180 mumol/L, respectively. Using <b>Bhutani's</b> nomogram, 100 % sensitivity was achieved using the 75 th percentile for BiliChek(R) and the 40 th percentile for JM 103 (R). CONCLUSION: Both TcB devices correlated closely with moderately increased TSB levels and are suitable screening tools to identify jaundiced infants that require a serum bilirubin, with upper limit cut-off values. Both devices reduced the need for TSB levels. We found the BiliChek(R) slightly more accurate than the JM 103 (R) for our study population. TcB however, is not in widespread use...|$|R
