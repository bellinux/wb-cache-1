5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning. So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E
500|$|According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is [...] "a perfectionist workaholic". He is {{also known}} for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|Redding added, [...] "I had {{borrowed}} a terrible old hollow-body electric guitar from {{someone at the}} studio... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> play along on rhythm to familiarise myself with a sequence, not being quite {{at home on the}} bass yet". [...] The guitar was tuned down one-half step, with the tone controls set to resemble a bass guitar.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do so," [...] the boy said. [...] "You {{shall not}} {{complain}} of me, again. Hitherto I have played for amusement, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> exercise my limbs, {{and to show}} the others that I could run faster and was stronger than they were; but in future I shall have a motive in doing so, and will strive to be worthy of my father." ...|$|R

2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> startle people. I hope to wake up people. I {{have no desire to}} simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's hard for me to stay serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E
2500|$|Sirtis {{was delighted}} to {{get the chance to}} do some comedy in Star Trek: First Contact and said, [...] "I loved it because it opened the door to a {{different}} side of Troi we'd never seen before. That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I {{was going to have a}} good part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character. So I knew that he would do her some justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{worst time}} {{was before the}} Long Vacation. They told me I ought to read this book and that. Harvey Anderson used to come primed with arguments. I could always {{overthrow}} them, but when I came to glory in doing so, perhaps I prayed less. Anyway, they left a sting. It might be that I doubted my own sincerity, from knowing that I had got <b>to</b> argue, chiefly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> be looked on as a champion." ...|$|R

5000|$|The 1980s saw Etheridge remain {{very active}} on the live front - {{including}} a reunion with Soft Machine for the band's final series of concerts at Ronnie Scott's club in 1984 - but much less productive in the studio. [...] "1981 {{was a sort}} of watershed year for me... there's sort of before and after 1981. Since then I've mostly played on my own or led bands, playing alongside other people but not in settled formations. That was partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> do that, and partly <b>because,</b> frankly, <b>I</b> didn't really {{know what to do with}} myself at that point.

The recording took place Tuesday, December 13, 1966, at the CBS Studios in London following their performance of [...] "Hey Joe" [...] for the Ready Steady Go! music television program. Producer Chas Chandler explained The 'Red House' on the album Are You Experienced came about during the last fifteen minutes of 12/13 session. Noel even played rhythm guitar on the track, playing the bass line. Jimi just winged through one take for reference and we started rolling. Noel Redding added, [...] "I had borrowed a terrible old hollow-body electric guitar from someone at the studio ... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> play along on rhythm to familiarise myself with a sequence, not being quite at home on the bass yet".

6000|$|... "Ah, but {{the glory}}!" [...] Fulkerson insinuated with impudent persiflage. [...] "I hadn't {{got to the}} glory yet, because it's hard to {{estimate}} it; but put the glory at the lowest figure, Mr. Dryfoos, and {{add it to the}} twenty-five thousand, and you've got an annual income from 'Every Other Week' of dollars enough to construct a silver railroad, double-track, from this office to the moon.

Long rejoined us, and we ran, as I have said, our course; which, as I have also noted, seemed short to me in the light of such a blaze of suggestion. To each of my companions--and the fact stuck out of them--something unprecedented had happened.|$|E
