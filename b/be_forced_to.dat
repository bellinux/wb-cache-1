Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games.

5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki.

After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose {{of it in the}} ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler to <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious {{as the model for}} the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1992 Parry favoured a deal with ITV, but thought the network {{should be prepared to}} pay up towards £30 million for live football. At a meeting in January 1992, Dyke made it clear ITV would not be positioned as they were already paying too much for football. He and executive director Trevor East commented on BSkyB's debt and felt the company would <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> increase their borrowing if they were awarded a contract. This did not dissuade Quinton, who urged Murdoch to bid. Quinton even informed Chisholm that there were no bidding rules.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers.

The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact.
