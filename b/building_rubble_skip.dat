50|$|The {{remains of}} the overseer's {{quarters}} are located on steep, rocky ground immediately north of the single men's quarters and the supply centre. The remains include a dense scatter of <b>building</b> <b>rubble,</b> including bricks, CGI sheets, two inch steel water pipe, iron bath tub, sink, and two iron bed frames. A small levelled concrete pad is located {{to the rear of}} the <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> and next to the iron bath tub.|$|R
40|$|The main {{components}} of <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> collected from demolished structures are waste concrete, brick and tile. A {{series of experiments}} using recycled aggregates of various compositions from <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> were conducted. The test results show that <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> can be transformed into useful recycled aggregate through proper processing. When the recycled aggregate was washed, the negative effects on the recycled concrete were greatly reduced. This is especially meaningful for flexural strength. Recycled coarse aggregate is the weakest phase given a low water/cement ratio. This effect will dominate the mechanical properties of recycled concrete. On the contrary, using recycled aggregate in concrete has little effect on its mechanical properties if the water/cement ratio is high. This mechanism does not occur in recycled mortar. The quantity of recycled fine aggregate will govern the mortar strength reduction percentage. Although using brick and tile in concrete will affect its mechanical properties, the effect is limited...|$|R
50|$|<b>Building</b> <b>rubble</b> used as {{landfill}} {{may raise}} soil pH (i.e. create alkaline soil), {{which can be}} problematic in regions of acidic soils (with local plants adapted to acid soils).|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> collected from damaged and demolished structures {{is an important}} issue in every country. After crushing and screening, this material could serve as recycled aggregate in concrete. A series of experiments using recycled aggregate of various compositions from <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> was conducted. The test results show that the <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> could be transformed into useful recycled aggregate through proper processing. Using unwashed recycled aggregate in concrete will affect its strength. The effect will be more obvious at lower water/cement ratios. When the recycled aggregate was washed, these negative effects were greatly improved. This is especially true for the flexural strength of the recycled concrete. The recycled coarse aggregate is the weakest phase at a low water/cement ratio. This effect will dominate the strength of recycled concrete. This mechanism does not occur in recycled mortar. The quantity of recycled fine aggregate will govern the mortar strength. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{village was}} {{captured}} by Israel's 7th and Carmeli Brigades on 31 October 1948 during the Israeli Defense Force offensive Operation Hiram. The village was completely destroyed and only <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> left behind. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel and the village remained depopulated of its inhabitants. In 1950, the moshav of Ya'ara was established on its land.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} {{formerly}} Upper Kilrenny, until nearby Lower Kilrenny {{changed its name}} to Cellardyke in the 16th century. The oldest part of the present church is the 15th century tower, with the body of the building rebuilt in 1807-08 (re-using the original stones as <b>building</b> <b>rubble).</b> The attractive village has many well-preserved houses in the local vernacular style, with crow-stepped gables, datestones, forestairs, pan-tiled roofs etc.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a simple}} cave system {{underneath}} comprising a passageway and bricked up alcoves leading to a chamber close to the cliff edge to the south. The chamber is fitted with brick built bins but mainly filled with <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> {{which is likely to}} have arisen from the demolition some time ago of a property above, where now there is a car parking area.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of ongoing}} {{conflict}} in Yemen, {{people with disabilities}} face problems such as lack of services and inability to access <b>buildings.</b> <b>Rubble</b> in the streets can {{make it difficult for}} those with physical disabilities to access services.

In late 2015, Saudi-led coalitions bombed the Al Noor Center for Care and Rehabilitation of the Blind in Sana'a.|$|R
50|$|Desperate Dan is a {{wild west}} {{character}} in the British comic magazine The Dandy and has become their mascot. He made his appearance in the first issue which was dated 4 December 1937. He is apparently the world's strongest man, able to lift a cow with one hand. The pillow of his (reinforced) bed is filled with <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> and his beard is so tough he shaves with a blowtorch.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, the Gorings {{decided that}} they would also plant trees in the fort's interior. Large {{quantities}} of Romano-British pottery and <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> were discovered during preparations for planting, prompting the first archaeological excavation of the hill fort. The two temples {{and a large number}} of artefacts were discovered. However, the planting has caused damage to the archaeology within the hill fort due to disturbances caused by tree roots.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Army {{transferred}} the Weldon Spring Quarry to the Atomic Energy Commission, who used it from 1959 to 1966 as a disposal area for uranium, thorium, and radium residues from the Chemical Plant (both drummed and uncontained) and for disposal of contaminated <b>building</b> <b>rubble,</b> process equipment, and soils from demolition of a uranium processing facility in St. Louis. Radiological contamination {{occurred in the}} same locations as the nitroaromatic contamination.|$|R
50|$|The old finger piers of {{the east}} end, piers such as Evans Coleman Evans; and Lapointe, which had been in Vancouver since its incorporation, gave way. <b>Building</b> <b>rubble</b> was dumped on the {{foreshore}} at Main Street and a peninsula where the Hastings Mill once sat and a massive terminal was created {{at the behest of}} Barney Johnson with Federal money in 1958, hence the Centennial Year and name (BC's 100's birthday).|$|R
40|$|The uranium and {{transuranic}} {{content of}} site soils and <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> can be accurately measured using a NaI(Tl) well counter, without significant soil preparation. Accurate measurements of total uranium in uranium-transuranic mixtures can be made, despite {{a wide range}} (0. 3 % to 97 %) of uranium enrichment, sample mass, and activity concentrations. The appropriate uranium scaling factors needed to include the undetected uranium isotopes, particularly U 234 can be readily determined on a sample by sample basis {{as a part of}} the field analysis, by comparing the relative response of the U 235 186 keV peak versus the K shell X rays of U 238, U 235, and their immediate ingrowth daughters. The ratio of the two results is a sensitive and accurate predictor of the uranium enrichment and scaling factors. The case study will illustrate how NaI(Tl) gamma spectrometry was used to provide rapid turnaround uranium and transuranic activity levels for soil and <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> with sample by sample determination of the appropriate scaling factor to include the U 234 and Uranium 238 content...|$|R

50|$|The Chapel is a unicameral {{late medieval}} {{building}} with alterations perhaps of the 17th or 18th centuries. Two further carved stones, of uncertain (though probably early) character, were discovered re-used as <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> {{in the inner}} east gable and outer south wall during the chapel's restoration. They were left in situ and are readily visible. A broken font, somewhat resembling a round-backed chair in its present condition, lies outside the church, and may also be of early medieval date.|$|R

50|$|Tipuana tipu {{is viewed}} as an {{invasive}} weed in some countries and is known for having a very aggressive root system. The tree roots can easily lift up concrete and asphalt. Precautions should be taken when planting near buildings, homes, or pools, as {{they are likely to}} be damaged. Damage may sometimes be averted by trenching near the structure to a depth of about 1 metre and filling the trench with <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> or lining the trench with thick plastic sheeting or corrugated roofing sheets.|$|R
5000|$|The village {{takes its}} name from the Witham charterhouse, a Carthusian Priory founded in 1182 by Henry II, which had {{peripheral}} settlements including one at Charterhouse and possibly another at Green Ore. [...] It is reputed to be the first Carthusian house in England. One of only nine Carthusian Houses, the priory did not survive the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the dissolution it was worth £227; the equivalent of £52,000 today (2006). Excavations in 1921 revealed buttressed wall foundations and <b>building</b> <b>rubble</b> including glazed roof and floor tiles. It is a scheduled ancient monument.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of elevated entrances were {{between five and}} ten metres above the ground level and facing the courtyard side {{in order to protect}} them from shell fire. Several examples were located in rather unsuitable places, however, for example above the outside of a castle. Heights of above 15 metres are only rarely recorded. The entrance was usually only accessible from another building in the nearby vicinity that is occasionally still is archaeologically discernible. Many elevated entrances today are only two to three metres above the ground because the original ground level, often several metres lower, has been filled with <b>building</b> <b>rubble.</b>|$|R
