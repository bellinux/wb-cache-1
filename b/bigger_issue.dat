25|$|As Andrew Carnegie was funding {{libraries}} elsewhere {{across the}} United States, a committee {{was formed to}} petition Carnegie for funds to build a public library in Augusta despite the mayor and city council not supporting his involvement. Carnegie agreed to donate $50,000 to fund {{the building of a}} library on the condition the city council pay its upkeep costs of $5,000 per year for maintenance. The city, unwilling to take the financial incentive of running a library for this price per year declined Carnegie's offer leading to a great divide in the city regarding the support or not of a public library. By 1905 public sentiment about a free library was mixed as there was no clear indication whether or not a free library would be brought to the region. Public interest in the library subsequently lessened and funding became a <b>bigger</b> <b>issue</b> than before, forcing the library to close in 1906.|$|E
2500|$|University of Kansas {{assistant}} {{professor of political science}} Patrick Miller includes voter intimidation as a form of fraud. [...] "The substantially <b>bigger</b> <b>issue</b> with voter fraud has been election fraud being perpetrated by election officials and party officials tampering with votes ... It is not the rampant problem that the public believes that is there. Kris Kobach says it is. Donald Trump says it is. And the data just aren't there to prove it. It's a popular misconception that this is a massive problem.” ...|$|E
2500|$|There was a reason, and it {{presented}} a serious {{obstacle to the}} Deepwater Railway plans: collusion. It was only later revealed that at the time, both the C and the N were essentially under the common control of the even larger Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and New York Central Railroad (NYC), whose leaders, Alexander Cassatt and William Vanderbilt respectively, had secretly entered into a [...] "community of interests" [...] pact. The C and the N had apparently agreed {{with each other to}} refuse to negotiate with Col. Page and his upstart Deepwater Railway. It wasn't just the rates that Page wanted to share, which could possibly have been negotiated. The <b>bigger</b> <b>issue</b> was the coal lands which both larger railroads, especially the N, had large investments in.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a <b>bigger</b> <b>issue</b> now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
