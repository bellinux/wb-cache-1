The Einsatzgruppens commanders were ordinary citizens: the great majority were professionals and most were intellectuals. By the winter of 1941–1942, the four Einsatzgruppen and their helpers had killed almost 500,000 people.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the nests}} {{located near the}} {{periphery}} {{are more likely to}} be attacked than the ones in the center which are usually completely surrounded by other nests.

However, each colony is more prone to attack if the colony next to it is attacked. This is an example of the attacked neighbor risk and reduces some of the benefit gained by participating in selfish herd tactics.|$|E
