The turbine blade {{is one of the}} most important parts of turbine machinery, and the characteristic parameters, pressure ratio of the engine and rotating speed of the turbine are all related to the shape and size of blades. Therefore, the profile measurement of turbine blade is an essential issue in the <b>blade</b> <b>machining</b> processing, however, it is difficult and particular to establish the profile measurement of turbine blade because of its complicated shapes and space angles of the blades, and the specific stringent environmental requirements need a more appropriate measurement method to the Turbine Blade profile measurement.

40|$|Turbine blade {{production}} through 3 - and 5 -axis CNC machines is {{a challenging}} process. Planning and realizing an entire turbine blade {{is the goal}} of this project. Besides, it is fundamental to experiment alternative machining strategies and find the best one, after defining clear and useful performance criteria. The focus is put on the blade's airfoil finishing. In order to reach this goal, four different machining strategies have been implemented. Among them, there are three 3 -axis strategies and one 5 -axis one. The starting raw workpiece is an aluminium cylinder. The chosen CNC machine is the GMX 250 linear by Gildemeister and is a 5 -axis one. The used tools are a 52 mm diameter toroidal mill, a 16 mm diameter ball end mill and a 20 mm diameter toroidal mill. In order to create the desired machining strategies, a core role is played by the CAD/CAM softwares used to obtain the tool paths corresponding to each implemented machining strategy. The used softwares are: VANC; Gib-CAM; Tebis. The core of the thesis project consists of: complete description of the entire turbine <b>blade</b> <b>machining</b> process; description of the four airfoil's finishing strategies; analysis of these strategies in order to find the best one. The performance criteria chosen to judge the different finishing operations are surface roughness (as quality representative) and machining time (as productivity equivalent).

Once this is proved, it is possible to establish which finishing operation is the fastest one, the most productive. What is expected and obtained, after implementing the different finishing operations, is that with 5 -axis machining there is a large time reduction compared to each 3 -axis machining time...|$|E

Qu et al. [8] proposed a multi-objective optimization method to minimize cutting force and maximize machining efficiency. Yang et al. [9] established the mathematical model of cutting force for thin-walled parts of titanium alloy by means of multiple regression and orthogonal test. Moreover, the influence of cutting force on machining deformation has been analyzed, which provides a reference for optimization of cutting parameters of difficult-to-machine materials. Zhou et al.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} process of machining complex and varying contour aerofoil parts used in aerospace industry like wings, blades of turbine and diffusers, etc. The main theme is to enhance productivity {{and on the other hand}} achieving accurate machining results for complex profile parts. The research consists of three main parts viz. Accurate and optimized tool path generation of complex profile, understanding and conversion of a 5 -axes machine kinematics into mathematical relationships and developing a post processor which converts cutter location file into machine readable file, and finally a time and accuracy study has been made and compared with techniques used previously for machining of such components. Tool path is generated on CAM software from where CL (Cutter Location) file is generated, then by use of mathematical calculations post processor is developed and used for the conversion of that CL file into machine readable file. Time and accuracy analysis has been made in the end on an impeller <b>blade</b> <b>machining.</b> Tool paths generated in CAM software requires to be very closely analyzed in order to ensure collision free tool paths as movement in all 5 -axes increases the chances of collision of head to work piece or with the table. For the study of 5 -axes machine kinematics and calculations, a general 5 -axes machine having 3 linear axes and two axes in rotary/tilting table has been used. By applying mathematical relationships using rotational matrix theorem and dot product of two vector quantities, equations were derived for rotary and tilting axes and then written in programming language (Visual C++) for line to line conversion of CL file into machine readable file. For the generation of CL file three different tool paths were generated. First process was the roughing of the area between every two adjacent blades then the next step was to finish the surface of the blades and the leading/trailing edge and the last process was to finish the hub surface of the impeller. The cutting parameters like feed, speed, axial depth of cut, radial depth of cut are dependent on the spindle power of the machine and the type of the material of part to be machined and that of the cutter itself. The selection of the size of the cutting tool used for the machining of each process is also dependant on the minimum area between two adjacent surfaces of the blades of impeller and maximum curvature of the blade from shroud surface to hub surface in order to avoid collision of the cutting tool with the blade surfaces. In the end, how the new approach has benefited is analyzed. The need for research on new approach was very demanding as to manufacture complex profile parts mostly used in aerospace industry with traditional machining approaches causes unpredictable delays due to manual calculations, inaccurate machining results like poor surface finish, tool breakage, etc, as well as requirement of various jigs/fixtures and skilled workers for accomplishing the task all the time.
