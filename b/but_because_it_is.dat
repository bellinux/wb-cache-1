25|$|Some Green Minibus Unions {{have called}} for the Government to provide a new fleet of buses which can hold up to 20 people, 4 more people than the current 16 people.

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, apple growers {{in the region}} found {{that they could not}} sell their fruit, not because of taste <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> smaller and has a less shiny {{appearance}} than fruit from the north of Mexico, the US and Chile. In 2003, apple growers from Pinal de Amoles and other nearby municipalities came together to find ways of marketing their product. The result is the production of apple juice, produced by a cooperative. Initial taste tests were positive but marketing was a challenge. Business students helped out and eventually the product began to appear on store shelves in various parts of Mexico and even in the US. In 2005, the cooperative signed a deal with bottlers to sell 60 tons of Querétaro Golden apples as 550,000 250-ml boxes of juice.|$|E

25|$|Critics of Ordinatio Sacerdotalis point out, {{that it was}} not promulgated {{under the}} {{extraordinary}} papal magisterium as an ex cathedra statement, and therefore is not considered infallible in itself.

Other Catholics believe the opposite.|$|E

500|$|Equitable tracing {{is based}} not on legal {{ownership}} but on the claimant's possession of an equitable interest. There are several advantages to equitable tracing; first, it can trace property now mixed with other property. In Boscawen v Bajwa, Millett justified this by saying that [...] "equity's power to charge a mixed fund with the repayment of trust moneys enables the claimant to follow the money, {{not because it is}} his, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> derived from a fund which is treated as if it were subject to a charge in his favour".

500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: [...] "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now I understand what you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E
500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E
