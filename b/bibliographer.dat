5|$|In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined Barley 40 shillings for illicitly {{publishing}} {{a number of}} works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing privileged books. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the Accidence, a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, Barley, along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and Thomas Pavier (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company {{within a few years}} so that they could continue their trade. Curiously, Barley did not join them until 1606. The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars. <b>Bibliographer</b> J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business. Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley, who held a royal patent on music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles. The Stationers' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant.|$|E

25|$|During the Elizabethan era {{and through}} the mid-seventeenth century, plays and poems were {{commonly}} printed as separate works in quarto format. Eighteen of Shakespeare's 36 plays included in first folio collected edition of 1623, were previously separately printed as quartos, with a single exception that was printed in octavo. For example, Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1, the most popular play of the era, was first published as a quarto in 1598, with a second quarto edition in 1599, followed {{by a number of}} subsequent quarto editions. Bibliographers have extensively studied these different editions, which they refer to by abbreviations such as Q1, Q2, etc. The texts of some of the Shakespeare quartos are highly inaccurate and are full of errors and omissions. <b>Bibliographer</b> Alfred W. Pollard named those editions Bad quartos, and it is speculated that they may have been produced, not from manuscript texts, but from actors who had memorized their lines.|$|E
25|$|Ioan Bianu (1856 or 1857 – February 13, 1935) was an Imperial Austrian-born Romanian philologist and <b>bibliographer.</b> The son of {{a peasant}} family from Transylvania, he {{completed}} high school in Blaj, where he became a disciple of Timotei Cipariu and Ioan Micu Moldovan. As a youth, he espoused Romanian nationalism, and came into conflict with the Austro-Hungarian authorities, before finally emigrating to the Romanian Old Kingdom in 1876. There, he attended the University of Bucharest, later joining the faculty, where he taught Romanian literary history. He was affiliated with the Romanian Academy Library for over half a century, transforming the institution from the meager state in which he found it, and overseeing a five-fold increase of its collection. He helped author two important multi-volume works detailing early books and manuscripts from his country, and was a founder of library and information science in his adoptive country. Near {{the end of his}} life, struggling with deafness, Bianu withdrew from the Library in favor of his friend Radu R. Rosetti, but went on to serve as president of the Romanian Academy.|$|E

40|$|OF THE SCHOLARS {{who enter}} {{libraries}} to pursue research, those {{who call themselves}} <b>bibliographers</b> {{have been among the}} most vocal critics of the policies and attitudes they encounter. That there should be such divergence of opinion, and at times even mutual disparagement, between <b>bibliographers</b> and librarians is par-ticularly distressing because the two fields are naturally related and, indeed, overlap (especially in their interest in the identification and recording of printed material). Developments in one field are bound to affect the other, and progress can best be made in both if a spirit of cooperation and understanding exists between them. Just why this understanding frequently is not present is a complex matter. Stereo-typed views of certain scholarly activities may exacerbate the prob-lem-as when literary critics belittle bibliographical work, or when <b>bibliographers</b> in turn look down on library work-but these preju-dices are, of course, symptoms rather than underlying causes of misunderstanding. The prejudices will decrease as workers in one field come to understand what their colleagues in an associated field are really doing and what relationship that activity bears to their own. With this in mind, I should like to try to describe the <b>bibliographer's</b> approach to books and to indicate some of the implications of that point of view for library policy. In doing so, I do not mean to suggest that librarians are unique in sometimes failing to understand what bibliography is about; just as much misunderstanding exists within academic departments. Moreover, the cause in each case is the same: a failure to recognize the relationship between the form and the content of books. Any attempt to explain what <b>bibliographers</b> do must first confront the awkward word bibliography itself, a word which has been applied to a considerable variety of activities.
