5|$|The {{track was}} {{discovered}} in 1970 during peat excavations, and is named after its finder, Ray Sweet. The company for which he worked, E. J. Godwin, sent part of a plank from the track to John Coles, an assistant lecturer in archaeology at Cambridge University, who had carried out some excavations on nearby trackways. Coles' interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which ran from 1973 to 1989, funded by various donors including English Heritage. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the third and first millennia BC. The work of John Coles, <b>Bryony</b> Coles, and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge, and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.|$|E
5|$|A fourth-wicket {{partnership}} of 83 runs between Amy Jones and Ellyse Perry rescued Loughborough from 31 for three against the Western Storm, and they posted 158 for eight. Storm's captain, Heather Knight, scored 74 {{runs in the}} chase, but received little batting support from her teammates. After Knight was run out, the Storm faltered to eventually lose the game by five runs. Western Storm were in action again two days later, when they hosted the Stars in Bristol. The Stars batted first and scored 161 for six, propelled by an innings of 90 not out from Nat Sciver. In their chase, Stafanie Taylor scored 74 not out, and Lizelle Lee got 53 to help the Storm to victory. In Southampton the next day, the Southern Vipers beat the Diamonds by 54 runs; Suzie Bates and Arran Brindle each scored 45 runs for the hosts, and Linsey Smith then took four wickets to help bowl the Diamonds out for 64. Only Beth Mooney reached double figures for the Diamonds. A strong bowling performance from Alex Hartley and Marizanne Kapp helped Surrey to limit Lancashire to 102 for nine in the next match, with the pair both bowling economically and taking five wickets between them. The Stars chased down the target with more than four overs remaining; Tammy Beaumont scored 45, and <b>Bryony</b> Smith made 30.|$|E
5000|$|When Steven {{discovers that}} <b>Bryony's</b> father's new job has fallen through and that <b>Bryony’s</b> {{family is not}} moving away, he is {{convince}} that the future was always unchageable. He begins working {{on a plan to}} place himself in <b>Bryony's</b> future. Steven tells the bus driver that nothing changes; the future cannot be altered, as proof since <b>Bryony's</b> family will not move away. The bus driver becomes more agitated because the bus driver will lose his wife to her boss according to the time booth. The bus driver goes off, getting very drunk. The bus driver’s wife is working at a petrol station. The bus driver confronts his wife over this predicted affair that only he has viewed. He beats her, pouring petrol down her throat.|$|R

5|$|The Lancashire Thunder {{took on the}} Loughborough Lightning in {{the fourth}} match of the tournament, and the two teams {{combined}} to score over 300 runs. Amy Satterthwaite scored a rapid 52 runs from 32 balls for the Thunder to help them reach 164 for eight. A combination of good bowling from the Thunder bowlers, and some poor run outs hindered the Lightning's batting. Sophie Ecclestone took three wickets with her spin bowling as the Lightning collapsed to 77 for eight. A partnership of 69 runs between Thea Brookes and Paige Scholfield gave Loughborough a chance at chasing down the total, but late wickets for Hayley Matthews saw Lancashire win by six runs. The next day, Yorkshire batted first against Surrey and scored 134 for five, largely due to runs from Hollie Armitage (43) and Lauren Winfield (29). Surrey's Alex Hartley was the pick of the bowlers, taking two wickets and restricting the Diamonds to 18 runs from her four overs. In their reply, Tammy Beaumont, <b>Bryony</b> Smith and Nat Sciver all made good starts to help their side chase down the total and give the Stars a six wicket victory with 11 balls remaining. Lancashire Thunder hosted the Southern Vipers in their third match of the tournament. The Vipers batted first and scored 132 for 4, helped by a score of 54 not out from Sara McGlashan. The Thunder lost Matthews from the fourth ball of their batting innings, but then recovered with a 57-run second wicket partnership between Satterthwaite and Emma Lamb. The pair were dismissed two overs apart, and Lancashire failed to score the runs they needed, falling 11 runs short of the Vipers' total.|$|E

500|$|Call the Midwife is a British period drama {{television}} series {{based on the}} best-selling memoirs of former nurse Jennifer Worth, who died shortly before the first episode was broadcast. It {{is set in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s and for the first three series centred primarily on Jenny Lee (Jessica Raine), who, in the first episode, begins a new job as a midwife at a nursing convent in the deprived Poplar district of London. The programme's ensemble cast has also included Jenny Agutter, Pam Ferris, Judy Parfitt and Laura Main as nuns living at the convent, and Miranda Hart, Helen George, <b>Bryony</b> Hannah, Charlotte Ritchie and Emerald Fennell as other midwives. Vanessa Redgrave delivers framing voiceovers in the role of [...] "mature Jenny", and continues to do so even after the younger version of the character was written out of the series.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, UK Sport, which {{distributes}} National Lottery {{funding to}} elite sport, published its {{expectations for the}} Games. It identified 41 potential medals to target and expected to win 35 of them, including 10 to 12 gold medals and to finish 8th in the overall medal table. Team GB exceeded the gold medal expectations on 19 August when Paul Goodison earned Britain's 13th {{gold medal in the}} men's Laser class. [...] The minimum medal target, of 35 medals, was passed on 20 August when they claimed their 36th medal– a bronze in the , won by <b>Bryony</b> Shaw.

500|$|Chartjackers was devised in 2009 by Jonathan Davenport and Andy Mettam of the British {{production}} company Hat Trick Productions.

The show was billed as a [...] "YouTube X Factor", with its main focus being its direct link to the 2009 annual appeal for the British charity Children in Need – profits from sales of the completed single were donated to the charity. Chartjackers was executively produced by Davenport, Hat Trick's digital department head, who had previously worked on similar cross-platform projects that incorporated both television and online media, such as the video podcast of Have I Got News For You and the YouTube-based series <b>Bryony</b> Makes a Zombie Movie. Digital agency Fish in a bottle were commissioned to provide creative content for the online platforms, such as the YouTube channel and Twitter account.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Rowling {{finished}} her manuscript for Harry Potter and the [...] Philosopher's Stone {{on an old}} manual typewriter. Upon the enthusiastic response of <b>Bryony</b> Evens, a reader who {{had been asked to}} review the book's first three chapters, the Fulham-based Christopher Little Literary Agents agreed to represent Rowling in her quest for a publisher. The book was submitted to twelve publishing houses, all of which rejected the manuscript. A year later she was finally given the green light (and a £1,500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury, a publishing house in London. The decision to publish Rowling's book owes much to Alice Newton, the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chairman, who was given the first chapter to review by her father and immediately demanded the next. Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children's books. Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an £8,000 grant from the Scottish Arts Council to enable her to continue writing.|$|E
500|$|While Thomas Pownall is {{well known}} as an American colonial Governor and English politician, {{he was also an}} {{important}} figure in [...] later 18th century antiquarian and archaeological studies.

He inherited these interests from his father Captain William Pownall, who lived at No. 5 Pottergate in the Minster Yard, which surrounds Lincoln Cathedral. His father had corresponded with William Stukeley about ancient finds in and around Lincoln, [...] and Thomas Pownall’s brother John was also a writer on archaeological subjects. Pownall was already demonstrating his interest in archaeology before he left for America, when, in 1752, [...] he recorded evidence for a Roman villa at Glentworth in Lincolnshire After [...] his return from America he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1770 and he contributed extensively to early issues of the journal Archaeologia. Some of his writings describe discoveries around Lincoln, but more importantly he wrote more widely [...] on New Grange in Ireland in 1773 and Cairn Brach y Dinas at Penmaenmawr, on the north Welsh coast. He was to follow this with descriptions of Roman remains in France when he was living there, and, on moving to Bath he again provided descriptions of [...] Roman discoveries.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout 1200 - 1500 A.D. in England, a potion called dwale {{was used}} as an anesthetic. This mixture {{contained}} bile, opium, lettuce, <b>bryony,</b> and hemlock.

60|$|A {{far more}} {{important}} service rendered by the spiral contraction of the tendrils {{is that they are}} thus made highly elastic. As before remarked under Ampelopsis, the strain is thus distributed equally between the several attached branches; and this renders the whole far stronger than it otherwise would be, as the branches cannot break separately. It is this elasticity which protects both branched and simple tendrils from being torn away from their supports during stormy weather. I have more than once gone on purpose during a gale to watch a <b>Bryony</b> growing in an exposed hedge, with its tendrils attached to the surrounding bushes; and as the thick and thin branches were tossed to and fro by the wind, the tendrils, had they not been excessively elastic, would instantly have been torn off and the plant thrown prostrate. But as it was, the <b>Bryony</b> safely rode out the gale, like a ship with two anchors down, and with a long range of cable ahead to serve as a spring as she surges to the storm.|$|E
