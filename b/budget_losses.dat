In 2003, George Gilder, who had lost most of his fortune with the bursting of the Internet stock bubble, sold the magazine for $1 back to Tyrrell and the American Alternative Foundation, the magazine's original owner (the name was later changed to the American Spectator Foundation). The magazine then moved operations back to the Washington, D.C. area. Later that year, former book publisher Alfred S. Regnery became the magazine's publisher.

Secondary goals of the project to find out the challenges of fighting labor informality and implications that arise from undeclared labor. Losses from the government budget were calculated by using three different approaches. First approach takes into consideration the total number of workers that is generated by the Labor Force Survey and the total number of declared workers at the Kosovo Saving Pensions Fund. It was found that Kosovo budget loses between 2 and 4. 6 million euros annually, while pension contributions forgone as a result of labor informality are between 11 and 18. 3 million euros annually. The second approach also refers to the total number of active workers that was found by the Labor Force Survey. The total number of undeclared workers is found based on the labor informality percentage that was found by the Riinvest report “To Pay or Not To Pay”. Calculations from this approach yielded that Kosovo government <b>budget</b> <b>losses</b> between 4. 2 and 9. 4 million euros in unpaid taxes. While the pension contributions forgone as a result of labor informality are between 22. 5 million euros and 37. 5 million euros annually. Lastly, the third approach uses information on inspections from the Executive Agency of Labor Inspectorate. This approach compares the total number of inspected workers with the number of workers who were legalized. It was found that, using this approach, the Kosovo government budget loses between 1 and 2. 3 million euros annually in unpaid taxes. While pension contributions forgone as a result of labor informality are between 5. 4 and 9. 1 million euros annually.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{structuring}} categorical-conceptual apparatus of the of the tax losses phenomenon in the state budgetary resources, namely clarification of the concepts of “tax gap”, “tax expenditures”, “tax losses”, {{as well as the}} quantification of tax losses of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine. Methodology. Most modern scholars interpret the tax gaps as the amount of taxes that were not received with the budget as a result of shadow economy, tax evasion and the existence of tax debt. However, considerable asymmetry of the tax component of the state budgetary resources also arises due to <b>budget</b> <b>losses</b> of all levels as a result of providing tax exemptions. In modern economic literature such losses are considered as tax expenditures. We consider tax losses a generalizing concept including potential amounts of tax revenues that the state and local budgets have not received {{as a result of the}} existence of the phenomenon of “tax gaps” and “tax expenditures”, and the amount of losses of the state budgetary resources in terms of their tax component is equal to the sum total of tax exemptions provided, unsettled tax debt of economic agents and the loss of tax revenue due to the operation of shadow economy. The study is based on the analysis of tax losses of budgetary resources of Ukraine during the period of time from 2004 to 2014. The results of the study showed enormous losses of budgetary resources in Ukraine due to the imperfection of the tax system, spread of undisclosed operations, tax evasion, and inefficient fiscal policy implementation. The Consolidated budget loses the amounts of monetary funds, equal to an average of 53. 30 % of actual revenue over the period studied. Total tax losses of the state budgetary resources in 2014 are equivalent to the total actual expenditures of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine on social protection and social security, defense, public order, security and judicial authorities. Even taking into account the point of view of foreign economists that only 1 / 3 of the tax gap can be converted into actual tax revenues in case of implementing measures of legalization of the economy, additional budgetary resources of the Consolidated budget of Ukraine obtained due to the elimination of tax gaps would be significant. It was determined that the effective management of tax gaps and tax expenditures and, consequently, a decrease in tax losses of budgetary resources will ensure the correction of fiscal asymmetries and imbalances, will contribute to achieving fiscal equilibrium, will cause a synchronization of fiscal and monetary policy, and as a result, will reduce the need of Ukraine in loan financing and its debt bondage. Practical implications. Justification of the conclusion that the major reserves to increase the tax component of budgetary resources of the state with preventing tax losses lie exactly in the plane of fiscal policy optimization and legalization of assets of business entities, allows to develop areas of improvement tax forms of financing public spending.

40|$|Abstract—A truly passive long-reach, {{symmetric}} 40 -Gb/s {{time and}} wavelength division multiplexed {{passive optical network}} (TWDM-PON) with a high <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> is demonstrated, using direct modulation and direct detection in both upstream and downstream directions. Thermally tuned directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are employed to serve as both upstream and downstream transmitters, not only owing to their low cost, but also, as a carrier-less modulation method, where the signal generated by direct mod-ulation is demonstrated to be more robust to high launch power induced fiber nonlinearities compared with external intensity mod-ulation formats with strong carrier power. Therefore, DML is suitable for applying in TWDM-PON to achieve a high loss bud-get. Moreover, the frequency chirp induced dispersion of directly-modulated signal is managed thanks to the combination of optical spectral reshaping and dispersion supported transmission effects, which {{makes it possible for}} the directly-modulated signal to reach a distance of 100 km and still with a good quality. As a result, a system <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> of 53 dB is achieved, supporting more than 1000 users with 100 -km purely passive reach, which is the first demon-stration of high <b>loss</b> <b>budget,</b> long reach TWDM-PONs to our best knowledge.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the study of characteristics of commercial Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers-SOAs and their employment in GPONs for the purpose of packet equalization of upstream bursts in order to provide additional <b>loss</b> <b>budget.</b> Additional <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> is aimed at facilitating the extension of GPONs to provide not only longer distance between central office and end user, but is also expected {{to increase the number of}} maximum users that can be connected to a single central office. The problem and the requirements of optical networks are described. After careful investigation into legal and technical dimensions of the situation such as use of certain wavelengths and EDFA’s inabilities, it is concluded that instead of EDFA or an Opto-electronic amplifier, an SOA should be considered for the purpose of employing as an optical amplifier installed in front of burst mode receiver at the central office. Commercial SOAs are used in order to investigate the limitations of SOA so that a suitable solution can be looked for within the functional constraints of the amplifier. The results of parametric measurements including input/output signal power, Gain and saturation are discussed; four different commercial SOAs are assessed with special emphasis on input power dynamics and gain response. The bit error rate -BER analysis is performed on SOAs in the context of the findings of parametric analysis of the SOAs. The effect of varying the input signal power on BER was observed. The receiver sensitivity for BER of 10 - 9 was measured for various SOA input power values. Power penalty imposed on receiver’s sensitivity, by saturation effects and noise is analysed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{probe the}} limits, both {{experimentally}} and analyt-ically, of {{passive optical network}} (PON) monitoring using peri-odic coding technology. The experimental demonstration focuses on a 16 customer PON with a 20 km feeder fiber followed by ei-ther a single cluster or a tiered hierarchy. A directly modulated laser modulated at 1 GHz was used to generate the monitoring probe signals. The measured data from the experimental setup was fed to a reduced complexity maximum likelihood sequence estima-tion (RC-MLSE) algorithm to detect and localize the customers. Three different PON deployments were tested. We demonstrate improved monitoring robustness when using a variable threshold for networks with a tiered geographic distribution. While only a 16 customer PON was tested, our experimental setup had 18 dB margin in the total <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> corresponding to splitting losses for 64 customers. We investigate analytically the total permissible <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> of the monitoring system operating in the 1650 nm wave-band {{as a function of}} receiver specifications. We examine the effect of resolution in the analog-to-digital conversion on the correlation peaks that form sufficient statistics for the RC-MLSE algorithm. Resolution affects both the RC-MLSE algorithm and the use of signal averaging to improve signal-to-noise ratio. We find that the monitoring system is able to monitor current PON standards with inexpensive, commercially available electronics.
