40|$|The {{anisotropy}} of elastoplastic {{and breaking}} reactions in the gallium arsenide plates with different <b>breakdown</b> <b>removal</b> after cutting has been investigated. The application of Timoshenko's algorithm {{for evaluation of}} the elastoplastic and breaking reactions at forming the corresponding components of the abrasive-broken layers has been substantiated; this algorithm has permitted to discover mathematically the connection of the deflection macrodeformation with distribution density of the near-surface microdeformation. The methods of quantitative evaluating the elastic sequence measure of the plastic contact the value of which 0. 47 - 0. 78 more than criterium value and characterizes the gallium arsenide as a sufficiently plastic bow with high anisotropy degree have been developed.

40|$|A rapid {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the preparation of}} up to 500 milligrams of pure ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBP carboxylase) from 250 grams of field-grown soybean leaves. Leaves were extracted in 20 millimolar phosphate (pH 6. 9) at 4 °C, containing 4 % (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 10 micromolar leupeptin, 1 millimolar phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride, 1 millimolar diethyldithiocarbamate, 5 millimolar MgCl 2, 1 millimolar dithiothreitol, 0. 2 millimolar ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid, 50 millimolar 2 -mercaptoethanol. The extract was incubated {{in the presence of}} 5 millimolar ATP at 58 °C for 9 minutes, then centrifuged and concentrated. Sucrose gradient centrifugation into 8 to 28 % (w/v) sucrose on a vertical rotor for 2. 5 hours yielded pure enzyme with a specific activity of 1. 1 to 1. 3 micromoles per minute per milligram protein at pH 8. 0, 25 °C. Soybean plants of the same line grown (at 400 microeinsteins per square meter per second) in growth chambers yielded enzyme with a specific activity of 0. 6 to 0. 7 micromoles per minute per milligram protein.

The extent and degree of this pathological change correlates with the severity and duration of hyperglycemia (1).

Both the transpeptidases and the β-lactamases are acylated by β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, which mimic the peptide, but <b>breakdown</b> and <b>removal</b> of the antibiotic is much faster in the β-lactamases, which lack the ability to process d-Ala-d-Ala peptides. Stereochemical factors driving this evolution in specificity are examined. Results: We have compared the crystal structures of two classes of β-lactamases and a β-lactam-sensitive d-alanyl-d-alanine-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase (DD-peptidase). The class C β-lactamase is more similar to the DD-peptidase than to another β-lactamase of class A. Conclusions: The two classes of β-lactamases appear to have developed from an ancestral protein along separate evolutionary paths. Structural differentiation of the β-lactamases from the DD-peptidases appears to follow differences in substrate shapes. The structure of the class A β-lactamase has been further optimized to exclude d-alanyl peptides and process penicillin substrates with near catalytic perfection.

40|$|Critical to {{spectral}} {{interpretations of}} geologic surfaces on the Earth and Mars is {{an understanding of}} the relationship between the composition of weathered rock surfaces and whole-rock mineralogy. In this study, thermal infrared spectroscopic and remote-sensing analyses were used to determine the composition of weathered granitoid rock surfaces in the Sacaton Mountains, Arizona. A linear spectral deconvolution approach was employed to determine the mineralogies of naturally exposed, weathered surfaces and artificially exposed, fresh rock surfaces. Deconvolution results from fresh rock surfaces yield similar bulk mineralogy to results from point counting of rock slabs and thin sections. Deconvolution of weathered rock spectra indicate that compared to fresh samples, weathered surfaces are deficient in plagioclase feldspar and are enriched in clay minerals. The differential weathering of feldspar minerals impacts the interpretation of whole-rock mineralogy and the spectral classification of bedrock geology, which, for plutonic rocks, is dependent on the relative proportions of different feldspars. Deconvolutions of multispectral remote-sensing or laboratory data show a deficiency of total feldspar in the weathered rock units but lack sufficient spectral resolution for the discrimination between different feldspars. These results demonstrate that the differential <b>breakdown</b> and <b>removal</b> of primary minerals in rock surfaces due to weathering can affect the interpreted rock petrology from remote-sensing studies.

40|$|Background. Phytoremediation is a {{promising}} {{technology for the}} cleanup of polluted environments. The technology {{has so far been}} used mainly to remove toxic heavy metals from contaminated soil, but there is a growing interest in broadening its applications to remove/degrade organic pollutants in the environment. Both plants and soil microorganisms have certain limitations with respect to their individual abilities to remove/breakdown organic compounds. A synergistic action by both rhizosphere microorganisms that leads to increased availability of hydrophobic compounds, and plants that leads to their removal and/or degradation, may overcome many of the limitations, and thus provide a useful basis for enhancing remediation of contaminated environments. Main Features. The review of literature presented in this article provides an insight to the nature of plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere, with a focus on those processes that are relevant to the <b>breakdown</b> and/or <b>removal</b> of organic pollutants. Due consideration has been given to identify opportunities for utilising the plant-microbial synergy in the rhizosphere to enhance remediation of contaminated environments. Results and Discussion. The literature review has highlighted the existence of a synergistic interaction between plants and microbial communities in the rhizosphere. This interaction benefits both microorganisms through provision of nutrients by root exudates, and plants through enhanced nutrient uptake and reduced toxicity of soil contaminants. The ability of the plant-microbial interaction to tackle some of the most recalcitrant organic chemicals is of particular interest with regard to enhancing and extending the scope of remediation technologies. Conclusions. Plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere offer very useful means for remediating environments contaminated with recalcitrant organic compounds. Outlook. A better knowledge of plant-microbial interactions will provide a basis for improving the efficacy of biological remediations. Further research is, however, needed to investigate different feedback mechanisms that select and regulate microbial activity in the rhizosphere...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{organization}} of filamentous actin (F-actin) in the synaptic pedicle of depolarizing bipolar {{cells from the}} goldfish retina was studied using fluorescently labeled phalloidin. The amount of F-actin in the synaptic pedicle relative to the cell body increased from a ratio of 1. 6 � 0. 1 in the dark to 2. 1 � 0. 1 after exposure to light. Light also caused the retraction of spinules and processes elaborated by the synaptic pedicle in the dark. Isolated bipolar cells were used to characterize the factors affecting the actin cytoskeleton. When the electrical effect of light was mimicked by depolarization in 50 mM K �, the actin network in the synaptic pedicle extended up to 2. 5 �m from the plasma membrane. Formation of F-actin occurred on the time scale of minutes and required Ca 2 � influx through L-type Ca 2 � channels. Phorbol esters that activate protein kinase C (PKC) accelerated growth of F-actin. Agents that inhibit PKC hindered F-actin growth in response to Ca 2 � influx and accelerated F-actin <b>breakdown</b> on <b>removal</b> of Ca 2 �. To test whether activity-dependent changes in the {{organization of}} F-actin might regulate exocytosis or endocytosis, vesicles were labeled with the fluorescent membrane marker FM 1 - 43. Disruption of F-actin with cytochalasin D did not affect the continuous cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis that was stimulated by maintained depolarization, nor the spatial distribution of recycled vesicles within the synaptic terminal. We suggest that the actions of Ca 2 � and PKC on the organization of F-actin regulate the morphology of the synaptic pedicle under varying light conditions.

Of the various contaminants present at these sites, dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) are particularly hard {{to locate and}} remove. There is an increasing need for external or non-invasive sensing techniques to locate DNAPLs in the subsurface and to track their spread and monitor their <b>breakdown</b> or <b>removal</b> by natural or engineered means. G. Olhoeft and colleagues have published several reports based on laboratory studies indicating that strong electrical signatures are produced when organic solvents, notably toluene, PCE, and TCE, reside in clay-bearing soils. According to Olhoeft, these electrical signatures are apparently characteristic of and unique to the particular organic solvent involved. The experiments are performed by packing the contaminated soil in a sample holder and a 4 -electrode complex electrical resistivity measurement is made, where two of the electrodes are used to impose a sinusoidal electric current and the remaining two electrodes are used to sense the response voltage of the specimen. The relative phase (or time delay) between the source and the response signals at low excitation frequencies is a particularly sensitive measure of electrochemical processes occurring within the specimen. This suggests {{the basis of an}} ideal new measurement technique for geophysical characterization of NAPL pollution. Despite the promising laboratory results, attempts to measure these effects in the field for characterizing polluted sites, including studies supported by DOE funding, seldom have been successful.

For this purpose we intend to document the detectability of clay-organic interactions with geophysical measurements in the laboratory, develop further understanding of the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms, and then apply these observations to develop field techniques to monitor the remediation of organic pollutants.

40|$|Background: The {{first step}} in glucose {{metabolism}} is conversion of glucose to glucose 6 -phosphate (G- 6 -P) by hexokinases (HKs), a family with 4 isoforms. The two most common isoforms, HKI and HKII, have overlapping tissue expression, but different subcellular distributions, with HKI associated mainly with mitochondria and HKII associated with both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic compartments. Here we tested the hypothesis that these different subcellular distributions are associated with different metabolic roles, with mitochondrially-bound HK’s channeling G- 6 -P towards glycolysis (catabolic use), and cytoplasmic HKII regulating glycogen formation (anabolic use). Methodology/Principal Findings: To study subcellular translocation of HKs in living cells, we expressed HKI and HKII linked to YFP in CHO cells. We concomitantly recorded the effects on glucose handling using the FRET based intracellular glucose biosensor, FLIPglu- 600 mM, and glycogen formation using a glycogen-associated protein, PTG, tagged with GFP. Our results demonstrate that HKI remains strongly bound to mitochondria, whereas HKII translocates between mitochondria and the cytosol in response to glucose, G- 6 -P and Akt, but not ATP. Metabolic measurements suggest that HKI exclusively promotes glycolysis, whereas HKII has a more complex role, promoting glycolysis when bound to mitochondria and glycogen synthesis when located in the cytosol.

Influent perchlorate concentrations were 50 μg/L and acetate was added as the electron donor at {{a concentration of}} 2 mg C/L. Perchlorate removal was evaluated at various influent dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Complete perchlorate removal was achieved with an influent DO concentration of 1 mg/L resulting in bulk phase DO concentrations below the detection limit of 0. 01 mg/L. The {{influence of}} increasing influent DO concentrations for 12 h periods was evaluated before and after individual backwash events. Partial perchlorate removal was achieved with an influent DO concentration of 3. 5 mg/L before a strong backwash (bulk phase DO concentrations of approximately 0. 2 mg/L), while no perchlorate removal was observed after the strong backwash at the same influent DO level (bulk phase DO concentrations of approximately 0. 8 mg/L). The immediate effect of backwashing depended on influent DO concentrations. With influent DO concentrations of 1 mg/L, strong backwashing resulted in a brief (3 ̆c 12 h) increase of effluent perchlorate concentrations up to 20 μg/L; more pronounced effects were observed with influent DO concentrations of 3 mg/L.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that increased nonenzymatic glycosylation occurs in peripheral nervous tissue of diabetic humans and animals, {{primarily on the}} PO-protein of peripheral nerve myelin. The pathophysiologic mechanism by which this biochemical alteration leads to myelin <b>breakdown</b> and <b>removal</b> is not as yet understood. In the present study we show that advanced glycosylation end-product (AGE) adducts that form during long-term exposure of peripheral nerve myelin proteins to glucose in vitro and in vivo markedly alter {{the way in which}} myelin interacts with elicited macrophages. In this interaction, macrophages appear to specifically recognize AGEs on myelin, since AGE- BSA competes nearly as effectively as AGE-myelin, while neither unmodified BSA nor unmodified myelin compete. The failure of yeast mannan to interfere with macrophage recognition of AGE-myelin suggests that the mannose/fucose receptor does not mediate this process. Recognition of AGE-protein by macrophages is associated with endocytosis, as demonstrated by resistance of cell-associated radioactivity to removal by trypsin action, and by low temperature inhibition of ligand accumulation in the cellular fraction. 125 I- labeled myelin that had been incubated in vitro with 50 mM glucose for 8 wk reached a steady state accumulation within thioglycolate-elicited macrophages that was five times greater than that of myelin incubated without glucose. Similarly, myelin isolated from rats having diabetes for 1. 5 - 2. 0 years duration had a steady state level that was 9 times greater than that of myelin from young rats, and 3. 5 times greater than that of myelin from age-matched controls. In contrast, myelin isolated from rats having diabetes for 4 - 5 wk had the same degree of accumulation observed with myelin of age-matched normal rats. These data suggest that the amount of increased nonenzymatic glycosylation observed in the myelin of short-term diabetic rats had not yet resulted in the significant accumulation of AGE-myelin present both in vitro and in the long-term diabetic rats. The disappearance of acid-insoluble radioactivity from within the cells and the appearance of acid-soluble radioactivity released into the medium were very similar for the two groups, suggesting that the striking difference in accumulation seen between normal myelin and AGE-myelin is due primarily to increased uptake. Formation of irreversible AGE-adducts on myelin appears to promote the recognition and uptake of the modified myelin by macrophages. This interaction between AGE-myelin and macrophages may initiate or contribute to the segmental demyelination associated with diabetes and the normal aging of peripheral nerve...|$|R
40|$|At 7 {{days after}} cutting the sciatic nerve, the {{extensor}} digitorum longus muscle was smaller and contained less protein than its innervated control. Correlating with these changes was {{the finding of}} elevated rates of protein degradation (measured in vitro) in the denervated tissue. However, at this time, rates of protein synthesis (measured in vitro) and nucleic acid concentrations were also higher in the denervated tissue, changes more usually associated with an active muscle rather than a disused one. These anabolic trends have, at least in part, been explained by the possible greater exposure of the denervated extensor digitorum longus to passive stretch. When immobilized under a maintained influence of stretch the denervated muscle grew to a greater extent. Although this stretch-induced growth appeared to occur predominantly through a stimulation of protein synthesis, it was opposed by smaller increases in degradative rates.

However, {{it can not be}} used to kill broadleaf weeds in broadleaf crops, such as soybeans. We are exploring the potential of developing broadleaf crops tolerant to treatment with dicamba by inserting a gene from a microbial system which encodes an enzyme capable of metabolizing dicamba. ^ A soil bacteria, Pseudomonas maltophilia, strain DI- 6, has shown the capability of degrading dicamba to CO 2, Cl- and water. The first step in dicamba <b>breakdown</b> is the <b>removal</b> of an O-methyl group to produce 3, 6 -dichlorosalicylic acid, a compound with no herbicidal activity. Therefore, this demethylase gene is a potential resource for producing an enzyme capable of inactivating dicamba in transgenic plants. ^ Attempts to clone the dicamba demethylase gene from strain DI- 6 using standard molecular/genetic approaches were not successful. Therefore, an alternative approach was to purify the demethylase enzyme to homogeneity and use N-terminal amino acid sequence information to produce an oligonucleotide for use as a probe in cloning the demethylase gene. In this thesis work, I report that the dicamba demethylase is a three-component enzyme system which contains an oxygenase component, a ferredoxin component and a reductase component. All three components have been purified to homogeneity and N-terminal sequences were obtained. Initial physical and chemical characterization of all three components also have been performed. Cloning of the genes using oligonucleotide probes based upon N-terminal amino acid sequences is presently underway. ^ The metabolic pathways for dicamba degradation by strain DI- 6 were also studied in detail using a variety of analytical methods. From this work, it has been discovered that there is more than one pathway involved in dicamba degradation in strain DI- 6. Besides O-demethylation, there also appears to be a direct dehalogenation reaction in the dicamba degradation pathway. Discovery of the dehalogenase activity in strain DI- 6 provides a potential additional enzyme source for the inactivation of dicamba in transgenic plants. ...|$|R

As with any new research endeavor we note the extreme importance of trying to reproduce the work of previous researchers to ensure that any effects observed are due to the physical phenomena occurring in the specimen and not due to the particular experimental apparatus or method used. To this end, we independently designed and built a laboratory system, including a sample holder, electrodes, electronics, and data analysis software, for the measurement of the complex electrical resistivity properties of soil contaminated with organic solvents. The capabilities and reliability of this technique were documented. Using various standards we performed measurement accuracy, repeatability, and noise immunity tests of this system {{and we were able to}} reproduce some key complex resistivity effects quoted in the literature. We attempted numerous times to reproduce the seminal results of Olhoeft and Sadowski on the complex resistivity response of toluene-contaminated clay-rich samples. While we observe similar responses to theirs for plain clays with brine, the addition of toluene does not produce the effects they claimed. We can only produce effects of similar magnitude if we intentionally introduce a large artificial dielectric heterogeneity in the specimen. We have also performed laboratory studies to test the sensitivity of the complex resistivity method to toluene and methanol contamination in sands, clays, and rocks. Additionally, we performed 4 -wire IP inversion measurements in a two-dimensional laboratory 'ant farm' to test the ability of this technique to image materials with both conductivity and dielectric heterogeneities. This work indicates, at best, a low sensitivity of the complex electrical resistivity method to organic contamination in rocks and soils. This reduces the short-term prospects of using complex resistivity as an effective technique to directly detect organic contamination. However, as noise suppression techniques improve and further understanding of electrical responses in Earth materials is achieved, the potential of the complex resistivity technique should improve. In contrast, we find that certain electrically polarizing materials, some clays for example, have responses large enough compared to sandy and silty soils to be reliably imaged through a detailed field IP survey. Thus, quantifying soil heterogeneity (which may relate to DNAPL distribution and transport) is an immediate potential application of this technique...|$|R

The victims were divided into 4 groups according to BLV: 1) 26 victims whose BLV was less than 750 ml (5. 93 ± 2. 41 ml/kg) (grade I BL); 2) 23 victims whose BLV was 750 — 1500 ml (11. 5 ± 1. 5 ml/kg) (grade 2 BL); 3) 23 victims whose BLV was 1500 — 2000  ml (23. 8 ± 4. 0 ml/kg) (grade 3 BL); 4) 23 victims whose BLV was over 2000 ml (45. 6 ± 10. 1 ml/kg) (grade 4 BL), according to the type of injury: 1) severe skeletal injury (SSI) (n= 17); 2) brain injury (BI) (n= 43); 3) a concurrence of SSI and BI (SSI+BI) (n= 35); according {{to the development of}} infectious complications: 1) 69 victims who developed infectious com plications on days 5 — 7 postinjury; 2) 26 victims who did not. To evaluate the impact of hypoxia on DNA damages, white blood cell apoptotic and necrotic processes, the victims were divided into 2 groups: 1) hypoxia (18 of the 95 victims who had 4 altered indicators, such as capillary blood pO 2, plasma lactate levels, pH, and BE); 2) no hypoxia (10 of the 95 victims whose indicators were within the normal range). DNA damages and necrotic and apoptotic changes in the white blood cells were assessed by the DNA comet assay. The plasma concentration of extracellular DNA was fluorometrically deter mined using a QuantiTTM HS DNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA). That of 8 hydroxy 2 deoxyguanosine was estimated by enzyme immunoassay employing an 8 hydroxy 2 deoxyGuanosine EIA Kit (Cayman Chemical, USA). The levels of cas pase 3, caspase 9, superoxide dismutase, and sAPO 1 /FAS were measured by enzyme immunoassay using test systems (Bender MedSystems, Austria). Results. There were significantly higher plasma levels of free DNA in the victims than in the controls throughout the followup, which is due to its exit from the cells damaged from tissue injury. In the first two weeks after injury, there were increases in DNA damages and white blood cell alteration processes by a necrotic and apoptotic mechanism in the victims with different types of injury, which may be associated with the active participation of leuko cytes in the processes of cellular <b>breakdown</b> product <b>removal</b> in the tissues damaged during injury and the in those of prevention of infectious complications. In the victims, white blood cell alteration in the necrotic pathway does not depend on BLV and hypoxia degree while that in the apoptotic pathway showed a relationship of leukocyte alteration to hypoxia in these patients. The sum of the values of necrotic DNA comets, apoptotic DNA comets, and single and doublestrand breaks on day 3 postinjury may serve as a predictor of the likely development of infectious complications in victims with injury, blood loss, and marked hypoxia. There were differences in the levels of DNA damages and white blood cell apoptosis and necrosis in the victims with BI and SSI. The injury victims showed a threefold decrease in plasma 8 hydroxy 2  deoxyguanosine concentrations, which was accompanied and, possibly, caused by an increase in the amount of superoxide dismutase. Conclusion. There was a relationship between the degree of DNA damages, apoptosis, and necrosis in the white blood cells of victims with injury and hypoxiainduced blood loss. </p...|$|R
