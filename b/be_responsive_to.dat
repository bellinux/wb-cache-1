5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> their needs and communications.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the AMPK activator AICAR as compared to somatostatin- 14 on cell viability and GH secretion in human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas in vitro and in rat GH 3 cells. Overnight treatment with AICAR increased phospho-(threonine- 172) AMPK levels (activated AMPK) in cultured human adenomas. As to the effects on cell viability, four adenomas out of 15 <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> AICAR (0. 4 mM) and five adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SS- 14 (100 nM). One adenoma <b>was</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> both somatostatin and AICAR. The effects of cotreatment with SS- 14 and AICAR were investigated in eight adenomas. In two adenomas, the effects of AICAR + SS- 14 did not exceed the effect of AICAR. In two adenomas which <b>were</b> not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> either AICAR or SS- 14, the cotreatment was able to reduce cell viability versus control. Two adenomas <b>were</b> not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> any treatment. As to the effects on GH secretion, nine adenomas out of 15 <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> AICAR. Twelve adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SS- 14. Eight adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> both AICAR and SS- 14. Cotreatment exceeded the effect of single treatments in 4 out of 10 adenomas. In GH 3 cells, AICAR reduced the activity of p 70 S 6 kinase, which {{plays an important role in}} cell growth. SS- 14 did not affect significantly AMPK phosphorylation and p 70 S 6 K activity but it was able to enhance the inhibitory effect of AICAR on phospho-S 6 levels. Moreover, AICAR and SS- 14 reduced ERK phosphorylation with a different time course. The combined treatment reduced phospho-ERK levels at any time point...|$|R

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, {{the ebb and flow of}} New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine local fiscal {{response}} to revenue sharing in Turkey under two main headings: revenue response and expenditure response. Whether local revenue <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> revenue sharing <b>is</b> examined by using cross-section and time-series analyses. The {{results of the}} cross-section analysis are inconclusive. However, evidence based on the time trend of the tax-effort ratio indicates that tax effort {{is influenced by the}} institutional framework of property taxation. This finding implies that local revenue <b>is</b> not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> revenue sharing. Whether local expenditure <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> revenue sharing <b>is</b> examined by using cross-section, time-series, and panel-data analyses. The results show that there is a strong positive relationship between the revenue sharing and expenditure trends. The Granger causality test indicates that revenue sharing drives expenditure, and this shows the existence of the circularity problem. These findings imply that local expenditure <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> revenue sharing. ...|$|R

[...] She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds.
