5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host <b>bee</b> species. When a male <b>bee</b> arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female <b>bee,</b> {{and from there to}} the <b>bee</b> nest to parasitize the <b>bee</b> larvae.|$|E
5|$|Studies in Europe and North America {{have shown}} {{dramatic}} declines in <b>bee</b> colonies. The U.S. has lost 59% of its <b>bee</b> colonies since 1947, and Europe has lost over 25% since 1985. Determining {{the causes of}} <b>bee</b> colony collapse {{is crucial to the}} global economy, as <b>bee</b> pollination assists with 9.5% of the global agricultural production worth billions of dollars.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} European honey <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera) {{has also}} been observed feeding on B.sessilis, as have seven species of native <b>bee,</b> comprising four species of Hylaeus (including the banksia <b>bee</b> H. alcyoneus), two of Leioproctus, and a Lasioglossum.|$|E

5|$|Solitary <b>bees</b> are {{important}} pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it {{is mixed with}} nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary <b>bees</b> have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary <b>bees</b> are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter <b>bees,</b> sweat <b>bees,</b> mason <b>bees,</b> polyester <b>bees,</b> squash <b>bees,</b> dwarf carpenter <b>bees,</b> leafcutter <b>bees,</b> alkali <b>bees</b> and digger <b>bees.</b>|$|R

5|$|Among insects, {{so-called}} killer bees were accidentally {{created during}} {{an attempt to}} breed a strain of bees that would both produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. It was done by crossing a European honey <b>bee</b> and an African <b>bee.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several <b>bee</b> {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host <b>bee.</b> When the cuckoo <b>bee</b> larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic <b>bee</b> species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other <b>bee</b> brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E
50|$|A set {{of honey}} <b>bees,</b> called swarm, can {{successfully}} accomplish tasks through social cooperation. In the ABC algorithm, there are three types of bees: employed <b>bees,</b> onlooker <b>bees,</b> and scout <b>bees.</b> The employed <b>bees</b> search food around the food source in their memory; meanwhile they share the information of these food sources to the onlooker <b>bees.</b> The onlooker <b>bees</b> tend to select good food sources from those found by the employed <b>bees.</b> The food source that has higher quality (fitness) will have a large chance to be selected by the onlooker <b>bees</b> than the one of lower quality. The scout <b>bees</b> are translated from a few employed <b>bees,</b> which abandon their food sources and search new ones.|$|R

50|$|Apidae is {{the largest}} family within the {{superfamily}} Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of <b>bees.</b> The family includes {{some of the most}} commonly seen <b>bees,</b> including bumblebees and honey <b>bees,</b> but also includes stingless <b>bees</b> (also used for honey production), carpenter <b>bees,</b> orchid <b>bees,</b> cuckoo <b>bees,</b> {{and a number of other}} less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops.|$|R
5|$|However {{farmers have}} focused on {{alternative}} solutions in order to mitigate these problems. By raising native plants, they provide food for native <b>bee</b> pollinators like L. vierecki and L. leucozonium, leading to less reliance on honey <b>bee</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>Bee</b> {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little <b>Bee</b> to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little <b>Bee</b> in to the police. When he informs Little <b>Bee</b> that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little <b>Bee</b> will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little <b>Bee</b> and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little <b>Bee</b> calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little <b>Bee,</b> and discover that she is in the country illegally.|$|E

5000|$|Stingless <b>bees,</b> {{sometimes}} called stingless honey <b>bees</b> or simply meliponines, {{are a large}} group of <b>bees</b> (about 500 species), comprising the tribe Meliponini (or subtribe Meliponina according to other authors). They belong in the family Apidae, and are closely related to common honey <b>bees,</b> carpenter <b>bees,</b> orchid <b>bees,</b> and bumblebees. Meliponines have stingers, but they are highly reduced and cannot be used for defense, though these <b>bees</b> exhibit other defensive behaviors and mechanisms. Meliponines are not the only type of [...] "stingless" [...] bee; all male <b>bees</b> and many female <b>bees</b> of several other families, such as Andrenidae, also cannot sting.|$|R
50|$|Danish {{zoologist}} Johan Christian Fabricius first identified Bombus fervidus, {{also known}} as the yellow bumblebee or golden northern bumblebee, in 1798. B. fervidus {{is a member of the}} order Hymenoptera, which comprises wasps, ants, <b>bees,</b> and sawflies. Bombus is the Latin word for “buzzing.” It is also in the Apidae, which is a diverse family of <b>bees</b> including honeybees, orchid <b>bees,</b> bumble <b>bees,</b> stingless <b>bees,</b> cuckoo <b>bees,</b> and carpenter <b>bees.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{informed}} and uninformed <b>bees</b> perform adaptation diffusion independently. The relation between both processes {{is that the}} observations of the uninformed <b>bees</b> arise from the informed <b>bees.</b> For the informed <b>bees,</b> they share information about the destination location to perform diffusion adaptation, and communicate with the surrounding informed <b>bees.</b> For the uninformed <b>bees,</b> they gather information from the informed <b>bees</b> in their neighborhood, and use these bees' estimation results as their own observation. Afterward, they communicate with all surrounding <b>bees.</b> By examining the information propagation mechanism among uninformed <b>bees,</b> {{it can be seen}} that after a few steps, an accurate estimate about the target position will be shared among the <b>bees</b> in the whole swarm.|$|R

5|$|Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old {{spelling}} enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, {{a predominantly}} black school in South Los Angeles. She {{lives with her}} widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she {{sign up for the}} Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling <b>Bee.</b> She follows his advice and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling <b>Bee.</b> Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling <b>bee.</b> Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the <b>bee,</b> she qualifies for the regional <b>bee</b> when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.|$|E
5|$|Most other <b>bees,</b> {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter <b>bees,</b> leafcutter <b>bees</b> and mason <b>bees</b> are solitary in {{the sense}} that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker <b>bees</b> for these species. Solitary <b>bees</b> typically produce neither honey nor beeswax.|$|R
50|$|Trigona fulviventris {{was first}} {{described}} by Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville in 1845. It {{is a member}} of the order Hymenoptera, which includes ants, <b>bees,</b> wasps, and sawflies and part of the family Apidae, which includes other <b>bees</b> such as bumble <b>bees,</b> honey <b>bees,</b> and orchid <b>bees.</b> It is further categorized in the genus Trigona, a genus of stingless <b>bees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pollinators include mason <b>bees,</b> small {{carpenter}} <b>bees,</b> cuckoo <b>bees,</b> halictid <b>bees,</b> syrphid flies, tachinid flies, blow flies, and others. Less common pollinators are wasps and butterflies. Rabbits and groundhogs eat the foliage.|$|R

40|$|Summary. In field experiments, we mapped {{the regular}} for-aging routes (traplines) of marked bumble <b>bees</b> visiting Ara-Iia hispida. When other <b>bees</b> were removed to create local-ized "competitive vacuums", the marked <b>bees</b> shifted their feeding {{activity}} toward the removal areas. <b>Bees</b> foraging in these competitive vacuums probed more flowers per in-florescence than control <b>bees.</b> One <b>bee's</b> foraging was stud-ied intensively {{before and after}} its local competitors were removed. Compared to four nestmates foraging elsewhere, the focal <b>bee's</b> trip times were shorter (p< 0. 005) and its food collection rate was marginally higher (P = 0. 064) dur-ing the removal, although all the <b>bees</b> foraged similarly before the removal. These observations indicate that trap-lining bumble <b>bees</b> opportunistically modify their use of space {{in response to the}} activities of other <b>bees</b> in a highly competitive environment...|$|R
