50|$|An {{internal}} glucose sensor, measuring at 38mm {{across and}} 16 mm thick. The implant {{consists of an}} integrated glucose sensor with signal conditioning circuits, a wireless communications circuit, and a 1-year lifetime battery, all housed in a hermetically sealed(airtight) titanium housing. The sensor is surgically implanted under the skin, at the waist or upper arm, and continuously monitors the glucose levels in the subcutaneous(under the skin) tissue. Data is then relayed to the receiver via wireless telemetry, the automatic measurement and transmission of data by wire, radio, or other means from remote sources. The ICGM system is as accurate as any other CGM device, however unlike similar products, the GlySens ICGM sensor works by detecting oxygen, allowing the system to be more stable in the interstitial fluid environment, the fluid surrounding tissue cells, than traditional CGMs. It has an outer membrane with electro-chemical detectors primed with enzymes {{to interact with the}} oxygen. The extent of the enzyme reaction and the concentration of glucose can be calculated by measuring the amount of remaining oxygen from the enzyme reaction. It is ensured the sensors are working properly through multiple <b>built-in</b> <b>checks.</b> The sensor may also have applications for glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetes including caloric and activity management, and prevention of type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals.|$|E

By relying on built-in correlations and default values, a basic simulation can be performed with limited knowledge on subsurface, surface plant, and financing conditions.

A user guide and example cases are available to help a new user get familiar with the tool. Examples of cases that can be simulated with GEOPHIRES v 2.0 are: investigating the payback period of a newly constructed geothermal power plant, sizing a geothermal district-heating system, assessing the impact of subsurface uncertainty (e.g., reservoir permeability, volume, and temperature) on overall geothermal plant performance, comparing different geothermal reservoir management strategies, estimating future electricity production using historical reservoir and plant operational data, and predicting the impact on future revenue of a system upgrade (e.g., drilling a new well or stimulating the reservoir).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of current sound-quality {{research}} has been to develop automated, objective metrics of perceptual attributes. These metrics have to be validated against subjective measures of the attributes which they claim to capture. To that end, typically, verbal reports are collected on complex psychophysical attributes from observers directly. That procedure, however, involves the risk of accumulating data of unknown validity, dimensionality, and unit. Rather than getting at the dimensions of interest directly, it is therefore advocated to ask but very simple judgments of preference from observers. Such data may then be used to model the listener’s decision strategies when comparing auditory events. Once a valid decision model has been established, psychophysical scale values may be derived. The focus of the presentation will be on two approaches, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, and the representation of paired comparisons by ’preference trees, ’ which will be illustrated with examples from sound-quality research. It is shown that these ’indirect’ approaches offer (a) the advantage of an explicitly stated theory about the observer’s decision strategy, with (b) <b>built-in</b> <b>checks</b> of the consistency of judgments, and (c) statistical tests to validate if the attempt at scale construction succeeded or failed.

40|$|For {{local people}} in sub-Saharan Africa, large land {{investment}} projects currently imply many risks and few benefits. Drawing on own ethical and economic research and using {{evidence from the}} authors' case studies in Kenya, Mali and Zambia and a new database of large-scale land acquisitions worldwide, this brief offers policy recommendations for host governments, investors {{and the international community}} so as to achieve a more favourable balance of risks and benefits in land investment projects. Our research suggests that the land governance systems of sub-Saharan African countries, comprising a multitude of sometimes contradictory laws derived from colonial and customary systems, privilege powerful actors and lead to violation of human rights. Legal uncertainty and an acquisition process that gives no voice to local land users can lead to displacements of farmers without compensation. Poorly enforced formal laws, neglect of <b>built-in</b> <b>checks</b> and balances, and power and information asymmetries between investors and local people can give rise to coalitions of investors and powerful rent-seekers. Displaced farmers and those unable to find jobs on the land investment projects migrate to other rural areas or the cities, and few and only low-skilled jobs are available to those who remain. We found limited evidence of positive spillovers from improved infrastructure and knowledge and technology transfer. Local food prices are likely to rise, as most of the production on investment farms is for export. Overall, when many farmers are displaced and investment projects are capital intensive the net welfare effect for the local population can be expected to be negative. Against this background, we propose a set of policy changes for promoting benefits for the local population and avoiding human rights violations. In contrast to proposals made by international guidelines and codes of conduct, we emphasize in particular the responsibilities of host country governments...|$|E
40|$|The Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) {{has been}} {{conducting}} research on gasification for six decades. One of the objectives of this gasification research has been to maximize carbon conversion and the water–gas shift process for optimal hydrogen production and syngas quality. This research focus and experience were a perfect fit for the National Center for Hydrogen Technology ® (NCHT®) Program at the EERC for improving all aspects of coal gasification, which ultimately aids in the production and purification of hydrogen. A consortia project was developed under the NCHT Program to develop an improved predictive model for ash formation and deposition under the project entitled “Coal Ash Behavior in Reducing Environments (CABRE) III: Development of the CABRE III Model. ” The computer-based program is now applicable to the modeling of coal and ash behavior in both entrained-flow and fluidized-bed gasification systems to aid in overall gasification efficiency. This model represents a significant improvement over the CABRE II model and runs on a Microsoft Windows PC platform. The major achievements of the CABRE III model are partitioning of inorganic transformations between various phases for specific gas cleanup equipment; slag property predictions, including standard temperature–viscosity curves and slag flow and thickness; deposition rates in gasification cleanup equipment; provision for composition analysis for all input and output streams across all process equipment, including major elements and trace elements of interest; composition analysis of deposit streams for various deposit zones, including direct condensation on equipment surfaces (Zone A), homogeneous particulate deposition (Zone B), and entrained fly ash deposition (Zone C); and physical removal of ash in cyclones based on D 50 cut points. Another new feature of the CABRE III model is a user-friendly interface and detailed reports that are easily exportable into Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or as pdf files. The user interface provides stepwise guides with <b>built-in</b> <b>checks</b> for efficient entry of required input data on fuels of interest to allow a successful execution of the model. The model was developed with data from several fuels selected by the sponsors, including bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite, and petroleum coke (petcoke). The data from these fuels were obtained using small pilot-scale entrained-flow and fluidized-bed gasifiers at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). The CABRE III model is expected to further advance the knowledge base for the NCHT® Program and, more importantly, allow for prediction of the slagging and fouling characteristics of fuels in reducing environments. The information obtained from this program will potentially also assist in maintaining prolonged gasifier operation free from failure or facilitate troubleshooting to minimize downtime {{in the event of}} a problem...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{being an}} upper-middle-income country, Namibia faces {{multiple}} challenges in its economic development. The legacies of apartheid policies have nurtured a highly skewed {{distribution of assets}} and opportunities, and this has to date not been overcome. The private sector remains divided into {{a small number of}} large, profitable and mainly white businesses, and a large number of very small, unproductive, low-skilled and mainly black businesses. The economic structure is geared mainly toward the extraction of resources with limited value-addition and limited linkages {{to the rest of the}} economy. Small businesses face barriers to growth due to the large size of the country, its low population density, and limited purchasing power of the large part of the population, leading to high transaction costs and preventing economies of scale, amongst others. Nonetheless, Namibia has seen productivity growth and diversification in a number of sectors which have a potential for contributing to more broad-based, inclusive and sustainable growth. The Namibian Government can pride itself on a stable political, legal and institutional environment and sound macroeconomic policies. To date, however, it has not played a proactive part in fostering new economic activities. The strategic goal of the Government is for Namibia to become a fully industrialized nation by the year 2030. This is to be achieved by processing Namibian raw materials and through import substitution of manufactured goods. This goal and the resultant strategies are, however, not based on rigorous economic analysis and disregard important constraints in the country’s business and investment climate. The Ministry of Trade and Industry sees itself narrowly as a promoter of the manufacturing sector, rather than as a coordinator of cross-sectoral search processes for promising new activities. For the past ten years the Ministry has been in a process of revising its 1992 White Paper on Industrial Development. Due to a lack of consensus on the general direction, Namibia is left without any applicable policy that delineates its strategy for private sector development and industrial transformation as well as the role of the Ministry in achieving this. Although social and equity concerns rank high in all policy papers, policies are not effectively targeted towards reducing spatial and social inequalities. The Ministry of Trade and Industry pursues stand-alone promotional activities rather than tackling full value chains in a comprehensive way. As the example of the Sites and Premises Programme shows, programs designed to support the development of Micro-, Small and Medium Enterprises are often top-down in structure and not targeted to businesses 2 ̆ 7 real needs; they are not integrated, they lack outreach and are not aimed at creating linkages with larger companies. Since dialogue with the private sector is informal and ad-hoc, the interests of small businesses are not effectively represented in policy-making. Furthermore, policy implementation is hampered by an inefficient public service, lack of performance monitoring and <b>built-in</b> <b>checks</b> and balances – as shown strikingly by the example of the Export Processing Zone regime - and by a generally low level of democratic pressure on the Government. An exception to this is the example of the Indigenous Plant Task Team (IPTT), which carries out a constant search process for market-oriented pro-poor activities and supporting instruments, but which is mainly driven by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and donors...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} {{of data from}} next-of-kin in studies of mortality among migrants. Int. J. Epid. 1975, 4 : 51 - 54.

40|$|We {{implement}} the {{effective field theory}} (EFT) approach to dark energy and modified gravity in the public Einstein-Boltzmann solver CAMB. The resulting code, which we dub EFTCAMB, is a powerful and versatile tool {{that can be used}} for several objectives. It can be employed to evolve the full dynamics of linear scalar perturbations in any given single field dark energy or modified gravity model, once the latter is mapped into the EFT formalism. It offers a numerical implementation of EFT as a model-independent framework to test gravity on cosmological scales. EFTCAMB has a <b>built-in</b> <b>check</b> for the fulfillment of general stability conditions such as the absence of ghost and superluminal propagation of perturbations. It handles phantom-divide crossing models and does not contain any quasi-static approximation, but rather evolves the full dynamics of perturbations on linear scales. As we will show, the latter is an important feature in view of the accuracy and scale range of upcoming surveys. We show the reliability and applicability of our code by evolving the dynamics of linear perturbations and extracting predictions for power spectra in several models. In particular we perform a thorough analysis of f(R) theories, comparing our outputs with those of an existing code for LCDM backgrounds, and finding an agreement that can reach 0. 1 % for models with a Compton wavelength consistent with current cosmological data. We then showcase the flexibility of our code studying two different scenarios. First we produce new results for designer f(R) models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state. Second, we extract predictions for linear observables in some parametrized EFT models with a phantom-divide crossing equation of state for dark energy. Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures.
