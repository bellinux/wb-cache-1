5|$|A {{laboratory}} test showed how males of P. fimbriata from Queensland minimise {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of <b>blotting</b> <b>paper,</b> some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old <b>blotting</b> <b>paper,</b> irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E

In November 2009, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum honored her as part of its annual American Music Masters Series; among the artifacts at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum exhibition are Joplin's scarf and necklaces, her 1965 Porsche 356 Cabriolet with psychedelically designed painting, and a sheet of LSD <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> designed by Robert Crumb, designer of the Cheap Thrills cover. Joplin's Porsche was recently auctioned off for $1.6 million, on an episode of Chasing Classic Cars. Also in 2009, Joplin was the honoree at the Rock Hall's American Music Master concert and lecture series.|$|E
25|$|Paxton {{was visiting}} London in his {{capacity}} as a director of the Midland Railway to meet the chairman John Ellis who was also a member of parliament. He happened to mention an idea he had for the hall, and Ellis promptly encouraged to produce some plans, provided they could be ready in nine days. Unfortunately he was committed for the next few days, but at a board meeting of the railway in Derby, it is said he appeared to be spending much of his time doodling on a sheet of <b>blotting</b> <b>paper.</b> At the end of the meeting he held up his first sketch of the Crystal Palace, inspired by the Victoria Regia House. The sketch is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
500|$|P. labiata {{females are}} {{extremely}} aggressive to other females, trying to invade {{and take over}} each other's webs, which often results in cannibalism. A laboratory test showed how they minimise the risk of meeting each other, by recognising pieces with <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> containing their own silk draglines and pieces contain other P. labiata females' draglines. If obstacles {{make it impossible to}} see whether the other is physically present, she avoids <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> containing the other's draglines, but moves with no constraint if she can see that the other female is not around. Draglines seem to act as territory marks, much as many mammals identify conspecifics by scent marking. P. labiata females also avoid rival females of higher fighting ability and spend more time around less powerful fighters. A laboratory test collected samples of the draglines [...] of equal-sized females and then pitted some of them in contests. Other females avoided the draglines of the victors, and spent the majority of their time on draglines of the losers. Similar tests showed that females of P. fimbriata from Australia and P. schultzi from Kenya do not avoid draglines of a powerful fighter.|$|E

500|$|The Group's {{aim was to}} find a {{replacement}} for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, sulfur and potassium nitrate with a binding agent. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, corn starch, and ammonium nitrate bound together in the JATO unit with glue and <b>blotting</b> <b>paper.</b> It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at the March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that [...] "at least it wasn't a big hole", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.|$|E
2500|$|One {{or both of}} two drying {{techniques}} was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying {{with the}} aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the humidity level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately. [...] Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a clothes line.|$|E

He had hardly reached the plattform when he received such a box on the ear that he fell to the floor. As he crestfallen rose to return to his own desk he was further rebuked by the teacher, who ordered him immediately to fling the drawing in the red-hot stove."

2500|$|As PINK {{was struck}} by the impossibility of expressing {{essentials}} in words, she started scripting her stories in disordered alphabets on canvas. Her paintings Letters from Arcadia (ongoing) are in fountain pen on canvas or palimpsest. [...] Letters to Family, an ongoing cycle of art works and installations, are communications with those PINK regards as close relatives and soulmates who live on in museums and libraries (such as Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, Velimir Khlebnikov, James Lee Byars, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Joseph Beuys, Piet Mondriaan, Kazimir Malevich, Marcel Broodthaers, Alberto Giacometti and The Unknown Artist). Letters from the Ferryman (2001) is a series of double portraits of strangers (painted and written). Encyclopedia Arcadia (begun 2001) is a series of books: Passions, Scripts, Prayers, Alchemy, Scriptures, Omens, Scores, Discoveries, Torn Mirages and Inventories. Blanchir l'Histoire (2002–2007) is a cycle of eight paintings, [...] each, in which PINK explores the roots of the written word from Sumerian to Hebrew.

2500|$|The {{restoration}} of the vase began in June 1988, and was filmed by the BBC History and Archaeology Unit. Deconstruction of the vase was achieved by wrapping it inside and out with <b>blotting</b> <b>paper</b> and letting it sit in a glass desiccator injected with solvents for three days, {{at the end of}} which it was separated into 189 pieces. After removing the remnants of the old adhesive and cleaning the fragments, an epoxy adhesive, Hxtal NYL, was used in conjunction with an acrylic resin to join the pieces. Although efforts were made to avoid [...] "trap-outs", where the placing of a fragment prevents the next from fitting in, Williams and Smith left for Christmas in 1988 [...] "not knowing whether they would be able to fit the last few shards without having to dismantle six months' work." [...] These fears proved unfounded; [...] "fter several weeks of assembling and reassembling the top half of the Vase, the final fragment of rim dropped in and fitted perfectly." [...] At the end of nine months' work, only 17 minuscule fragments remained unplaced, rather than the 34 that were omitted from the previous restoration. After filling in the cracks with coloured resin, Williams gave his verdict: [...] "It's OK... ruined my Christmas." ...|$|E

As Miss Plenderleith has just come back from playing golf at Wentworth, they go there and find out that she was seen on the links with the case. Later investigations show that she was seen to throw the item into the lake there. The police retrieve it but find nothing in it. Poirot asks Japp and Miss Plenderleith to call at his flat and they tell her of Eustace's arrest. Poirot then tells her of his real conclusions. From clues concerning missing <b>blotting</b> <b>paper,</b> Poirot deduces that Mrs Allen had written a letter just before she died, which if she killed herself, would indicate a suicide note. [...] He postulates that Miss Plenderleith came home, found her friend dead, driven to kill herself by the actions of her blackmailer and was determined to avenge her – this wasn't a murder made to look like suicide but a suicide made to look like murder and thereby entrapping the blackmailer. Miss Plenderleith placed the gun in Mrs Allen's right hand, {{despite the fact that she}} was left-handed, and the purpose of her trip to Wentworth was to hide there the dead lady's golf clubs – left-handed clubs, the attaché-case being a red herring to put the police off the trail. [...] Convinced by Poirot that Major Eustace will be imprisoned for his other crimes, she agrees to tell the truth and save the man from the gallows.|$|E
