5|$|Most {{bacteria}} have {{a single}} circular chromosome that can {{range in size from}} only 160,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Candidatus Carsonella ruddii, to 12,200,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacteria Sorangium cellulosum. The genes in bacterial genomes are usually a single continuous stretch of DNA and although several different types of introns do exist in bacteria, these are much rarer than in eukaryotes. Some bacteria, including the Spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement. <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> the cause of Lyme disease, contains a single linear chromosome and several linear and circular plasmids.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E
25|$|Lyme disease, or borreliosis, {{is caused}} by spirochetal {{bacteria}} from the genus Borrelia, which has 52 known species. Three main species (Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> s.s.) are the main causative agents of the disease in humans, while {{a number of others}} have been implicated as possibly pathogenic. Borrelia species in the species complex known to cause Lyme disease are collectively called <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> sensu lato (s.l.) {{not to be confused with}} the single species in that complex <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> sensu stricto which is responsible for all cases of Lyme disease in North America.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 study {{suggests}} <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> infections are endemic to Mexico, from four cases reported between 1999 and 2000.|$|E
25|$|Human {{diseases}} {{transmitted by}} microtine rodents include cystic hydatid disease, tularemia, bubonic plague, babesiosis, giardiasis and the Lyme disease spirochete <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lyme disease* is {{a disease}} caused by <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> a spirochaete, and spread by ticks of the genus Ixodes. Symptoms in dogs include acute arthritis, {{anorexia}} and lethargy. There is no rash as is typically seen in humans.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{also showed}} him {{at high risk}} of atherosclerosis and lactose intolerance, with the presence of the DNA sequence of <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> possibly making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease. A later analysis suggested the sequence may have been a different Borrelia species.|$|E
25|$|Lyme Disease {{was first}} {{described}} in Europe in 1883, the 1970s in North America and 1982 in Australia. It is an illness {{caused by a}} spiral bacterium called a spirochaete. The most common name for this spirochaete is <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> but many different Borrelia species cause Lyme Disease worldwide. An Australian spirochaete has not been found in humans yet, and may be quite different from <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi.</b> Despite clinical case reports, it is still controversial as to whether Lyme disease can be contracted in Australia. Some doctors and health authorities believe it does, while others are adamant that it does not. Until the controversy is resolved patients with suspected Lyme-like Disease should be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics because early treatment of Lyme Disease invariably results in a complete cure.|$|E
25|$|Despite Lyme disease (<b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> infection) being a {{notifiable}} {{disease in}} Scotland since January 1990 which {{should therefore be}} reported {{on the basis of}} clinical suspicion, it is believed that many GPs are unaware of the requirement. Mandatory reporting, limited to laboratory test results only, was introduced throughout the UK in October 2010, under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany {{that dates back}} to 1884, and from an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy, revealed the presence of the DNA sequence of <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> making him the earliest known human with Lyme disease.|$|E
25|$|In Europe known {{reservoirs}} of <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized {{mammals and}} 16 {{species of birds}} (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected {{as well as other}} species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> genetics {{has been the}} subject of recent studies. One study has found that prior to the reforestation that accompanied post-colonial farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the mid-west that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease was present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} caused by spirochetal {{bacteria}} from the genus Borrelia. Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella, along with an outer membrane similar to other Gram-negative bacteria. Because of their double-membrane envelope, Borrelia bacteria are often mistakenly described as Gram negative despite the considerable differences in their envelope components from Gram-negative bacteria. The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> sensu lato, and show {{a great deal of}} genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|The prokaryotes– {{bacteria}} and archaea– typically {{have a single}} circular chromosome, but many variations exist. The chromosomes of most bacteria, which some authors prefer to call genophores, can {{range in size from}} only 130,000 base pairs in the endosymbiotic bacteria Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola and Candidatus Tremblaya princeps, to more than 14,000,000 base pairs in the soil-dwelling bacterium Sorangium cellulosum. Spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia are a notable exception to this arrangement, with bacteria such as <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> the cause of Lyme disease, containing a single linear chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{infection}} of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. Acute hepatitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bartonella henselae, <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, Tropheryma whipplei, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, and rickettsia species.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the cell}} is the cytoplasmic region that {{contains}} the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids {{have been identified in}} several species of spirochete bacteria, including members of the genus Borrelia notably <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> which causes Lyme disease. Though not forming a nucleus, the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{transmitted}} to humans by {{the bite of}} infected ticks of the Ixodes genus. Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> and Borrelia mayonii are the cause. In Europe and Asia, the bacteria Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are also causes of the disease. The disease {{does not appear to}} be transmissible between people, by other animals, or through food. Diagnosis is based upon a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Blood tests are often negative in the early stages of the disease. Testing of individual ticks is not typically useful.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates {{a process known as}} iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with hemochromatosis, are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|Unlike eukaryotes, the {{bacterial}} DNA is not enclosed {{inside of}} a membrane-bound nucleus but instead resides inside the bacterial cytoplasm. This means that the transfer of cellular information through the processes of translation, transcription and DNA replication all occur within the same compartment and can interact with other cytoplasmic structures, most notably ribosomes. The bacterial DNA is not packaged using histones to form chromatin as in eukaryotes but instead exists as a highly compact supercoiled structure, the precise nature of which remains unclear. Most bacterial chromosomes are circular although some examples of linear DNA exist (e.g. <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi).</b> Along with chromosomal DNA, most bacteria also contain small independent pieces of DNA called plasmids that often encode for traits that are advantageous but not essential to their bacterial host. Plasmids can be easily gained or lost by a bacterium and can be transferred between bacteria {{as a form of}} horizontal gene transfer. So plasmids can be described as an extra chromosomal DNA in a bacterial cell.|$|E
25|$|Some vector {{competence}} {{studies have}} been undertaken on Ixodes holocyclus {{with respect to the}} Lyme disease pathogen <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> sensu stricto (with a United States strain). These suggested that the tick can not transmit this strain of spirochaete (. Despite this, there is a strong belief that some kind of Lyme-like spirochaete causes a Lyme-like disease in Australia and that it is carried by Ixodes holocyclus. At the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney the Tick-borne Diseases Research Unit continues its study into this issue. Cases of Lyme-like disease are being diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs (often musculoskeletal, chronic fatigue, neurological and dermatological), exclusion of other infections, serology (which is supportive but not conclusive), and response to antibiotic treatment. Initially, antibiotics may cause a worsening of symptoms (the Herxheimer reaction), as spirochaetes are destroyed, which in part supports the diagnosis. This Australian form of Lyme-like borreliosis is associated with a different clinical picture from true Lyme disease of North America.|$|E
25|$|A {{preceding}} antigenic challenge can {{be identified}} in approximately two-thirds of people. Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi,</b> Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than {{the risk of developing}} ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.|$|E

Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|Tick-borne {{diseases}} {{are common in}} dogs. [...] Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> and spread by Ixodes pacificus on the West coast of the United States and by I. scapularis (deer tick) {{in the rest of}} the U.S. [...] Signs and symptoms include fever, joint swelling and pain, lameness, and swelling of the lymph nodes. [...] It has been diagnosed in dogs in all 48 states of the continental U.S. [...] Ehrlichia canis, which causes canine ehrlichiosis, and Rickettsia rickettsii, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are both spread by the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineous.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{cases were}} {{described}} in Brazil in 1992 in siblings from Cotia, São Paulo that developed symptoms as a migrating redness, general flu-like symptoms and arthritis after being bitten by ticks. Although the symptoms {{were similar to}} those presented by patients of Lyme disease, clinical and laboratorial results were considerably different. Ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex were not found at the risk areas; bacteria from the <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> sensu lato complex —that cause Lyme disease— were not found in biological fluids and tissues of the siblings. Blood analysis of the patients on electron microscopy exhibited structures resembling microorganisms of the spirochaete phylum. For these reasons, the Brazilian zoonosis was considered a new disease and named Baggio–Yoshinari Syndrome (BYS), defined as: [...] "Exotic and emerging Brazilian infectious disease, transmitted by ticks not belonging to the Ixodes ricinus complex, caused by latent spirochetes with atypical morphology, which originates LD-like symptoms, except for occurrence of relapsing episodes and auto-immune disorders".|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Steere, et al., {{began to}} test {{antibiotic}} regimens in adult patients with Lyme disease. In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer, {{a researcher at}} the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, with collections of I. dammini [...] from Shelter Island, NY, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed [...] "poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes." [...] Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the [...] "long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease." [...] Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from patients diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour [...] "offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism." [...] Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from patients with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. In June 1982, he published his findings in Science, and the spirochete was named <b>Borrelia</b> <b>burgdorferi</b> in his honor.|$|E
