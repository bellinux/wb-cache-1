5|$|Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a {{treatise}} on cabbage, which Pliny knew, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> survived. The Greeks {{were convinced that}} cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} hadrosaurids, Edmontosaurus lacked a bony crest. It {{may have had}} soft-tissue display {{structures}} in the skull, though: the bones around the nasal openings had deep indentations surrounding the openings, and this pair of recesses are postulated to have held inflatable air sacs, perhaps allowing for both visual and auditory signaling. Edmontosaurus may have been dimorphic, with more robust and more lightly built forms, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been established if this is related to sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Norman conquest, Dorchester was not a place of great significance; the Normans did build a castle <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> survived. A priory was also founded, in 1364, though this also has since disappeared. In the later medieval period the town prospered; it became a {{thriving}} commercial and political centre for south Dorset, with a textile trading and manufacturing industry which continued until the 17th century. In {{the time of}} Edward III (1312–1377), the town was governed by bailiffs and burgesses, with the number of burgesses increasing to fifteen by the reign of James I (1566–1625).|$|E
5|$|Its {{estimated}} mass is over 23.04 {{times that of}} Jupiter. Additionally, HIP 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU, which is 710 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit. The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39.482 AU, meaning that HIP 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, HIP 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of HIP 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been directly observed {{long enough to know}} definitively.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{surveyed}} by the geologist Thomas Sopwith in the 19th {{century and the}} historian R.G. Collingwood in the 20th, with a geophysics survey in the 21st, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been fully excavated. Among finds at the fort are altars with inscriptions to Hercules by the 6th Legion of the Roman army (normally stationed at York) and to Apollo by the fort's garrison of auxiliaries, the 2nd Cohort of Nervians. Other finds include a midden containing shoes; coins, fragments of Samian pottery, beads, nails, and a bronze handle shaped like a dolphin.|$|E

5|$|The {{south-western}} promontory of Dun Mingulay {{features the}} remains of an Iron Age fort {{and there is a}} pre-historic site at Crois an t-Suidheachain near the western landing place at Aneir {{at the southern end of}} Mingulay Bay, which may have been a stone circle. In 1971 a 2,000-year-old Iron Age midden was found resting on sand near the ‘Village’ overlooking the Bay. A stone 'pebble hammer' was discovered nearby in 1975, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been possible to date the find. Skipisdale may also contain Iron Age remains.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} to extend the O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due to the absence of an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been built.|$|E
5|$|Valor por Tamaulipas ("Courage for Tamaulipas") is a Facebook {{page that}} covered {{security}} updates in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. It {{was founded by}} an anonymous user on 1 January 2012, and its goal is to share information with other social media users on the drug-related violence and risk situations all across the state. With over 515,000 likes on Facebook, Valor por Tamaulipas routinely posted messages and photos of crime scenes on its page. In a country where many journalists have been assassinated for writing about drug trafficking and organized crime, the page survives under anonymity, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been immune to threats.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's Transformation Plan, the 3rd Brigade, 75th Division was redesignated as the 166th Aviation Brigade, {{under the}} command of Division West of the First Army. Its mission would be to train and {{mobilize}} aviation units of the Army's reserve and national guard components. It was to be the only brigade under the First Army that specialized in training for Army aviation units. It was activated 1 December 2006 as a reserve unit at Fort Riley. The brigade became a partner organization of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed at Fort Riley and could provide better support than the headquarters of First Army Division West, which was headquartered at Fort Carson, Colorado and maintained units all over the western United States. The brigade received a shoulder sleeve insignia on 13 June 2007, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been authorized for wear due to First Army policy requiring its units to wear its SSI.|$|E
5|$|Structure 10L-11 is on {{the west}} side of the Acropolis. It {{encloses}} the south side of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is accessed from it by a wide monumental stairway. This structure appears to have been the royal palace of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, the 16thruler in the dynastic succession and the last known king of Copán. Structure 10L-11 was built on top of several earlier structures, one of which probably contains the tomb of his predecessor K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil. A small tunnel descends into the interior of the structure, possibly to the tomb, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been excavated by archaeologists. Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat built a new temple platform over his predecessor's tomb in AD769. On top of this he placed a two-storey superstructure with a sculpted roof depicting the mythological cosmos. At each of its northern corners was a large sculpted Pawatun (a group of deities that supported the heavens). This superstructure had four doorways with panels of hieroglyphs sculpted directly onto the walls of the building. A bench inside the structure, removed by Maudslay in the nineteenth century and now in the British Museum's collection, once depicted the king's accession to the throne, overseen by deities and ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The {{four main}} Japanese islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido {{lie in a}} convex {{arrangement}} pointing to the Pacific Ocean, while the oceanic trenches that form the western boundary of the Pacific Plate are convex in the opposite direction, toward Eurasia. The continental crust above the subduction zones had previously {{been associated with the}} Eurasian Plate, but northern Honshu and Hokkaido have more recently been treated as part of the North American Plate, due to a poorly defined plate boundary between Eastern Siberia and Alaska and a newly forming boundary at the eastern perimeter of the Sea of Japan. This portion of the crust has been known locally as the Okhotsk Plate. The southwestern border of the plate is called the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line. It is a region of faulting that traverses the width of central Honshu, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> generated any large earthquakes. Moving westward, though, the Atera, Miboro, Atotsugawa, and Nobi faults have all produced large events. Two of those events occurred beyond the terminus of the 1891 rupture: the 1945 Mikawa earthquake that hit near Nagoya on the Fukozu Fault and the 1948 Fukui earthquake that occurred near the Sea of Japan.|$|E
