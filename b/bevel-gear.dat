25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} pinions, generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the spur gears on the individual half-shafts. Each pinion pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the pinion pairs are displaced axially, such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given pinion meshes with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Therefore, each pinion couples that spur gear to the other pinion, and in turn, the other spur gear, {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a <b>bevel-gear</b> differential.|$|E

2500|$|Bossi’s human-powered aircraft, {{named the}} Pedaliante, {{utilized}} conventional glider configuration and construction. The high-winged streamlined monoplane design featured two laminated balsa wood propellers – each approximately [...] in diameter. The control surfaces {{consisted of a}} conventional rear rudder, elevator, {{and a pair of}} roll spoilers on the wings – all activated by a divided control yoke. The pilot sat semi-upright, and a bicycle chain transmitted the power from the pedals to an overhead transverse shaft that was <b>bevel-geared</b> to the two propellers, which extended from the wing {{on each side of the}} fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|All {{these cars}} are based around the TC3's solid transmission, which uses two <b>bevel-geared</b> {{differentials}} (or [...] "diffs"), with a prop shaft connecting them. On the BJ4, JConcepts used AE diff cases and diffs, and modified the shaft {{to include a}} slipper unit. Since then, JConcepts has updated the BJ4 to the Worlds-winning 'Worlds' edition. In Summer 2006, JConcepts [...] "turned the drawings over to Team Associated, which took over and fine-tuned the design for fit and finish" [...] (RC Driver magazine, Dec. 2007).

5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the engine were increased propeller efficiency through the reduction gearing effect of having the engine effectively running at 1,800 rpm for only 900 rpm of the airscrew, and excellent high-altitude performance due to the high compression ratio achieved. A bonus was the counter-rotating masses tended to cancel out the gyroscopic forces of the engine. This was achieved by using <b>bevel-gears</b> housed {{in the rear of}} the crankcase. This [...] "contra-rotary" [...] action also caused the point of ignition in the rotary action of the cylinders to itself slowly rotate in the direction of the crankshaft's rotation as the engine ran, as shown in the animation. For a normal rotary engine that had its crankshaft fastened to the airframe, the point of ignition always stayed in the same place in the cylinders' rotative action as they spun with the crankcase.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.0 L (...) straight-4 {{engine was}} {{designed}} by ex-Royal Flying Corps engineer Clive Gallop and was technically very advanced for its time. It {{was one of the}} first production car engines with 4 valves per cylinder, dry-sump lubrication and an overhead camshaft. The four valve SOHC Hemi design, with a <b>bevel-geared</b> shaft drive for the camshaft, was based on the pre-war 1914 Mercedes Daimler M93654 racing engine. Just before the outbreak of the war Mercedes had placed one of the winning Grand Prix cars in their London showroom in Long Acre. At the suggestion of W.O. Bentley, then being commissioned in the Royal Naval Air Service, the vehicle was confiscated in 1915 by the British army, dismantled at Rolls-Royce and subjected to scrutiny. A notable difference to both the Mercedes and the aero engines was the cast-iron monobloc design, and the fully Aluminium enclosed camshaft, which greatly contributed to its durability. But having the valve-head and block in one-piece made for a complicated and labour intensive casting and machining. This was a feature shared during that time by the Bugattis which the car was later to compete with. The engine was also among the first with two spark plugs per cylinder, pent-roof combustion chambers, and twin carburetters. It was extremely undersquare, optimized for low-end torque, with a bore of 80 mm and a stroke of 149 mm.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the synthesis, design, and development of a next generation surgical robotic system to increase assimilation of surgical robots in minimally invasive surgery. This portable robotic system is constructed for multipurpose use, such as guiding surgical tools, positioning laparoscopic cameras, and cooperating with miniature in vivo robots. ^ A compact, portable robot has been developed using a spherical <b>bevel-geared</b> mechanism to achieve the necessary workspace for minimally invasive surgery in four degrees of freedom. Kinematics have been developed as a foundation for workspace analysis and intuitive motion control. Further, inverse dynamic modeling has been presented for advanced dynamic control system implementation. ^ An optimal design methodology for spherical serial mechanisms has been presented based on genetic algorithms. Multiple criteria (workspace, manipulability, and size) with changeable priorities are linearly combined in one objective function for different desirable performance emphases. A new metric of workspace quality, consistent manipulability, has been defined to involve both the global manipulability and the uniformity of manipulability over the workspace. The optimization results of the presented robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flexible and adaptable methodology also provides a general optimization approach for robot linkage synthesis. ^ The derived kinematics are integrated in control software for intuitive master-slave control. Use of the robotic system for camera guidance and for cooperation with miniature in vivo robots in porcine models indicates that the robot can provide the surgeon with a stable and remotely adjustable platform for holding and positioning of tools for minimally invasive surgery. Compact robotic systems based on this technology could replace the large systems in current use, potentially increasing the impact of robots on medical care. ...|$|R

Corliss directed both the business and research sides of this company, {{and over the years}} invented many assembly line improvements such as a <b>bevel-gear</b> cutter.

50|$|The Jeantaud was a French {{automobile}} {{manufactured in}} Paris from 1893 until 1907. It was {{the brainchild of}} Charles Jeantaud, a coachbuilder who built his first electric carriage in 1881. Among the vehicles he constructed was the first car to set a land speed record (39.24 mi/h km/h, driven by Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat), as well as coupes and hansom cabs; in these the driver sat high, and to the rear. Some cars had an unusual <b>bevel-gear</b> front-wheel-drive layout. From 1902 to 1904, Jeantaud offered a range of gas-engined cars similar to 1898 Panhards.|$|E
50|$|Unlike its {{predecessors}} which were <b>bevel-gear</b> OHC designs, the Pantah {{was the first}} Ducati to have belt-driven camshaft motors, thus forming {{the vanguard of the}} new generation of current Ducati V-twins. First shown December 1979, the Pantah came on the market as the 1980 500SL and the last of the line, the 650SL, was sold in 1986. Successful in racing as the 600 cc TT2 and later TT1 750 cc racer, the Pantah was a lighter, shorter wheelbase motorcycle, in a new trellis frame that was to become a trademark Ducati feature.|$|E

It was fitted with a Zoller supercharger and produced [...] at 7200 rpm. The gearbox was a four-speed preselector type unit. At the rear the differential in its aluminium casing was fastened to the chassis and drove the wheels through short shafts with sliding splines and universal joints.|$|E

The chassis was based on the one used in the 1928 Morris Minor with lowered suspension using half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction disk shock absorbers with rigid front and rear axles and bolt on wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 78 inches (1980 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|E

50|$|The Silver Hawk’s 592 cc {{design was}} a {{development}} of the Silver Arrow and shared a similar frame design and cycle parts, {{as well as the}} monoblock 26 degree V with a one-piece OHC head concept. The single <b>bevel-gear</b> overhead camshaft ran across the cylinder head and four bores with special air cooling housed two pairs of cylinders at 26 degrees to each other. A single carburettor fed all four induction valves through a cross shaped induction that produced an uneven feed. Coil and dynamo ignition was driven by skew gearing from the camshaft-drive vertical shaft. A dry-sump oil system was supplied from a steel tank {{at the base of the}} front-down tube, bolted to the engine's crankcase. The engine was flexible, however, and could be started by hand and run in top gear most of the time. This was an important factor for the hand operated gear change.|$|E

40|$|Many {{a robotic}} pitch-roll wrist uses a <b>bevel-gear</b> {{differential}} train {{to drive the}} gripper. The innovative design of pitch-roll wrists using spherical cam-roller pairs is currently underway at McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines, {{with the aim of}} overcoming the drawbacks of <b>bevel-gear</b> trains. This innovative design relies on Speed-o-Cam, a new concept of speed-reduction mechanisms based on cams and pure-rolling contact, intended to replace gears and harmonic drives in applications where backlash, friction, and flexibility cannot be tolerated. The new mechanism consists mainly of a spherical conjugate cam subassembly and two roller-carrying disks. We start with a study of cam curvature, with special focus on its machinability. Drawing from experience, we introduce the hypothesis that high curvature changes of a cam profile are at the source of the concentration of machining errors. As a consequence, the machining accuracy of the concave regions in a cam profile is substantially lower than that of its convex regions. To produce a more accurate cam we developed the geometric condition that guarantees a fully convex spherical cam profile. The optimum design of the pitch-roll mechanism based on cam-roller pairs is reported here. The optimization is intended to simplify the subassembly of spherical conjugate cams of the old design by means of a layout of two pairs of spherical mechanisms of the Stephenson type and two conjugate cams mounted on distinct shafts. We focus on the optimum design of both the spherical cam-roller mechanism and the spherical Stephenson mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The non-{{oriented}} and {{oriented graph}} techniques {{are used for}} kinematic analysis of <b>bevel-gear</b> trains. In both techniques, the kinematic structure of the gear trains is represented by a graph. Although the non-oriented graphs are simple to draw, they are used only to determine the carrier nodes of the fundamental circuits. On the other hand, the oriented graphs carry more information than the non-oriented graphs since each line in an oriented graph represents a pair of complementary variables. In this paper, these two techniques are compared and {{the advantages of the}} oriented graph technique are demonstrated by the kinematic analysis of an articulated robotic mechanism used by the Cincinnati Milacron T 3. ...|$|E
