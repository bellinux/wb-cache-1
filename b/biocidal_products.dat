25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E
2500|$|Several European {{countries}} {{restrict the}} use of formaldehyde, including the import of formaldehyde-treated products and embalming. Starting September 2007, the European Union banned {{the use of}} formaldehyde due to its carcinogenic properties as a biocide (including embalming) under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive (98/8/EC). Countries with a strong tradition of embalming corpses, such as Ireland and other colder-weather countries, have raised concerns. Despite reports to the contrary, no decision on the inclusion of formaldehyde on AnnexI of the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive for product-type22 (embalming and taxidermist fluids) had been made [...]|$|E
30|$|Obviously, if toxic {{compounds}} are {{not considered}} in a component based assessment, the calculated risk will be an underestimation of the actual risk of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product,</b> see[25]. It is, however, impossible to provide a general estimate {{of the magnitude of}} such an underestimation, as this depends on the concentration and ecotoxicological potency of the compounds that are erroneously not included in the assessment. Therefore, special care has to be taken to ensure that all toxic ingredients are included in a component-based assessment of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R
30|$|Any {{component}} based {{approach requires}} that all “relevant” compounds {{are included in}} the assessment, i.e. biologically active chemicals that are present at sufficiently high concentrations. Within the framework of biocide legislation such compounds are termed “substances of concern”, i.e. constituents of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> other than the active ingredient that have “an inherent capacity to cause an adverse effect on humans, animals or the environment” ([1], Art 2 e). If no ecotoxicological information is at hand for such ingredients, the only risk assessment option is the direct biotesting of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or the resulting environmental mixture, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the here}} {{investigated}} dataset, the components that contribute more than 20 % {{to the overall}} joint toxicity as well as relevant a.s. from other <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> types are covered by these criteria. Using a set of criteria based on the REACH and CLP regulations for the identification of additives relevant for a CBA of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> has the great advantage to improve consistency and harmonization with the existing regulatory guidance. In terms of workload, the number of additives to be considered would increase compared to the current set of criteria [13]. However, the aquatic toxicity data for the additives need to be compiled anyway {{in the course of}} classification and labelling, and therefore no extra effort would be implied for this step of the assessment. In the present data set, the number of additives that would need to be considered in addition to the active substances amounts to 48 in 21 products (i.e. about 2 per product), and is reduced to 21 (about 1 per product, equal to about 8 % of all additives) if ready biodegradability is considered additionally.|$|R

Currently, these tasks are dealt with by the biocides group within the IHCP. From 2013, coinciding with the coming-into-force of a new <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR), the European Chemicals Agency ECHA will take over the biocides' program.|$|E
50|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> in {{different}} ways in both occupational and domestic settings. Many <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are intended for industrial sectors or professional uses only, whereas other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are commonly available for private use by non-professional users. In addition, potential exposure of non-users of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (i.e. the general public) may occur indirectly via the environment, for example through drinking water, the food chain, {{as well as through}} atmospheric and residential exposure. Particular attention should be paid to the exposure of vulnerable sub-populations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Also pets and other domestic animals can be exposed indirectly following the application of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, exposure to biocides may vary in terms of route (inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion) and pathway (food, drinking water, residential, occupational) of exposure, level, frequency and duration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> include, for example, insect repellents and {{disinfectants}} used in hospitals. The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR) {{ensures that}} there is enough information about these products so that consumers can use them safely. ECHA is responsible for implementing the regulation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> is a {{substance}} intending to destroy, deter, render harmless, prevent the action of, or exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism {{by any means}} other than mere physical or mechanical action. These products are highly regulated because of health and performance concerns. They first have to be legally regulated, and all products or substances on the market {{also have to be}} tested and certified in order to ensure their compliance with current directives and regulations.|$|R
30|$|The {{transitional}} {{guidance document}} particularly explains two different generic approaches for the mixture toxicity assessment. One {{approach is to}} conduct ecotoxicity tests with the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or, e.g. with the environmental mixture resulting {{from the use of}} the product (such as leachates from treated wood). The second, so-called component-based approach (CBA) is to calculate the ecotoxicity of the product or of the resulting environmental mixture using ecotoxicity data of the individual mixture components. The concept of concentration addition (CA) is recommended as default for this approach by the BPR {{as well as by the}} transitional guidance document, because CA is less data demanding and usually results in a more conservative assessment than the alternative concept of independent action (IA), demonstrated e.g. by Junghans et al. [24]. In comparison to the whole mixture testing approach, the CBA has the strong advantage that it allows assessing the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> and environmental mixtures resulting from its usage with little extra effort, assuming that predicted environmental concentrations are calculated anyway for all relevant product components. Ecotoxicological testing, particularly animal testing, is thereby reduced. The CBA is therefore preferred to the whole mixture testing approach wherever possible [12, 13].|$|R
30|$|Supported by {{theoretical}} {{calculations and}} experimental verifications, {{the present study}} developed criteria for the identification of CBA-relevant components in a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> These criteria are based on existing criteria stated in the regulation for classification, labelling and packaging of substances. The CBA was found sufficiently protective and reliable for the tested products when applying the here recommended criteria. The lack of available aquatic toxicity data {{for some of the}} identified relevant components was the main reason for underestimation of product toxicity.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years {{biocides}} {{have been used}} increasingly and {{questions have been raised}} about their contribution to the reported increase in biocide and antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. The EU <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> Regulation (BPR) now requires information on the risk of resistance development in organisms targeted by the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> There is no current protocol available to predict the likelihood of bacteria becoming resistant to a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or biocides contained therein. This study aimed to identify useful markers of biocide resistance and develop a step-by- step protocol predictive of bacterial biocide resistance and antibiotic cross-resistance following biocide exposure. A range of experimental techniques with the potential to generate markers of biocide resistance were explored. These included minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) /minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) /antibiotic susceptibility determination, flow cytometry, efflux activity measurements, outer membrane protein changes, real-time PCR and microarrays. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains SL 1344 and 14028 S, and Burkholderia lata strain 383 were exposed to low concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate and benzalkonium chloride as test biocides. Baseline and post-exposure data were then compared. Techniques used to understand any change in antimicrobial susceptibility were assessed in terms of practicality, cost and ease of use, and a step-by-step protocol was put together accounting for each of these factors. Increases in biocide MIC and MBC of up to 100 fold were observed in SL 1344 and 14028 S after exposure to both biocides. However these changes were not stable after subculture of surviving organisms in the absence of either biocide. No such dramatic changes were observed within B. lata. Up-regulation of efflux activity was observed as a result of CHG/BZC exposure and the efflux regulatory gene acrR underwent a > 100 fold down-regulation in both Salmonella strains after CHG exposure.

40|$|In {{collaboration}} with Vitalfluid, TU Eindhoven, FloraHolland, Bactimm, Alewijnse and Medical faculty of UMC Radboud Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture studied horticultural application {{for the use}} of plasma activated water. This research was funded by the GO programm Oost Nederland, the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRO) and Top sector Horticulture & Propagation materials. By using a specialized plasma reactor, an indirect air dielectric barrier discharge in close proximity to water can create an acidified, nitrogen-oxide containing solution called plasma-activated water (PAW). Plasma water is tested for properties as a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product,</b> plant protection treatment and as a fertilizer in horticultural applications. Mild plasma water with a short production time (15 min) can effectively control bacteria and meet the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> legislation. Strong plasma water with a longer production time (45 min) is necessary for controlling molds as Fusarium, Botrytis and powdery mildew. The tomato mosaic virus can be reduced with strong plasma up to 80 %. The crop treatments showed no damage on young gerbera plants, lettuce and tomato plants. Application of plasma water through the irrigation system to promote plant growth is not promising, because nitrogen supply is in general not limited. Application as seed disinfection is possible with low concentrations of plasma water...|$|R

30|$|A risk {{quotient}} exceeding {{one might}} be caused by the overestimation that results from the application of CA to a mixture of not entirely similarly acting compounds. Details on how to estimate this possible overestimation are provided by Junghans and colleagues[29], Backhaus and colleagues[22] and Altenburger et al.[30]. The direct testing of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> might provide additional insight, given that a substantial risk overestimation by CA is possible, which depends {{on the number of}} involved compounds, their toxicity and ratio in the mixture. Otherwise there would be a clear indication for a reason for environmental concern, which would call for appropriate risk management strategies.|$|R
30|$|The {{mixtures}} {{that make}} up a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> will usually not be composed of either only strictly similarly or of only strictly dissimilarly acting compounds. Hence, the application of either CA or IA is inherently biased. From the available evidence[6], it is to be expected that the application of CA to a mixture of not entirely similarly acting compounds will lead to a slightly cautious mixture assessment (slight overestimation of risk). Accordingly, using IA for a mixture of at least partly similarly acting substances would often lead to a risk underestimation. Consequently, should IA be used during the authorization of a product, an applicant would need to prove that IA adequately describes the toxicity of the assessed <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> This, however, is only possible by comparing the IA-prediction to experimental data for the product for each considered endpoint. It might therefore be easier and less resource demanding to limit the experimental work to testing the whole product only and to omit a component-based analysis using IA. If IA is considered due to dissimilar modes or mechanisms of action of the ingredients, it should be checked prior to any experimental work whether the actual mixture ratio allows for the possibility that IA might indeed lead to a different regulatory outcome of the assessment, see discussion by Backhaus and Faust,[22]. It should finally be pointed out that only CA can be applied with the typical ecotoxicological data that are documented in the published literature or study summaries, such as EC 50 or NOEC-values, see discussion in[6].|$|R

50|$|In {{light of}} {{potential}} adverse effects, {{and to ensure}} a harmonised risk assessment and management, the EU regulatory framework for biocides has been established {{with the objective of}} ensuring a high level of protection of human and animal health and the environment. To this aim, it is required that risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> is carried out before they can be placed on the market. A central element in the risk assessment of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are the utilization instructions that defines the dosage, application method and amount of applications and thus the exposure of humans and the environment to the biocidal substance.|$|E
50|$|The EU {{regulatory}} framework for biocides has for years been defined by the Directive 98/8/EC, {{also known as the}} <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive (BPD). The BPD was revoked by the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation 528/2012 (BPR), which entered into force on 17 July 2012 with the application date of September 1, 2013. Several Technical Notes for Guidance (TNsG) have been developed to facilitate the implementation of the BPR and to assure a common understanding of its obligations. According to the EU legislation, <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> need authorisation to be placed or to remain on the market. Competent Authorities of the EU member states are responsible for assessing and approving the active substances contained in the biocides. The BPR follows some of the principles set previously under the REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restrictions of Chemicals) and the coordination of the risk assessment process for both REACH and BPR are mandated to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which assures the harmonization and integration of risk characterization methodologies between the two regulations.|$|E
30|$|Testing {{the whole}} product is {{straight}} forward, {{does not require}} any specific methodology and can hence use the same experimental outline as the tests of an individual chemical. However, the BPR states that tests with vertebrate animals can only be conducted as a last resort, i.e. when alternative testing and assessment methods have been exhausted. Furthermore the testing of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> for its chronic toxicity might be of only limited informative value. The composition of the product might change already during the exposure in biotests, as the different chemicals might have a different stability and distribution between biota, headspace, aqueous media, soil, sediment, etc. Changes in the chemical composition of the initial mixture are most likely even more pronounced if transformation and distribution processes in the environment are taken into consideration.|$|R
30|$|The maximum STU {{indicates}} which endpoint {{for which}} species {{is expected to}} be most sensitive to the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> in question and is hence used for the final assessment. It can be mathematically proven that the risk quotient that results from summing up PEC/PNECs (eq. 8) is always equal or higher than the maximum STU according to eq. 9 [22]. Their precise relationship depends on the ecotoxicological profiles of the compounds in the mixture. In case of dissimilar profiles, the ratio between the application of eq. 8 and 9 approaches the theoretical maximum of m, which is number of considered endpoints. If the compounds have almost the same ecotoxicological profiles, which can be expected e.g. for a mixture of simple organic solvents, then the risk quotients from both equations become identical.|$|R

Only a small number of active ingredients have been supported by manufacturers in submitting dossiers to the EU Authorities.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe the <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{are divided}} into {{different}} product types (PT), based on their intended use.

It should noted that one active substance can be used in several product types, such as for example sulfuryl fluoride, which is approved for use as a wood preservative (PT 8) as well as an insecticide (PT 18).|$|E
30|$|Four options exist, {{if there}} are {{potential}} reasons for concern (RQProduct > 1, Figure 1): (i) the PEC and/or PNEC estimate of the most risky compound might be refined by providing additional ecotoxicological data and/or exposure estimates. Such an effort might be worthwhile in particular if the PNEC assessment is based only on the so-called base-set of data, i.e. short-term toxicity data for algae, daphnids and fish, according to ECHA (2008); (ii) evidence from e.g. dedicated experimental mixture studies with these or other representatives of the compounds / compound classes in question are provided, in order to allows a better estimation of the IF; (iii) the whole mixture (<b>biocidal</b> <b>product)</b> might be subjected to direct biotesting, considering the limitations as outlined above; or (iv) a more detailed component-based assessment is carried out that uses quantitative risk estimates {{not only for the}} most risky compound, but for every relevant compound.|$|R
30|$|CA, {{as well as}} IA, {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} that the compounds in a mixture do not interact, neither chemically nor in their toxicokinetic and -dynamic phases. Such interactions might cause synergisms, i.e. a mixture toxicity that is higher than expected by both concepts. Although comparatively rare in general[6], several examples of synergistic interactions can be found in the literature. They are mainly restricted to mixtures with a few (usually two) compounds, which is exactly the situation that is relevant within the context of <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> authorization. For example, the combination of zinc-pyrithione and copper, two antifouling biocides, shows a clearly higher toxicity than predicted by CA in a range of bioassays, due to the trans-chelation of zinc-pyrithione to the significantly more toxic copper-pyrithione[26]. Mixtures of organophosphates and carbamates (insecticides) were consistently more toxic to fish than predicted by CA, despite their similar mechanisms of action[27]. This is most likely caused by the inhibition of organophosphate biotransformation to their inactive dicarboxylic acid derivates by carbamates.|$|R

As with all surface treatments, NPs can be leached into the surrounding environment, leading to potential ecotoxicity in soil and water and associated biota.

Although ecotoxicity has been assessed by a variety of techniques, it is important that a suitable standard test be developed and the European Unions’s <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> Registration group is working on this, as well as a standard test for antimicrobial efficacy to determine their impact on ecological processes of surrounding non-target organisms and their transformation products under realistic scenarios.|$|R
