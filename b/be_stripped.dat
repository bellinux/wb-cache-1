5|$|A. Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva was {{the only}} 2006 Winter Olympics {{medalist}} to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their medal. She won a silver medal in the 15km race, but tested positive for carphedon and was thus stripped of her medal. Germany's Martina Glagow was given the silver medal and fellow Russian Albina Akhatova won the bronze.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard {{can collect}} drool and food particles, making {{frequent}} cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat needs to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> {{every two to}} four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.|$|E
5|$|On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Punk {{defended the}} WWE Championship against The Rock in a match stipulated that if The Shield interfered, Punk would <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of the title. Punk {{originally}} pinned The Rock to retain after The Shield put Rock through a table while the arena lights were out. Vince McMahon began {{to announce that}} Punk would <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of the title, but he instead restarted the match at The Rock's request. Punk went on to lose the match, ending his record-setting reign at 434 days. Punk received a title rematch with Rock on February 17 at the Elimination Chamber event, stipulated that the Rock would lose the WWE Championship if he was disqualified or counted out, but Rock pinned Punk to retain the title. On the February 25 episode of Raw, Punk faced Royal Rumble winner John Cena for his number one contendership to the WWE Championship, but lost.|$|E

5|$|After a touch-line {{argument}} with then-club captain Gareth Owen, Gannon gave a forthright interview explaining that disciplinary {{action would be}} taken, and Owen would <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of the captaincy. Owen, who was later released by the club, did not play another game for County. Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause. By then, some of the Party's followers stationed in France wanted Betances to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his posts and assignments. At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental health to have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{impairment}} in the cutaneous {{distribution of the}} saphenous nerve was measured in 30 patients after bilateral stripping of the long saphenous vein. The vein <b>was</b> <b>stripped</b> upwards in one leg and downwards in the other. Three months after operation a significantly greater incidence of sensory loss was found in those legs in which the vein <b>was</b> <b>stripped</b> upwards (13 out of 26) compared with those which had <b>been</b> <b>stripped</b> downwards (6 out of 26) ...|$|R
50|$|Note - Melbourne Storm <b>were</b> <b>stripped</b> {{of their}} 2007, 2009 premiership titles and their 2006, 2007, 2008 minor premiership titles {{due to their}} 2010 salary cap breaches.

5000|$|After the home-and-away {{season was}} finished, 's {{reserves}} and under-19s teams <b>were</b> <b>stripped</b> of any premiership points earned in matches {{in which they}} fielded Frank Loughran, an unregistered player from the Latrobe Valley. The reserves team, which went through the entire season undefeated, <b>was</b> <b>stripped</b> of twelve premiership points; it fell from first to second on the ladder, but still {{went on to win}} the premiership. The under-19s team <b>was</b> <b>stripped</b> of 28 premiership points, and dropped out of the final four as a result.|$|R
5|$|During this time, {{he joined}} the Jungfrontkämpfervereinigung, the youth section of Hermann Hiltl's right-wing {{veterans}} movement, and began reading newspapers published by the Nazi Party (NSDAP). The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic in Germany, rejection {{of the terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism. They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their citizenship and civil rights.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|In December, 2016, {{following}} {{the release of}} the McLaren Report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. La Gazzetta dello Sport reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation. The Russian team potentially could <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of up to 12 Olympic medals among these athletes alone.|$|E

5|$|On November 22, Kemp came {{in second}} to Ryan Braun in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. Later, it was {{revealed}} that Braun had tested positive for elevated testosterone and baseball attempted to suspend him, but lost on appeal. A survey of baseball writers revealed that if the MVP vote was retaken, with knowledge of Braun's positive test, then Kemp would have won. Braun was eventually suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal. Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun should <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his MVP Award from that season.|$|E
5|$|Serie A {{was dealt}} another blow by the 2006 Italian {{football}} scandal which involved alleged widespread match fixing implicating league champions Juventus, {{and other major}} teams including Milan, Fiorentina, Lazio, and Reggina. The FIGC ruled Juventus <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their title, relegated to Serie B and start the following season with a nine-point deduction. The other clubs involved suffered similarly with relegation and points deduction.|$|E
5|$|The National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) was one {{of several}} far-right {{political}} parties active in Germany {{after the end of the}} First World War. The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism. They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a Volksgemeinschaft (people's community) based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their citizenship and civil rights.|$|E

5|$|The US women's 4 x 400 metres {{relay team}} was {{recommended}} by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of their gold medal, after the suspension of Crystal Cox for doping. The gold medal should theoretically go to Russia, silver to Jamaica and bronze to Great Britain. However, up to today, no further action has been taken by IOC. Hence, the US relay team is still listed as the winner for this event.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} slowly {{moving in the}} {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; {{he was unable to}} repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully {{expected}} to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

5|$|After {{a return}} to the United States in mid-1970, Yancey entered {{inactive}} status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James River fleet until 16 August 1984 when she was withdrawn to <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of useful equipment by the U.S. Navy. She re-entered the fleet one year later, on 28 August 1985, but was withdrawn for the final time on 15 December 1989 to be prepared for sinking as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|At {{a special}} session of {{government}} held on 30 August 1944 in Pavelić's villa, guarded by armed men, Lorković and Vokić were accused of conspiracy against the Poglavnik and Croatia's German ally. Vice President of the Government, Džafer Kulenović, and many others defended them but to no avail. Lorković was kept under house arrest until he was tried before the Poglavnik's Bodyguard Division (PTS) where {{it was decided that}} he would <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his rank and expelled from the PTS. After the trial, he was transferred to Koprivnica and later in Lepoglava, alongside Vokić, Farolfi, Ljudevit Tomašić and others, although Košturić later escaped. Lorković was executed at the end of April 1945.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should <b>be</b> <b>stripped</b> of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
