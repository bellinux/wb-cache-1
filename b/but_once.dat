5|$|Adhesion problems. The {{locomotives}} {{were often}} prone to wheelslip, and required very careful driving when starting a heavy train from rest, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> into their stride they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and being remarkably stable when hauling heavy expresses.|$|E
5|$|His command style {{had worked}} {{when he was}} leading a {{division}} or corps, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> promoted to command of an army, it opened him to criticism over whether the advantages gained were enough to offset the loss of efficiency that followed.|$|E
5|$|The ore {{was easily}} located and worked from shallow pits and shafts, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> the usable upper {{deposits}} were removed, or if a mine shaft entered the bed too {{far below the}} surface, only unusable unconverted pyritic deposits were found.|$|E

5|$|Vanadium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal. The elemental metal is rarely found in nature, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> isolated artificially, {{the formation of}} an oxide layer (passivation) stabilizes the free metal somewhat against further oxidation.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} robbery attempt, Mauboussin's {{jewellery}} firm opened a branch in New York City on 1 October 1929, {{only to be}} met by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{at the end of}} October. To compound matters, the same gang of international robbers tried to steal the Nassak Diamond again in May 1930, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> again missed it.|$|E
5|$|At the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany, Kuznetsova {{recorded}} {{her first}} career win over Serena Williams before losing {{in the semifinals}} to Tatiana Golovin. The following week she was seeded 1st in the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, but lost to Serena Williams in the semifinals. Kuznetsova completed the year by competing at the year-ending Championships in Madrid, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> again failed to progress beyond the preliminary round-robin stage, losing all three matches. She finished the season as world No. 2 and as the highest-ranked Russian player for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> he took office, {{he had to}} come down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to hatching, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E
5|$|During the sessions, Grohl {{was invited}} by Tom Petty to perform with The Heartbreakers on Saturday Night Live one month later. The {{performance}} {{was followed by}} an invitation to be a full-time member of the Heartbreakers, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> Petty heard about the Foo Fighters, he instead encouraged Grohl {{to move on with}} this solo project. Grohl soon recruited a full band, which included bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith of the recently disbanded Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist, and former Germs member, Pat Smear.|$|E

5|$|Hardy was {{scheduled}} to wrestle on the pre-show of Turning Point in December 2005, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> again no-showed the event, again citing traveling problems. Hardy was suspended as a result and did not appear on TNA television again. In March, April, and May 2006, Hardy appeared on several live events promoted by TNA in conjunction with Dave Hebner and the United Wrestling Federation. Hardy was later released from his TNA contract in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough's {{weakness}} during Anne's reign {{lay in the}} English political scene. His {{determination to}} preserve {{the independence of the}} Queen's administration from control of party faction initially enjoyed full support, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> royal favour turned elsewhere, the Duke, like his key ally Godolphin, found himself isolated; first becoming little more than a servant of the Whigs, then a victim of the Tories.|$|E

5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first argumentative, then calm down and help {{each other in the}} clean air at the top.

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{struggled}} {{to begin the}} 2010–11 NHL season, falling to 14th place in the conference at the Christmas break. Consequently, the organization asked Darryl Sutter to step aside as general manager.

The team pulled itself back into playoff contention following the change <b>but</b> <b>once</b> again failed {{to qualify for the}} post-season.|$|E

5|$|This {{order of}} battle was almost always followed, {{the battle of the}} Great Plains and the battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a {{flanking}} force, routing the opposing Carthaginian troops.|$|E
5|$|When news arrived of Cerialis' {{victory over}} Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from {{pursuing}} further military endeavours. Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army <b>but,</b> <b>once</b> again, he was snubbed. With {{the return of}} Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.|$|E
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
