40|$|Previous {{marketing}} {{literature has}} focused {{to a large}} extent on the effect of <b>bundle</b> characteristics on a consumer's decision to buy a (fixed) <b>bundle</b> in a non-competitive setting. This study extends this narrow focus in four major ways. First, the authors address <b>bundles</b> that are customizable. Second, they distinguish between a consumer's decision of whether to <b>bundle</b> (<b>bundle</b> choice) and the decision of how many goods or services to include in a <b>bundle</b> (<b>bundle</b> size). Third, they extend the focus on <b>bundle</b> characteristics towards the impact of consumer and supplier characteristics on both <b>bundle</b> choice and <b>bundle</b> size. Fourth, they do so in a competitive context. They find that <b>bundle,</b> consumer and supplier characteristics differentially influence <b>bundle</b> choice and <b>bundle</b> size decisions. For instance, consumer socio-demographics were found to significantly affect the decision to obtain a <b>bundle,</b> but had no significant effect on the preferred size of the <b>bundle.</b> Further it was found that heavy users prefer to <b>bundle</b> fewer services compared to light users. This study has important managerial implications towards a successful <b>bundling</b> strategy.
