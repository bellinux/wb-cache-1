5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. <b>Because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people have been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E

25|$|Foods like seitan, tofu skin, meat {{alternatives}} {{made from}} seaweeds, root vegetable starch and, tofu, originate in China and became popularized <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people periodically abstain from meat. In China, {{one can find}} an eggless vegetarian substitute for items ranging from seafood to ham. Also, the Thai (เจ) and Vietnamese (chay) terms for vegetarianism originate from the Chinese term for a lenten diet.|$|E

25|$|Andy Goodway was {{appointed}} Great Britain coach in 1997. At {{the end of}} that year Great Britain played a home three-Test series against the Australian Super League and lost 2–1. Despite the series being given official test status, these games are not widely regarded as a genuine Ashes series <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> Australian stars were again missing. The continuing Super League war meant that the 1998 Kangaroo Tour was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Proctor's {{nomenclature}} {{has often}} been criticized, mainly <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of his names honored English astronomers, but also because he used many names more than once. In particular, Dawes appeared no fewer than six times (Dawes Ocean, Dawes Continent, Dawes Sea, Dawes Strait, Dawes Isle, and Dawes Forked Bay). Even so, Proctor's names are not without charm, and for all their shortcomings they were a foundation on which later astronomers would improve.|$|E
25|$|When a {{group member}} {{does not feel}} that his/her effort is {{justified}} {{in the context of}} the overall group, the individual will be less willing to assert the effort.

25|$|The {{reported}} {{increase is}} largely attributable {{to changes in}} diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness. A widely cited 2002 pilot study concluded that the observed increase in autism in California cannot be explained by changes in diagnostic criteria, but a 2006 analysis found that special education data poorly measured prevalence <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> cases were undiagnosed, and that the 1994–2003 U.S. increase was associated with declines in other diagnostic categories, indicating that diagnostic substitution had occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{families}} {{are sorted into}} a somewhat novel sequence unlike that in older works, where e.g. Corvidae are placed last. This is <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> reallocations have taken place since about 2005 that a definite taxonomy has not been established yet, although the phylogeny is by and large resolved. The present sequence {{is an attempt to}} preserve as much of the traditional sequence while giving priority to adequately addressing the phylogenetic relationships between the families.

25|$|Logic and the {{philosophy}} of language are closely related. Philosophy of language {{has to do with}} the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.|$|E

25|$|A site in Southampton, England {{claims to}} be the oldest lawn bowling site still in operation, with records showing the game has been played on the green there since 1299. The first written {{reference}} to bowling dates to 1366, when King Edward III of England banned his troops from playing it so that they could focus more on their archery practice. It is believed that King Henry VIII bowled using cannonballs. Henry VIII also famously banned bowling for all but the upper classes, <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> working men and soldiers were neglecting their trades.|$|E
25|$|They {{were also}} {{famous for their}} love of nightlife, which {{attracted}} a lot of criticism, especially <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of them had international duties with France. All this contributed {{to the image of}} Racing Club as an eccentric institution, but these players have also been seen as trail blazers for Stade Français's president Max Guazzini, who a few years later, took up the provocative (such as the use of the pink colour) and imaginative spirit to boost his club's image and shake off the conservative traditionalism of French rugby.|$|E

Firstly <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people are being killed, but even more so seeing all their arsenal, logistics and soldiers in the area.” This opposition stems from the civilian deaths caused by the Force Intervention Brigade, as well as the failure of the Brigade to eliminate most rebel groups despite long term presence in the region.|$|E

25|$|George Gaylord Simpson was {{responsible}} for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with paleontology in his 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution. Simpson's work was crucial <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> paleontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, {{with the idea that}} natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the evolution of the horse) that earlier paleontologists had used as support for neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the fossil record was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.|$|E
25|$|GIS {{offers a}} {{superior}} method for landslide analysis {{because it allows}} one to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively. <b>Because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> variables are involved, {{it is important to}} be able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the Earth's surface. Researchers need to know which variables are the most important factors that trigger landslides in any given location. Using GIS, extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential to save lives, property, and money.|$|E
