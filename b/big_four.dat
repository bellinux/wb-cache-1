5|$|Since 2010, {{when the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> {{increasingly}} began {{to dominate the}} tour as a group, most articles and reports concentrate solely on {{the members of the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> and their chances in upcoming tournaments or how the previous one has affected them, with smaller sections {{on the rest of the}} players.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> is generally seen {{to have had a}} positive impact on tennis, making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention. However, with all four members being from European countries, this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America. It has also been argued that the dominance of the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> has made the game predictable or even boring.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} rivalries {{between the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> {{are considered to}} be some of the greatest of all time.

5|$|After {{unsuccessful}} litigation to {{stop the}} project, the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. The Indiana Department of Transportation pledged $1million for the project to build a ramp to the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8million, but was likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp was expected to cost $4million; the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> Bridge was expected to cost $3million and take 18months. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the Spring Street Freight House. However, the mayor of Jeffersonville, Tom Galligan, called for a redesign of the entrance ramp to the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that {{the building of the}} column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the United States Coast Guard nor the Army Corps of Engineers had approved of the planned rampway. Galligan said he would rather have a ramp that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and off the bridge. Previous plans to access the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> Bridge included building an elevator.|$|E
5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the <b>Big</b> <b>Four</b> have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E
