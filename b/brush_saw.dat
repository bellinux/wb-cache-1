40|$|Results of precommercial {{thinning}} (cleaning) by <b>brush</b> <b>saw</b> {{and by a}} machine-mounted device, {{consisting of}} a hydraulically-driven heavy disc with two short steel flails mounted in a journal bearing, are presented. Plots were laid out in middle and south Sweden in 1983, some being observed annually until 1989. There were {{significant differences between the}} two methods as regards the number of sprouts on European aspen (Populus tremula L.) and birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.) stumps six years after cleaning. Plots cleaned by machine had a larger number of birch or aspen sprouts, than plots cleaned by <b>brush</b> <b>saw.</b> Mean height of stumps was significantly greater on plots cleaned by machine. Stumps cleaned by machine under snow conditions were 30 - 70 cm high. There were no significant differences in the number of sprouts or in the height of sprouts, between high and low stumps. Cleaning by machine damaged 7 - 13 per cent of conifers classified as main stems, as compared to no damage caused by <b>brush</b> <b>saw</b> cleaning. Practical recommendations are given: cleaning by machine under a snow cover is not recommended in most cases...|$|E

40|$|After the {{mandatory}} rules for clearing was removed in 1994, the clearing area {{has increased in}} Sweden. After the storms Gudrun and Per, the areas became planted with new plants, mainly spruce, but also other tree species. Storm areas are now being invaded by naturally rejuvenated birch in the tilling tracks. Since the birch often is initially growing faster than the spruce it is inhibiting the growth and is also damaging the spruce. The purpose of this thesis is to study the new <b>brush</b> <b>saw</b> with chain and compare it with the conventional clearing saw, mainly in terms of performance and ergonomics.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{relative}} pre-commercial thinning costs have increased, {{as a proportion of}} total silvicultural costs, and the annual area treated with pre-commercial thinning has decreased, partly because stands are denser and the development of tools has been slow compared to advances in tools for other forestry measures, calling for new methods and techniques to be developed. Reducing competition by topping secondary stems might be an attractive alternative to traditional pre-commercial thinning for biological, technical and financial reasons. However, the topped secondary stems must not overtop the main stems and should not present obstacles {{at the time of the}} first commercial thinning. Topping, i. e. top-cutting or top-breaking of secondary stems, was tested in birch (Betula sp.) stands with the background that increased competition from topped secondary stems may promote higher quality in the main stems and that topped secondary stems might die and disappear by the time of the first commercial thinning as a result of treatment. Furthermore, growth of the topped birch stems was studied after treatment in different seasons. Motor-manual equipment for topping and a mechanised prototype were tested in an experimental rig and the mechanised prototype was also tested in a field experiment. All tools were compared with a conventional <b>brush</b> <b>saw,</b> regarding both time requirements and quality of work. Results indicated that topping, especially at a higher level above ground leading to a smaller height lead for the main stems, gave a significant increase in main stem quality of birch, compared to traditional pre-commercial thinning. Secondary stems showed higher survival after topping compared to traditional pre-commercial thinning, but topping at a lower level above ground gave lower survival than topping at a higher level. No differences in growth or survival were detected between top-cut and top-broken stems over three years and survival and height growth was lower for stems treated in a growing condition compared to stems treated earlier in the year. Despite having a significantly less powerful engine, a motor-manual pole saw prototype designed to be used for topping was a competitive alternative to the <b>brush</b> <b>saw</b> in terms of both time consumption and damage to the residual stand. The mechanised prototype seemed to be a competitive alternative in high diameter and dense stands. Although the quality of work obtained with the mechanised prototype was equally high to the quality obtained with the <b>brush</b> <b>saw,</b> the results regarding time requirements for the mechanised prototype from the experimental study could not be verified in field experiments, resulting in a faster operation under field conditions with the <b>brush</b> <b>saw</b> irrespective of type of stand. It was also concluded that current standards for time requirements for brush saws might need to be revised, and that the height/diameter ratio might have an important influence on the time requirements for both motor-manual and mechanised pre-commercial thinning tools. Topping seemed to be an attractive alternative to traditional pre-commercial thinning. However, further studies with varying initial and remaining stand density, stand height, species composition and tests of other possible advantages, e. g. reduced browsing pressure on main stems and reduced time requirements for mechanised tools when the cutting height can be raised above obstacles, should be performed. Tools for topping could be developed that would give equal or better results with respect to both quality and costs compared to the traditional <b>brush</b> <b>saw.</b> Mechanised equipment for pre-commercial thinning that can give acceptable results in terms of quality of work are available, but further development is needed in order to lower time requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} how to reduce the high, and every decade raising, pre-clearance cost.

The study compares the economic results from thinning of four parcels each treated differently regarding harsh or light pre-clearance and extraction of only pulpwood, or both pulpwood and fuel wood. In this type of spruce stand the study indicates that a lighter pre-clearance, followed up with both pulpwood and a fuel wood extraction, has a much better economy than the traditional method of hard pre-clearance and only pulpwood extraction...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of shoot development in deciduous trees after cleaning of railway verges was carried out during the period 1999 - 2001. The trials were located in Långsele (Västernorrland County), Garsås (Dalarna County), Herrljunga (Västra Götaland County) and Tockarp (Skåne County). The methods of cleaning compared in the study were: motor-manual cleaning with normal stump height; motor-manual cleaning with low stump height; mechanical cleaning with a chain cutter once; mechanical cleaning with chain cutter annual three times (1999, 2000, 2001) and mechanical cleaning with a blade cutter. Cleaning operations were carried out April-June, 1999 - 2001. Tree species {{included in the study}} were pubescent birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh), pendula birch (Betula pendula Roth), aspen (Populus tremula L.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.). Shoot density, shoot height and shoot diameter were estimated before cleaning. The effects of cleaning were evaluated by calculating annually for three years: the number of living stumps per m 2, the number of shoots per stump and the height of the shoots. The study had two objectives, namely to evaluate the biological effects of various vegetation cleaning methods and to act as a demonstration project for the Swedish Rail Authority and the Swedish Roads Authority, who commissioned the work. There were differences in stump height after cleaning using the different methods. In the four trials, stump height was 2 - 25 cm after mechanical cleaning with a chain cutter. After repeated mechanical cleaning of pubescent birch on peat soil (Herrljunga) with a chain cutter to leave 2 cm high stumps, there was a greater {{reduction in the number of}} shoots and a smaller number of living stumps compared with the other cleaning methods. The reason for this was that greater numbers of the stumps were totally destroyed or that higher placed sprouts were cut away. After repeated cleaning of clumps with several generations of stumps, there was also a tendency for the number of main stumps with sprouts to be reduced. After a single cleaning of birch, the choice of cleaning method had no effect on sprout development. The number and length of aspen suckers decreased after repeated mechanical cleaning in Långsele and a similar trend was observed in Tockarp. Grasses and herbaceous vegetation grew quickly and inhibited sucker development, particularly in Långsele. Aspen is very susceptible to fungal attack after repeated grazing and cleaning, which may explain this result. Goat willow was included in the study and was favoured in areas which had drainage water in the ditch below the railway embankment. Access on sloping embankments was often poor, which resulted in the stump height after mechanical cleaning being two to three times higher than on flat ground. In the Herrljunga trial, willow had many high placed spruts on the stump. Repeated cleaning or grazing gave rise to a bushy thicket. It could be seen in a number of sites that willow was particularly attractive to wild animals. Motor-manual cleaning with low stump height (average 8 - 18 cm) left a smaller number of uncleaned fast-growing sprouts remaining on the stump than mechanical cleaning with normal stump height (average 15 - 20 cm). It is easier to cut the main stump under a wide clump with a mechanical chain cutter than with a <b>brush</b> <b>saw.</b> The view from the track is affected by the density of the thicket (stems) and its maximum height. After three years growth in Garsås, the average height of the highest shoots per birch stump was 112 cm and the sprout (stem) density was 18. 2 sprouts per m 2. After seven years, the corresponding sprout height and density were 441 cm and 2. 9 sprouts per m 2. There were differences in height between treatments. Differences in shoot height were a result of the tree species, the site and the position in the country. Mechanical cleaning with a cutter chain thrashes the thicket apart completely. However, when the thicket is cut with a mechanical circular saw or by motor-manual cleaning, the cut brushwood can be collected. In Garsås, the production of birch biomass in track areas which were not cleared for seven years was 22 tonnes d. w. (dry weight) per ha along a kilometre of track with a 5 metre strip on each side. On the Herrljunga trial on peat soil, the total biomass production on a similar area with less dense thicket was 5. 6 tonnes d. w. per ha from six-year old sprouts of pubescent birch. The corresponding production from six-year aspen suckers was 6. 2 tonnes d. w. per ha in Långsele and 9. 7 tonnes d. w. per ha in Tockarp. The removal of the biomass probably prevented embankments being set on fire and reduced the green manure effect. There is also the advantage that the woody biomass removed can be utilised as a mulch or as a biofuel. Selective motor-manual cleaning of previously identified tree specimens was also included in the study. Two variants of selective motor-manual cleaning were tested, either sparing selected specimens or cleaning half the normal treatment area. Specimens that were spared were located at appropriate safety distances from the tracks and often had characteristic growth patterns and attractive flowering. Selective cleaning was carried out at all four sites, but was more successful in open landscape (Tockarp, Långsele) where the light allowed in helped to stimulate the undergrowth, which competed with suckers and stump sprouts from cleared trees. The effects of shoot formation and growth after different forms of repeated cleaning should be investigated further under more controlled conditions. The practicality and cost of selective mechanical cleaning should also be investigated...|$|E

40|$|A thirteen-year {{prospective}} {{study has been}} conducted of an open cohort o f forestry workers, who operate low-vibration power tools in the Suomussalmi region of Finland. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report the changes in vibrotactile perception thresholds (VPTs) observed at the fingertips of a subgroup of workers who reported for a required annual medical examination on three occasions (in 1990, 1995, and 2003), when a sensitive tactometer was available to record their thresholds. The same apparatus was used for the first and third evaluation, and a production prototype with equivalent performance was used for the second. The apparatus has been described elsewhere (Brammer and Piercy, 1991; Brammer et al., 2007), and fulfills the requirements of ISO 13091 - 1 : 2001 (method A). During the study, the work practices changed. In 1999, mechanized tree harvesting was introduced into the area, and <b>brush</b> <b>saws</b> were substituted for chain saws for much of the manual work.

40|$|Lint {{cleaners}} at cotton gins {{improve the}} grade and {{market value of}} cotton, but excessive cleaning can reduce bale values and some quality factors. Textile mills prefer that ginned lint be cleaned at gins with only one saw-type lint cleaner, but many gins use two stages of saw lint cleaning to obtain higher grades. Experiments were conducted to study the characteristics and efficiency of flow-through air-type lint cleaners operating under commercial gin conditions. Comparisons were also made to a controlled-batt saw-type lint cleaner that followed the air-type lint cleaner. One air-type lint cleaner was only 25 % as effective at cleaning {{as one of the}} saw-type lint cleaners. However, the air-type cleaners caused less fiber damage than the saw-type lint cleaners. Information from the field study will be used to (i) advise cotton ginners on the proper use of air-type lint cleaners and (ii) plan new studies to develop air-type lint cleaners that better supplement lint cleaning with only one saw-cylinder cleaner and ensure acceptable market return. Experiments were conducted at three commercial gins to study the characteristics and efficiency of flow-through air-type lint cleaners operating under standard field conditions. Overall, one air lint cleaner gave a cleaning efficiency of 9 % compared to 36 % for one saw lint cleaner following an air lint cleaner. However, the air-type cleaners caused less fiber damage than the saw-type cleaners. Although textile mills prefer that ginned lint be cleaned at gins with only one saw-type lint cleaner, many gins use two stages of saw lint cleaning to obtain higher grades. An air-type lint cleaner can be substituted for one of the gin’s usual saw machines. These results, however, indicate that air-type cleaners need to be improved to better supplement lint cleaning with only one saw-cylinder lint cleaner to ensure acceptable grades and market return.

40|$|Exposure to fine {{particles}} and noise {{has been linked}} to cardiovascular diseases and elevated cardiovascular mortality affecting the worldwide population. Residence and/or work in proximity to emission sources as for example road traffic leads to an elevated exposure and a higher risk for adverse health effects. Highway maintenance workers spend most of their work time in traffic and are exposed regularly to particles and noise. The aims of this thesis were to provide {{a better understanding of the}} workers' mixed exposure to particles and noise and to assess cardiopulmonary short term health effects in relation to this exposure. Exposure and health data were collected in collaboration with 8 maintenance centers of the Swiss Road Maintenance Services located in the cantons Bern, Fribourg and Vaud in western Switzerland. Repeated measurements with 18 subjects were conducted during 50 non-consecutive work shifts between Mai 2010 and February 2012, equally distributed over all seasons. In the first part of this thesis we tested and validated measurements of ultra{{fine particles}} with a miniature diffusion size classifier (miniDiSC) - a novel particle counting device that was used for the exposure assessment during highway maintenance work. We found that particle numbers and average particle size measured by the miniDiSC were highly correlated with data from the P-TRAK, a condensation particle counter (CPC), as well as from a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). However, the miniDiSC measured significantly more particles than the P-TRAK and significantly less than the SMPS in its full size range. Our data suggests that the instrument specific cutoffs were the main reason for the different particle counts. The first main objective of this thesis was to investigate the exposure of highway maintenance workers to air pollutants and noise, in relation to the different maintenance activities. We have seen that the workers are regularly exposed to high particle and noise levels. This was a consequence of close proximity to highway traffic and the use of motorized working equipment such as <b>brush</b> cutters, chain <b>saws,</b> generators and pneumatic hammers during which the highest exposure levels occurred. Although exposure to air pollutants were not critical if compared to occupational exposure limits, the elevated exposure to particles and noise may lead to a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases in this worker population. The second main objective was to investigate cardiopulmonary short-term health effects in relation to the particle and noise exposure during highway maintenance work. We observed a PM 2. 5 related increase of the acute-phase inflammation markers C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A and a decrease of TNFa. Heart rate variability increased as a consequence of particle as well as noise exposure. Increased high frequency power indicated a stronger parasympathetic influence on the heart. Elevated noise levels during recreational time, after work, were related to increased blood pressure. Our data confirmed that highway maintenance workers are exposed to elevated levels of particles and noise as compared to the average population. This exposure poses a cardiovascular health risk and it is therefore important to make efforts to better protect the workers health. The use of cleaner machines during maintenance work would be a major step to improve the workers' situation. Furthermore, regulatory policies with the aim of reducing combustion and non-combustion emissions from road traffic are important for the protection of workers in traffic environments and the entire population...|$|R

[...] My reason, to my doubt, replied, As if a book were opened wide, And at a certain page I traced Every record undefaced, Added by {{successive}} years,-- The harvestings of truth's stray ears Singly gleaned, and in one sheaf Bound together for belief. Yes, I said--that he will go And sit with these in turn, I know. Their faith's heart beats, though her head swims Too giddily to guide her limbs, Disabled by their palsy-stroke From propping mine. Though Rome's gross yoke Drops off, no more to be endured, Her teaching is not so obscured By errors and perversities, That no truth shines athwart the lies: And he, whose eye detects a spark Even where, to man's, the whole seems dark, May well see flame where each beholder Acknowledges the embers smoulder. But I, a mere man, fear to quit The clue God gave me as most fit To guide my footsteps through life's maze, Because himself discerns all ways Open to reach him: I, a man Able to mark where faith began To swerve aside, till from its summit Judgment drops her damning plummet, Pronouncing such a fatal space Departed from the founder's base: He will not bid me enter too, But rather sit, as now I do, Awaiting his return outside. --'Twas thus my reason straight replied And joyously I turned, and pressed The garment's skirt upon my breast, Until, afresh its light suffusing me, My heart cried--What has been abusing me That I should wait here lonely and coldly, Instead of rising, entering boldly, Baring truth's face, and letting drift Her veils of lies as they choose to shift? Do these men praise him? I will raise My voice up to their point of praise! I see the error; but above The scope of error, see the love.-- Oh, love of those first Christian days! --Fanned so soon into a blaze, From the spark preserved by the trampled sect, That the antique sovereign Intellect Which then sat ruling in the world, Like a change in dreams, was hurled From the throne he reigned upon: You looked up and he was gone. Gone, his glory of the pen! --Love, with Greece and Rome in ken, Bade her scribes abhor the trick Of poetry and rhetoric, And exult with hearts set free, In blessed imbecility Scrawled, perchance, on some torn sheet Leaving Sallust incomplete Gone, his pride of sculptor, painter! --Love, while able to acquaint her While the thousand statues yet Fresh from chisel, pictures wet From <b>brush,</b> she <b>saw</b> on every side, Chose rather with an infant's pride To frame those portents which impart Such unction to true Christian Art. Gone, music too! The air was stirred By happy wings: Terpander's* bird *[Footnote: Terpander, a famous Lesbian musician and lyric poet, 670 B.C.] (That, when the cold came, fled away) Would tarry not the wintry day,-- As more-enduring sculpture must, Till filthy saints rebuked the gust With which they chanced to get a sight Of some dear naked Aphrodite They glanced a thought above the toes of, By breaking zealously her nose off. Love, surely, from that music's lingering, Might have filched her organ-fingering, Nor chosen rather to set prayings To hog-grunts, praises to horse-neighings. Love was the startling thing, the new: Love was the all-sufficient too; And seeing that, you see the rest: As a babe can find its mother's breast As well in darkness as in light, Love shut our eyes, and all seemed right. True, the world's eyes are open now: --Less need for me to disallow Some few that keep Love's zone unbuckled, Peevish as ever to be suckled, Lulled by the same old baby-prattle With intermixture of the rattle, When she would have them creep, stand steady Upon their feet, or walk already, Not to speak of trying to climb. I will be wise another time, And not desire a wall between us, [...] When next I see a church-roof cover So many species of one genus, [...] All with foreheads bearing lover Written above the earnest eyes of them; [...] All with breasts that beat for beauty, Whether sublimed, {{to the surprise of}} them, [...] In noble daring, steadfast duty, The heroic in passion, or in action,-- Or, lowered for sense's satisfaction, To the mere outside of human creatures, Mere perfect form and faultless features. What? with all Rome here, whence to levy [...] Such contributions to their appetite, With women and men in a gorgeous bevy, [...] They take, as it were, a padlock, clap it tight On their southern eyes, restrained from [...] feeding On the glories of their ancient reading, On the beauties of their modern singing, On the wonders of the builder's bringing, On the majesties of Art around them,-- [...] And, all these loves, late struggling incessant, When faith has at last united and bound them, [...] They offer up to God for a present? Why, I will, on the whole, be rather proud of it,-- [...] And, only taking the act in reference To the other recipients who might have allowed it, [...] I will rejoice that God had the preference.|$|R
