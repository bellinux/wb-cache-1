5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake <b>bread</b> <b>on</b> Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of <b>bread</b> <b>on</b> the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|Fisher saw {{the need}} to improve the range, {{accuracy}} and rate of fire of naval gunnery, and was an early proponent of the use of the torpedo, which he believed would supersede big guns for use against ships. As Controller, he introduced torpedo boat destroyers as a class of ship intended for defence against attack from torpedo boats or submarines. As First Sea Lord, he was responsible for the construction of , the first all-big-gun battleship, but he also believed that submarines would become increasingly important and urged their development. He was involved with the introduction of turbine engines to replace reciprocating engines, and the introduction of oil fuelling to replace coal. He introduced daily baked <b>bread</b> <b>on</b> board ships, whereas when he entered the service it was customary to eat hard biscuits, frequently infested by biscuit weevils.|$|E
25|$|The Villa del Pastore {{dates from}} between the eighth century BC and 79 AD. It {{is divided into two}} parts: a large outdoor area and a series of {{residential}} rooms. The garden area is bordered to the south by the semicircular wall, while on the north is a 140m long cryptoporticus which runs parallel to a colonnade on a slightly lower level. At the centre of the garden is a swimming pool (natatio) with marble staircase. In the centre of the semicircular alcove was found the statue that gives the villa its name, of marble, 65cm tall in Hellenistic style and is an old shepherd dressed in hides, carrying on his shoulders a kid, with a basket with grapes and <b>bread</b> <b>on</b> his left hand while in the right hand is a hare. Also in the garden to the south west is a porch 10x2m portico paved with black and white mosaic. Also a small square nympheum was found in the centre of which was placed a marble labrum.|$|E

500|$|On 23June 1916, Dallas took {{delivery}} of the newest RNAS fighter, Sopwith Triplane #N500. This was the original prototype, having undergone Admiralty trials before being shipped to France. Though still only a test plane, it was flown into combat 15minutes after its arrival. Dallas named it Brown Bread, {{and it was the}} first of a series of 'Tripes' that he would fly and fight in over the next year. He achieved his first victory with Brown <b>Bread</b> <b>on</b> 1July, the same day he was promoted to flight lieutenant. Three days later, he was recommended for further promotion. He scored his last Nieuport-mounted 'kill' on 9July, earning the Croix de guerre and a mention in despatches for coming to the aid of a French Maurice Farman biplane. On 7September 1916, Dallas was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, [...] "for the specially gallant manner in which he has carried out his duties" [...] since first seeing action in December 1915. By the end of the year he was among the earliest RNAS aces, with eight confirmed and four unconfirmed victories, and had been raised to the rank of flight commander.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor {{packaging}} {{a loaf of bread}} for his uncle, the [...] "village wit", – who ironically nicknames him [...] "Beaut" [...] because of his off-putting appearance – in his mother Nance's Coal Creek bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father [...] "Cracked" [...] McGregor). [...] Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting <b>bread</b> <b>on</b> credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work and the young man gets a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a teetotaler up to that point) blind drunk with a [...] "horrible mess" [...] made just for that purpose. Having reached a breaking point, Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the 1893 World's Fair. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely milliner/shop owner, with whom he develops a platonic relationship.|$|E

The priest then turned them over and placed them into the hands of a second priest, who waived them. Noting further that [...] says that [...] "they put the fat upon the breasts," [...] the Gemara deduced that this second priest then handed the parts over to a third priest, who burned them. The Gemara thus concluded that these verses taught that three priests were required for this part of the service, giving effect to the teaching of [...] "In the multitude of people is the king's glory." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop jackfruit-based high fiber bread by utilizing jackfruit rind flour in bread formulation, and to characterize physical properties of produced high fibre bread. Jack fruit rind pieces were undergone few soaking and washing steps prior to get dried and milled. Obtained Jackfruit rind flour (JRF) was incorporated into wheat flour (WF) in three different ratio (5, 10 and 15 %) to produce partially substituted wheat flour (WF) with JRF. Allbread samples including <b>bread</b> sample based <b>on</b> WF [BC (as control) ], <b>bread</b> based <b>on</b> WF substituted with 5 % JRF (B 5 JRF), <b>bread</b> based <b>on</b> WF substituted with 10 % JRF (B 10 JRF) and <b>bread</b> based <b>on</b> WF substituted with 15 % JRF (B 15 JRF) were undergone proximate and physical analysis. The incorporation of JRFcaused significant influence <b>on</b> <b>bread</b> volume and texture attributes. Increasing the level of JRF incorporated into WF caused an increase in hardness and darkness of bread samples, and decrease in their volume compared to the control. Bread samples substituted with 5 % JRF had the highest mean scores of overall acceptance...|$|R
