After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E

25|$|The AGC had a power-saving mode {{controlled}} by a standby allowed switch. This mode turned off the AGC power, except for the 2.048MHz clock and the scaler. The F17 signal from the scaler turned the AGC power and the AGC back on at 1.28 second intervals.

Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, {{continues}} alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him {{to wake up and}} eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water.

25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared and go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, {{it is a sign}} that the winter is not over yet. If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E

Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E

When his power was taken from him many years ago, it was broken up and scattered across Japan as 'Gifts'. His first attempt to retrieve them failed, and it took him so much energy to make her that he slept for a century. Upon awakening, he creates Pandora and sends her to Earth {{to do the job}} properly. She succeeds in Volume 3, defeating his previous Goddess and confronting him. Pandora plans to kill Zeus but realizes that without the Gifts and the power of chaos, Man has no will to live.

It started feeling like everything I was saying was the same. I just thought, I have nothing else to say. So I went to bed with that on my mind". After falling asleep, Millard woke up {{early in the morning and}} wrote several lines to the song in his journal before going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Several weeks later, he was searching through his journal and found the notes again; when he went to the band's studio, he showed the notes to his producer, Pete Kipley. The two finished the lyrics to the song in less than thirty minutes, and recorded the piano track the same night; they also brought in someone to compose a string track for the song. Millard wanted [...] "Word of God Speak" [...] to contain only piano, avoiding the big production that could assure the song success on the radio, as he felt the simple production would mirror the lyrics.|$|E

At 20:55, Crutchley left the southern group in Australia to attend the conference, leaving Captain Howard D. Bode of Chicago {{in charge of the}} southern group. Crutchley did not inform the commanders of the other cruiser groups of his absence, contributing further to the dissolution of command arrangements. Bode, awakened from sleep in his cabin, decided not to place his ship in the lead of the southern group of ships, the customary place for the senior ship, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> At the conference, Turner, Crutchley, and Vandegrift discussed the reports of the [...] "seaplane tender" [...] force reported by the Australian Hudson crew earlier that day. They decided {{it would not be a}} threat that night, because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action. Vandegrift said that he would need to inspect the transport unloading situation at Tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for the transport ships, and he departed at midnight to conduct the inspection. Crutchley elected not to return with Australia to the southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside the Guadalcanal transport anchorage, without informing the other Allied ship commanders of his intentions or location.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{effective}} method {{of reducing the}} risk of [...] SIDS is putting a child less than one year old on their <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Other measures include a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers, no loose bedding, a relatively cool sleeping environment, using a pacifier, and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke. Breastfeeding and immunization may also be preventive. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Evidence is not sufficient for the use of fans. Grief support for families affected by SIDS is important, as the death of the infant is sudden, without witnesses, and often associated with an investigation.|$|E
50|$|To {{enable the}} call records to be date stamped, the CMOS divider IC {{produces}} an interrupt pulse every 125 ms which activates the processor. The interrupt service routing updates the system clock and checks for any {{activity on the}} line. If there is none, the processor goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>SLEEP</b> mode. In this mode, the CPU consumes very little power thereby enabling the unit to be battery powered. In its quiescent state, Monolog consumes around 180 µA while the monitored telephone line is inactive, rising to a peak of about 6 mA during a call while the DTMF decoder is on during the first 20 to 30 seconds of a call.|$|R

2500|$|Altitude {{acclimatization}} is {{the process}} of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at higher elevations, in order to avoid altitude sickness. Once above approximately a pressure of most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the [...] "climb-high, sleep-low" [...] approach. For high-altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp, climb up to a higher camp (slowly), and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there, a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells. [...] Once the climber has acclimatized to a given altitude, the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations. The rule of thumb is to ascend no more than [...] per day <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> That is, one can climb from [...] (...) to [...] (...) in one day, but one should then descend <b>back</b> <b>to</b> [...] (...) <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> This process cannot safely be rushed, and this is why climbers need to spend days (or even weeks at times) acclimatizing before attempting to climb a high peak. Simulated altitude equipment such as altitude tents provide hypoxic (reduced oxygen) air, and are designed to allow partial pre-acclimation to high altitude, reducing the total time required on the mountain itself.|$|R
