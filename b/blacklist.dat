50|$|Since {{the legal}} settlements, Unite has {{continued}} seeking compensation for those denied work due to industry-wide <b>blacklisting,</b> compiling a dossier on contemporary <b>blacklisting.</b> This includes potential cases of <b>blacklisting</b> on major flagship projects, raising concerns that employment agencies may be operating their own <b>blacklists.</b> Unite {{has asked the}} ICO to re-open its <b>blacklisting</b> investigation.|$|R

5|$|<b>Blacklist</b> {{also has}} a {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode, where each mission can be accessed by talking with {{the crew of the}} Paladin. Crew members offer a variety of missions and requirements for completing them, and players play as Fisher or his colleague Briggs; both have the same abilities. The game has a total of 14 missions, with split-screen play supported. In addition to co-op and Spies vs. Mercs, <b>Blacklist</b> has other multiplayer modes including Uplink control, Team Deathmatch, and Extraction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blacklist</b> {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought <b>Blacklist</b> gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the <b>Blacklist,</b> and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the <b>Blacklist,</b> and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to blow up the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{effectiveness}} of phishing <b>blacklists.</b> We used 191 fresh phish that were less than 30 minutes old to conduct two tests on eight anti-phishing toolbars. We found that 63 % of the phishing campaigns in our dataset lasted less than two hours. <b>Blacklists</b> were ineffective when protecting users initially, as most of them caught less than 20 % of phish at hour zero. We also found that <b>blacklists</b> were updated at different speeds, and varied in coverage, as 47 % - 83 % of phish appeared on <b>blacklists</b> 12 hours from the initial test. We found that two tools using heuristics to complement <b>blacklists</b> caught significantly more phish initially than those using only <b>blacklists.</b> However, {{it took a long}} time for phish detected by heuristics to appear on <b>blacklists.</b> Finally, we tested the toolbars on a set of 15, 345 legitimate URLs for false positives, and did not find any instance of mislabeling for either <b>blacklists</b> or heuristics. We present these findings and discuss ways in which anti-phishing tools can be improved...|$|R
50|$|Password <b>blacklists</b> {{are very}} similar to {{username}} <b>blacklists</b> but typically contain significantly more entries than username <b>blacklists.</b> Password <b>blacklists</b> are applied to prevent users from choosing passwords that are easily guessed or are well known and could lead to unauthorized access by malicious parties. Password <b>blacklists</b> are deployed as an additional layer of security, usually in addition to a password policy, which sets the requirements of the password length and/or character complexity. This is because there are a significant number of password combinations that fulfill many password policies but are still easily guessed (i.e., Password123, Qwerty123).|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} copy the CD, the user may have {{to copy the}} disc on another {{computer}} (real or virtual), uninstall the <b>blacklisted</b> software or wait for an update of the <b>blacklisted</b> software, which will have a countermeasure to the game or music disc's own <b>blacklisting</b> countermeasure.|$|R

5|$|Ubisoft {{hoped that}} Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: <b>Blacklist</b> would sell {{at least five}} million copies. The game debuted at number two on the UK retail {{software}} sales chart in its first week of release, behind Saints Row IV. It was August's fourth-bestselling game in the United States. On October 16, 2013 Ubisoft announced that <b>Blacklist</b> had failed to meet sales expectations, and on November 13 {{it was announced that}} the game had sold two million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending {{to ask them}} to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a <b>blacklist</b> which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the <b>blacklist,</b> but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E
50|$|Since Mac OS X Snow Leopard, {{the system}} keeps two <b>blacklists</b> to {{identify}} known malware or insecure software. The <b>blacklists</b> are updated periodically. If the application is <b>blacklisted,</b> then File Quarantine will refuse {{to open it}} and recommend to the user to move it to trash.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Empirical {{studies on}} link <b>blacklisting</b> {{show that the}} {{delivery}} rate is very sensitive to the calibration of the <b>blacklisting</b> threshold. If the calibration is too restrictive (the threshold is too high), all neighbors get <b>blacklisted.</b> On the other hand, if the calibration is too loose (the threshold is too low), unreliable links get selected. This paper investigates <b>blacklisting</b> analytically using a model that accounts for the joint effect of the wireless channel (signal strength variance and coherence time) and the network (node density). The model, validated empirically with mote-class hardware, shows that <b>blacklisting</b> does not help if the wireless channel is stable or if the network is relatively sparse. In fact, <b>blacklisting</b> is most beneficial when the network is relatively dense and the channel is unstable with long coherence times. ...|$|R
5|$|Owing to {{its strong}} {{relation}} with Indonesia, the Philippines initially was cold on the issue. In fact, {{not only that}} it denied Jos√© Ramos-Horta entry in 1997 (when {{he was supposed to}} give a lecture to the University of the Philippines Diliman), then President-Fidel V. Ramos even included him in the immigration <b>blacklist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sam Fisher {{is leaving}} Andersen Air Force Base when a {{terrorist}} organization assaults the base, wounding Paladin Nine Security co-worker and best friend Victor Coste. Soon afterwards a faction known as the Engineers takes responsibility, announcing a series of attacks on the United States, the titular <b>Blacklist,</b> which will continue until the U.S. recalls its troops deployed abroad.|$|E
5|$|Splinter Cell: <b>Blacklist</b> was {{introduced}} at E3 2012's Microsoft {{press conference on}} June 4, 2012, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In February 2013, a Wii U version was rumored to be in development, and Ubisoft confirmed the report two months later. Originally scheduled for release in early 2013, the game was pushed back to August on January 16, 2013. On August 3, 2013, Ubisoft confirmed that the game had been declared gold, indicating that it was being prepared for duplication and release. Splinter Cell: <b>Blacklist</b> was released in North America on August 20 and in Europe three days later for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360.|$|E
40|$|Using {{ground truth}} sales data for over 40 K {{unlicensed}} prescription pharmaceuticals sites, we present an economic analysis of {{two aspects of}} domain abuse in the online counterfeit drug market. First, we characterize the nature of domains abused by affiliate spammers to monetize what is evidently an overwhelming demand for these drugs. We found that the most successful affiliates are agile in adapting to adversarial circumstances, and channel {{the full spectrum of}} domain abuse to advertise to customers. Second, we use contemporaneous <b>blacklisting</b> data to provide an economic analysis of the revenue impact of domain <b>blacklisting,</b> a technique whereby lists of ‚Äúknown bad ‚Äù registered domains are distributed and used to filter email spam. We found that <b>blacklisting</b> rapidly and effectively limited per-domain sales. Nevertheless, <b>blacklisted</b> domains continued to monetize, likely as a result of high demand, non-universal use of <b>blacklisting,</b> and delay in deployment. Finally, our results suggest that increasing the number of domains discovered and using <b>blacklists</b> to block access to spam domains could undermine profitability more than further improving the speed with which domains are added to <b>blacklists.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|The film {{reestablished}} {{the career}} of Martin Ritt, {{who had been on}} the <b>blacklist</b> for most of the decade for alleged associations with communists. Paul Newman's performance as Ben Quick brought him national fame, as well as the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival. During the production, Newman married co-star Joanne Woodward.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blacklist</b> again {{features}} Sam Fisher, {{a former}} Third Echelon Splinter Cell {{who is now}} the spymaster and commander of the newly installed Fourth Echelon. The game also sees the return of Fisher's old ally, Anna (Grim) Gr√≠msd√≥ttir, and new characters such as Isaac Briggs and Charlie Cole. Several supporting characters from Conviction reappear, including Victor Coste, Patricia Caldwell, and Andriy Kobin. There is also a cameo from former 3rd Echelon agents Archer and Kestrel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blacklist</b> pre-release {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive, despite criticism {{of its new}} voice actor. The game received generally positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, gameplay, combat, soundtrack and multiplayer mode. However, criticism was directed at its dated graphics, lack of challenge and ending. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release.|$|E

5|$|NBC {{bought the}} rights to The <b>Blacklist</b> from Sony Pictures Television in August 2012 and green-lit {{production}} in January 2013. Producers said that the casting process was difficult.
