25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> wear.|$|E

2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, the brake shims between the <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{thickness}} variation has many causes, {{but there are}} three primary mechanisms which contribute the most to the propagation of disc {{thickness variation}}s connected to uneven pad transfer. The first is improper selection of brake pads for a given application. Pads which are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking {{for the first time}} in cold weather, often are made of materials which decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is improper break in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc as a whole) every time the pads are changed on a vehicle. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is known as [...] "pad imprinting." [...] This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break-down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and actually is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the <b>brake</b> <b>pad.</b> This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.|$|E
