Hamilton and his older brother James Jr. (1753–1786) were <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock to Rachel Faucette, a married woman of half-British and half-French Huguenot descent, and James A. Hamilton, a Scotsman who was the fourth son of Laird Alexander Hamilton of Grange, Ayrshire. Speculation that Hamilton's mother was of mixed race, though persistent, is not substantiated by verifiable evidence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

5|$|During her tour to Europe, Eva Perón was {{featured}} in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's caption–"Eva Perón: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow"–was {{a reference to the}} name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> wedlock in Charlestown, Nevis. His Scottish-born father, James A. Hamilton, was {{the fourth}} son of Alexander Hamilton, laird of Grange, Ayrshire. His mother, born Rachel Faucette, was half-British and half-French Huguenot. Orphaned as a child by his mother's death and his father's abandonment, Hamilton was taken in by an older cousin and later by a prosperous {{merchant}} family. He was recognized for his intelligence and talent, and sponsored {{by a group of}} wealthy local men to travel to New York City to pursue his education. Hamilton attended King's College (now Columbia University), choosing to stay in the Thirteen Colonies to seek his fortune.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record of plants, did not begin with food; it was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation {{of the poor and}} uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E

Still another researcher, Adin Baber, claims that Nancy Hanks was the daughter of Abraham Hanks and Sarah Harper of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|On the Art of the Cinema is {{mandatory}} reading for North Korean students of literature. North Korean filmmakers must also study the work, or even memorize it. On the Art of the Cinema also influenced South Korea's minjung-oriented People's Cinema (MR: minjung yŏnghwa) movement that was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Gwangju Democratization Movement. The work's influence goes beyond Korea, too. Australian Anna Broinowski directed Aim High in Creation!, {{a movie about}} making a propaganda film abiding by Kim's instructions.

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story {{and moved on to}} another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Ranjang Pande, the {{youngest}} son of Damodar Pande, was stationed as a {{captain in the}} army in Kathmandu. He {{was aware of the}} disunity between Samrajya Laxmi and Bhimsen; and thus he had secretly expressed his loyalty to Samrajya Laxmi and had vowed to help her in bringing Bhimsen down for all the wrongs he had committed against his family. Factions in the Nepalese court had also started to develop around the rivalry between the two queens, with the Senior Queen supporting the Pandes, while the Junior Queen supporting the Thapas. About a month after Mathabar's return to Kathmandu, a child was <b>born</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> an adulterous relationship between him and his widowed sister-in-law. This news was spread all over the country by the Pandes, and the resulting public disgrace forced Mathabar to leave Kathmandu and reside in his ancestral home in Pipal Thok, Borlang, Gorkha. To save face, Bhimsen gave Mathabar the governorship of Gorkha.|$|E
