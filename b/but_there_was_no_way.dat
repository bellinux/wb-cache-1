One scenario he raised was that the Soviet bloc might break up; a sign of this happening would be the rise of unknown Mikhail Gorbachev through the party ranks. A CIA analyst said that the presentation was fine, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> the Soviet Union was going to break up in his lifetime or his children's lifetime.

In a well-organised formation, {{they might have been}} able to make a contribution, but to intervene in a ship-to-ship duel would be very dangerous. In theory, they could have taken advantage of the confusion to sail off after the stragglers of the convoy, but night had now fallen, and until the moon rose, they would not be able to see their prey. Also, it quickly became clear that Bonhomme Richard would need help. Therefore, they waited until they could be useful. About this time, the little schooner caught up with them, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to transfer the potentially very useful boarding team to Bonhomme Richard or Alliance.|$|E

500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at {{cocktail}} parties.

After watching Peterson's performance, Miller {{decided to become a}} pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. I knew right then that I would be a jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were what he had to work hardest on.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the music for}} the album, the band decided that the artwork needed to reflect the themes on the record, likening the change of image to a political campaign. Armstrong recalled, [...] "We wanted to be firing on all cylinders. [...] Everything from the aesthetic to the music to the look. [...] Just everything." [...] Green Day drew inspiration from Chinese communist propaganda art the band saw in art galleries on Melrose Avenue and recruited artist Chris Bilheimer, who had designed the art for the previous records Nimrod and International Superhits! to create the cover. The band aimed for the cover to be [...] "at once uniform and powerful". The album's artwork—"a Posada-stark print of a heart-shaped hand grenade gripped in a blood-soaked fist"—is representative of its political content. After listening to the new music on his computer, Bilheimer took note of the lyric [...] "And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade" [...] from [...] "She's a Rebel". Influenced by artist Saul Bass's poster for the 1955 drama film The Man with the Golden Arm, Bilheimer created an upstretched arm holding a red heart-shaped grenade. Although he felt that red is the [...] "most overused color in graphic design", {{he felt that the}} [...] "immediate" [...] qualities of the color deemed it appropriate for use on the cover. He explained, [...] "I'm sure there's psychological theories of it being the same color of blood and therefore has the powers of life and death... And as a designer I always feel it's kind of a cop-out, so I never used it before. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> you couldn't use it on this cover." ...|$|E

2500|$|By some accounts, the Hells Angels {{were hired}} as {{security}} by {{the management of}} the Rolling Stones, on the recommendation of the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane (who both had previously used the Angels for security at performances without incident), for $500 worth of beer. This story has been denied by some parties who were directly involved. According to the road manager of the Rolling Stones' 1969 US Tour Sam Cutler, [...] "the only agreement there ever was ... the Angels would make sure nobody tampered with the generators, but that was the extent of it. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> 'They're going to be the police force' or anything like that. That's all bollocks." [...] The deal was made at a meeting including Cutler, Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully, and Pete Knell, a member of the Hells Angels' San Francisco chapter. According to Cutler, the arrangement was that all the bands were supposed to share the $500 beer cost, [...] " [...] the person who paid it was me, and I never got it back, to this day." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> he would come with enough songs to fill {{out the rest of the}} record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
2500|$|Len Hutton {{had lost}} the toss five {{times in a row}} in 1953, but this time he won it and he became the first England captain to put Australia in to bat since 1911–12. He then watched his fielders drop 14 catches as Australia piled up 601/8 declared. Keith Andrew dropped Arthur Morris off Bedser on 0, {{allowing}} the Australian opener to make 153, adding 202 in 232 minutes for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (162). Alec Bedser had a rash all over his back, but bowled on regardless for 1/131 as another six catches were dropped off his bowling. His ungainly fielding led to him being barracked by the crowd, calling [...] "Old Man" [...] whenever he stopped the ball. Tyson – labouring under a 38-yard run up – went for 1/160 off 29 eight ball overs, but battered the batsmen with bouncers and bruised Morris on the arm several times. He also bowled short and fast at Ray Lindwall after the all-rounder had despatched him to the boundary on his way to 64 not out, which would have serious repercussions in the Second Test at Sydney. [...] "We dropped a considerable number of catches," [...] recalled wicket-keeper Keith Andrew. [...] "Nether were we the fittest team in the world. Compton broke a finger fielding on the first day and Alec Bedser was never well, as was proved when it was discovered that he had developed shingles. One or two of us also got a touch of the sun, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of getting away from the fact that 'catches win matches'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} cross-cut at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the cross-cut to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level. It worked well, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to get horses down to the lower levels, so tramming had to be done by hand. So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the cross-cut from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it. However work ceased in 1918 while it was still [...] short of the 120Fathom Level and no further work was done on it before the company went into liquidation in 1920.|$|E
