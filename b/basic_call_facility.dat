40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{in detail}} two possible scenarios for integrating the future mobile telecommunication system UMTS with the evolving broadband fixed telecommunication system BISDN. In the first scenario a mobile-specific access network is envisaged {{combined with a}} B-ISDN backbone network. The second scenario uses BISDN <b>basic</b> <b>call</b> <b>facilities</b> throughout the entire network, including the mobile access part. The two scenarios are described in detail and a comparison at functional level is made. This comparison is complemented by a performance study of a non-trivial handover procedure in a high-traffic public environment. I. Introduction UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) is currently being designed and standardized. It {{is intended to be}} a system capable of providing a diversity of services (up to 2 Mbit/s). In addition to multi-party and multimedia services, UMTS should integrate services as currently being offered by cordless, cellular, (dedicated) paging and private m [...] ...|$|R

Phase 1 gave the gsmSCF the ability to bar calls (release the call prior to connection), allow a call to continue unchanged, or to modify a limited number of call parameters before allowing it to continue. The gsmSCF could also monitor the status of a call for certain events (call connection and disconnection), and take appropriate action on being informed of the event. Phase 1 was defined as part of Release 96 in 1997.|$|R

Currently we see the two signaling protocol families H. 323 and SIP existing and further evolving simultaneously. For both, efforts are done to not only establish <b>basic</b> <b>calls</b> but to enable so called Supplementary Services. This is generally considered one precondition for replacing the functionality of existing conventional PBXs on top of a standard protocol. Nevertheless solutions that support more then just <b>basic</b> <b>call</b> scenarios are at the moment still often based on proprietary protocols or protocol extensions...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} a telephony {{system is the}} call control model on which it is based. It is noted that many call control models in the past, especially those in PSTN/ISDN networks follow centralized model. For such a model, typical is significant coupling of modules belonging to different services with the <b>basic</b> <b>call</b> control module which is aware of all active telephony features in the system. Although sometimes based on distributed model, VoIP call control models still manifest some of the listed problems of their predecessors. In this paper we present a fully distributed model which exhibits minimal coupling of modules belonging to different services and a simple <b>basic</b> <b>call</b> control module. The model is based on taxonomies of call control services which are presented in the paper. Also, the implementation of several typical services is described...|$|R
