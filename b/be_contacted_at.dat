50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, several {{tractors}} and small locomotives were built with friction-disk transmissions with an output disk rolling on the face of the input disk. For disks of identical diameter, the effective gear ratio could be varied from 1:1 when the point of <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the perimeter of the input disk, to infinity when the point of <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the center, to -1:1 when the point of <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the opposite extreme. The transmission on early Plymouth locomotives worked this way, while on tractors using friction disks, the range of reverse speeds was typically limited.|$|R
