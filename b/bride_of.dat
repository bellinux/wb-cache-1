5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{decision}} to put <b>Brides</b> <b>of</b> Destruction on hiatus, in 2006, former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns formed The Tracii Guns Band with former L.A. Guns members Paul Black and Nickey Alexander as well as <b>Brides</b> <b>of</b> Destruction live bassist Jeremy Guns. The group announced {{a tour of the}} US with plans to perform songs from L.A. Guns, <b>Brides</b> <b>of</b> Destruction and Tracii Guns' solo material as well as various cover songs. Previously, in 2005, Black released the demos, titled Black List, recorded during his time with L.A. Guns in the 80's.|$|R

5|$|James Whale (22 July 1889– 29 May 1957) was an English film {{director}}, theater {{director and}} actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including {{what is considered}} the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936). He became increasingly disenchanted with his association with horror, but many of his non-horror films have fallen into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In both instances, the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E
50|$|Waking the Dead {{was to be}} {{the final}} L.A. Guns album to feature founder and namesake member Tracii Guns, who would leave the band to form <b>Brides</b> <b>of</b> Destruction with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe. Adam played guitar and drums in the infancy stage <b>of</b> <b>Brides</b> <b>of</b> Destruction with Tracii and Sixx when the band was going by the name Cockstar, but chose to leave the new project and stay with L.A. Guns. Hamilton {{recommended}} hairdresser London LeGrand as the <b>Brides</b> <b>of</b> Destruction's lead singer; Sixx and Guns were fascinated with London's rockstar look and hired him for the position.|$|R

5|$|Wood meets Loretta King, whom {{he thinks}} has {{enough money to}} fund <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> the Atom and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Fuller as planned. Filming begins, but is halted when it is {{revealed}} that King is actually poor, and Wood has no money to continue production. Wood convinces meat packing industry tycoon Don McCoy to take over funding the film, who agrees {{as long as the}} film stars his son Tony as the leading man and the film ends with an explosion. The filming finishes with the title being changed to <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> the Monster, but Fuller breaks up with Wood after the wrap party because of his circle of friends, his work, and transvestism. Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his unemployment, but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into rehab, and Wood meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals to her his transvestism, which she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Lugosi was not {{prone to}} fits of swearing, {{particularly}} {{in front of}} women and did not perform his own water stunt in <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> the Monster. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus any reference to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep. Also, when Ed Wood talks to George Weiss about making I Changed My Sex!, Weiss mentions Chained Girls, implying that Chained Girls was made before Glen or Glenda, when in fact Chained Girls was made afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted smallpox from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not. Maria Theresa then forced her daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, to pray {{with her in the}} Imperial Crypt next to the unsealed tomb of Empress Maria Josepha. The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined <b>bride</b> <b>of</b> King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed herself for her daughter's death {{for the rest of her}} life because, at the time, the concept of an extended incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught smallpox from the body of the late empress.|$|E

5|$|Initially Lugosi and Jane Wyatt {{were set}} to star in the film. Universal also {{announced}} that Boris Karloff and Colin Clive, who had starred together in Frankenstein and <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein, would appear, and that Cesar Romero would play Dr. Garth. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Universal had sought Herbert Marshall {{for the role of}} Sandor, before casting Pichel. None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, {{in the form of a}} wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.|$|E
5|$|Marge's {{distinctive}} blue beehive hairstyle {{was inspired}} by a combination of the Bride's in <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, {{who was a member of}} the original cast of The Tracey Ullman Show, was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992. She was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in The Simpsons Movie. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1955, viewers {{were able}} to see {{first-hand}} what Perry did for a living before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his <b>bride</b> <b>of</b> six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E

5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Jr. {{was eager}} for James Whale, fresh from his great success with <b>Bride</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein, to direct Dracula's Daughter. Whale was idle, waiting for Irene Dunne to finish work on Magnificent Obsession {{so she could}} begin work on Whale's Show Boat. Wary of {{directing}} two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called The Hangover Murders. Whale argued that {{the same sort of}} audiences who went to horror films also went to mystery films and pointed to the hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Thin Man as evidence that a picture based on the novel would be a success. Laemmle agreed to buy the rights for $5,000, only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct Dracula's Daughter next.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his <b>bride</b> <b>of</b> five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E
