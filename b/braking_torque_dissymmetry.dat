40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque,</b> a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is to be equal to the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> In the case of normal braking, the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is smaller than the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is bigger than the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R
30|$|The {{predicted}} performance variables {{corresponding to}} maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> {{compared to those}} predicted at a conventional constant compression ratio (rc[*]=[*] 16.4) are displayed in Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Figure 10 shows that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> {{in the case of}} a constant compression ratio, changes between 281 and 252 N.m passing through a maximum of 295 N.m at about 1, 900 rpm. For the variable compression ratio, the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> is kept constant at its maximum value of 295 N.m over a speed ranging from 1, 500 to 2, 460 rpm by varying the compression ratio between 16.4 and 19.3. This means that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> increases by 5.4 % at 1, 500 rpm and 4.6 % at 2, 460 rpm. The shown variation trend in compression ratio urges that actual variation in compression ratio should be considered to increase the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> to its constant maximum value.|$|R
40|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> of a direct-{{injection}} {{diesel engine}} {{is known to}} plateau over a range of injection timings. Injection timing affects the engine?s ignition delay and the fractions of fuel which burn in premixed and diffusion modes. Therefore, the characteristics of combustion for swept injection timings along the maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> plateau are determined. The research is conducted by varying injection timing at constant engine speed and load while measuring engine emissions and in-cylinder pressure, revealing the premixed and diffusion burn fractions as well as important engine and exhaust design criteria such as maximum in-cylinder pressure and exhaust composition. These results are significant in diesel engine design because cheaper, lighter engines may be built if desired maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> may be produced with lower peak in-cylinder pressures. More critically, different emissions composition profiles exist for the desired maximum <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> which will allow designers to choose injection calibrations which favor some emissions over others. In fact, both favorable emissions and in-cylinder pressure criteria {{can be achieved by}} implementing more retarded timings along the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> plateau without losses in efficiency or power output...|$|R
40|$|Friction force {{oscillations}} {{caused by}} changing {{properties of the}} contact zone between brake disc and pad are well known from various applications. Resulting effects like brake judder are known phenomena in brake technologies and in the scope of various scientific work. A new measure to potentially reduce <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> oscillations is the active compensation {{with the use of}} the control system of a self-energizing hydraulic brake (SEHB). New in comparison to traditional disc brakes is the fact that the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> is measured by the pressure in an additional supporting cylinder. Thus, the brake system is able to work in <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> control mode. Within this paper a dynamic simulation model of the SEHB is shown and evaluated with measurement data achieved from a full scale test rig for railway applications. Based on the simulation model a pressure control strategy is developed to minimize <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> oscillations of lower frequencies. The control parameters of the simulation are transferred to the experimental setup. Finally, simulation and experimental results are compared. Future work will deal with the development of control strategies to additionally minimize <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> oscillations of the higher dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{advantages}} of the electric motor such as fast and precise torque response, the performance of the electric vehicle (EV) can be improved. During braking or driving on the cornering, the vehicle will over steer or under steer if a car turns by more or less than the amount commanded by the driver. To improve the stability of the small EV with four in-wheel motors, the differential regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> control is proposed. In this system, the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> at each wheel will be controlled individually based on the value of slip ratio. If the slip ratio is greater than the optimum value, the regenerative brake will turn off. In this situation, the electric motor will not produce the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> Conversely, if the slip ratio lower than the optimum value, the regenerative brake will turn on and the electric motor will generate the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> In the numerical analysis, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the road condition is set to an icy road on the left tire and dry asphalt on the right tire. From the simulation results, the differential regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> control can prevent the tire from lock-up and avoid the vehicle from skidding...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electroslag Remelting (ESR) {{technology}} is a main method of special metallurgy; and split pillar {{is one of the}} most important mechanical units of ESR. The split pillar works not only as the mother body of ESR cross arm, but also as the rotation driving device of the cross arm. Since the tremendous mass of the cross arm and electrodes, serious inertia torque generates when the split pillar rotates, which leads to motion instability and problems of angle location and even safety threatens. In this paper, based on virtual machine technology, dynamic research of the rotation process of the electroslag-remelting-furnace split pillar was proceeded; influences of driving torque applied on the split pillar was researched, as the driving torque being constant, anti-step and with <b>brake</b> <b>torque.</b> 3 D solid model of the split pillar and clamping device were established; main technical parameters were accomplished; and simulation research of the dynamic process was proceeded.

40|$|Eddy current brake (ECB) is an {{attractive}} contactless brake whereas it suffers from <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> attenuation when the rotating speed increases. To stabilize the ECB’s torque generation property, this paper introduces the concept of anti-magneto-motive force to develop the ECB model on the fundamental of magnetic circles. In the developed model, the eddy current demagnetization {{and the influence of}} temperature which make the <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> attenuation are clearly presented. Using the developed model of ECB, the external and internal characteristics of the ECB are simulated through programming by MATLAB.

40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} a part of a funded project between Saab automotive and Chalmers University of Technology. Within the organization the project is known as ‘EVBB project’ which stands for; ‘Electric Vehicle Blended Braking’. A blended brake control merges a regenerative brake system with a friction brake system. The aim is to get a better understanding regarding to what extent a regenerative brake system is capable of recovering energy and how it will affect vehicle stability and maneuverability. The variable torque and power limitations of the electric motor require a brake-by-wire system that can apply the remaining <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> to fulfill the total <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> demanded by the driver. Proper <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> proportioning and the working area of the electric motor are visualized by means of brake force distribution plots. Simulations are performed for a mild parallel hybrid electric vehicle with a separate axle drive train. The drive train has a 30 [kW] electric motor mounted on the rear axle. A two track model with electric power train has been developed. The simulation results are based on this 7 DOF planar vehicle model, meaning that any pitch and roll motion of the vehicle body is excluded. The vehicle model has a closed-loop torque control, enabling velocity tracking of driving cycles. The control of lateral dynamics by means of the steering input is open-loop. A method of ‘non-linear tyre force estimation’ by means of look-up tables, based upon Pacejka’s Magic Formulas, has been used. Simulation results of two proposed control strategies show that rear wheel regenerative braking is effective. A control that initially biases the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> to the rear axle is able to recuperate 90 % of the brake energy on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).
