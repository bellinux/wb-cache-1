5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved <b>by</b> <b>building</b> the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's {{economic}} health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching {{as far north as}} Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient <b>by</b> <b>building</b> a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.|$|E

5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed <b>by</b> <b>building</b> and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair. Many of the jobs in these industries were highly skilled.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British {{captured}} the fort in the Siege of Fort Mackinac, the first {{battle of the}} conflict, because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared.

In 1814, the Americans and British fought a second battle {{on the north side}} of the island. The American second-in-command, Major Andrew Holmes, was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island.|$|E

5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} <b>by</b> <b>building</b> oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for {{the oil and gas}} industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in {{the oil and gas industry}} and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena <b>by</b> <b>building</b> two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the other was tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E
5|$|His {{next project}} was to develop Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which became the world's largest shipyard.

5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved <b>by</b> <b>building</b> new bridges with sufficient headroom for boats and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a {{pressing}} need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified <b>by</b> <b>building</b> forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E
