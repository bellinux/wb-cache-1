5|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{offers a}} higher resolution image. In an electron microscope, a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> focused electrons {{interacts with the}} sample rather than a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, again {{using his}} {{knowledge}} of the cyclotron and inventing what are now known as time-of-flight techniques, Alvarez created a mono-energetic <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> thermal neutrons.

5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> electrons to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E

The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate, so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse.|$|E

This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E

5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
