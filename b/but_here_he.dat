5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
25|$|Where {{else should}} I die <b>but</b> <b>here?</b> <b>he</b> often declared. Yet in 2004 the police twice searched Sivaram's home, and various groups {{political}} parties {{such as the}} Jathika Hela Urumaya and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in Sri Lanka publicly threatened him as a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) activist and a terrorist sympathiser.|$|E
25|$|By 1992 he {{was racing}} in Formula 3000 for the Mike Earle's 3001 International {{team in a}} Reynard 92D Mugen, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> found the going much harder. In ten rounds he failed to qualify once, at Hockenheim, but when he did make it onto the grid he never reached higher than 21st. His first season was also marred by two {{accidents}} at Barcelona and Enna, although he became more reliable {{towards the end of}} the year, climaxing in an eighth-place finish at Magny-Cours.|$|E

25|$|In 1525 the Spanish crown {{appointed}} him {{governor of the}} autonomous territory of Pánuco on the Gulf Coast {{in what is now}} northeast Mexico, arriving to take up the appointment in May 1527. He traveled with Luís Ponce de Leon and arrived in Hispaniola in 1526, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> fell sick and did not arrive in Mexico until May 1527, immediately assuming his post. Cortés had already extended his reach into Pánuco, so that Guzmán's appointment was a direct challenge. His appointment was opposed by the Pro-Cortés faction of the struggle for power in early colonial Mexico, who viewed him as an outsider with no military experience. But he had the support of the Council of Indies and the Spanish Crown who saw him as a counterbalance to the figure of Cortés whose aspirations to power worried the King of Spain. Guzmán's appointment gave heart to Spanish conquerors who had not received what they considered sufficient rewards from Cortés's distribution of encomiendas and to Spanish settlers who had not participated in the conquest but saw their paths to position and wealth blocked by the Cortés faction.|$|E
500|$|Charles Wharton Stork commented in his 1917 {{anthology}} of Swedish verse that [...] "The anthologist finds little to pause over until {{he comes to}} the poetry of Karl Mikael Bellman (1740-1795), <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> must linger long." [...] Describing him as a [...] "master of improvisation", he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Not all {{reaction}} to Wagner was positive. For a time, German musical life {{divided into two}} factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of Johannes Brahms; the latter, {{with the support of}} the powerful critic Eduard Hanslick (of whom Beckmesser in Meistersinger is in part a caricature) championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations. They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the conservatories at Leipzig under Ignaz Moscheles and at Cologne under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller. Another Wagner detractor was the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan, who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner's Paris concert on 25 January 1860 at which Wagner conducted the overtures to Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser, the preludes to Lohengrin and Tristan und Isolde, and six other extracts from Tannhäuser and Lohengrin: [...] "I had imagined that I was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz... I do not like all the music of Berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects... <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> was imitated and caricatured... Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease." ...|$|E

50|$|His {{first job}} was as Scientific Officer to Merlewood Research Centre at Grange-over-Sands in Cumbria, <b>but</b> from <b>here</b> <b>he</b> moved in 1960 to begin lecturing at St Andrews University. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> was {{based at the}} Gatty Marine Laboratory with other {{luminaries}} such as Malcolm Burrows and Adrian Horridge.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> now, <b>here</b> <b>he</b> was, {{actually}} setting forth, {{and without}} a home to come back to! You see, he had {{made up his mind}} that no matter what happened, he wouldn't come back, after having given his house to Jimmy Skunk.|$|R

2500|$|During 1844, he {{published}} two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses {{just as he}} did in 1843, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the [...] "single individual" [...] who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for [...] "that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader" [...] The single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.|$|E

50|$|After Bohemond's {{successful}} landing, {{the emperor}} charged Kontostephanos with intercepting the Norman supply convoys, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> too <b>he</b> failed.

60|$|Flight! But {{why should}} Bosinney fly? A man fled {{when he was}} in danger of {{destroying}} hearth and home, when there were children, when he felt himself trampling down ideals, breaking something. <b>But</b> <b>here,</b> so <b>he</b> had heard, it was all broken to his hand.|$|R
