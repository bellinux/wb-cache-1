50|$|The most {{comprehensive}} wallpainting work {{was in fact}} {{carried out by the}} Elmelunde Master presenting a variety of scenes from the story of the Creation and the New Testament but also with illustrations of everyday activities such as ploughing and hunting. Between the paintings, margins with frills depicting flowers, plants and other ornaments can be seen. The figures all have sleepy faces, a characteristic of the Elmelund Master. Colours include <b>black,</b> <b>ochre,</b> caput mortuum, and cinnabar which has now faded to verdigris.|$|E
50|$|The {{new museum}} is {{dominated}} by a large copper roof with stylized masts that represent the actual height of Vasa when she was fully rigged. Parts of the building are covered in wooden panels painted in dark red, blue, tar <b>black,</b> <b>ochre</b> yellow and dark green. The interior is similarly decorated, with large sections of bare, unpainted concrete, including the entire ceiling. Inside the museum the ship {{can be seen from}} six levels, from her keel to {{the very top of the}} sterncastle. Around the ship are numerous exhibits and models portraying the construction, sinking, location and recovery of the ship. There are also exhibits that expand on the history of Sweden in the 17th century, providing background information for why the ship was built. A movie theatre shows a film in alternating languages on the recovery of the Vasa.|$|E
40|$|Current {{international}} printmaking {{practice has}} seen {{developments in the}} depiction of identity {{through the use of}} metaphor in personal narratives. This research explores the distinctive and defining qualities of social satirical modalities of expression using vernacular urban forms and motifs, combining visual elements not used previously to highlight and reflect upon the contradictory nature of identity and existence through the distinctive qualities of the printmaking medium. Through the use of <b>black,</b> <b>ochre</b> and terracotta inks, the aquatint etching A Native Feature delves into detritus {{within the context of the}} suburban landscape. It ameliorates the objects depicted, considered to be insignificant, so that they become metaphorical characters to reveal prevalent contradictions inherent in the complexity of human relationships, environmental policy, fundamentalist belief systems and the ethics of business and government. The significance of A Native Feature is evidenced by its acquisition by the Art Gallery of New South Wales and subsequent inclusion in the exhibition Contemporary Australian Prints – From the Collection. The work has also been shown by John Miller Gallery, Newcastle in the solo exhibition Recent Etchings...|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{analysis of}} this painting by the scientists at the National Gallery in London revealed {{the use of the}} following pigments by Rembrandt: lead white, bone <b>black,</b> charcoal <b>black,</b> <b>ochres</b> and vermilion.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} works in this series, the painting's palette is very diminished. In this case, <b>blacks,</b> <b>ochres,</b> grays and earth tones are applied with very free, {{energetic}} brushstrokes. The {{theme of the}} loss of identity in crowds in this painting {{can be seen as a}} precursor to expressionist painting, particularly the work of James Ensor.|$|R
50|$|As in {{the rest}} of the Black Paintings, Goya's use of his medium {{displays}} an assurance that comes only from a lifetime of experience. Paint is handled freely and rapidly yet with great decisiveness. The palette knife is also used to apply paint in some areas. <b>Blacks,</b> <b>ochres,</b> earth tones and grays are the only colors used, as {{in the rest}} of the black paintings.|$|R
50|$|Judith and Holofernes palette {{consists}} of <b>blacks,</b> <b>ochres</b> and red applied with very free, broad and energetic brushstrokes. The lighting is both focused and highly theatrical, {{and seems to}} imply a night scene lit by a torch, which illuminates Judiths face and outstretched arm and leaves in semidarkness {{the face of the}} old serving woman whose darkened outline is shown in prayer. Significantly, neither Holofernes nor the blood streaming from his neck is shown, as is typical of most artistic renderings.|$|R

50|$|His {{paintings}} mostly {{stick to}} <b>black,</b> white and <b>ochre</b> in colour. The most obvious motif seen in {{them is the}} circles and lines, which depict dreaming tracks.

50|$|Even after {{returning}} to landscape painting, until 1980 Congdon continued his artistic reflection on the Cross. Over two decades, there were developments {{and changes in the}} handling of this subject. Putting things very simply, one might identify the following phases. In the first works, the influence of the traditional iconography for such paintings clearly makes itself felt: the arms are shown forming a T or Y; the figure is light-colored; background tends to be dark; and the palette reveals some hint of realism (some trace of red, a mixture of <b>black</b> and <b>ochre</b> for the hair, with the occasional presence of gold).|$|R
50|$|The painting's {{range of}} color is diminished, {{as much or}} {{even more so than}} the other <b>black</b> paintings, to <b>ochres</b> and <b>blacks.</b> This {{reinforces}} a nocturnal and unreal atmosphere, appropriate to the mythical subject of this work. The arbitrary, irrational aspects of Goyas black paintings have given them a place as precursors to Modern art.|$|R
50|$|The {{bare-faced curassow}} {{is a large}} bird {{reaching}} a length of 82 to 92 cm. The sexes differ in appearance. The male has black upper parts faintly glossed with greenish-olive, with an unfeathered face with yellowish bare skin, a small black crest, and white underparts. The female has a black head, throat, neck and upper mantle, and {{a black and white}} barred crest. The remainder of the upper parts are greenish-black barred with white or <b>ochre.</b> The <b>black</b> tail is tipped with white or ochre and the underparts are <b>black</b> with <b>ochre</b> barring on the breast, paling to a yellowish or ochre belly. The facial skin on females is blackish.|$|R
50|$|His {{paintings}} depict {{stories from}} the Pintupi dreaming. They are mostly about places and events in the Tingari cycle (a cycle of myths about the ancestors of the Pintupi). His designs are inspired by those painted on the body during ceremonies. He uses acrylic paints on canvas, sticking to earthy colours (<b>black,</b> white and <b>ochres).</b> He paints simple shapes with dotted lines, which is a style that his brothers also use.|$|R
50|$|The {{colors in}} greater areas of this {{painting}} are generally subdued and executed in ochres or in mixtures of several pigments. The dark green foliage {{in the upper}} part contains a glaze of emerald green and Scheele's green mixed with yellow lake with small addition of ivory <b>black</b> and yellow <b>ochre.</b> The strong colourful accents in the bonets and clothes of the children are painted in almost pure pigments such as cobalt blue, vermilion or chrome orange.|$|R
5000|$|Derek Elley of Variety stated, [...] "In most respects, {{the film}} is so far from Wilde's play that it's {{practically}} a separate work. Bathed in pastels, <b>ochres,</b> <b>blacks</b> and golds, and easily moving around a variety of locations, it's like another slice of '30s nostalgia in the vein of Enchanted April or Where Angels Fear to Tread. Though undeniably retaining their wit, the Wilde-isms are finally more of a distraction, imported from another world and another genre." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sanskrit texts {{mention the}} use of bitumen, rock salt, yellow orpiment, chalk, alum, bismuth, calamine, realgar, stibnite, saltpeter, cinnabar, arsenic, sulphur, yellow and red <b>ochre,</b> <b>black</b> sand, and red clay in prescriptions. Among the metals used were gold, silver, copper, mercury, iron, iron ores, pyrite, tin, and brass. Mercury {{appeared}} to have been the most frequently used, and is called by several names in the texts. No source for mercury or its ores has been located. Leading to the suggestion that it may have been imported.|$|R
50|$|From the {{fundamental}} {{theme of the}} Face (The National Art Museum, 1999) until the anonymous multitude of the silhouettes of the Metropolis (The Shadows of the Present, Simeza, 2004), the painter meditates (approaching the face schematically and in series) on the entire magma of emotions and anxieties that haunt the human condition nowadays, evolving towards the depersonalisation of all the nets and towards the consumist reification. This existentialist pithy message is embodied in Florica’s painting exactly in the rind, the leather, the scales, the scars, the imprints and the crust of the tones of white, grey, <b>black</b> and <b>ochre</b> of the wrapping cardboard. Her images do not become simpler from a cycle to another. They become poli-matters reliefs, with cassetons, with the zigzag rhythms of the goffered cardboard, with fields of numbers with schematized eyes and palms, with interweavings and garlands of paper bands or painted cloth. Therefore, the artist neither performs in narrative scripts, nor composes after effects of rhetoric of the proper abstract image.|$|R
25|$|Blue was a latecomer among colours used {{in art and}} decoration, as well as {{language}} and literature. Reds, <b>blacks,</b> browns, and <b>ochres</b> are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is {{probably due to the}} perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments. The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite.|$|R
50|$|Fladda {{lighthouse}} is {{an active}} lighthouse located on the Islet of Fladda, one of the Slate Islands about 1.8 km off Cullippol. The lighthouse was built in 1860 on project by David A. and Thomas Stevenson; it is a cylindrical masonry tower 13 m high with gallery and lantern. The tower is painted white, the lantern is <b>black</b> and has <b>ochre</b> trim; it is a minor light operated by Northern Lighthouse Board but managed privately. The light emits a two white flashes every 9 seconds.The keeper’s house seems to be home to a large colony of terns.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} level is raised {{slightly}} above the Flinders Street pavement. Three granite steps lead to paneled entrance doors {{with a metal}} transom grille over, in a pattern reminiscent of fish scales. The richly finished entrance vestibule is lined with a reddish marble. A pair of glazed timber doors with brass handles and kickplate and an elaborate fanlight over opens onto the main business chamber. A dogleg terrazzo stair, which extends to the roof level, has a timber handrail and decorative wrought iron balustrade. The walls in the stairwell are lined with <b>black</b> and yellow <b>ochre</b> coloured tiles.|$|R
5000|$|Zorn {{is known}} to use a basic color palette {{consisting}} of Lead White (Flake White), Yellow Ochre, Vermilion and Ivory Black. This limited color palette shows tremendous range in terms of color mixing. A large variety of tonal ranges are possible to mix and considered as a very important development for portrait painting. However, the color palette {{can also be used}} in still life and landscape painting under certain circumstances. Most striking aspect is that a kind of an olive green color is possible to obtain by mixing Ivory <b>Black</b> and Yellow <b>Ochre</b> as Ivory <b>Black</b> is bluish in nature.|$|R
50|$|The lowest tier of the {{exterior}} walls is embellished with sculptures of lions and elephants. The material {{used for the}} sculptures are of <b>black</b> and <b>ochre</b> stones (<b>black</b> stone is used to carve pantheon gods while Ochre stone is used for other sculptures). Also sculptured on {{the exterior}} face of the temple are divine images of Vishnu and his incarnations. In addition, the entrance doors are flanked by images of mythological figures, which are of 1 or 2 ft in height. On the southern face of the shikara or tower there is well crafted image of Ganesha with six arms and well turned out trunk. Some of the other images of interest are: A stone slab of Vishnu and Lakshmî mounted on Garuda with a king offering prayers, a gana adorning the top part of the pillars; inside the sanctum sanctorum, next to the main deity of Shiva Linga, is serpent with raised hood, and also images of Ganesha and Shiva, and that of a king and queen.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, colour codes were {{employed}} to accelerate and simplify the colouring of the various ornaments and figures. For this purpose each section was given a number from 1-9 or an abbreviation {{of the name of}} the colour. Some paintings were embellished with raised ornaments (pastiglia-technique). Either a semi-liquid paste was applied to the painting surface, or a stamp had been previously produced from a mould and then applied onto the painting surface. Depending on the final visible colour of a painting, specific colours for the underpainting {{were employed}}. An ochre for example has an underpainting in a bright yellow. Similar to Tibetan paintings, the traditional painting was carried out with shading systems, such as a dry or wet shading system. Shading may be obtained with glazes, or with one of the dry shading systems, such as the dot-shading technique in which minuscle dots of colour cover the paintings surface. Specific details were then achieved with small paint brushes employing a variety of colours: <b>black,</b> white, <b>ochre</b> or red.|$|R
5000|$|Mata Ortiz pottery {{pieces are}} made for their {{aesthetic}} value and use pre Hispanic pottery only as inspiration, not {{as a means of}} continuing a folk-art tradition. The painted designed is where the artistic variation is most evident and skill levels vary greatly. Some potters stick to geometric patterns and colors very similar to those on original Pakimé pottery with the oval shaped vessel considered “classic” [...] Others have develop shapes and styles using new colors such as green, yellow, even purpose, sweeping lines and extremely thin lines. Newer painted designs include zoomorphic shapes such as lizards, snakes, fish, birds and others, almost always related to the desert environment. The most common decoration is burnishing to give a soft shine and fine lines in <b>black</b> and <b>ochre.</b> Another form of decoration adds decorative elements in clay over the walls of the vessel and sgraffito is usually done with only one color such as black on black. A relatively rare form of decoration for the pottery is the incision of the clay vessel while the clay is still moist.|$|R
50|$|The cave {{itself is}} located in a heavily forested {{volcanic}} landscape two kilometers north of Corinto, and is approximately 60 meters wide, 30 meters in height, and 20 meters deep, with multiple chambers. There are around 200 pictographs within the cave, each of varying colors, including red, <b>ochre,</b> <b>black,</b> green, yellow, and white. The size of each painting varies greatly. Some of the human figures can be up to 100 cm in height, although most are only around 30 cm. General symbols ranged from 4 to 50 cm in height. To see a variety of images taken from the cave, please proceed to the referenced Bradshaw Foundation page.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1920s, Balinese {{traditional}} {{paintings were}} restricted {{to what is}} now known as the Kamasan or Wayang style. It is a visual narrative of Hindu-Javanese epics: the Ramayana and Mahabharata, {{as well as a number}} of indigenous stories, such as the Panji narrative.These two-dimensional drawings are traditionally drawn on cloth or bark paper (Ulantaga paper) with natural dyes. The coloring is limited to available natural dyes: red, <b>ochre,</b> <b>black,</b> etc. In addition, the rendering of the figures and ornamentations must follow strictly prescribed rules, since they are mostly produced for religious articles and temple hangings. These paintings are produced collaboratively, and therefore mostly anonymously.|$|R
50|$|The male has a <b>black</b> cape with <b>ochre</b> {{spots and}} the body plumage on a grey ground colour is finely patterned. The {{elongated}} neck feathers are dark and end in a small, hard, yellowish plate; this peculiar structure making them popular for making high-grade artificial flies. The male has red wattles and combs but not as strongly developed as in the red junglefowl. Legs of males are red and have spurs while the yellow legs of females usually lack spurs. The central tail feathers are long and sickle shaped. Males have an eclipse plumage in which they moult their colourful neck feathers in summer during or after the breeding season.|$|R

50|$|The flag {{differs from}} the flags of the Australian states as {{it does not include}} the British Blue Ensign. The flag of the Australian Capital Territory adopted 15 years later is similar in design. The flag's colours consist of the {{official}} Territorian colours of <b>black,</b> white and <b>ochre</b> (making it the only flag among Australia's states and territories not to feature the colour blue). The Southern Cross appears as five white stars on a black panel at the hoist. In the fly of the flag is a stylised Sturt's Desert Rose, the territory's floral emblem since 1961, with seven white petals and a black seven-pointed core. The seven white petals represent the six Australian States and the Northern Territory.|$|R
5000|$|The team {{acquired}} significant commercial sponsorship from Yardley for the [...] season, {{running in}} white with <b>black,</b> gold and <b>ochre</b> stripes in a stylised [...] "Y" [...] wrapping around the car's bodywork, losing this deal to McLaren for 1972 {{and replacing it}} by Marlboro's familiar white and red (a flat shade, not dayglo) colours. Ironically this deal was also lost to McLaren for 1974, to be replaced briefly by Motul in a pale green and silver colour scheme. As Stanley-BRM the cars initially ran in red, white and blue with no major sponsorship; for the team's swansong it was sponsored by Rotary Watches and ran in pale blue and white. The Jordan-BRM P230 was black and gold.|$|R
5000|$|Fahrenheit is a Shinigami who {{has come}} to the human world in search of Dune, who is an old friend of his past. He has long, jet <b>black</b> hair and <b>ochre</b> eyes. He has large horns and a fair sized sickle which later on in the manga is {{discovered}} to be the thing that is holding back Fahrenheit. It seems that before he left for his job to be a shinigami, he ran away from Dune without saying [...] "Good-bye". With great regret, he becomes a student at Mitsuhachi Academy to try and tell Dune what he never got to say but due to leaving the afterworld and abandoning his position (which is a sin to the Shinigami ways), he cannot speak when around Dune.|$|R
5000|$|Marsh rabbits {{display a}} blackish brown or dark reddish dorsal surface. The belly is a dingy {{brownish}} gray in most {{but can also}} have a dull white appearance in mainland rabbits. [...] The leading edges of the ears display small <b>black</b> tufts with <b>ochre</b> on the inside. [...] rough hair on the dorsal side can be fringed with black hairs. The black portions of the upper parts often change to a dull grayish buff in spring and summer months, returning to a reddish or ochre color in fall, followed by darker black in the winter. Rabbits of peninsular Florida typically display darker and redder colors with a cinnamon-rufous nape, feet, and legs. Juveniles display much darker and duller colors than adults.|$|R
