40|$|Researchers are {{designing}} new MANET {{routing protocols}} and comparing and improving existing MANET routing protocols before any routing protocols are standardized using simulations. However, the simulation results from different research groups are {{not consistent with}} each other. This is {{because of a lack}} of consistency in MANET routing protocol models and application environments, including networking and user traffic profiles. Therefore, the simulation scenarios are not equitable for all protocols and conclusions cannot be generalized. Furthermore, it is difficult for one to choose a proper routing protocol for a given MANET application. In this paper Investigators for experimental purpose, considered 10 and 20 multiple random wireless nodes in 250 mx 250 m terrain area and routing protocol DSR and find out the various simulation results like: Number of generated packets, sent packets, received, forward, dropped packet, Maximum and minimum generated packets size, Simulation length in seconds, <b>number</b> of generated <b>bytes,</b> <b>number</b> of sent <b>bytes,</b> <b>number</b> of received and forward <b>bytes.</b> <b>Number</b> of drop <b>bytes...</b>|$|R

When you operate on the vector registers, every operation is done in parallel on the 64 numbers. Every time you do some work with them, you actually work with 64 inputs.

40|$|Abstract—Wireless Sensor {{networks}} {{are a new}} class of distributed system that {{is an integral part of}} the physical space they inhabit. Unlike most computers which work primarily with data created by humans, sensor networks reason about the state of world that embodies them. The network consists of numerous sensor nodes with sensing, wireless communications and computing capabilities. These sensor nodes require time to time update of variables by a process called dissemination. This is done using dissemination protocols like Drip, DIP (Dissemination Protocol) and DHV. These protocols helps improve reliability and efficiency but do not consider security of transmitted data. A special protocol called Se-Drip is proposed to ensure security during data dissemination. It is an enhanced version of Drip protocol. Here security is provided using Merkle hash tree which forms the hash values for the transmitted data. To enhance and complicate the security process an 8 <b>byte</b> <b>number</b> called the salt number is added. This provides better security and authentication.
