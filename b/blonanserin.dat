Methods: The primary outcome measure for efficacy was improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at week 24. Secondary outcomes were PANSS subscale scores, 21 -item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD- 21) score, response rate, discontinuation rate, and individual adverse events. Results: Forty-four patients were recruited. The discontinuation rate was 86. 4 % in the aripiprazole group and 68. 2 % in the <b>blonanserin</b> treatment group.

An in vitro release experiment was performed and the adhesive performance of the drug-in-adhesive patches with different concentrations of IPM was evaluated by a rolling ball tack test and a shear-adhesion test. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and rheological parameters of the drug-in-adhesive layers were determined to study the effect of IPM on the mechanical properties of the PSA. The results of the in vitro release experiment showed that the release rate of <b>blonanserin</b> increased with an increasing concentration of IPM. The rolling ball tack test and shear-adhesion test showed decreasing values with increasing IPM concentration.

Time to discontinuation of treatment is also representative of effectiveness. We investigated differences in treatment discontinuation among newly started second-generation antipsychotics in the clinical setting. Methods: Using a retrospective cohort study design, we screened all outpatients (n = 7936) who visited the Shioiri Mental Clinic between July 1, 2008 and June 30, 2010. We identified a cohort of patients (n = 703) diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and calculated the time to discontinuation of each second-generation antipsychotic. Results: Of the 703 patients, 149 were newly treated with aripiprazole, 67 with <b>blonanserin,</b> 95 with olanzapine, 36 with quetiapine, 74 with perospirone, and 120 with risperidone. The time to discontinuation for all causes was significantly longer for aripiprazole than for <b>blonanserin,</b> olanzapine, and risperidone. In addition, aripiprazole tended to be continued for longer than quetiapine and perospirone, but these differences were not significant. Conclusion: Aripiprazole may be considered the best available option for long-term treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Methods: A total of 39 schizophrenia inpatients were included in this study. The subjects received either BNS (N= 20) or RIS (N= 19), and the clinical responses were evaluated periodically. The concomitant use of mood stabilizers was not allowed. Efficacy was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia. Cognition was assessed using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia, Japanese-language version. Social function was assessed using the Life Assessment Scale for the Mentally Ill. Results: For both groups, each assessment exhibited {{a decrease in the}} mean change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The depression subscale was significantly improved in the BNS group compared with the RIS group at 8 weeks after administration. BNS improved verbal fluency and executive function (cognitive function) and daily living and work skills (social function). Compared with the RIS group, BNS was observed to improve daily living. Conclusion: BNS may improve psychotic symptoms, cognitive function, and daily living in patients with acute-phase schizophrenia. BNS may be superior to RIS in the improvement of daily living.

40|$|Neuroleptic {{malignant}} syndrome (NMS) is rare {{but sometimes}} causes life-threatening conditions. We report {{the case of}} a 53 -year-old male patient who developed NMS following cardiac surgery. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and pre- scribed <b>blonanserin,</b> chlorpromazine, and biperiden. From postoperative day 3, hyperthermia, disturbed consciousness, and involuntary movement were observed. Subsequently, his serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels increased. After NMS was suspected, chlorpromazine and biperiden were stopped. From postoperative day 7, intravenous administration of dant- rolene was initiated. Following this treatment, his serum CPK levels gradually decreased, and the other symptoms improved. The treatment of NMS remains controversial. There is no evidence that dantrolene is effective for treating NMS; however, it {{may be one of the}} important options for treating NMS. We present the case and discuss the diagnosis and management of NMS following cardiac surgery. [Arch Clin Exp Surg 2017; 6 (2. 000) : 117 - 119...|$|E

This study aimed {{to examine whether}} previous findings could be replicated in a genetically distinct and homogenous group (ie, Japanese patients with schizophrenia) and whether previous findings could be extended to {{a broader range of}} antipsychotics with previously unclear relative efficacy and tolerability. Methods: Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed in which randomized trials comparing any of the following interventions were included: second-generation antipsychotics, haloperidol, or placebo. The primary outcomes for efficacy and acceptability were the response rate and all-cause discontinuation. The secondary outcomes included the improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, discontinuation because of adverse events, and individual adverse events. Results: Eighteen relevant studies were identified (total n= 3, 446; aripiprazole = 267, <b>blonanserin</b> = 285, clozapine = 47, clocapramine = 295, haloperidol = 857, mosapramine = 493, olanzapine = 179, paliperidone = 136, perospirone = 146, placebo = 138, quetiapine = 212, and risperidone = 338; mean study duration = 8. 33 ± 1. 41 weeks). In primary outcomes, olanzapine and paliperidone showed efficacy than placebo, and olanzapine and paliperidone showed superior acceptability compared with placebo. There were differences in the incidences of individual adverse events (the best antipsychotic: extrapyramidal symptoms = olanzapine, hyperprolactinemia-related symptoms = quetiapine, sedation = paliperidone, and weight change = <b>blonanserin)</b> among antipsychotics. Conclusion: Although the current analysis exclusively included Japanese patients with schizophrenia, no remarkable differences were observed in efficacy and safety compared with previous meta-analyses. Diverse hierarchies in safety outcomes also support the implication that individual risk expectations for adverse events can guide clinical decisions. However, the sample size was relatively limited. Additional efficacy and safety data are required to fully obtain a conclusive understanding. Keywords: antipsychotics, Japanese schizophrenia, network meta-analysis, efficacy, safet...|$|E
