5|$|Following Khumarawayh's {{ascension}} {{to power}} in 884, the Abbasid central government decided to reassert its control over the provinces ruled <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> invaded northern Syria that year. By early 885 the conflict was proceeding favorably for the Abbasids, forcing Khumarawayh to personally take the field and try to stop their advance toward Egypt. In the battle that followed, the Abbasid troops initially defeated the Tulunids and plundered Khumarawayh's camp, but were then ambushed by a Tulunid reserve force and routed in turn.|$|E

5|$|Breslin married Jami Rutili, and {{the couple}} had three children, Shane, Paige, and Chase. He {{earned a degree in}} {{recreation}} management while at Lake Superior State. During his career, Breslin was involved in numerous charities. He delivered food on Thanksgiving for the Chris Zorich Foundation; conducted self-esteem workshops for an anti-drug, anti-gang organization; participated in the Wolves' Read to Succeed program, in which he read to children at local libraries; and several others. In a 1997 interview, Breslin said that the most special charity he helped was one started <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his wife. The Extra Effort program was started at Indian Trail Junior High School in Addison, where Jami was a teacher. Each month the program gave both a male and a female student four tickets to a Wolves game and a gift bag. The students were chosen based on attitude, effort and attendance. After retiring from professional hockey, he coached youth hockey and helped manage an Irish pub.|$|E

Following the commercial success of The Evil Dead (1981), Raimi and Campbell decided to collaborate on another project. Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served {{as one of the}} editors on The Evil Dead, and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot for the film, because of continued interference by the studio.|$|E
5|$|Development of Space Race {{began in}} Summer 1972 {{under the name}} Asteroid by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, based on ideas <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> co-founder Ted Dabney.

The game was planned to be quick to create to fulfill an earlier contract with Bally Midway. The engineering and prototyping was done by Alcorn; after it was completed and the design given to Midway to be released as Asteroid, Atari produced its own nearly identical version as Space Race. Fifty Space Race cabinets were produced using a fiberglass design by George Faraco {{before the rest of}} the production was switched to a cheaper standard cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens from Outer Space (all 1956).|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{the journal}} Zoologica {{was founded by}} Osborn and Hornaday {{specifically}} as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first {{issue of the journal}} contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on equal footing with the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for the purpose of further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.|$|E

Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen <b>by</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> they wanted Gentiles {{to accept their}} God as the only God.

The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death.

Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had {{told him she was}} pregnant <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Resistance execute {{an attack}} on a Nazi {{research}} facility in London, bombing their base of operations, stealing secret documents and prototype stealth helicopters. The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on reverse-engineered technology derived from an ancient organization known as Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons, computer AI's, and super concrete; however, it is also revealed that someone is tampering with the super concrete's formula, making it susceptible to mold deterioration. The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside the camp and meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been using technology made <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy the camp and rescue prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897.

Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented <b>by</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897.
