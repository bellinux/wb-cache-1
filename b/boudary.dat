40|$|The {{dynamics}} of dislocation assemblies in deforming crystals indicate {{the emergence of}} collective phenomena, intermittent fluctuations and strain avalanches. In polycrystalline materials, the understanding of plastic deformation mechanisms depends on grasping the role of grain boundaries on dislocation motion. Here the interaction of dislocations and elastic, low angle grain boundaries is studied {{in the framework of}} a discrete dislocation representation. We allow grain boundaries to deform under the effect of dislocation stress fields and compare the effect of such a perturbation to the case of rigid grain <b>boudaries.</b> We are able to determine, both analytically and numerically, corrections to dislocation stress fields acting on neighboring grains, as mediated by grain boundary deformation. Finally, we discuss conclusions and consequences for the avalanche statistics, as observed in polycrystalline samples. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Contrary to Inverter Ring Oscillators (IRO), several events can evolve simultaneously in a STR: a handshake request and acknowledge protocol {{prevents them from}} colliding.

However, growths of monolayer and bilayer WSe 2, an important member of the transition-metal dichalcogenides family, by the molecular-beam epitaxy method remain uncharted probably {{because of the difficulty}} in generating tungsten fluxes from the elemental source. In this work, we present a scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study of molecular-beam epitaxy-grown WSe 2 monolayer and bilayer, showing atomically flat epifilm with no domain boundary defect. This contrasts epitaxial MoSe 2 films grown by the same method, where a dense network of the domain <b>boudaries</b> defects is present. The scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of monolayer and bilayer WSe 2 domains of the same sample reveal not only the bandgap narrowing upon increasing the film thickness from monolayer to bilayer, but also a band-bending effect across the boundary between monolayer and bilayer domains. This band-bending appears to be dictated by the edge states at steps of the bilayer islands.
