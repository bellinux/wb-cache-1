The quadrille is an {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of ensemble called a jing ping band. In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called bélé, traditional storytelling called kont, masquerade, children's and work songs, and Carnival music.|$|E
5|$|One night, she is {{dropped off}} {{at home by}} one of her male colleagues; Apu {{witnesses}} this and assumes that Chanda has been soliciting. She steals the money that Chanda has been collecting {{to pay for the}} math tuition and spends it all on food and new clothes. This devastates Chanda, who becomes depressed when Apu tells her that the money was not hard-earned. Chanda stops attending school and continues to work with the hope that Apu will join the Indian Administrative Service, after she is inspired <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> District Commissioner (Sanjay Suri). In the meantime, Amar helps Apu realize her mistake by making her witness Chanda working at the restaurant. Apu rekindles her interest in school and begins to treat her mother with respect, having realized that she can perform well if she possesses the will. She brings her mother back to school and the duo finish their SSC year together.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{developed}} a large practice among powerful people, including Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester {{and the principal}} secretary Sir Francis Walsingham, and in 1581 he was made physician-in-chief to Queen Elizabeth I of England and her household, with a life pension of £50 per year. In June 1584, Elizabeth granted him a monopoly on the importation of aniseed and sumac to England for ten years; this was renewed in January 1593. In 1588 he was given land and tithes in Worcestershire belonging to the Bishop of Worcester Edmund Freke. Gabriel Harvey, an English scholar of the era, remarked on Lopez's rise on the title page of a book he owned, Judaeorum Medicastrorum calumnias:Doctor Lopus, the Queenes physitian, is descended of Jewes: but himselfe A Christian, & Portugall. He none of the learnedest, or expertest physitians in ye Court: but one, that maketh as great account of himself, as the best: & <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Jewish practis, hath growen to much wealth, & sum reputation: aswell with ye Queen herselfe as with sum of ye greatest Lordes, & Ladyes.|$|E

25|$|Before 1910 the {{difficulty}} of harmonizing the Proprium de Tempore and the Proprium Sanctorum, to which reference has been made, was only partly met in the thirty-seven chapters of general rubrics.

25|$|The Capilla del Santo Sepulcro or Chapel of the Holy Burial {{was built}} between 1759 and 1763. The murals here were begun in 1760 and {{center on the}} death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. This area connects the Chapel of the Calvary, which is behind it, <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of bridge {{anchored}} to the walls. This chapel contains {{an image of a}} resuscitated Jesus but still reclined which is notable for the bloody face and the number of precious stones that have been placed on it. These stones have remained despite the various attacks the church has suffered over its history. The roof is trapezoidal decorated with rose windows and four large reliefs of shells. The walls are painted with numerous figures such as Four Evangelists, the Four Fathers of the Church, and a large quantity of angels and cherubs. There are also allusions to the Four Cardinal Virtues, and medallions with scenes of the Resurrection.|$|E

500|$|Beecham's {{attitude}} towards 19th-century German repertoire was equivocal. He frequently disparaged Beethoven, Wagner and others, but regularly conducted their works, often with great success. He observed, [...] "Wagner, though a tremendous genius, gorged music like a German who overeats. And Bruckner was a hobbledehoy {{who had no}} style at all... Even Beethoven thumped the tub; the Ninth symphony was composed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Mr. Gladstone of music." [...] Despite his criticisms, Beecham conducted all the Beethoven symphonies during his career, and he made studio recordings of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, and live recordings of No. 9 and Missa Solemnis. [...] He conducted the Fourth Piano Concerto with pleasure (recording it with Arthur Rubinstein and the LPO) but avoided the Emperor Concerto when possible.|$|E
500|$|The Old Golden Gate ( [...] , [...] ), known also as the Xerolophos Gate and the Gate of Saturninus, is {{mentioned}} in the Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae, which further states that the city wall itself in the region around it was [...] "ornately decorated". The gate stood somewhere on the southern slopes of the Seventh Hill. Its construction is often attributed to Constantine, but is in fact of uncertain age. It survived until the 14th century, when the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras described it as being built of [...] "wide marble blocks with a lofty opening", and crowned <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of stoa. In late Byzantine times, a painting of the Crucifixion was allegedly placed on the gate, leading to its later Ottoman name, İsakapı ("Gate of Jesus").

500|$|Sequels, prequels and adaptations {{based on}} Austen's work range from {{attempts}} to enlarge on {{the stories in}} Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel Virtues and Vices (1981) and fantasy novel Resolve and Resistance (1996). Beginning {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, [...] "her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to [...] "the world of Jane Austen". The texts that continue the story are [...] "generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest" [...] and [...] "often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque". Those that emphasise nostalgia are [...] "defined not only by retrograde longing but also <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.|$|E

2500|$|Bourdieu thus sees habitus as an {{important}} factor contributing to social reproduction because it is central to generating and regulating the practices that make up social life.
