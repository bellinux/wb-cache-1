25|$|Their {{presence}} is controversial, and resisted by {{large segments of}} the Christian population, who argue that the primarily Sunni Muslim Palestinians dilute Christian numbers. Many Shia Muslims also look unfavorably upon the Palestinian presence since the refugee camps have tended to be concentrated in their home areas. The Lebanese Sunnis, however, would <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these Palestinians given the Lebanese nationality, thus increasing the Lebanese Sunni population by well over 10% and tipping the fragile electoral balance much in favor of the Sunnis. Late prime minister Rafiq Hariri —himself a Sunni— had hinted {{on more than one occasion}} on the inevitability of granting these refugees Lebanese citizenship. Thus far the refugees are Lebanese citizenship as well as many rights enjoyed by the rest of the population, and are confined to severely overcrowded refugee camps, in which construction rights are severely constricted.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the home was used as a {{temporary}} hospital. Colonel John Glover and the Marblehead Regiment occupied the house as their temporary barracks in June 1775. Initially, General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief of the newly formed Continental Army, used the Benjamin Wadsworth House at Harvard College as his headquarters, but decided he needed more space for his staff. Washington moved into the Vassall House on July 16, 1775, and used it as his headquarters and home until he departed on April 4, 1776. During the Siege of Boston, he found the view of the Charles River from the house particularly useful. [...] The home was shared with several aide-de-camps, including colonel Robert H. Harrison. During his time there, Washington was visited by John Adams and Abigail Adams, Benedict Arnold, Henry Knox, and Nathanael Greene. In his study, Washington also confronted Dr. Benjamin Church with evidence that he was a spy. It was in this house that Washington received a poem written by Phillis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet. [...] "If you should ever come to Cambridge", he wrote to her, [...] "I shall <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a person so favored by the Muses".|$|E
2500|$|Noah Bennet first {{appears in}} [...] "Genesis", the first episode. He {{is found in}} the {{apartment}} of Chandra Suresh in Madras, India. Chandra's son Mohinder enters the apartment, but leaves quickly after realizing Bennet is there as well. Bennet seems to notice Mohinder, and later follows him to New York. There, Bennet is one of Mohinder's afternoon passengers during his job as a taxicab driver. Bennet begins pleasantly referencing his travels, and stating that he'll <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his family again. The conversation turns as he mentions personal facts about Mohinder, ultimately resulting in Mohinder fleeing his own cab. Finally, Bennet comes home to Odessa and greets his family. The next morning in [...] "Don't Look Back", Claire states her desire to meet her biological parents. Bennet is reluctant, but doesn't outright say [...] "no." [...] After Claire gets home from school, Bennet says he'll start contacting the adoption agency and look for her biological parents. After a happy Claire leaves the room, Bennet is seen watching a video tape of Claire demonstrating her healing abilities.|$|E
