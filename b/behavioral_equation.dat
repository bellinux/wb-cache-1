40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to measure the {{exchange}} rate pass-through to domestic prices by using VAR model, and to estimate the long- and short-run and dynamic coefficients of exchange rate pass-through by building the price <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation,</b> which was set up by the error correction model According to results of VAR model estimation, the impact of exchange rate on import, producer, and consumer prices increased after the Korean financial crisis of 1997 - 98. And the estimation of the price <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation</b> model also shows that the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices grew after the financial crisis. It is found that there has existed an asymmetric effect of exchange rate movements on prices, looking at the aspects that the pass-through coefficients in the rising period of exchange rate have been different from those in the falling period. This evidence implies that even if exchange rate will fall right after it rises for a certain period of time, consumer prices will not recover to the original level or it will, on the contrary, rise. Therefore, policy authorities should, on the process of implementation of monetary policy, keep in mind that this empirical evidence can be a restraint factor in pursuing the price stability...|$|E

40|$|The {{inconsistency}} of optimal policy {{comes from}} inconsistency between the social loss function {{and the economic}} structure. Accordingly, this paper designs a central bank loss function, which proves consistent with the economic structure. Under the designed central bank loss function discretionary policy proves optimal for social welfare. Optimal discretionary policy emerges because the implied <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation</b> is identical with that under commitment to the social loss function. Consequently, this paper also designs policy rules. To some extent, policy rules appear more basic, flexible, and operational than social and central bank loss functions, but the social loss function serves as an ultimate objective and the central bank loss function explicitly identifies the attainable targets and appropriate weight to achieve the social optimum.

It also utilizes a significantly improved method for assessing {{the meaning of the}} regression coefficient on the exchange rate variable in consumption and investment functions, removing ambiguity as to whether they should be interpreted as income or substitution effects. The paper attempts econometrically, using a seven <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation</b> model, to determine the total impact during 2000 - 2008 of the U. S. real exchange rate’s 13. 8 % decline. Using projections based on an econometric model of the U.

The estimated overall negative effect of declining real exchange rates on the GDP is 1. 9 % over the eight years, or about a quarter percent decline a year.

40|$|Despite {{belonging}} to a monetary union with a common currency and pooled foreign reserves, the countries of Africa's franc zone (CFA) experience substantially different inflation rates, especially in the short run. The authors develop a model of inflation differentials for the franc zone countries based on behavioral differences in fiscal policy responses to fluctuations {{in the price of}} the main export commodity. The model is basedon the fact that for primary exporters in general, and for CFA zone members in particular, the volatility of commodity prices implies a high variance in government revenues. The model identifies two effects: a monetary effect (commodity booms imply a surge in foreign reserves which, if unsterilized, is inflationary) and a fiscal effect (higher government revenues are, to varying degrees, accompanied by a marked increase in the level of spending, which is again inflationary). The fiscal relationship is the key <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation</b> of the model, as the other relationships are essentially derived from accounting identities. The authors empirically test the model for Cote d'Ivoire. It tracks quite well the inflationary cycle that Cote d'Ivoire experienced after the boom in coffee prices in 1975 - 76. Since the countries are in a monetary union, if some countries have expansionary fiscal policy (and thus inflation) the others must take a more contractionary fiscal stance. One issue for future research is what determines whether a member country has the freedom to follow an expansionary fiscal policy or whether it must contract because other members have already expanded. A discussion of potential games played by countries in a monetary union may shed light on these issues.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{an empirical}} model to explain growth of total assets {{of a sample}} of the world's largest banks. The model was estimated over a period in which U. S. banks' assets grew less rapidly than the assets of large banks headquartered in other industrial countries. The model provides an estimate of the banks' allocation between home currency and foreign currency assets which allows an estimate of the impact of exchange rate exchanges on bank asset growth.; The results of the model suggest that no single economic variable explains the faster growth of non-U. S. banks. Changes in real exchange rates were estimated to have {{had a significant impact on}} bank asset growth through their impact on the dollar value of banks' home-currency assets. This impact was greater over a shorter time period when exchange rate movements tended to be larger. Over the longer run other factors, such as faster home-country economic growth, an expanding trade and foreign investment sector, and the ability of large banks to retain their share of domestic intermediation, tended to be relatively more important.; The model tested whether banks headquartered in particular countries tended to respond in a similar manner to economic variables and could be aggregated into a single <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation.</b> Aggregation was generally indicated for non-U. S. banks and was rejected for American banks. The model overpredicted asset growth for large U.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 In {{order to}} {{effectively}} use foodgrain prices as tools of government policy, {{it is necessary}} to know the possible effects of price incentives on different economic variables. The present study attempts to measure the effects of foodgrain prices, upon various economic variables, including production, consumption, both at the farm and urban levels, and farm sales of two major foodgrains, and to explore possible measures to improve the current foodgrain price policy. The results of the empirical study of farm producers' response indicate that Korean farmers respond significantly in their grain production to price changes and that they are more responsive in barley than in rice production in terms of both input use and planted acreage. This suggests that policy designed to raise barley price to farm producers would contribute relatively more to increasing overall foodgrain production. In studying the consumption behavior of farm and urban consumers, and sales decisions of farmers, a simultaneous equation model was used. The system comprises eight equations: six behavioral and two market identity equations. In specifying the model, special attention was given to a peculiar feature emerging from the dual role of farmers in semi-monetized agriculture, that is, as consumers {{on the one hand and}} as sellers of products on the other. Two types of analyses were carried out on the basis of the estimated behavioral parameters of the model. First, an analysis was made of the partial response to price changes by treating each <b>behavioral</b> <b>equation</b> as an independent single equation under the usual ceteris paribus assumption. Secondly, the total behavioral responses were analyzed by taking account of simultaneous changes in all endogenous variables in the system. The partial response analysis indicates that both farm and urban consumers have a “potential” tendency to respond negatively to price changes in their consumption of rice and barley and also a "potential" tendency to substitute one grain for another in the face of changing relative prices. It also shows a positive response in the foodgrain marketings of farm producers. But the total response analysis shows that the responses measured in the partial analysis are substantially offset by the interdependence of the prices of rice and barley on the open market, resulting in positive changes in the quantity demanded or no substitution at all. The empirical results also provide counter-evidence concerning the validity in the Korean economy of the so-called "target cash requirements hypothesis," advanced by a number of economists. One important policy implication that can be drawn from the study is that if the government's objective is to reduce foreign exchange spending on rice imports by restructuring foodgrain consumption (in addition to increased domestic production), it can be done through the use of price incentives by inducing the consumers to reveal their "potential" responses on the market. This is equivalent to forcing the ceteris paribus assumption made in the partial response analysis to operate in the real world through an appropriate governmental operation...|$|E
