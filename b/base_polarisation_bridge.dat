40|$|Polls have {{repeatedly}} shown a class <b>based</b> <b>polarisation</b> around Chávez, which some political science analysis on Venezuela has recognised. This paper seeks to show, however, that this class based division {{needs to be}} placed in historical context to be fully understood. Examining Venezuelan history from the colonial to the contemporary era the paper shows, unlike most previous work on Bolivarian Venezuela, that race is an important subtext to this class based support, and that there is indeed a correlation between class and race within the Venezuelan context. Furthermore, class and race are important positive elements in Chávez’s discourse, contrasting this with their negative use in opposition anti-Chavismo discourse. Finally the paper briefly reviews the Chávez government’s policy in tackling the class/race fissures in Venezuelan society, and concludes by asking whether these policies represent a change in the historical patterns of classism and racism within Venezuelan society or are simply reproducing past patterns...|$|R

40|$|Steel pipelines, {{buried under}} the soil and {{protected}} by the combination of protective coatings and cathodic protection (CP), are used {{for oil and gas}} transportation. These pipelines are one of the critical infrastructures for energy transportation and therefore became lifelines of modern society. The deterioration of the external surfaces of transmission pipelines is a serious problem and is caused mainly by coating and/or CP failure leading to the loss of integrity of pipelines. To avoid such damage, there is a need of techniques which are able to locate active corrosion sites, monitor corrosion, and evaluate corrosion damage. Fundamental understanding of such processes occurring on coated pipelines (with various types of defects in coatings as well as pipe) in complex soil environment is necessary for the development of such techniques. Numerous laboratory techniques, i. e., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy <b>based,</b> <b>polarisation</b> measurements <b>based,</b> mathematical simulations, direct observation etc. have been used to develop fundamental understanding, simulate and evaluate corrosion occurring in oil and gas pipelines under various operating conditions. Given the complex nature of the pipeline corrosion, application of these laboratory techniques in field measurements as well as in understanding the corrosion mechanisms is lacking.

40|$|SummaryFor {{animals that}} can see it, the {{polarisation}} of light adds another dimension to vision, analogous to adding colour {{to a black}} and white image [1, 2]. Whilst some animals use the orientation of the electric field vector (e-vector) for navigation and orientation [3], the ability to discriminate angular differences in e-vector has been implicated in object recognition for predator/prey detection [4, 5] as well as signalling and communication [6]. In all animals previously tested, however, the resolution of e-vector angle discrimination {{has been found to be}} in the range 10 – 20 ° [5, 7, 8], which is inadequate for the typical e-vector differences measured in relevant natural visual scenes [9]. In this study, we found that mourning cuttlefish (Sepia plangon) are able to detect differences between e-vector orientations as small as 1 °. Not only is this the most acute e-vector angle discrimination measured behaviourally in any animal, but it provides a high enough resolution to be relevant to real world visual tasks. We analysed natural underwater scenes using computer <b>based</b> <b>polarisation</b> imaging. When we increased the resolution of our system, we discovered information not detected using normal-resolution imaging polarimetry and invisible to animals lacking fine e-vector angle discrimination. For example, we found that high-resolution e-vector discrimination provides a new way of breaking typical intensity-based background matching. S. plangon lacks colour vision, like most other cephalopods, and high-resolution polarisation vision may provide an alternative source of contrast information that is just as fine-scale...|$|R

40|$|Light has {{provided}} the means to learn and gather information about the physical world throughout history. In a world where science moves to smaller scales and more specialised problems however, the boundaries of current technology are continually challenged, motivating the search for more sophisticated systems providing greater information content, sensitivity and increased dimensionality. Utilising the vectorial nature of light presents a promising avenue by which to meet these growing requirements. Polarisation can, for example, be used to transmit information, or alternatively, changes in polarisation induced by an object allow study of previously neglected material properties, such as birefringence and diattenuation. Central to this thesis is thus the characterisation and exploitation of the opportunities afforded by the electromagnetic (i. e. vectorial) nature of light. To this end the work follows three running themes: quantification of polarisation information; formulation of simple propagation tools for electromagnetic waves; and development of specific <b>polarisation</b> <b>based</b> optical systems. Characterising the informational limits inherent to <b>polarisation</b> <b>based</b> systems reduces to considering the uncertainty present in any observations. Uncertainty can, for example, arise from stochastic variation in the polarisation state being measured, or from random noise perturbations upon detection. Both factors are considered and quantified here. Development of vectorial optical systems does, however, pose significant difficulties in modelling, due to mathematical complexity and computational requirements. A number of new tools are hence developed, as prove applicable {{to a wide variety}} of applications. Examples are naturally given. To illustrate the potential of <b>polarisation</b> <b>based</b> systems, specific current topics are discussed; namely the growing demand for data storage, and single molecule studies. It will be shown that polarisation, can not only be used to multiplex information in data pits on optical media, but also to allow full 3 D study of single molecules.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} pathological {{changes of}} {{retinal pigment epithelium}} (RPE) by polarisation-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). METHODS: Forty-four eyes (22 patients) with significant pathologies of the RPE were evaluated using PS-OCT. A transversal scanning time domain OCT system was used for two-dimensional cross-sectional imaging of retinal polarisation properties. RESULTS: The RPE scrambles the polarisation state of backscattered light (ie, acts as a depolarising layer), while the polarisation state of transmitted light is maintained. In patients with RPE pathologies irregularity, elevation, thickening or absence of the RPE is readily visualised by exploiting the depolarisation information.

40|$|The {{magnetisation}} {{dynamics of}} a single square nanomagnet, the interaction between a pair of nanodiscs, a partially built writer structure {{and a range of}} magnetic tunnel junction sensor heads were studied using Time Resolved Scanning Kerr Microscopy (TRSKM) and four probe contact DC electrical transport measurements. Large amplitude magnetisation dynamics {{of a single}} square nanomagnet have been studied by TRSKM. Experimental spectra revealed that only a single mode was excited for all bias field values. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that at larger pulsed field amplitudes the center mode dominates the dynamic response while the edge mode is almost completely suppressed. The magnetisation dynamics occurring in a system comprised of two laterally separated magnetic nano-discs were also investigated. The polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect was used to measure the dynamic response of each disc independently so as to demonstrate that dynamic dipolar interactions between non-uniform spin wave modes in the different discs may be identified from the difference in their phase of oscillation. Results show a stronger dynamic dipolar interaction than expected from micromagnetic simulations highlighting both the need for characterisation and control of magnetic properties at the deep nanoscale and the potential use of dynamic interactions for the realization of useful magnetic nanotechnologies. TRSKM measurements were made simultaneously of the three Cartesian components of the magnetisation vector, by means of a quadrant photodiode <b>polarisation</b> <b>bridge</b> detector, on partially built hard disk writer structures. The rise time, relaxation time, and amplitude of each component has been related to the magnetic ground state, the initial torque, and flux propagation through the yoke and pole piece. Dynamic images reveal “flux-beaming” in which the magnetisation component parallel to the symmetry axis of the yoke is largest along that axis. A comparison of the magnetisation dynamics excited with different pulsed excitation amplitudes was also made. The results shows that more effective flux beaming is observed for higher pulse amplitudes. Lastly the microwave emission of Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) nanopillars has been measured using a four probe contact DC electrical transport measurement technique as a magnetic field is applied in the plane of the film at different angles (ϕ_H) with respect to the easy axis. Experimental spectra revealed that a more complicated spectrum containing several modes is observed as ϕ_H is increased. The modes were identified as edge and higher order modes from the statistical distribution of modes from different devices and micromagnetic simulations. The in-plane and out-of-plane components of the Spin Transfer Torque (STT) were estimated by analytical fitting of experimental data for the lowest frequency edge mode for the value of ϕ_H where the amplitude of the said mode was a maximum and its frequency a minimum. The estimated values are larger than expected perhaps due to the macrospin approximation made in deriving the analytical model. The results presented in this thesis can contribute to the understanding of magnetisation dynamics in industrially relevant data storage devices as well as the realization of a dipolar field coupling mechanism for arrays of nanooscillators.
