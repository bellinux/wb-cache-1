Besides the hydraulic system, the paper also {{presents the}} supervisory and control system architecture, including a few synoptics, and their remote terminal units (monitoring or control and monitoring units). The developed and field tuned manual and automatic controllers are also presented. The manual controllers – direct and gate position controllers (for the gates operation) and gate flow controllers - are defined for the main canals and main distributors intakes in order to permit a pre-defined flow value or a daily flow schedule achievement and also defined for a few gate controlled <b>bottom</b> canal <b>orifices</b> used to discharge the overflow to the drainage system. The automatic controllers - water depth controllers for a few gate controlled <b>bottom</b> canal <b>orifices</b> – are defined {{in order to prevent}} automatically canal overtopping. The supervisory and control system also monitor the outflows at the main canals and the main distributors - the most important canal top side weirs, canal terminal weirs and automatic Neyrpic siphons.

40|$|Abstract: Rivers {{longitudinal}} connectivity is {{compromised by}} man-made obstacles, such as dams and weirs, which affect fish movements, leading to populations decrease and genetic deterioration. Properly designed fishways re-establish connectivity, allowing for fish migration. The aim {{of our work}} is {{to contribute to a}} more fast and efficient development of pool-type fishways using hydrodynamic modelling, based on fish behaviour experiments. Modelling free surface flows in hydraulic structures with complex geometry, like pooltype fishways, with aerated and complex flow patterns, represents a significant research challenge. Knowledge already acquired in an experimental full scale indoor pool-type fishway in previous studies is used. A 1 : 2. 5 scaled fishway of this facility was built and used to characterize velocity and turbulence in a pool-type fishway with cross-walls equipped with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifices.</b> An offset orifice configuration was used with consecutive orifices positioned {{on opposite sides of the}} cross-walls, creating a sinusoidal flow path. The measurements of velocity fields were made using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV). Velocity maps were obtained at several positions, for planes parallel to the bottom and parallel to the sidewalls. Parameters that influence fishways efficiency like velocity fields, turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds shear stresses were determined. A 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the fishway was developed using a commercial software FLOW- 3 D. Velocity fields, turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds shear stresses were compared with the ones determined from PIV measurements and ADV measurements and results deviations between experimental and numerical data were analyzed. The use of FLOW 3 D to simulate mean velocity patterns and flow turbulence in pooltype fishways and its use as design tool for new fishway geometries are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, urban {{stormwater}} discharges have been recognised {{as one of}} the main causes of the environmental problems of receiving water bodies. During rain events, in fact, large amounts of water and pollutants are directly discharged through combined sewer overflow (CSO) devices into the receiving waters without any treatment. In addition, storm flow peaks and pollutant shock loads can arrive at the treatment plant (TP) reducing its efficiency or causing malfunctionings. Recently, environmental problems have induced researchers to focus on the qualitative impacts of the CSO discharges. In particular, more efficient CSO devices, such as the high crested side-weir with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifice</b> and many kinds of vortex separator devices, have been proposed by different authors. These devices can perform a relevant reduction of the discharged pollutant loads, besides the usual flow partition function. A further significant improvement of the performances of CSO devices can be obtained by increasing as much as possible the storage capacity of the sewer system. For this objective, the real time control (RTC) has been proven to be a cost-effective solution since {{it is based on the}} activation of existing unused capacities and consequently allows for reducing the need of new storage infrastructures. Schilling reports significant monetary savings achieved by the implementation of RTC for several case studies. Benefits obtained with the implementation of RTC have been shown by different authors by comparing the performances of various urban drainage systems in RTC scenarios and in uncontrolled system scenarios. One common RTC technique is to activate the sewer in-line storage capacity by placing moveable regulators, such as sluice gates, weirs and orifices, into the main trunk sewers. These regulators, if adequately controlled, can reduce the CSO discharges in terms of both water volumes and pollutant masses and can perform also a better regulation of the flows conveyed to the TP. In this paper, the improvement of the performances of a CSO device deriving from the adoption of RTC techniques is analysed in terms of reduction of discharged water volumes and pollutants. In particular, a simple quality-oriented CSO device, the high crested side-weir with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifice,</b> has been considered. This device is made up of a high crested side weir and of a downstream fixed gate with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifice</b> and allows for storing some in-line volume behind the gate until the water level rises up over the weir crest. The storing process leads to reduce the discharge of first flush waters and of pollutants into the receiving water body and to increase the water volumes conveyed to the treatment plant. Benefits obtained with RTC techniques have been evaluated considering moveable sluice gate regulators placed upstream of the CSO device. The control of the gates has been performed adopting a basic local strategy aiming to the activation of the maximum in-line storage. In particular, standard proportional (P) control units have been considered for the regulation of the gate movements. The analysis has been carried out setting up and applying a numerical model to the experimental data of two Italian urban catchments, considering both quantitative and qualitative measurements recorded during several rain events. The implemented model is based on the fully-dynamic De Saint Venant equations for the water flow and on the advection-dispersion equation for the analysis of the pollutants inside the sewer system...|$|E

40|$|A {{negatively}} buoyant jet (NBJ) {{corresponds to}} the physical phenomenon that develops when a fluid is discharged upwards into a lighter environment or downwards into a heavier receptor fluid. In a NBJ the flow is initially driven mostly by the momentum, so it basically behaves as a simple jet released with the same angle, while far from the outlet the buoyancy prevails, bending the jet axis down and making it similar to a plume. The coexistence in the same phenomenon of both the characteristics of simple jets and plumes makes the NBJs a phenomenon still not entirely explained but, considering also the numerous practical applications, very interesting to study. Here some of the experimental results are presented. The laboratory experiment were obtained on a model simulating a typical sea discharge of brine from desalination plants: a pipe laid down on the sea <b>bottom,</b> with <b>orifices</b> on its lateral wall, releasing brine (heavier than the sea water) with a certain angle to the horizontal, {{in order to increase}} the jet path before sinking to the seafloor. A non-intrusive image analysis technique, namely Feature Tracking Velocimetry, is applied to measure velocity fields, with the aim at understanding the influence of some non-dimensional parameters driving the phenomenon (e. g. Reynolds number, release angle) on the structure of the NBJ and of the turbulence. ...|$|R

Fish ladder has two fish entrances: one in the turbine outlet channel and another in the natural river course. Both the most relevant hydraulic values (flow, velocity, volumetric energy dissipation) and biological parameters (movement pattern, attraction, entry and passage) were measured. Biological assessment was conducted in the spawning season using PIT tag technology. The main influence on upstream movement was river discharge. There were no preferences between path selection; and ascent success and transit time were similar between two entrances [...] Results highlight the importance of two access points for improve entrance and decrease migration delay...|$|E

The dam is 13 m high {{and it has}} a pool and weir with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifice</b> fish ladder to let potamodromous fish (Iberian barbel – Luciobarbus bocagei–, Nothern straightmouth nase –Pseudochondrostoma duriense– and brown trout –Salmo trutta–) overcome the obstacle. This fish ladder is being monitored since 2012 : daily trapping and counting fish that reach the last pool; fish passage video recording through orifices and spillways; tagging fish (PIT, Tbar and others) and studying passage metrics (location, entrance, passage time, performance). Results have been analyzed as a function of physical –discharge, temperature, atmospheric pressure– and biological variables –species, sex, size, competition–. Downstream migration is also analyzed to locate fish routes and understand fish behavior. After every research, passage improvement options are detected, accomplished and assessed on next migration season. At this moment, this overall approach has quintupled fish ladder efficiency and it offers lot of information about Iberian fish behavior and their preference under different hydraulic conditions...|$|E

In this paper, one of these devices – the high crested side-weirs with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifice</b> – is analysed. In particular a comparison, in terms of reduction of discharged water volumes and pollutants, between the performances of the high crested CSO device and the more common low crested side-weir is presented. For this purpose, numerical simulations have been run using experimental data concerning flow rates and pollutant concentration measured during different rain events in the urban catchment of Cascina Scala, Italy. A model based on the solution of the fully-dynamic De Saint Venant equations for the water flow and of the advection-dispersion equation for the propagation of pollutants inside the sewer has been implemented and applied. The simulations show the better performances of the analysed high crested CSO device compared to the low crested side-weir...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the flow structure under a partially inundated bridge deck measured by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and flow visualization techniques. The approaching flow was subcritical having Froude number Fin the range 0. 12 similar to 0. 55. The proximity ratio P-r(= ratio of clearance below the bridge deck h {{to the total}} depth of deck D) was varied from 0. 57 to 2. Depending upon the Froude number F and proximity ratio P-r, four types of flow structures under the bridge deck were recognized. In flow Type I, the water surface elevation on the downstream side of bridge deck is slightly lower than the counterpart on the upstream side, and the shear layer formed {{at the bottom of}} upstream girder continuously fluctuates and touches soffit of all girders. In the case of flow Type II, the water surface on downstream side of bridge deck is lower than that on the upstream side and the shear layer originating from the upstream girder impinges near the third cavity between girders. However, in both the cases, the cavities between the girders are completely occupied by vortices. On the contrary, in the cases of flow Type III and flow Type IV, the flow is separated from the upstream girder edge. However, in flow Type III, the separated flow impinges on successive girders and cavities are partially filled by water; while in flow Type IV, the flow is totally separated from the deck <b>bottom</b> like <b>orifice</b> flow. The phenomena of vortex formation within the cavities are discussed for the cases of flow Type I and flow Type II. Also, for the vertical distribution of mean streamwise velocity in the shear layer below bridge deck, the nonlinear regression equations are developed. Using the distributions of measured mean streamwise velocity within the shear layer below the bridge deck at different streamwise distances, the similarity profile is obtained. The mean velocity deficit (u(sl) - u(su)) and representative thickness b(s) are considered as the appropriate characteristic velocity and length scales for developing similarity profile. The proposed characteristic scales provided unique similarity profiles having promising regression coefficient. The similarity profile proposed is suitable for more general case of bridge deck having different bridge girders and even for rectangular block without girder. Further, the turbulence characteristics for the flow below the bridge deck are also presented...|$|R

The growing attention towards environmental problems has consequently determined the necessity of adopting proper combined sewer overflow (CSO) devices able to reduce the pollutant load into receiving waters during rain events. In this paper, one of these devices – the high crested side-weirs with <b>bottom</b> <b>orifice</b> – is analysed. In particular a comparison, in terms of reduction of discharged water volumes and pollutants, between the performances of the high crested CSO device and the more common low crested side-weir is presented. For this purpose, numerical simulations have been run using experimental data concerning flow rates and pollutant concentrations measured during different rain events in the urban catchment of Cascina Scala, Italy. A model based on the solution of the fully-dynamic De Saint Venant equations for the water flow and of the advection-dispersion equation for the propagation of pollutants inside the sewer has been implemented and applied. The simulations show the better performances of the analysed high crested CSO device compared to the low crested side-weir...|$|E
