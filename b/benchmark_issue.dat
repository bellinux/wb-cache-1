40|$|Benchmarking in {{academic}} pharmacy, {{and recommendations for}} the potential uses of benchmarking {{in academic}} pharmacy departments are discussed in this paper. Benchmarking is {{the process by which}} practices, procedures, and performance metrics are compared to an established standard or best practice. Many businesses and industries use benchmarking to compare processes and outcomes, and ultimately plan for improvement. Institutions of higher learning have embraced benchmarking practices to facilitate measuring the quality of their educational and research programs. Benchmarking is used internally as well to justify the allocation of institutional resources or to mediate among competing demands for additional program staff or space. Surveying all chairs of academic pharmacy departments to explore <b>benchmarking</b> <b>issues</b> such as department size and composition, as well as faculty teaching, scholarly, and service productivity, could provide valuable information.

40|$|Abstract. To {{define a}} DTD or a Schema {{is not a}} trivial task. It can be {{compared}} to the task of preparing a data structure or, in some cases, to program that data structure adding some semantic. This makes this task error prone. It is common that a final Schema/DTD supports some special XML structures that should not be considered correct, or that, although these special structures are correct, they are not being correctly managed by the application parsing them. We defend that the possibility to automatically generate XML documents based on a Schema/DTD can help preventing these situations. The generated documents can be used for unit testing and help tuning the Schema/DTD or fixing application problems. They can also assist on <b>benchmarking</b> <b>issues</b> as sometimes developers does not have access to full featured real world documents. In this article we discuss a Perl module (Test::XML::Generator) that provides different mechanisms for automatically generate XML documents based on a DTD and a set of controlling parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Constraint Programming (CP) is a {{very general}} {{programming}} paradigm that proved its efficiency on solving complex industrial problems. Most real-life problems are stochastic in nature, which is usually taken into account through different compromises, such as applying a deterministic algorithm to the average values of the input, or performing multiple runs of simulation. Our goal in {{this paper is to}} analyze different techniques taken either from practical CP applications or from stochastic optimization approaches. We propose a <b>benchmark</b> <b>issued</b> from our industrial experience, which may be described as an On-Line Multi-Choice Knapsack with Deadlines. This benchmark is used to test a framework with four different dynamic strategies that utilize a different combination of the stochastic and combinatorial aspects of the problem. To evaluate the expected future state of the reservations at the time horizon, we either use simulation, average values, systematic study of the most probable scenarios, or yield management techniques. 1...|$|R

From the five policy papers, it is expected that any research projects involving children with mental disabilities will require the compliance with the current statutes and policies but should there emerge a unique case, an extension to one of the policies would have to be undertaken to circumvent ethics in research practices.

40|$|When {{the results}} of {{research}} in the field of robotics are presented to the scientific community, the same question is asked repeatedly: Are the results really reproducible? Regarding <b>benchmarking</b> <b>issues,</b> some technological areas where complex mechatronic devices, such as robots, have a central role are very far from other research areas like physics or chemistry, to name but a few, where reproducibility is always mandatory. Aside from mechatronic complexities, the comparison between two different algorithms in the same conditions is influenced by the experimental validation scenario. In underwater environments, the difficulties for benchmarking characterization increase substantially. This is especially true when the test bed is the sea where uncertainty is high. It is the aim of this article to present a software tool which enables a comparison between two different algorithms when the algorithms are being used to solve the same problem in water tank conditions. This is a preliminary stage before the final validation on the seabed. The evaluated algorithms fall into the three-dimensional (3 -D) image reconstruction context, as a prior step to their autonomous manipulation.

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{an innovative}} formulation for simple linear tetrahedral elements non-sensitive to volumetric locking. Tetrahedral meshes enable {{to deal with}} high deformation by using efficient and robust adaptive meshers - while standard explicit formulations based on linear hexahedral elements with reduced integration and hourglassing stabilization cannot be coupled with efficient remeshing procedures. The principle of this anti-locking modification is to impose the volumetric constraints at each node instead of at each integration point, as {{been done in the}} averaged nodal pressure formulation proposed by Bonet in 1998. However, the modification made here is material independent: the strain tensor is directly modified before any stress or pressure calculus. The formulation is extended to incompressible elasticity and von Mises incompressible isotropic inelasticity (elastic-visco-plasticity). An infinitesimal strain formulation has been chosen in order to obtain a very simple and thus computational time saving algorithm. This choice can be easily justified taking into account the value of the critical time step in explicit simulations, especially for metal-forming processes. Standard elastic and inelastic <b>benchmarks</b> <b>issued</b> from the literature validate qualitatively and quantitatively this promising formulation for quasi-incompressible deformations cases...|$|R

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} many options for storing XML content, {{focusing}} on the native XML database option. This report accesses and studies the maturity of current native XML database implementations and provides an illustrative {{state of the art}} through <b>benchmarking.</b> <b>Issues</b> such as test data generation, lack of XQuery implementations and proprietary API interfaces are presented along with their solutions. The benchmarking process discovered poor standards compliance, missing functionality and areas that still require standardisation. Native storage was compared with relational storage and it was discovered that relational storage can result in better query performance but is less efficient at retrieving entire documents or large chunks of XML data. A document management system was developed on top of the native XML database that was discovered to have the best functional and performance properties. This was done in order to illustrate the effort required to integrate this emerging technology into an application. The report concludes that it is not yet time to make the switch to a native XML database but cautions that as the technology continues to develop at a very fast pace, it will not be long before native XML databases overcome their current weaknesses and become a comparable alternative to a relational database...|$|R
40|$|The {{domestic}} bond markets of the Asia and Pacific region have grown considerably since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, although they remain undeveloped {{relative to the}} region's weight in the world economy. This paper proposes {{that in order to}} encourage further development of these markets, regulators should make them more accessible to foreign borrowers. To that end we offer insights into the nature and mechanics of foreign bond issuance by investigating the key characteristics of 3, 132 foreign bonds issued in 14 countries (other than the United States) between July 1928 and June 2009. We found that the foreign borrowers that tap domestic markets are overwhelmingly of high credit quality and comprise sovereigns, supranationals, and major financial institutions. There is a preference for simple fixed-rate payment structures, which can then be swapped into the currency and coupon type of choice using currency and interest rate derivatives. On the whole, the long-term viability of foreign bond markets appears linked to the presence of highly liquid foreign exchange and derivatives markets that facilitate risk management and transformation, enabling regulation that facilitates cooperation with market participants, the presence of <b>benchmark</b> <b>issues,</b> and competitive pricing between alternate market segments. bond markets; financial market development; foreign bonds...|$|R

40|$|With the {{elimination}} of the federal deficit, the Bank of Canada, the Department of Finance, and financial market participants are examining ways to manage the reduction in the stock of marketable debt. This paper summarizes three different methods ¯ reverse auction, over-the-counter purchases, and conversions ¯ {{that could be used to}} buy back Government of Canada bonds before they mature. The relation between the size of bond <b>benchmark</b> <b>issues</b> and the liquidity of the government securities market is examined. It is argued that the consolidation of bond issues, as well as the maintenance of large benchmarks, tends to enhance market liquidity. Thus, in an environment where the government's marketable debt is shrinking, purchasing off-the-run bonds ahead of maturity and the maintenance of large bond benchmarks helps maintain, and possibly enhances, the liquidity of a government securities market. In discussing the buy-back mechanics, reverse auctions are shown to be similar to conventional bond auctions except that tenders are made for the sale rather than the purchase of securities. Following this, the paper examines two over-the-counter repurchase methods. The first is similar to the coupon-pass approach used by the Federal Reserve. The second is simply direct over-the-counter purchases in the secondary market. Finally, the mechanics that underlie conversions (switches) are shown to be similar to reverse auctions or coupon passes except that the investors receive a liquid bond issue in return for tendering the less-liquid issue.

40|$|The Canadian {{fixed-income}} {{market is}} in the midst of a structural transformation similar to those occurring in other national financial markets around the world. The authors examine recent developments and trends in the market and discuss their possible effects. The simultaneous shrinking of the federal government's financial requirements and steady rise in issues of corporate securities have significantly altered the composition of Canada's fixed-income market. Government of Canada securities constitute a predominant portion of outstanding fixed-income securities and play a pivotal role, serving as benchmarks for the valuation of other traded securities and as a hedging vehicle for market participants trying to control their exposure to risk. The reduced issuance of federal government securities has contributed to a decline in the liquidity of the benchmark market. This raises broader issues regarding the future of the Canadian fixed-income market, since the corporate market is still fairly underdeveloped and illiquid compared with that for Government of Canada issues. There are thus currently few benchmark and hedging alternatives. The federal government is, however, committed to preserving the integrity of the market for <b>benchmark</b> <b>issues</b> and is adopting initiatives to enhance market liquidity and alleviate some of the pressures on the effective supply of these securities. Another evolving trend in the market is the emergence of electronic trading platforms. These platforms have the potential to facilitate the price-discovery mechanism, increase cost efficiency, and improve the liquidity and transparency of the market. ...|$|R
