5|$|The {{first stop}} is District 11, {{the home of}} Katniss' {{deceased}} friend and Hunger Games ally, Rue. During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same gesture {{that she used to}} say farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man is quickly executed <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is Christmas, and Christine {{is having}} dinner with Marion, Ernie, Fung, Bobby and Adam. Christine unwraps her present to find an album of photos from her life. She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. On the front seat & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
5|$|Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and, upon reuniting with Arc, {{discovers that}} the {{rumors of a}} curse on Kazus are not false. The people there are see-through, and one such person, Cid of Canaan, instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia, the mythril smith Takka's adoptive daughter. They find her on the airship, and {{accompany}} her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion. There, they meet Ingus, a soldier of Sasune who has somehow escaped the curse. He joins the trio after an audience with the king, who instructs them to find his daughter, Sara. They catch up {{to her in the}} Sealed Cave, and with her, battle the monster who cast the curse: the Djinn. Just as Sara seals the Djinn away, however, Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus all disappear <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> As it transpires, the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power. After this, Luneth's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune. She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn's curse, but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once. After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off, they go back to Kazus, where Takka drags Refia home. The three boys consult with Cid, and then Takka, who builds a mythril ram on the ship. It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns, and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid's airship, the player would be able to piece together why: she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys, and therefore has to leave. The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in Nelv Valley.|$|E
6000|$|Yet there needed {{not these}} letters {{to guide the}} {{agitated}} spirit of Venetia, for, <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> had reached them, the word was spoken; and falling on <b>her</b> knees <b>before</b> the portrait, the daughter of Lady Annabel had exclaimed, 'My father!' ...|$|R
6000|$|She said nothing, and glancing round, I {{discovered}} that she was walking away, <b>her</b> fingers clasped <b>before</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> cast down, and looking profoundly dejected. Jumping up, I hurried after her. [...] "Listen!" [...] I said, coming to her side. [...] "Do {{you know that there}} are others in the world like you who would understand your speech?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} last, and stood {{trembling}} <b>before</b> <b>her,</b> his <b>eyes</b> aflame, his high cheek-bones faintly tinted. And she measured him very calmly and coldly with <b>her</b> sombre <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
500|$|Wood {{starred in}} 2008's Vadim Perelman-directed The Life <b>Before</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Eyes,</b> {{based on the}} Laura Kasischke novel of the same name, about the {{friendship}} of two teens of opposite character {{who are involved in}} a Columbine-like shooting incident at their school and are forced to make an impossible choice. Wood played the younger version of Uma Thurman's character, Diana. One critic cited her performance as [...] "hands-down extraordinary". Wood stated that she intended the film to be the last one in which she played a teenager.|$|E
500|$|The villagers {{continue}} the harvest festivities, and Albrecht emerges again {{to dance with}} Giselle, who is named the Harvest Queen. Hilarion interrupts the festivities. He has discovered Albrecht's finely made sword and presents it as proof that the lovesick peasant boy is really a nobleman who is promised to another woman. Using Albrecht's hunting horn, Hilarion calls back the party of noblemen. Albrecht has no time to hide and {{has no choice but}} to greet Bathilde as his betrothed. All are shocked by the revelation, but none more than Giselle, who becomes inconsolable when faced with her lover's deception. Knowing that they can never be together, Giselle flies into a mad fit of grief in which all the tender moments she shared with [...] "Loys" [...] flash <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She begins to dance erratically, causing her weak heart to give out. She dies in Albrecht's arms. Hilarion and Albrecht turn on each other in rage before Albrecht flees the scene in misery. The curtain closes as Berthe weeps over her daughter's body.|$|E
500|$|For Chris Bennion, {{writing in}} The Independent, {{the events of}} [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] are a life review; the viewer shares Christine's visions of her life as she lies dying. However, like Christine, the viewer does not realise this until the end. For Bennion, Christine does not merely relive key moments of her life, but {{attempts}} to [...] "snatch at lost moments" [...] as she longs [...] "for second chances". Julie McDowall, who reviewed the episode for The Herald, also considers the viewer [...] "totally immersed in one character's confused and flawed point of view". She argued that [...] "there was no thunderclap moment when the story's twist is spectacularly revealed. There was just the slow and terrible realisation which we shared with Christine. We were with her, thinking 'Oh god no, not that. Don't let it be that!'" [...] Ultimately, claims McDowall, the oddities and confusion in the episode's plot is revealed to be the product of Christine's [...] "brain slowly fading, her memories blinking out, light by light, into darkness". Phoebe-Jane Boyd, whose review of the episode was published on entertainment website Den of Geek, likewise saw the episode as Christine's life flashing <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{with a variety of}} elements from the scene of the crash—police cars, car sounds, the song on the radio—indicative of [...] "her consciousness ... becoming muddled as parts of the car accident crash through into her memories".|$|E
60|$|The sly {{insinuation}} had its effect. Evidently {{the woman}} had a swift vision of a detective in citizens' clothes <b>before</b> <b>her</b> mind's <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm very sorry, indeed," [...] said Dorothy, who {{was truly}} frightened {{to see the}} Witch {{actually}} melting away like brown sugar <b>before</b> <b>her</b> very <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|She declines the {{position}} of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast {{to the people of}} Argentina ("Eva's Final Broadcast"). Eva's achievements flash <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> before she dies ("Montage"), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long life ("Lament"). Eva dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che says that a monument was set to be built for Evita but [...] "only the pedestal was completed, when Evita's body disappeared for 17 years...." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Wonderful {{stories are}} told of her powers over the spectators. Macready relates {{that when she}} played Aphasia in Tamburlaine, after seeing her lover strangled <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> so terrible was her agony as she fell lifeless upon the stage, that the {{audience}} believed she was really dead, and only the assurance of the manager could pacify them. One night Charles Young was playing Beverly to her Mrs. Beverly in The Gamester, and in the great scene was so overwhelmed by her pathos {{that he could not}} speak. Unto the last she received the homage of the great; even the Duke of Wellington attended her receptions, and carriages were drawn up before her door nearly all day long." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, she starred {{opposite}} Luke Wilson in My Super Ex-Girlfriend, {{playing a}} superhero who is dumped by her boyfriend and then takes her revenge upon him. She received $14 {{million for the}} role, but the film was panned by critics and made a modest US$61 million worldwide. Entertainment Weekly {{felt that it was}} a [...] "miscalculation to make Thurman the antagonist. She does a sprightly satiric turn, but [...] wasted in a movie that would rather tweak male paranoia than liberate a nerdette terrified of her powers". In the 2007 film The Life <b>Before</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Eyes,</b> Thurman starred as an accident survivor whose guilt causes her present-day life to fall apart. It received a limited theatrical release and was dismissed by critics as [...] "a confusing, painfully overwrought melodrama".|$|E

2500|$|Nana is Umaru's buxom classmate {{and friend}} who lives by {{herself in the}} ground floor {{apartment}} below the Domas. She is very shy, and is originally from Akita, occasionally reverting to its dialect when nervous. Because of her big breasts, Nana has lack of confidence because most people look at her breasts <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The first person to look her in the eyes is Taihei, whom she later has a crush on and gets flustered whenever he gives her compliments.She later reveals to Taihei that she has an older brother who is working {{at a restaurant in}} Tokyo; Taihei suspects he might have met him on his business trip. She is the main character of a spin-off manga titled [...] after having placed first in a Niconico Seiga poll among the Umaru-chan characters.|$|E
2500|$|Several recent {{movies have}} been filmed in New Haven, {{including}} Mona Lisa Smile (2003), with Julia Roberts, The Life <b>Before</b> <b>Her</b> <b>Eyes</b> (2007), with Uma Thurman, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf. The filming of Crystal Skull involved an extensive chase sequence {{through the streets}} of New Haven. Several downtown streets were closed to traffic and received a [...] "makeover" [...] to look like streets of 1957, when the film is set. 500 locals were cast as extras for the film. In Everybody's Fine (2009), Robert De Niro has a close encounter in what {{is supposed to be the}} Denver train station; the scene was filmed in New Haven's Union Station.|$|E

60|$|Of the two ladies, one {{was well}} {{advanced}} in years; but the high-backed oaken chair {{in which she}} sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table <b>before</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.|$|R
5000|$|Pilot of Getter Hien 2, the Jakofu {{killed her}} parents. Her white hair {{is from the}} shock of losing her parents {{at such a young}} age. They died right <b>before</b> <b>her</b> very <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

60|$|It {{was what}} she dreaded. Swiftly {{everything}} seemed to darken <b>before</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

60|$|The wood floated <b>before</b> <b>her,</b> for <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were {{suffused with}} tears. They rose {{from a deep}} well, long concealed, and her heart was filled with acute pain that found no relief in them.|$|R
6000|$|She made no {{immediate}} answer, but, letting her hands fall idly in her lap, looked straight <b>before</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> beautiful <b>eyes</b> fixed upon vacancy, and her mind amply occupied {{in considering the}} pros and cons of the situation. Then Sir Eustace took heart of grace; bending down, he kissed the Madonna-like face. Still there was no response. Only very gently she pushed him from her, whispering: ...|$|R
