5|$|One of Japan's oldest flags {{is housed}} at the Unpo-ji temple in Yamanashi Prefecture. Legend states {{it was given}} by Emperor Go-Reizei to Minamoto no Yoshimitsu and has <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a family {{treasure}} by the Takeda clan for the past 1,000 years, and at least it is older than 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a generalized upright theropod, with a skull {{similar to that of}} other large theropods and a sail on its back, even having four-fingered hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree onion}} or Egyptian onion {{produces}} bulblets in the umbel instead of flowers, {{and is now}} {{known to be a}} hybrid of A. cepa × A. fistulosum. It has previously <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a variety of A. cepa, for example A. cepa var. proliferum, A. cepa var. bulbiferum, and A. cepa var. viviparum. It has been grown for centuries in Japan and China for use as a salad onion.|$|E

50|$|In {{object-oriented}} programming, programs <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a set {{of interacting}} objects. In functional programming, programs <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, in process-oriented programming, programs <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> sets of concurrent processes acting on logically shared data structures.|$|R
5|$|The white-cheeked nuthatch, with S. przewalskii subsumed within it, {{has been}} {{regarded}} as {{closely related to the}} North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), which has a similar contact call (though S. carolinensisss is moderately higher in pitch), and they have sometimes <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> conspecific. In turn, it has been proposed that the triumvirate of S. przewalskii, S. leucopsis and S. carolinensis could be related to the Sitta canadensis, monophyletic group, corresponding to the subgenus Micrositta, which includes six species of average-sized nuthatches. The relationships remain very unclear. A molecular study by Eric Pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity.|$|E
5|$|This {{thesis of}} a {{maritime}} foundation was {{contrary to the}} general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly {{of at least one}} cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example) but have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} subgenera have been {{proposed}} over the years. For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number of species in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), {{some of which have}} since <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> separate genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original number of species of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included as separate sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888.|$|E

50|$|Any {{employee}} who works 40 {{or more hours}} a week <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> one full-time equivalent. An {{employee who}} works less than 35 hours a week cannot <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a full-time equivalent.

5|$|The genus Bombus, {{the only}} one extant genus in the tribe Bombini, {{comprises}} over 250 species; for {{an overview of the}} differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps, see characteristics of common wasps and bees. The genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera, a degree of complexity criticised by Williams (2008). The cuckoo bumblebees Psithyrus have sometimes <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a separate genus but are now considered to be part of Bombus, in one or more subgenera. Williams identifies 15 subgenera that are seen to be monophyletic, fewer in number, diagnosable from morphology, and at least roughly correspond to behavioural and ecological groupings: Examples of Bombus species include Bombus atratus, Bombus dahlbomii, Bombus fervidus, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus ruderatus, and Bombus rupestris.|$|E
5|$|The {{four main}} Japanese islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido {{lie in a}} convex {{arrangement}} pointing to the Pacific Ocean, while the oceanic trenches that form the western boundary of the Pacific Plate are convex in the opposite direction, toward Eurasia. The continental crust above the subduction zones had previously {{been associated with the}} Eurasian Plate, but northern Honshu and Hokkaido have more recently <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> part of the North American Plate, due to a poorly defined plate boundary between Eastern Siberia and Alaska and a newly forming boundary at the eastern perimeter of the Sea of Japan. This portion of the crust has been known locally as the Okhotsk Plate. The southwestern border of the plate is called the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line. It is a region of faulting that traverses the width of central Honshu, but it has not generated any large earthquakes. Moving westward, though, the Atera, Miboro, Atotsugawa, and Nobi faults have all produced large events. Two of those events occurred beyond the terminus of the 1891 rupture: the 1945 Mikawa earthquake that hit near Nagoya on the Fukozu Fault and the 1948 Fukui earthquake that occurred near the Sea of Japan.|$|E

Agriades franklinii <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a valid species or a subspecies of Agriades glandon.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{motoring}} taxation was {{closely linked to}} the construction of roads until 1937, since when motoring taxation has <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> 'general taxation' with roads competing for funds with other departments on an equal basis.|$|E

5|$|Two other taxa that Czerkas and his co-authors named <b>were</b> later <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> junior {{synonyms}} {{by other}} authors. Czerkas' Cryptovolans <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Microraptor, and his Scansoriopteryx <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Epidendrosaurus. Czerkas described Omnivoropteryx, noting {{that it was}} similar to Sapeornis. Later specimens of Sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous.|$|R

25|$|The African genus Centrioncus (once {{placed in}} Sepsidae, but {{then moved to}} Diopsidae) was once {{recommended}} {{to be treated as}} a separate family, Centrioncidae, a sister group of the diopsids, but since then this lineage has usually <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a subfamily.|$|E
25|$|No {{income tax}} {{enacted by the}} US Congress (either {{before or after the}} Sixteenth Amendment) has ever been apportioned among the states by population.

25|$|There are no set or defined {{characteristics}} of a great power. These characteristics have often <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> empirical, self-evident to the assessor. However, this approach has the disadvantage of subjectivity. As a result, there have been attempts to derive some common criteria and to treat these as essential elements of great power status.|$|E

Accordingly, the conditional probability P ( [...] Y ≤ 1/3 | X [...] ) <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an equivalence class of random variables; as usual, two random variables <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> equivalent {{if they are}} equal almost surely.|$|R
25|$|Carya ovalis {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an {{interspecific}} hybrid between C. glabra and C. ovata.

The relationships may be more complex after a long and reticulate phylogeny, according to detailed chemical analyses of hickory nut oils.|$|E
25|$|De Candolle first {{proposed}} dividing the genus into 12 sections in 1824, {{based on the}} diversity of growth forms. Traditionally {{the large number of}} Pelargonium species have <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> sixteen sections, based on the classification of Knuth (1912) who described 15 sections, as modified by van der Walt et al. (1977-1997) who added Chorisma, Reniformia and Subsucculentia.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the need}} for a cinema law has been {{frequently}} debated throughout the history of the Turkish Republic, until 1986 no specific law or regulation had been developed.
