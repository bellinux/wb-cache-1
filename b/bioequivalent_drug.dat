40|$|The {{principal}} goal of bioequivalence (BE) investigations has crucial {{importance and}} {{has been the subject}} of extensive discussions. BE studies are frequently considered to serve as procedures for sensitive discrimination. The BE investigation should be able to provide methods and conditions sensitively identifying relevant differences between drug products if such differences in fact exist. Alternatively, BE studies can be deemed as surrogates of clinical investigations assessing therapeutic equivalence. <b>Bioequivalent</b> <b>drug</b> products will be provided to patients for their benefits. Both points of view are valid since they represent two aspects of product performance. It has been argued that both should be equally sustained and applied. In practice, however, they collide when regulatory conditions and statements are developed. For instance, some regulators prefer to conduct BE studies following single drug administrations since these conditions are considered to provide the highest sensitivity of discrimination between pharmacokinetic profiles and thus, a product's in-vivo performance. Others suggest that, at least for modified-release products, BE investigations should be performed in the steady state since it represents clinical conditions. Preference for one point of view or the other pervades other regulatory statements including suggestions for subjects to be selected in studies and pharmacokinetic measures to be evaluated. An overview is provided on the disturbing inconsistency of statements within and between regulations. It is argued that harmonization would be highly desirable, and relevant recommendations are offered...|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Use {{of generic}} <b>drugs,</b> which are <b>bioequivalent</b> to brand-name <b>drugs,</b> {{is now a}} common practice. However, there is still concern among {{patients}} and physicians that brand-name drugs are more efficient than generic drugs (1).|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} rising {{prescription}} drug costs {{has emerged as}} a critical policy issue around the world, particularly in the United States. These costs strain the budgets of patients and health insurers, and directly contribute to adverse health outcomes by reducing adherence to im-portant medications. Drug spending is driven by brand-name drugs, which cur-rently account for about 20 % of all prescriptions in the US, but 80 % of costs. Brand-name drugs generally are granted periods of market exclusivity during which they charge high prices to account for the initial investment in research and devel-opment. In the case of small molecule drugs, once the market exclusivity period ends, competitors producing <b>bioequivalent</b> generic <b>drugs</b> can enter the market, and the drug price quickly falls. In this week’s PLOS Medicine, Nathalie Vernaz and colleagues study the consequences of this delicate balancing act going awry due to the cumulative effects of so-called life-cycle management (or ‘‘evergreening’’) strate-gies employed by the drug’s manufacture...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{scenario}} generic drugs {{have an important}} role in pharmaceutical market. Generic <b>drugs</b> are <b>bioequivalent</b> to brand <b>drugs</b> and are much cheaper as compared to brand drugs because of no R&D cost and minimum marketing expenses, hence accelerating competition in pharmaceutical drug market. The applicant has to file ANDA with FDA to get generic drug approval. There are hurdles which delay the timely introduction of generic drugs into the market: use of authorized generics, continued misuse of the Citizen Petition process, the use of Free Trade Agreements and the patent reform. Still there is room for growth, because generic market is undergoing significant change, with intense merger and acquisition activity, a raft of upcoming patent expiries and new legislations being enacted to promote generic prescription in the major markets...|$|R
40|$|Background: Generic {{ciclosporin}} A modified (CsA) {{does not}} have an equivalent pharmacokinetic profile to branded CsA in some transplant populations, potentially leading to negative clinical consequences and increased long-term costs. Objective: To assess direct healthcare costs for de novo renal transplant recipients in the US receiving branded versus generic CsA in the first month after transplantation. Methods: Administrative claims data from eight private US health plans were linked to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data. A total of 227 renal transplant cases between 1996 and 2004 were included: 183 were dispensed branded CsA and 44 received generic CsA. Log transformed multiple linear regression was used to model total first-year healthcare costs after the initial CsA claim, controlling for both patient demographics and clinical characteristics and clustering at the transplant centre level. Results: After controlling for patient factors and pre-CsA costs, total healthcare costs were significantly higher (p[*]-[*] 0. 04) for patients receiving generic CsA versus branded CsA. The main driver for the difference was the cost associated with immunosuppressants other than CsA (p[*]-[*] 0. 01). Conclusions: Despite initial perceived cost savings associated with generic CsA, de novo renal transplant recipients incurred greater total healthcare costs than those treated with branded CsA. Patients receiving generic CsA may need higher doses or other immunosuppressants to maintain the transplanted kidney than patients receiving branded CsA. Providers and payers {{need to be aware of}} potential differences in total healthcare costs between formulations of <b>bioequivalent</b> critical-dose <b>drugs</b> to make the best choice for patient care.

40|$|Inhaled {{therapy is}} key to the {{management}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). New drugs and inhalers have recently been launched or will soon become available, and the expiry of patent protection covering several currently used inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids will be accompanied by the development of <b>bioequivalent,</b> generic inhaled <b>drugs.</b> Consequently, a broader availability of branded and generic compounds will increase prescription opportunities. Given the time course of COPD, patients are likely to switch drugs and inhalers in daily practice. Switching from one device to another, if not accompanied by appropriate training for the patient, can be associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased use of health care resources. In fact, while it seems reasonable to prescribe generic inhaled drugs to reduce costs, inadequate use of inhaler devices, which is often associated with a poor patient–physician or patient–pharmacist relationship, {{is one of the most}} common reasons for failure to achieve COPD treatment outcomes. Further research is needed to quantify, as in asthma, the impact of inappropriate switching of inhalers in patients with COPD and show the outcomes related to the effect of using the same device for delivering inhaled medications...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Background: Epilepsy is {{frequently}} debilitating and switching between <b>bioequivalent</b> antiepileptic <b>drugs</b> (AEDs) with narrow therapeutic index remains controversial. Methods: We investigated {{the association between}} A-rated switching and emergent treatment for an epilepsy-related event over a 1 -year period using recent claims data from the Truven Health MarketScan® Commercial Database. Cases and matched controls with a diagnosis of epilepsy were identified using emergency services and inpatient visits or outpatient visit claims, respectively. Cases and controls were matched using a 1 : 1 ratio for age within 5 years of the case's age and seizure diagnosis category. The exposure was defined as an A-rated switch of an AED during the 90 days prior to index date. Adjusted analyses controlled for matching, sex, AED type (older vs. newer AEDs), Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index score, and total number of AED prescription filled. Results: 1, 873 of 7, 843 (24 %) cases and 1, 566 matched controls (20 %) experienced an A-rated switch. The unadjusted odds of an epilepsy-related event were 1. 26 for switchers (95 % CI: 1. 17 - 1. 36), and after controlling for all confounders, 1. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 06 - 1. 25). Compared with other AEDs, switching of carbamazepine and phenytoin is associated with increased risk of epilepsy-related events. Discussion: Individuals with epilepsy who switch between A-rated formulations of AEDs {{are more likely to}} experience an emergently treated epilepsy-related event compared with individuals who do not switch. Compared with newer AEDs, switching of some older AEDs such as carbamazepine and phenytoin is associated with increased risk of epilepsy-related events. Effective management of epilepsy requires clinicians, pharmacists, and patients to understand the factors associated with bioequivalent medication substitutions. Physicians and pharmacists should actively seek to prevent switching of anti-epileptic medications once patients are stabilized on a specific product - whether branded or generic version. Such switching increases the odds of an epileptic event...|$|R
40|$|Due {{diligence}} in {{the process}} of pro-vision of healthcare services refers, among other elements, to the appli-cation of pharmacological therapy at a time which offers the greatest chance for a successful outcome of treatment, i. e. for achieving the op-timum expected effect understood as an improvement in the patient’s health, reduction of health risks or elimination of the disease. However, due diligence may also refer to actions aimed at ensuring that neither the pa-tient nor the healthcare payer is re-quired to incur unreasonable costs {{in the process}} of treatment. The validity of that statement stems not only from normative acts but also from ethical standards laid down in the Medical Code of Ethics (Article 57 section 2). It often happens that the provision of optimal treatment calls for deviations from the formal provisions included in Summary Product Characteristics (SPCs), and the application of <b>drugs</b> that are <b>bioequivalent</b> to reference <b>drugs,</b> which translates into a significant reduction of costs. The present study addresses the problem of acceptabili-ty of a specific form of drug substitu-tion consisting in the replacement of a reference drug with a generic drug. Also explored are legal aspects asso-ciated with the possibility of therapy based on “off-label use”. The study reviews normative acts ex-isting in the Polish and EU legislation. It also provides a clear definition of or-phan drug, which has made it possible to make a distinction and investigate mutual relations between the con-cepts of brand-name (reference) drug, orphan drug and generic drug. Key words: brand-name drug, orphan drug, generic drug, bioequivalence of medicinal products, “off-label use”...|$|R
