40|$|Summary: Compliance {{with animal}} welfare and {{environmental}} health principles and <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> {{has an impact on}} {{the quantity and quality of}} the animal products produced. The quantity and quality of livestock and livestock products influences demand and prices and has an effect on income from the livestock industry and ultimately on gross domestic product (GDP) and food security. Environmental health on the other hand influences either negatively (in poor) or positively (in good) environmental health situations thereby has impact on the quantity and quality of livestock and livestock products and the level of contribution to GDP and food security. Both animal welfare {{and environmental health}} principles are well adhered to when adequate <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> provisions are implemented and enforced. Good, enforceable <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> and good <b>veterinary</b> governance are prerequisites for ensuring secure sanitary conditions and food safety and preventing the spread of animal diseases, and ultimately they enhance incomes and ensure the availability of wholesome food, thereby contributing to GDP and food security. It is therefore important to integrate these three components, namely animal welfare, environmental health and <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation,</b> in livestock production and marketin...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of the Law on the {{veterinary}} activities from 2005 and its amendments 2006 - 2016 In {{the second part}} of the report an analysis is made of the philosophic nature and the main principles regulated by the Law on the {{veterinary activities}} from 2005 in their antiepizootic part. The pros and cons of the approaches used in European and world practice in <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> drafting are highlighted. One of the approaches includes only basic and constant principles of <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation,</b> while the other presents all regulatory norms with dynamic character that require periodic updating of the legislative basis. An analysis also is made of the dynamics of the amendments and additions of certain articles and paragraphs of the Law on the veterinary activities for the period 2006 - 2016 and their adequacy to the antiepizootic activities is assessed. An attempt is made to analyze the interrelationship and interdependence between the legal regulations of additions and amendments to the LVA and the material-technical, organizational and structural conditions for their practical implementation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{scientific}} analysis is to trace the genesis and development of <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> from 1881 to 2015, focusing on its anti-epizootic aspects. For this study the historical and dialectical and systematic approach and analysis were applied. The {{first part of the}} analysis covers the period until 2005 – the stage before the accession of the country to EU. There the first legislative acts from the post-liberation period 1897 - 1906 are analyzed, which {{marked the beginning of the}} regulated anti-epizootic activity, delegated as a primary duty of the state institutions. Special attention is paid to the Law on sanitary-veterinary service from 1924, elaborated by Prof. G. Pavlov, which laid down the foundations of the Public Veterinary Medicine in Bulgaria. An analysis is made of the basic principles in the legislative basis in the period of centralized planning (1945 - 1990) and the period of transition to market economy (1990 - 2004) before the accession of Bulgaria to the EU. The retrospective analysis of all laws from this 120 -year period shows that <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> has developed in line with the socio-political and economic conditions in the country, but it has always been in accordance with the international legal norms. The second part of the analysis, which includes the period following the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the EU, will interpret the organizational and legal, structural, professional, deontological, financial economic aspects and problems which occurred after the establishment of Bulgarian Food Safety Agency in order to improve the system related to animal health and food safety...|$|R

In England and Wales salmonellas were isolated from 7 % of caecal samples and 6 % of lymph node samples, while in Denmark they were isolated from 3 % of caecal samples and 4 % of lymph node samples. In England and Wales 25 serotypes were found in both pigs and feeds and these included nearly all the most prevalent human pathogens. In Denmark {{four of the six}} serotypes in pigs had been found in resterilized feed. One notable difference between the two studies was the very wide range of serotypes found in pigs in England and Wales and the narrow range in Denmark.

Setting of new game rules makes Albanian society walk safer in a process of integration, where the EU principles are inserted even better in domestic laws. Core legislation, food safety and veterinary fields, are some prerequisites that Albania should meet in its way towards full membership in the EU. For a long time now, Albania has been establishing new food and feed standards and all its actions are in full compliance with EU regulations and directives. In addition to adequate policies to enforce better the current legislation in respect with an effective consumer protection, it is worth mentioning full reforming and streamlining of functioning institutions in the framework of food safety. The <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> is a main discipline of veterinary medicine regulating veterinary service relations with food business operators.

40|$|The South African {{food safety}} and animal food control systems are {{developed}} and enforced by three government departments: Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Animal health relies heavily on veterinary drugs for controlling pests and diseases. Movement of animals and animal products, is also a potential method of transmission of pests and diseases within and between countries. Human health is inextricably linked to animal health and production through zoonotic and foodborne hazards. By eating animal products (meat, milk, eggs, etc.), humans are exposed to microbiological hazards and chemical residues. This paper will describe and critically review the relevant legislation and regulations {{as well as their}} implementation, highlighting discrepancies and overlaps. Four working groups of eight key informants performed a gap analysis and defined actions and steps to remedy the gaps for: 1) Legislation for the registration for veterinary drugs and pesticides in animal feeds; 2) Animal health <b>legislation,</b> including <b>veterinary</b> public health, biosecurity and animal diseases; 3) Microbiological hazards and chemical residues in food of animal origin; and 4) Laboratory capacity for residues and animal diseases surveillance and monitoring. There is a shortage of academic institutions devoted to teach applied regulatory toxicology and aquatic animal health. Furthermore, due to duplication of activities from two authorities regulating the registration of veterinary medicines and stock remedies, there is poor utilization of scare skills for surveillance, monitoring and evaluators responsible for human food safety evaluation of drugs intended for food animals. Food safety of animal products is fragmented as a result of it not being under only one Ministry. Different aspects of legislations fall under the three departments. Lines of responsibility are not always well understood as they sometimes overlap and inconsistently applied. There are also a number of stakeholders involved at local, regional and international level. International standards in line with Codex, World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), are followed, in line with international obligations. National governments and private sector standards are applied by producers and processors of animal derived food. At local level there are provincial and municipal regulations for implementation of National directives, as well as private standards of supermarkets, butchers, dairies and other retailers of animal derived foods. In conclusion, South Africa needs to have one broad <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> which covers animal disease control, registration and control of veterinary drugs (including insecticides manufactured for administration to animals), food safety including food protection, prevention and elimination of zoonoses and aspects of laboratory animal facilities and diagnostic laboratories, health education and extension...|$|R

Two of the strains, Bacillus anthracis FD 111 and FD 112, are Aro- mutants derived by Tn 916 mutagenesis of B. anthracis UM 23 - 1. Bacillus subtilis PA 1 and PA 2 contain a recombinant plasmid, pPA 101 or pPA 102, respectively, that carries the gene from B. anthracis encoding synthesis of protective antigen (PA). The final strain, B. subtilis PA 7, was isolated in this study from B. subtilis DB 104 transformed with pPA 101. All five strains were less virulent in guinea pigs and A/J and CBA/J mice than the toxinogenic, nonencapsulated <b>B.</b> anthracis <b>veterinary</b> vaccine Sterne strain.

40|$|Abstract The global dairy industry, the {{predominant}} pathogens causing mastitis, {{our understanding of}} mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. This paper aims to discuss changes {{in each of these}} aspects. Globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. In many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis and an increase in the relative impact of Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli mastitis. In some countries, Klebsiella spp. or Streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. Differences between countries in <b>legislation,</b> <b>veterinary</b> and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. For pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. For pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. The genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. Genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. These developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control. </p...|$|R
40|$|Blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are pests in the {{livestock}} and labour-intensive farming systems along the major rivers in South Africa. Since 1995, blackflies have been controlled in the Orange River with the larvicide Bacillus thuringienses var. israelensis (Bti). During 2006 – 2007, {{the views of}} livestock farmers concerning blackfly annoyance were determined by means of questionnaires. The results of the questionnaires were substantiated by seasonal abundance surveys of the sub-adult stages of blackflies, conducted in 2007 at 13 sites in the Orange River and 11 sites in the Vaal River. More than half (52 %) of the 39 participating farmers along the Orange River and 79 % of the 52 participating farmers along the Vaal River stated that they experienced severe blackfly problems. The majority of farmers were unaware {{of the availability of}} products {{that could be used to}} protect their animals against blackfly attacks and were willing to be involved in blackfly research. High numbers of blackfly sub-adult stages found in both rivers supported the high annoyance levels reported by the respondents. Simulium chutteri, Simulium damnosum s. l., Simulium hargreavesi, Simulium adersi and Simulium alcocki were identified at Christiana and Delportshoop on the Vaal River, whilst S. chutteri, S. damnosum s. l., S. adersi, S. alcocki and Simulium gariepense were identified at Marksdrift and Ses Bridge on the Orange River. Despite the extensive control of blackflies, farmers still experience problems and this contention is supported by surveys conducted along the rivers. C.

40|$|The project {{provided}} {{the assistance of}} an expert in ostrich production and marketing, who visited Namibia between 15 March and 11 April 1992. Following discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Veterinary Department, the Department of Wildlife, Conservation and Research, ostrich producers, processors and feed suppliers, and visits to ostrich farms, research stations, a tannery and an abattoir, a report was prepared analysing {{the current state of}} the industry, and the policy options open to your Government for its further development. Ostrich farming began in the early 1980 s and has expanded very rapidly. Government monitoring and control has developed piecemeal and involves three departments in two ministries. The collection and analysis of statistics in respect of the industry is, however, inadequate. The main product at the present time is fertile eggs for hatching, and the main market the USA. The inflated price paid for eggs - an egg for export is worth as much as a 14 -month old bird on the local market - is an incentive to increase production of eggs alone as rapidly as possible. The market for eggs will not, however, be unlimited and their export is helping create a situation whereby the purchasing countries will soon be able to provide their own stock. The inflated market for eggs is detrimental to the long-term future of the ostrich industry in Namibia. The ostrich industry is currently growing much faster than would be possible without egg exports, but it is developing without the equipment and expertise for incubating and rearing large numbers of chicks on which a long-term industry will need to be based. This concentration on the export of reproductive material has severely curtailed the operation of secondary industries and the development of product marketing. On the other hand, Namibia can anticipate a significant share of a long-term market if the industry in the country develops correctly in the next few years. It must, however, be ready to face competition from many other countries. Moreover, a collapse in prices, due to a falling demand for reproductive material, would have a severe effect on production, unless measures are taken to promote investment in long-term capacity for the production and processing of slaughter birds. The immediate challenge is to provide for the transition between egg export and such production. It is therefore recommended that your Government recognise the ostrich industry as part of a broader agricultural sector and allocate resources, particularly in the research and <b>veterinary</b> areas, accordingly. <b>Legislation</b> should be enacted to replace the present ad hoc arrangement of exemptions to laws and regulations, and a Species Management Plan needs to be prepared in order to avoid any problems with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is recommended that a policy be adopted to promote the gradual passage from the live export market to a rearing and processing industry, by the imposition of an export quota linked to the industry's annual reproductive capacity, thereby encouraging investment in incubation and rearing technology for the birds that are not exported. Great care needs to be taken in establishing the quota level...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of Arachno-Entomology in Berlin {{will be shown}} by veterinary point of view. Due to the complex subject and lack of references {{there can be no}} demand of com-pleteness. The result of the statistics is the basic idea for further historical research. The subject in the beginning is the systematic of arthropology {{and on the other hand}} the ori-gin of Berlin. The oldest tradition of Parasitolgy and especially of Arachno-Entomology goes back to Aristoteles (* 384 –† 322 B. C.) and Hippokrates (* 460 –† 377 <b>B.</b> C.). From <b>veterinary</b> point of view Berlin gives an idea of that period first in the 16. th century. The first „Marstallveterinäre“ were bind by oath from Kurfürst Joachim Friedrich von Brandenburg (* 1546 –† 1608). The theologian, linguist and educationist Johann Leon-hard Frisch (* 1666 –† 1743) published his major work in 13 parts “ Beschreibungh von allerley Insecten in Teutsch-Land. Nebst nützlichen Annmerkungen und Abbildungen. Von diesem [...] . Gewürme. “ (* 1720 –† 1738). Friedrich II., König von Preußen (* 1712 –† 1786), introduced the title „Arztschmied“. Friedrich Wilhelm II. (* 1744 –† 1797) set up the „École Veterinaire” in 1790. It can be seen as a root of a continuous and comparable arachno-entomological research of bioscientific, veterinary and medical view in Berlin. In the beginning of that school arachno-entomological knowledge was collectet from the whole european continent and arranged. in Berlin. Beside of the „Königliche Thier-arzneischule zu Berlin” the archono-entomolgy was influenced by the untiring work of the lawyer and scientist of nature G. Kraatz (* 1831 –† 1909). He was founder of the “En-tomolgischen Museums”, one of the founders of an “Entomolgischen Gesellschaft” and of the first “Berliner Entomolgischen Zeitung”. The veterinary arachno-entomology was developed in Berlin by personalities like J. G. Naumann (* 1754 –† 1836), E. F. Gurlt (* 1794 –† 1882), A. Ch. Gerlach (* 1811 –† 1877) etc. for the last 200 years. Later one it was more and more determined as an important part of the infectional biology. The im-portant arachno-entomological scientists of Berlin were shown in a “line of ancestors”. The priority of tis dissertation is concentrated by the academic educational institution, the institut of bee-science (Institut für Bienenkunde) and the entomological museum. The first part is documented till 1945, the second part the time after world war II., including the expedition in foreign countries up to the present time. Alltogether there were more than 1300 scientific publications to the subject of arachno-entomological in Berlin...|$|R
40|$|The Cambridge Infectious Diseases Consortium (CIDC) was {{established}} to provide a multi-institutional, world class quality environment for infectious disease research addressing important questions and for the recruitment and training of high quality veterinarians into careers in infectious disease research. The programme has been a demonstrable success in achieving these overall aims. The institutions that have {{played a key role}} in the consortium include the Department of Veterinary Medicine, the Department of Zoology and The Department of Pathology in the University of Cambridge, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI), The Animal Health Trust, The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), The Institute of Animal Health (IAH), The Institute of Zoology (London: IOZ) and the University of Pretoria. In terms of research infrastructure, the programme has successfully consolidated or established research and education collaborations with all of the participating institutions, including VLA, IAH, IOZ, WTSI and AHT. Since the inception of CIDC, additional collaborative research funds have supported collaborative projects in infectious disease dynamics with all of these institutions. Subject areas have included bovine Tuberculosis, Bluetongue serotype- 8 vaccination, bat rabies and other viral infections and swine and equine influenza. On the education and training front, the programme has successfully: a) 	introduced 23 veterinarians into research programmes (far more than the 14 initially planned for at the application stage); a further 2 veterinarians have been funded on other, external funds and 3 of the current fellowship have gained their own personal Fellowship funding from the Wellcome Trust and are now completing their PhDs within CIDC. Of the 22, 11 have successfully completed PhD or other programmes. These fellows have been placed in research programmes in 4 University of Cambridge departments, VLA, IAH, AHT, IOZ and Sanger (WTSI). Diseases studied have included Foot and Mouth Disease, avian influenza, swine and equine influenza, henipaviruses and rabies like viruses in bats, bovine Tuberculosis (problem herds) and Tuberculosis in wild living mammals (meerkats). Without specific additional funding, this programme will be difficult to sustain, although some aspects of it have been taken up by the Wellcome Trust. However, importantly, the programme has demonstrated very clearly that we can provide veterinarians with no prior research experience with an excellent training environment which can prepare them to be independent, internationally competitive research scientists. 	 	The success of the programme is demonstrated clearly by the positions that these graduate students have gone on to; 10 of these 11 are in fully funded postdoctoral positions, including within Defra funded programmes in VLA and IAH and on a number of Wellcome Trust programmes. A further 11 are still on time to complete. b) 	established a training programme for practicing veterinarians in clinical research methods and trained a large number (67) through this course. This is a far greater number than initially envisaged. The course is now a registered with the RCVS and a financial structure for its sustainability has been identified. c) 	established an infectious disease dynamics (DDU) / epidemiology unit in Cambridge University with links into several other departments which is now undertaking high quality infectious disease research in animals. The interactions of DDU members across the consortium has resulted in a substantial change in the nature of the science that others have been undertaking. Individuals in DDU have gained their own personal funds. A key infectious disease modelling course developed during the 5 years of the CIDC funding has now been taken up and run as a highly successful Wellcome Trust Advanced Course. The outputs from scientist have been published in highest ranking journals, including in the last 2 years in Science, PLoS Biology and Journal of the Royal Society Interface, as well as in many leading discipline specific journals such as Journal of Virology, Proceedings of Royal Society (<b>B),</b> Equine <b>veterinary</b> Journal, International Journal of Biostatistics and Vaccine. d) 	provided an excellent environment for post-doctoral training in infectious disease dynamics, with 2 of the post-docs working in CIDC programmes having gained their own Fellowship funding as a result (with further scientists being attracted in from the outside). Within the environment in Cambridge, this personal funding provides a key mechanism for sustaining the programme. e) 	established a new 3 rd year undergraduate honours course, the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases (DID) course, focused on the dynamics of animal and zoonotic infections. Significant proportions (> 25 %) of all Cambridge veterinary students have been selecting this voluntary course, as well as a proportion of natural scientists and medical students. The course is now being sustained with support from the University. We have also provided high quality training in transboundary disease control, particularly for clinical veterinary students in their 5 th year. Research The directly funded research programme in Mammalian Influenza A dynamics was the subject of a sub-contract with The Animal Health Trust in Newmarket. The programme has met all milestones and achieved all objectives in the funded programme of research in the quantitative dynamics of mammalian (swine and equine) influenza. In particular, we have: - successfully undertaken long chain influenza transmission studies in both pigs and horses with viruses adapted for transmission in the two respective species. Studies in both species were undertaken in both immunologically naïve animals, as well as in animals that had partial immunity derived from traditional vaccination approaches. These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that rates of within and between host adaptation, or mutation rates of the adapted viruses are higher in animals which have prior immunity which therefore drives selection, particularly at transmission. - with additional funding from the Wellcome Trust, including individual fellowships, successfully developed a sequencing pipeline at WTSI for deep sequencing analysis of the viral genetic diversity found within individual hosts. We have studied samples from pigs and horses infected in experiments by the natural respiratory contact transmission route and have also started to use the approach to study naturally occurring epidemics in both vaccinated (Newmarket) and naïve (Australian) hosts. The results have demonstrated that a) there is considerable diversity of viruses within natural hosts b) a considerable proportion of this diversity transmits, at least between immunologically naïve hosts and c) transmission chains longer than those practically achievable experimentally in large animals are often needed for changes at the consensus level to occur. This work has formed the basis for important aspects of the Combating Swine Influenza (COSI) awards. We have also studied adaptation of an avian virus in swine tissues including natural, air interface, pig tracheal explants. - demonstrated, using cutting edge antigenic cartographic methods, the key antigenic determinants in equine H 3 N 8 influenza and how this virus has evolved over 40 years. It has also quantified issues of original antigenic sin following equine influenza vaccination which have broad applicability to the study of repeated dosing with multivalent vaccinal products. The programme has exceeded all commitments made through high quality delivery and generation of additional funding based on the core support from Defra and Hefce. It has has met all milestones agreed at the outset. Importantly, the highly successful fellowship programme has addressed the key objective of the Veterinary Training and Research Initiative (VTRI) in successfully demonstrating the potential for introducing large numbers of veterinarians into high quality research careers.
