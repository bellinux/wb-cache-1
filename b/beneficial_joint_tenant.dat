50|$|Rights {{that arise}} by {{operation}} of law often arise by design of certain contingencies set forth in a legal instrument.

Nothing needs {{to be put in}} writing to affirm that this will happen. <b>Joint</b> <b>tenants</b> with rights of survivorship create a similar situation. <b>Joint</b> <b>tenants</b> with rights of survivorship deeds are always taken in equal shares, and when one <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> dies, the other tenants equally acquire title by virtue of the terms of the conveyance itself, by operation of law.|$|R

40|$|Joint tenancy and tenancy {{in common}} are {{for all intents and}} {{purposes}} the only means of co-ownership of real or personal property in Western Australia. <b>Joint</b> <b>tenants</b> hold the whole property jointly and nothing separately. Tenants in common, on the other hand, have a distinct share in the property. There are two essential features that distinguish a joint tenancy from a {{tenancy in common}}. The first feature is the right of survivorship: upon the death of one <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> his interest in the property is extinguished and the interest of the surviving <b>joint</b> <b>tenants</b> is correspondingly enlarged. Upon the death of a tenant in common his interest in the property passes under his will or intestacy. The second feature is the presence of four unities: in order for there to be a joint tenancy there must be unity of title, interest, time and possession. Although the four unities may be present in a tenancy in common, the only unity which is essential is unity of possession...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the true}} {{nature and extent of}} the {{interest}} of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenant,</b> as distinct from their joint interest in the property itself? Can the joint tenancy itself constitute property? And, will the extent of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenant’s</b> interest always be an undivided moiety? This paper reviews two recent decisions: Peldan v Anderson (2006) 80 ALJR 1588 and Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 7. At first instance, the court in Peldan v Anderson conceptualised the severance of a joint tenancy as a transfer of property. This was discussed also in the Federal Court decision and in the High Court on appeal. The Federal Court analysed the severance of a joint tenancy in terms of the alienation of a bundle of rights, indicating an understanding of a joint tenancy as itself a property interest. This paper uses Penner’s challenge to the ‘bundle of rights’ theory of property as a framework to reject this. Having determined the nature of a joint tenancy as other than property, the paper refers to Cummins to examine the extent of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenant’s</b> property interest. This case shows a contemporary application of equitable rules that result in the deconstruction of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenant’s</b> undivided moiety. Together, these cases highlight the challenges associated with finding the true extent of ‘ownership’ and ‘property’ where a joint tenancy is involved...|$|R

40|$|In Hein v. W. T. Rawleigh Co. {{a husband}} and wife {{acquired}} real property in joint tenancy with the wife furnishing all the consideration. However, prior to this acquisition there had been a judgment entered against the husband in another action. The husband conveyed his rights to his wife who later died. Held: The wife’s devisee was entitled to have title to the property quieted subject to the judgment creditor’s lien on an undivided half. This decision presents the alternative questions: (1) whether a judgment lien on one <b>joint</b> <b>tenant’s</b> rights continues undisturbed after a severance caused by release of the debtor’s rights or (2) whether after severance the lien attaches to his severed interest and ceases as to the <b>joint</b> <b>tenant’s</b> rights. In conclusion, this case changes no existing rule of law. Liens may attach to a <b>joint</b> <b>tenant’s</b> rights and may become liens against the whole estate or be lost completely depending on who takes by the right of survivorship. If the property is severed during the lifetime of the tenants, the lien attaches to the judgment debtor’s share. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the point at}} which the <b>joint</b> <b>beneficial</b> tenancy under the default rule in Stack v Dowden [2007] 2 AC 432 is severed so as to give rise to a tenancy in common under which the co-owners have distinct and separate beneficial shares in the family home. The answer to this question may have an important practical consequence if one of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenants</b> dies during the period of co-ownership and (in the absence of any severance by mutual agreement or written notice under s. 36 (2) of the Law of Property Act 1925) the deceased's estate claims there was a fresh and different common intention to share beneficially as tenants in common generating an automatic severance of the joitn tenancy which (in turn) brought to an end any right of survivorship in favour of the survinging <b>joint</b> <b>tenant.</b> A number of options present themselves but none of these, in the writers' view, provide an entirely satisfactory answer. Is it possible for the joint tenancy to be severed immediately at the point of acquisition? Alternateively, does severance occur when the parties common intention alters post-acquisition as a result of subsequent events? Failing that, will the commencement of legal proceedings seeking a declaration as to the parties' respective shares operate as an effectual severance?
