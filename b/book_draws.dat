40|$|A $k$-page <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> of a graph $G=(V,E) $ {{consists}} of a linear ordering of its vertices along a spine and an assignment of each edge {{to one of the}} $k$ pages, which are half-planes bounded by the spine. In a <b>book</b> <b>drawing,</b> two edges cross if and only if they are assigned to the same page and their vertices alternate along the spine. Crossing minimization in a $k$-page <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> is NP-hard, yet book drawings have multiple applications in visualization and beyond. Therefore several heuristic <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> algorithms exist, but there is no broader comparative study on their relative performance. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark set of challenging graph classes for <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> algorithms and provide an extensive experimental study of the performance of existing <b>book</b> <b>drawing</b> algorithms.

25|$|The Secret Battle is a {{novel by}} A. P. Herbert, first {{published}} in 1919. The <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> upon Herbert's experiences as a junior infantry officer in the First World War, and has been praised for its accurate and truthful portrayal of the mental effects {{of the war on}} the participants. It was one of the earliest novels to contain a detailed description of Gallipoli, or to challenge the Army's executions of soldiers for desertion. It is noticeable as being sharply different from Herbert's later work—there is no note of humour or lightness in the novel, simply a stark and simple narrative.|$|E

Meanwhile, Constant Mown, son of Prostetnic Jeltz, convinces {{his father that}} {{the people on the}} planet are not citizens of Earth, but are, in fact, citizens of Nano, which means that it would be illegal to kill them. As the <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> to a close, Arthur {{is on his way to}} check out a possible university for Random, when, during a hyperspace jump, he is flung across alternate universes, has a brief encounter with Fenchurch, and ends up exactly where he would want to be.

It has been noted that the <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> on material from The Reshuffle, a satirical political skit by Rao that was published by Mainstream in 1984. The book was renamed The Insider, the new title suggested by Kalyani Shankar, political editor at The Hindustan Times. The Insider was released in 1998 by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a function in Delhi that had two former prime ministers and a president in attendance.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Leigh Fermor {{decided to}} walk the length of Europe, from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (Istanbul). He set off on 8 December 1933, {{less than a year}} after Hitler had come to power in Germany, with a few clothes, several letters of introduction, the Oxford Book of English Verse and a Loeb volume of Horace's Odes. He slept in barns and shepherds' huts, but also was invited by landed gentry and {{aristocracy}} into the country houses of Central Europe. He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way. Two of his later travel books, A Time of Gifts (1977) and Between the Woods and the Water (1986), were about this journey. A book on the final part of his journey was unfinished at the time of Leigh Fermor's death, but was published as The Broken Road: Travels from Bulgaria to Mount Athos in September 2013 by John Murray. The <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> on Leigh Fermor's diary at the time and on an early draft he wrote in the 1960s.|$|E

Gutman concluded that most black families largely remained intact despite slavery. Gutman further argued that black families also remained intact during {{the first wave of}} migration to the North after the Civil War (although he remained open to arguments about black family collapse in the 1930s and 1940s).|$|E

[...] The review noted the author's expertise in the subject matter, [...] "The <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> on the author's expertise as a counterterrorism (CT) officer and Arabic linguist, and his experience studying AQ in the field, including in combat." [...] Fahoum concluded, [...] "An End to Al-Qaeda is a good read for those analysts in the CT community still developing their understanding of information operations and understanding {{the role of religion}} in the battle between AQ and the rest of the world's Muslims".|$|E
2500|$|Kay's Phantom {{is not a}} sequel, {{but rather}} a retelling of the {{original}} Leroux novel. While the <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> mainly from Leroux's text, there are also obvious references to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical: several phrases from the musical's lyrics are used to describe certain circumstances in the book. There are also nods to the Lon Chaney film version of the story. The character of Javert shares his name with the obsessive police captain who hunts Jean Valjean for twenty years in Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. [...] The storyline surrounding Erik's vain, childish mother bears some glancing similarities to Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary; like Emma Bovary, {{she lives in a}} stultifyingly provincial town and is courted by a medical man.|$|E

For the author, the criminal organizations in Mexico are not gangs; they are a [...] "movement and an industry drawing in hundreds of thousands from bullet-ridden barrios to marijuana-growing mountains". The book explains how the cartels have created paramilitary death squads with tens of thousands of armed men from the country of Guatemala to the Texan border. It contains testimonies from members inside of the cartels; and while El Narco shows that the [...] "devastation" [...] of the Mexican Drug War may be south of the U.S. border, Grillo pinpoints that the United States [...] "is knee-deep in this conflict".|$|E

2500|$|The {{product of}} {{a year and a}} half of writing, the <b>book</b> <b>draws</b> on Melville's {{experience}} at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The white whale is modeled on the notoriously hard to catch actual albino whale Mocha Dick, and the ending is based on the sinking of the whaler [...] Essex by a whale. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.|$|E
