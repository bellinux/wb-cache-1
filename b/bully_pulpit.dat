5|$|Romney used a <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit</b> {{approach}} towards {{promoting his}} agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt with a public crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census enumerators free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit</b> to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E

40|$|College presidents lead taxing and complex, though {{enormously}} fulfilling and rewarding, lives. The {{story that}} unfolds in College Presidents Reflect: Life {{in and out}} of the Ivory Tower is fashioned from the perspectives of over two-dozen retired former college presidents. The over-their-shoulders view we get from these men and women who have sat on the presidential perch provides an unprecedented view of the office, of the pathways to presidencies, and of the ways in which tenures conclude when presidents decide, at times pushed, to exit. Does anything after leaving office compare with the status and regard regularly accorded presidents? How do their <b>bully</b> <b>pulpits</b> change from the power of the presidency to life? What are the high successes and unforeseen regrets born out of time in the office? From their journeys we learn lessons about leadership. We hear about how one gets into the presidency, planned or not. There is only one true source of insight and reflection about these issues and that is those who have been there, these former college presidents. [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|The {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, Lyndon Johnson, {{made use of}} his experience in legislative politics, along with the <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit</b> he wielded as president, {{in support of the}} bill. In his first address to a joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, [...] "No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{used his}} {{governorship}} as a <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit</b> for modest Republican reforms {{intended to provide}} moderate alternatives to the radical Populist actions. He promoted the [...] "Governor's Grain Bill" [...] {{as a way to}} regulate trade in grain, specifically by giving the Railroad and Warehouse Commission the authority to license, inspect, and regulate country grain elevators. The Republican members of the legislature supported it as well, going so far as making it a party measure. Opposition to the bill from Democrats and Populists were based on suspicion against the railroad commission. The bill went through two rounds of voting with considerable horse trading but in the end won narrowly, giving Nelson credibility as a political force.|$|E
2500|$|Hawkins was a {{founding}} member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and served as vice chairman during its first term (1971–1973). Hawkins did not play a significant role in the CBC, as he preferred to focus on legislation rather than use Congress as a <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit</b> like other African Americans such as Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., Bill Clay, and Ron Dellums; Hawkins argued that there needed to be “clearer thinking and fewer exhibitionists in the civil rights movement.” During this time, Hawkins succeeded in restoring honorable discharges to the 170 black soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment who had been falsely accused of a public disturbance in Brownsville, Texas in 1906, and removed from the Army. Unlike other CBC members, he sought cooperation from organized labor and white ethnics in order to make his agenda more likely to pass into law. In 1980, Hawkins criticized the CBC as [...] "85 percent social and 15 percent business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roanoke has a weak mayor-{{city manager}} form of government. The city manager is {{responsible}} for the day-to-day operation of the city's government and has the authority to hire and fire city employees. The mayor has little, if any, executive authority and essentially is the [...] "first among equals" [...] on the city council. The mayor, however, has a <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit</b> as Roanoke media frequently cover the mayor's appearances and statements. The current mayor of Roanoke is Sherman Lea and the current city manager is Robert S. Cowell. The city council has six members, not counting the mayor, all of whom are elected on an at-large basis. A proposal for a ward-based council, in which the mayor and vice mayor would continue to be elected at-large, was rejected by Roanoke voters in 1997, but ward system advocates still contend that the at-large system results in a disproportionate number of council members coming from affluent neighborhoods and that electing some or all council members on a ward basis would result in a more equal representation of all areas of the city. The four year terms of city council members are staggered, so there are biannual elections. The candidate who receives the most votes is designated the vice mayor for the following two years.|$|E

During this time John Peel became a Lotuspool fan; Zoom and Panel Donor were signed to larger labels; Lotuspool {{became one of the}} first 10 labels on the internet as they joined the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA); Lotuspool was pursued for acquisition by three major labels; and the Lotuspool ownership struck up an alliance with James Grauerholz and the author William S. Burroughs. The alliance mostly centered on a mutual love of firearms and the loose shooting restrictions associated with the Lotuspool farm zoning, but in addition, Grauerholz was a generous friend to Lotuspool. He produced the initial Panel Donor record with Matt Nalbach and was very generous when it came to Lotuspool borrowing his recording equipment for <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit</b> records.|$|E

5000|$|Jason Morningstar wrote Durance for the Game Chef 2011 competition. This game {{focused on}} the contest's theme of William Shakespeare and its {{ingredients}} of [...] "daughter," [...] "exile," [...] "forsworn," [...] and [...] "nature"; those elements got Morningstar thinking about the colonization of Australia in the 1780s and the 1790s, {{and he ended up}} writing about a penal colony on a distant planet. Morningstar was pleased with the Game Chef iteration of Durance, so in July 2011 he started iterating it for possible publication by <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit.</b> About a year later, <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit</b> decided {{to take advantage of the}} newest advances on the internet, and pushed Durance out as their first Kickstarter, raising $27,458 from 639 backers.
