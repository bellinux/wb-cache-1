40|$|The "Hero" was a Canadian steamer {{built of}} wood by Girard & Frechette at Sorel, Quebec in 1878. She was of 342 gross tons. In 1880, the "Hero" was {{purchased}} by Charles F. Gildersleeve and taken to Kingston, Ontario. There she was reconstructed at the Portsmouth Shipyward. On April 28, 1881, she was launched. She was licensed to carry 475 passengers. <b>Between</b> <b>decks,</b> she had <b>space</b> for several carloads of freight. Her boiler exploded and the vessel sank while tied to Rathbun's Wharf at Belleville, Ontario, Lake Ontario, on June 14, 1901. No lives lost...|$|R

50|$|Lochnevis was a two class vessel, {{designed}} for shorter voyages. Her passenger accommodation consisted of lounges, dining rooms, smoke rooms {{and plenty of}} covered <b>deck</b> <b>space,</b> but no overnight accommodation.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{experience}} gained from building and operating the Brading and Southsea, Shanklin was designed slightly differently from her sisters. She had a taller funnel, raised lifeboats and increased passenger <b>deck</b> <b>space.</b>|$|R

50|$|Despite their {{increasing}} success, {{these early}} cruises, called “excursions”, {{were difficult to}} plan with existing ships. Constructed as ocean liners, they {{did not meet the}} requirements of the pleasure-seeking market. They offered few amenities aboard. This became apparent during long stretches at sea. Furthermore, their construction as multi-class vessels also proved a hindrance as such vessels provided restricted access to <b>deck</b> <b>space.</b> Whatever <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> there was, was mostly sheltered, and designed to accommodate the rigors of the North Atlantic instead of the seas of more southern climes. Ballin believed that only a vessel specifically designed for cruising would be appropriate. Furthermore, such a vessel could spend the entire year doing so.|$|R
50|$|Above the {{car deck}} are {{two levels of}} accommodation, {{providing}} shelter and facilities for up to 1000 passengers. The first deck houses the cafeteria at the bow, with the main entrance concourse and shop immediately aft. Behind this are lounges, toilets and the information desk, with {{the bar at the}} stern. The next deck has an observation lounge at the stern and crew accommodation further forward. External <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> stretches from the lounge to just short of the bridge on both sides. An observation lounge on the top deck has seating aft of the funnel. The large amount of open <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> is one factor that makes the Isle of Mull popular with tourists.|$|R

25|$|Although Hapag-Lloyd {{originally}} {{considered a}} traditional two-funnel {{design for the}} fourth Europa, they finally opted for a modern, balanced design.

50|$|The Tirhandil is {{the oldest}} style of vessel on the Aegean Sea. Tirhandils are rarer these days due to their {{accommodation}} capacity.

50|$|Residential <b>decks</b> {{may contain}} <b>spaces</b> for cooking, dining and seating.

For a typical 6 person outdoor patio table building an area of 12' x 16' (4x5 m) is ideal. If <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> is available, homeowners may choose to include a seating area for outdoor couches and benches.|$|R

50|$|One {{cause of}} the loss of lives on the Titanic was the lack of {{lifeboat}}s. Even if every lifeboat had been completely filled with passengers and crew, {{there would have been no}} way to rescue more than half of all the people on board. The first SOLAS treaty was designed to avoid such a disaster happening again. One of its provisions was to ensure that vessels had enough lifeboats to provide every person aboard the vessel with a place. Putting this rule into effect was not difficult with cargo ships: they had small crews and plenty of <b>deck</b> <b>space.</b> Passenger ships had to stack lifeboats on top of each other to carry enough to accommodate the large number of passengers and crew. Warships also had large crews and little <b>deck</b> <b>space.</b>|$|R
