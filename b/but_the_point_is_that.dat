500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest". Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E
500|$|Greed {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in." [...] A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, [...] "perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice." ...|$|E
2500|$|American {{nativism}} countered {{the immigration}} and assimilation of Poles into the United States. In 1923, Carl Brigham dismissed the Poles as inferior in intelligence. He even defended his assertions against popular support for Kościuszko and Pulaski, well-known Polish heroes from the American Revolution, stating, [...] "careless thinkers [...] select one or two striking examples of ability from a particular group, and [...] that they have overthrown an argument based on the total distribution of ability." [...] Orators [...] "can not alter {{the distribution of the}} intelligence of the Polish immigrant. All countries send men of exceptional ability to America, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some send fewer than others." ...|$|E
500|$|SEN. CLINTON: No, I didn't, Chris. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> {{what are}} we going to do with all these illegal {{immigrants}} who are (driving ?) -- (inaudible)? ...|$|R
50|$|Professor Wille {{considered}} that creditors' rights took preference over {{those of a}} lessee who was not in occupation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> left open in Kessoopersadh v Essop. See also Genna-Wae Properties v Medico-Tronics.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> {{cleared up}} sooner than they expected, for, {{before they reached}} the wharf, a graceful figure was seen to be {{bounding}} through the bushes, apparently in hot pursuit of the dog.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Awfully. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> now he's gone I {{can tell}} you about that M.C.C. match affair. I know you want to hear what really did happen that afternoon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Mrs. Lyddell, [...] "any {{one else}} would rejoice to be asked; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> it is so {{unpleasant}} to admit any thing of a stranger into the intimacy these things occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not that,' said Arthur, turning gratefully to his father. 'I {{should be}} glad {{to give up the}} army and live at home--there is nothing I should like better; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> I must know what Violet thinks of it.' ...|$|E
50|$|Conversely, if both radii <b>are</b> zero (two <b>points)</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> distinct, <b>the</b> {{external}} center can <b>be</b> defined as <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity {{corresponding to the}} slope of the line of centers, but there is no well-defined internal center.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll admit that, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> here: as {{an artist}} you can't afford to dispose of a race on the {{testimony}} of their hereditary enemies. You wouldn't expect a sympathetic study of the Greek by the Saracen, would you?" ...|$|R
60|$|MORE. We {{shall not}} agree there, Shelder; {{and we might}} argue it all day. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> not whether you or I <b>are</b> right--the <b>point</b> is: What <b>is</b> a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do? Please tell me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Seaforth reflectively, [...] "I fancy you do, and, if it's any {{comfort to}} you, I think Harry does too. He is {{considerably}} {{less of a}} fool than folks who do not understand this country might suppose him to be; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> if he can prevent it you will not suffer an infliction of this kind again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Either that, or I've {{arranged}} with the shop {{to give us}} a quid down, and take all profits on this and the next number. They're as keen as anything on the taking-all-profits idea, but I've kept that back to be used only in case of necessity. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jim gets his sovereign in any case. I must be off to my editorial. So long,' and he went.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{pleasant}} for [...] "him"; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these are lines to an Indian air. Shelley, also, {{about the same}} time, wrote Lines to an Indian air; but we may [...] "swear, and save our oath," [...] that the singers preferred Bayly's. Tennyson and Coleridge could never equal the popularity of what follows. I shall ask the persevering reader to tell me where Bayly ends, and where parody begins: ...|$|E
25|$|Also, with seconds remaining, and Tyrone {{down by a}} <b>point,</b> Russell (who <b>was</b> blidsided) adjudged Canavan to {{have touched}} {{the ball in the}} ground, when he was passing it to team-mate, Sean McLaughlin. McLaughlin put the ball over <b>the</b> bar, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> not counted.|$|R
50|$|Aloisio the New, {{known in}} Russian as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin, was an Italian Renaissance {{architect}} invited by Ivan III {{to work in}} Moscow. Some Italian scholars have attempted to identify him with the Venetian sculptor Alevisio Lamberti da Montagnano, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> still widely disputed.|$|R
25|$|Scopes never testified {{since there}} was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later {{admitted}} that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> not contested at the trial.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, my lord; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> men said openly, there, {{that there was}} a report that he would be attainted, and {{deprived}} of his land, for treasonable words spoken by him to the king, the Duke of Albany, and the Duke of Rothesay. If this is so, he will have to fly; for assuredly he has, at present, no force gathered that could resist those of the king and Douglas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Larry," [...] said Breckenridge, [...] "if {{you were}} merely {{one of the}} rest your {{intentions}} would no doubt become you, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> every homesteader round here is dependent on you. If you went down, {{the opposition to the}} cattle-men would collapse, or there would be general anarchy, and that is precisely why Torrance and the Sheriff are anxious {{to get their hands on}} you. Now, doesn't it strike you that it's your plain duty to keep clear of any unnecessary peril?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Charcot adds: 'In every case, {{science is}} a foe to {{systematic}} negation, which the morrow may cause to melt {{away in the}} light of its new triumphs.' The present 'new triumph' is a mere coincidence with the dicta of our Lord, 'Thy faith hath made thee whole.... I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.' There are cures, as there are maladies, caused 'by idea.' So, in fact, we had always understood. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> science, wherever it agrees with David Hume, is not a foe, but a friend to 'systematic negation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> to {{get back}} his money for him," [...] said Ursula, [...] "which he {{is not likely to}} see on other conditions. Could you not ask leave to go down to your uncle in Essex for two or three days? He may be ill, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, I'll do {{that part}} of it," [...] {{interrupted}} Michael, [...] "you have no experience. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> this: If--or rather since--you know nothing of the crime, since the--the party in the closet--is neither your father, nor your brother, nor your creditor, nor your mother-in-law, nor what they call an injured husband----" ...|$|R
5000|$|Patil {{believes}} {{that when it}} comes to sport in India, you have to create your own opportunities. [...] "I think we give up very easily. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> support will come. I made my own opportunity. The government gave me a lot of money, but only after I climbed Everest and had proven myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{things have}} been going against me the last three years. Nevis has been {{steadily}} cutting into my trade; but I held on somehow, expecting that a record harvest or a high market would put me straight. I'd {{have been able to}} get some of my money in again then. In the meanwhile I was getting behind with the makers who supplied me, and now one or two of them have pulled me up; I guess it was the hail that decided them. It's a private compromise, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nevis takes over my liabilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor Hadley's {{just across}} the hall," [...] Doctor Emory {{explained}} to Daughtry. [...] "It won't take me five minutes. He and I have a disagreement. He has diagnosed the case as chronic appendicitis and wants to operate. I have diagnosed it as pyorrhea which has infected the stomach from the mouth, and have suggested emetine treatment of the mouth as a cure for the stomach disorder. Of course, you don't understand, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I've persuaded Doctor Hadley to bring in Doctor Granville, who is a dentist and a pyorrhea expert. And they're all waiting for me these ten minutes! I must run.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder what}} became {{of the men who}} silently (you couldn't hear {{yourself}} speak) must have shared that conviction with me. To be left to write about it is not, perhaps, the most enviable fate; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this impression resumes in its intensity the whole recollection of days and days of desperately dangerous weather. We were then, for reasons which it is not worth while to specify, in the close neighbourhood of Kerguelen Land; and now, when I open an atlas and look at the tiny dots on the map of the Southern Ocean, I see as if engraved upon the paper the enraged physiognomy of that gale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{all very}} well for common people. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was,</b> Kemp, that I {{had to get out}} of that house in a {{disguise}} without his seeing me. I couldn't think of any other way of doing it. And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay it was," [...] he returned, {{with the}} same steadiness. [...] "It seemed to me pertinent; and, besides, when you ask me for money upon no security, you treat me with the liberty of a friend, and it's to be presumed that I can do <b>the</b> like. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> do you accept?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "it wasn't any fancy <b>points.</b> They <b>was</b> {{just plain}} ostriches. A little off colour, too--owing to dietary. And there wasn't any {{particular}} restriction {{of the demand}} either. You'd have thought five ostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>was,</b> one of 'em had swallowed a diamond.|$|R
60|$|In vain may 'so good an {{observer}} as Miss X. think herself fully awake' (as she does think herself) when crystal-gazing, because once, when {{she happened to}} have 'her {{eyes fixed on the}} window,' her expression was 'associated' by a friend 'with something uncanny,' and she afterwards spoke 'in a dreamy, far-away tone' (p. 297). Miss X., though extremely 'wide awake,' may have looked dreamily at a window, and may have seen mountains and marvels. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she was not voluntarily gazing at a crystal for amusement or experiment--perhaps trying to see how a microscope affected the pictures--or to divert a friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{know exactly}} how all this has come about. Elsa's pretty and attractive. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she is a success, and as a success she appeals to Gerald's weakest side. He worships success. She {{is going to have}} a marvellous career, and she can help Gerald on in his. He can write plays for her to star in. What have I to offer against that? Yes, I know it's grovelling and contemptible of me to say that, Ginger. I ought to be above it, oughtn't I--talking as if I were {{competing}} for some prize... But I haven't any pride left. Oh, well! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} real welcome. And {{you could}} see that the prince {{appreciated}} it. There was a warmth and a meaning to it that the prince understood at once. It was a pity that he couldn't have stayed over and had time to see the carriage factory and the new sewerage plant. We all told the prince that he must come back and he said that if he could he most certainly would. When the prince's train pulled out of the station and we all went back uptown together (it was before prohibition came to Ontario) you could feel that the institution of royalty was quite solid in Orillia for a generation.|$|E
50|$|The lever frame at Stockport Junction was {{equipped}} with electro-pneumatic slides instead of levers, with electrical economising contacts located above them. The signalman wanted to cross a freight train travelling {{in the opposite direction}} behind <b>the</b> passenger train, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>were</b> locked by a track circuit until the passenger train was well clear of them.|$|R
5000|$|CMJ New Music Monthly {{described}} Tristeza's {{style in}} a review of their album, Dream Signals in Full Circles, [...] "A typical Tristeza track involves a down-shifted take on emo's rhythmic lopsidedness, beds of washy, behind-the-beat keyboards, and Christopher Sprague's arpeggiated, effect-drenched guitar melodies. It's all adeptly played, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> less individual virtuosity than collective compositional panache." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{since the}} card question, {{everything}} I said or did {{had the power}} of annoying Cluny. [...] "Your name has more sense than yourself, then," [...] said he angrily, [...] "for it's good Gaelic. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> this. My scout reports all clear in the south, and the question is, have ye the strength to go?" ...|$|R
