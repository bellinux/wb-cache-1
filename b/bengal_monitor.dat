50|$|The <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitor's</b> belly skin has {{traditionally}} been used in making the drum head for the kanjira (known as Dimadi in Maharashtra), a South Indian percussion instrument.|$|R
50|$|Oriental garden lizards, painted-lip lizards, mugger crocodiles, Asian water <b>monitors,</b> <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitors</b> and 30 {{species of}} snake {{are found in}} the park. Garra ceylonensis is an endemic fish species {{recorded}} in park. Introduced Oreochromis spp., giant gourami, catla, and rohu are important food fish species found in the reservoir.|$|R
50|$|Both {{types of}} monitor lizards - <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitor</b> and water monitor, {{can be seen}} in Kaludiya Pokuna.|$|E
50|$|Smaller mammal species include colugo, binturong, and Malayan weasel. Larger mammals include Sumatran serow and Malayan tapir. The park is home {{to various}} reptile species {{including}} <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitor</b> and Malayan pit viper.|$|E
50|$|Among the mammals, Nilgai, Golden jackal, Jungle cat, and Indian grey {{mongoose}} {{are known}} to occur. Reptiles known from Basai Wetland include <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitor,</b> Rat snake, Checkered keelback, and water snakes. A large population of amphibians also occurs in the swampy habitat.|$|E
50|$|It houses Bangladesh's richest {{wildlife}} resource after Sunderbans. It {{is famous}} for its remoteness and for its rich array of wildlife, including great hornbills, crab-eating macaques, Asian elephants, sambar deer, Asian black bears, spotted owlets, leopards, clouded leopards, barking deer, <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitors,</b> dholes, and capped leaf monkeys/capped langurs. There have also been uncertain reports of vagrant tigers in the forest reserve by local indigenous people.|$|R
50|$|Young {{monitor lizards}} are more {{colourful}} than adults. Young {{have a series}} of dark crossbars on the neck, throat and back. The belly is white, banded with dark crossbars and are spotted with grey or yellow (particularly {{in the eastern part of}} the range). On the dorsal surface of young monitors, there are a series of yellow spots with dark transverse bars connecting them. As they mature, the ground colour becomes light brown or grey, and dark spots give them a speckled appearance. Hatchlings of nebulosus tend to {{have a series of}} backward-pointing, V-shaped bands on their necks.Bengal monitors have external nostril openings (nares) that is slit-like and oriented near horizontal, and positions between the eye and the tip of the snout. The nares can be closed at will, especially to keep away debris or water. The scales of the skin are rougher in patches and on the sides, they have minute pits, especially well distributed in males. These scales with micropores have glandular structures in the underlying dermal tissue and produce a secretion which may be a pheromone-like substance. Like other varanids, <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitors</b> have a forked tongue that is protruded in the manner of snakes. The function is mainly sensory, and is not very involved in the transport of food down the throat. <b>Bengal</b> <b>monitors</b> have fat deposits in the tail and body that serve them in conditions when prey are not easily available.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the storm's {{existence}} in the Bay of <b>Bengal,</b> it was <b>monitored</b> by the ERS-1 satellite. It became the first North Indian Ocean cyclone to be observed by scatterometer instruments, providing the data necessary to calibrate the device for minimizing directional ambiguity of its measurements.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{very good}} birding area where one can see: whitebellied seaeagle, osprey, Indian skimmer, slender billed gull, brahminy kite, brown headed gull, painted stork and stone curlew.

40|$|The {{bacteria}} {{involved in}} nitrogen and sulphur cycles and physicochemical characteristics {{of water and}} sediment in traditional, modified extensive and semi-intensive shrimp culture systems of West <b>Bengal,</b> India were <b>monitored.</b> The physicochemical parameters, except salinity and sediment pH, were observed to be well within the optimum levels recommended for shrimp culture. The levels of ammonia (NH 3; PV 0. 05) and nitrite (NO 2; Pb 0. 03) differed significantly among systems. The mean heterotroph counts were always close to or above 106 /ml pond water and 106 /g sediment. The counts of total heterotrophs and nitrate reducing bacteria (NRB) of the pond water of different culture systems differed significantly (Pb 0. 01). While the counts of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB; Pb 0. 001), nitrate reducing bacteria (Pb 0. 01) and sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB; Pb 0. 03) in pond sediment of the three culture systems differed significantly. The mean counts of ammonia oxidizers increased with days of culture (DOC) in traditional and modified extensive systems, but they remained constant in semi-intensive pond sediment. The mean counts of nitrite oxidizers were generally high in water and sediment samples of modified extensive system. The mean sulphur oxidizing bacterial counts of pond water were higher in semi-intensive and modified extensive systems, which generally decreased with increasing DOC. The sulphate reducing bacterial counts of sediment increased with DOC in modified extensive and semi-intensive systems and vice versa i...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{productivity}} of the ocean is crucial and can be represented by several oceanic parameters. However, the major indicator for ocean productivity monitoring is phytoplankton (Chlorophyll-a) concentration. The {{productivity of}} the ocean is now decreasing due to several factors {{and the rate of}} declination is even higher in some part of the ocean such as in the Bay of <b>Bengal.</b> Therefore, long-term <b>monitoring</b> of ocean productivity is important, thus the primary goal {{of this study is to}} monitor the changes in ocean productivity in the Bay of Bengal due to the seasonal variation. The observation was made based on two seasons i. e. northeast monsoon (November to February) and southwest monsoon (May to September) over a long-term period. The ten-year (from 2001 to 2010) products of Chlorophyll-a concentration from SeaWiFS were used to analyze the spatial and temporal analysis of ocean productivity at the Bay of Bengal. The finding of this study indicates a long-term variation of ocean productivity at the Bay of Bengal for different seasons. It is found that Chlorophyll-a concentration started to increase in the month of October/November and decreased after January, and this trend of Chlorophyll-a concentration change remains the same for over the past ten years. However, no constant rate of change of Chlorophyll-a concentration from year to year has been observed in this study. This study also observed that ocean productivity is highly varied in the Northwestern region of the Bay of Bengal during the northeast monsoon as compared to other regions. In contrary, ocean productivity was found high at Northeastern part of the Bay durin...|$|R
