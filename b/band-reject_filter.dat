Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 95 - 101. Filters {{are one of}} {{the fundamental}} microwave components used to prevent the transmission or emission of signals with unwanted frequency components. In general, they can be considered as an interconnection of resonator structures brought together to accomplish a desired frequency response. Up to GHz frequencies, these resonator structures are usually constructed using lumped elements such as discrete capacitors and inductors. At microwave frequencies, discrete components lose their normal charcteristics and resonators can be realized using distributed structures like quarter- or half-wavelength transmission line stubs. However, filters built using this approach are generally big, especially when high frequency selectivity is desired. Recently, sub-wavelength structures, namely split-ring resonator (SRR) and complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR), have attracted the attention of many researchers. Interesting properties of the periodic arrangements of these structures have led to the realization of left-handed materials. Furthermore, high-Q characteristics of these structures enabled the design of highly frequencyselective devices in compact dimensions. In this thesis, these two resonator structures are investigated in detail. A deep exploration of their resonance mechanisms and transmission properties is provided along with a brief survey of related literature. However, the main focus of the thesis is the design of <b>band-reject</b> <b>filters</b> based on these resonator structures. Experimental results based on measuring the scattering paramaters of fabricated prototypes are supported with computer simulations. <b>Band-reject</b> <b>filters</b> based on SRR and CSRR are compared and discussed.

Finally, an electronically switchable split-ring resonator structure based on PIN diodes is presented.

40|$|The {{development}} of contemporary SHF systems {{calls for a}} broad nomenclature of frequency-selective devices, band-pass filters in particular. One of the possible directions of filter design is the usage of electromagnetic-bandgap (EBG) structures, which can be implemented {{in the form of}} certain slots in a microstrip line’s ground plane. It was previously proposed to use these structures as parts of output matching networks of high-efficiency SHF amplifiers built according to harmonic-manipulation approach. The use of the mentioned structures would be more effective if they themselves could perform as matching network. By utilizing the results of theoretical and experimental research of harmonic filters built on microstrip line’s ground plane slots, let’s consider design of networks that are capable of performing other relevant function in addition to that of <b>band-reject</b> <b>filters.</b> The goal of the current work is to investigate the possibility of application of the microstrip line’s ground plane slot resonators (<b>band-reject</b> <b>filters)</b> to the design of band-pass filters. This research can also contribute to the design of such output matching networks of SHF amplifiers that must simultaneously perform the tasks of harmonics filtering and impedance matching on the fundamental frequency of amplifier’s operation. In order to achieve this task a band-pass filter was proposed and studied theoretically and experimentally. The filter includes two sections of <b>band-reject</b> <b>filters,</b> each section consisting of two slot resonator located in microstrip line’s ground plane, while the line section with slots at the same time works as a part of three-section band-pass filter. Each slot resonator can be represented as a parallel resonant circuit connected serially into the transmission line. Parameters of the parallel resonant circuit are calculated from the known resonant frequency of the slot resonator and wave impedance of the slot line. The characteristics of the filter were calculated with the aid of ABCD matrices. The matrices represented every slot, line sections between the slots and variation of the line’s characteristic impedance (the width of microstrip line). The results of calculation were compared with results of electromagnetic simulation and experimental study of the filter test sample. The considered filter was found to have characteristics similar to that of a filter built on half-wave resonators, but the signal suppression in the upper pass-band was much higher compared with situation when only a step-like variation of characteristic impedance was used in the filter. Herewith the overall length of the filter with slot resonators was not higher than that of the prototype. Using a test sample of the three-section filter manufactured on Rogers 3010 material with thickness 0. 635 mm and nominal relative permittivity e = 10. 2 the signal suppression in 2. 0 – 3. 6 GHz band was measured to be within the range of 0. 1 to 3 dB, while in 4. 6 – 6 GHz band the signal suppression was found to be more than 20 dB.

40|$|Growing {{demand for}} {{multi-band}} wireless systems has emphasized tunable highly linear filtering without sacrificing cost or form factor. The 3 G/ 4 G frequency-division duplex (FDD) cellular {{systems such as}} long-term evolution (LTE) {{are more prone to}} interference from strong blockers associated primarily with the co-located transmit signal. In an LTE receiver (RX), transmit signal introduces a strong out-of-band (OOB) blocker, transmit (TX) leakage, placing stringent linearity and power-handling capability requirements at the diversity RXs. In conventional multi-band systems, a large number of SAW filters are used and single-pole multi-throw switches select the appropriate SAW filter for the desired channel. The cascaded insertion loss of the filter and switch, impose a significant noise performance degradation. Therefore, filtering solutions that are tunable, blocker tolerant, and highly linear are critical to extending multi-band schemes. In this research work, tunable filters are proposed with offset <b>band-reject</b> <b>filtering</b> to address TX leakage. First, a N-path filter is demonstrated in 45 -nm CMOS SOI technology and consists of a combination of tunable band-pass and <b>band-reject</b> <b>filtering.</b> A tunable filter was presented with more than a decade tuning range, high linearity and blocker tolerance for a SAW-less diversity path receiver in FDD cellular systems. The 3 -dB bandwidth (BW) of the pass band is greater than 80 MHz with an independently tunable reject band, providing the ultimate rejection is 33 dB to 41 dB while the pass band insertion loss is between 2. 6 dB and 4. 3 dB over the tuning range. The proposed filter offers 29 -dBm OOB 3 rd-order input-intercept power (IIP 3) and 22 -dBm in band (IB) IIP 3 with a 10 -dBm blocker 1 -dB compression point (B 1 dB). Then, A channel-selecting low-noise amplifier (CS-LNA) with blocker filtering is presented for a SAW-less diversity path receiver in frequency-division duplexing cellular systems. A hybrid -path bandpass filter/band-reject filter (BPF/BRF) feedback network is applied to the LNA to create close-in reject bands around the passband to suppress transmit leakage and improve the out-of-band (OOB) input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP 3). Control of the frequency and depth of the reject bands is demonstrated with analysis and simulation. A cancellation linearization is applied to improve the in-band (IB) linearity. Adaptive LO swing and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) thick-oxide devices are demonstrated to improve the power-handling capability. The proposed CS-LNA is implemented in 32 -nm CMOS SOI and operates from 0. 4 to 6 GHz with the maximum rejection larger than 60 dB and power-handling capability up to 17 dBm. The prototype demonstrates an OOB IIP 3 of 36 dBm and IB IIP 3 of 10 dBm at 1 GHz.

40|$|Transmission of {{multimedia}} data {{is the goal}} of third generation (3 G) cellular radio systems necessitating high-speed data links where the multipath delay spread generally encompasses many symbol intervals. The channel impulse response for each antenna in a prototypical high-speed data link is many symbol intervals in duration and generally sparse. In order {{to reduce the number of}} parameters that need to be estimated in order to characterize the channel, researchers have recently proposed a number of schemes for direct estimation of the multipath parameters. However, this approach generally requires a very long observation interval in order to accurately estimate the complex gain of each dominant multipath at each antenna. This dissertation presents an alternative approach based on subbanding and the Cross-Relation Method (CRM) of Xu, Lieu, Tong, and Cliath. ^ The basic approach is to apply the CRM in each subband, using basis functions derived from the symbol wavering and the bandages filter, to blindly identify the frequency response of each channel in the given subband. In each subband, oversampling of the channel outputs and exploitation of basis function coefficient properties leads to improved performance. However, oversampling can also lead to trivial solutions for which the channel estimates are chosen to be <b>band-reject</b> <b>filters.</b> Two procedures are developed for averting these trivial solutions based on a weighted in-band energy concentration criterion. In addition, a method is presented for proper phasing of each subband channel estimate in order to blindly reconstruct the full channel impulse response associated with each antenna. In the practical commercial case where a small number of training symbols are available, a semi-blind approach is presented that follows the blind procedure by a fractionally-spaced decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The advantage of this semi-blind approach is that the number of taps needed for the DFE need only span the effective duration of the original symbol wavering, which in the wideband case is much less than the number of taps needed to span the delay spread as required in a conventional DFE. ^ Extensive simulations have been conducted demonstrating accurate identification of multiple channels under multipath conditions, moderate SNR, and with a relatively small number of symbols. ...|$|R

5000|$|For all but {{the most}} tightly packed dipole arrays (the brickwork-like [...] "gangbuster" [...] {{low-pass}} filters), a first order understanding of FSS operation can be achieved by simply considering the scattering properties of a single periodic element in free space. A dipole or patch in free space will strongly reflect energy for wavelengths comparable in size to the object itself, for example when the dipole is 1/2 wavelength in length. For frequencies below this first resonance (and for frequencies {{between the first and second}} resonance), the object will reflect little energy. So, this resonance phenomenon observed with dipoles and patches leads naturally to the notion of modeling them as a resonant circuit connected in parallel across a transmission line - in this case the element is a series connection of a capacitor and inductor, which produces a reflective short circuit at resonance.

40|$|When digital filters must {{operate in}} a {{real-time}} environment, many filter designs become unsatisfactory due {{to the amount of}} required computation time. A considerable reduction in computation time is achieved by replacing floating-point coefficients with small integer coefficients in filter equations. This increases the speed at which the resulting filter program executes by replacing floating-point multiplication instructions with integer bit-shift and add instructions. These instructions require fewer clock cycles than floating-point calculations. Integer filters are a special class of digital filters that have only integer coefficients in their defining equations. This characteristic leads to some design constraints that can often make it difficult to achieve features such as a sharp cutoff frequency. Since integer filters can operate at higher speeds than traditional designs, they are often the best type of filter for high sampling rates or when using a slow microprocessor. This chapter discusses basic design concepts of integer filters. It also reviews why these filters display certain characteristics, such as linear phase, and how to derive the transfer functions. Next this theory is extended to show how to design low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and <b>band-reject</b> integer <b>filters</b> by appropriate selection of pole and zero locations.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{electronically}} adjustable and configurable {{applications of the}} modern active elements. In the field there were presented various active elements in applications of the analog filters and oscillators which stem from basic and more or less similar principles of circuit synthesis and design. However, there is not provided study of real behavior in detail {{and in most cases}} electronic control of the various parameters in application is not verified. In the precise design of application is very important to identify problematic features and determine how much it influences functionality of the device. In this work several filtering structures based on common and modified synthesis principles (integrator loops) are compared in the view of multifunctionality, configurability, variability, kind of used electronic control and impact of influences of real elements on behavior. There are used standard methods like adjusting of variable transconductance, intrinsic value of current input resistance and not so common method based on variable current gain in design of modified and improved multifunctional filtering circuits. The last method of mentioned control enabled to find quite unique filter which allows continuous electronic change of transfer from <b>band-reject</b> to all-pass <b>filter</b> of the 2 nd order without reconnection. It is much simpler than previous and more common integrator loops. Larger part of this work is focused on electronically controllable oscillators mainly on quadrature types. There is presented several very simply and elementary realizations which require minimal number of active and passive elements. There are also slightly or more complicated solutions which remove some drawbacks of mentioned simpler variants. First of all there is given attention on study of real behavior which make obvious different problems with mutual dependence of oscillation condition and oscillation frequency, dependence of produced amplitudes (quadrature types) on parameter which is controlling oscillation frequency, influence of this parameter on oscillation condition, etc. In the framework of this part of the thesis there was introduced a novel modification of current conveyor transconductance amplifier (CCTA) so called current-gain-controlled current conveyor transconductance amplifier (CGCCCTA). Requirements for novel applications in the field of oscillators for newly developed controllable current amplifier and digitally controllable current amplifier (DACA) at the Department of Telecommunication FEEC BUT lead to creation of several chapters of this work where mentioned active elements can be used. The important contribution of this work (for practical approach) is also experimental testing of most of designed circuits and determination of exact design equations and rules which take into account real behavior of circuits and confirm results obtained from experiments...|$|R
