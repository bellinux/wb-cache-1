2500|$|The Post Office {{commissioned}} a new design of pillar box in 1980 from {{a panel of}} three competing designers. The competition was won by Tony Gibbs and his design, which {{was thought to be}} ultra-modern at the time, was designated Type K by the Post Office. Made in traditional cast iron, it stayed in production until 2000. Notable features included: replaceable lifting ring screwed into the dome of the <b>box,</b> <b>body</b> and roof of box cast as one piece, large easy-to-read collection time plate, all surface details and collection plate window recessed to give a perfect cylindrical outline, integral restrictor plate, know colloquially as a [...] "Belfast Flap" [...] to restrict posting to letters only and a flanged shallow base suitable for installation in modern buildings, shopping centres and other urban areas. These boxes were thus much easier to move and handle as they could be rolled over level ground or lifted by crane into position. The design had one major flaw {{in the area of the}} door hinge, which is prone to snap under stress and the K type pillar boxes are no longer being installed.|$|E

40|$|This PhD aims {{to create}} a reading {{strategy}} for {{the subject of the}} female boxer in order to intervene in the ways in which this figure is utilized and understood in contemporary culture. Ultimately, I am positing the limits of social constructivism and social science as a way to understand the <b>boxing</b> <b>body</b> and, specifically, the female boxer. Readings arising out of the philosophy of phenomenology, among other areas of thought, are more useful as a way to understand and capture this. Art can draw on the difference and also the intersection between these understandings, as well as add new meanings to our thinking around the subject. I am considering the female boxer as a cipher to explore questions around the representation and vulnerability of moving bodies. My interest is in the contradictions present in the plurality of the subject; on the one hand, a political need exists to count the particular body of the female boxer as a body that matters; on the other hand, the female <b>boxing</b> <b>body</b> is an example of physicality and potentiality that is not totally captured by current semantic, cultural definition. I will discuss depictions and conceptualizations that exist both in the sociological definition of the <b>boxing</b> <b>body</b> and in methods of artistic representation, with the intention of articulating an understanding of the subject that allows for its inconclusivity as a lived body. Brian Massumi writes, “in motion, a body is in an immediate, unfolding relation to its own non-present potential to vary. ” The charge of indeterminacy as carried by a body is inseparable from it, as long as the body is dynamic and alive. This thesis describes, addresses, and challenges {{the ways in which the}} female <b>boxing</b> <b>body</b> is functioning and being defined as a sociological signifier, specifically the practice of gender construction as it frames the <b>boxing</b> <b>body</b> in art and theory. Via an understanding of the female boxer as vacillating, as being both irresolute and situated, my project engages with particular works of contemporary art that are attempting an alteration of our existing interpretations of the subject. My ultimate intention is to elucidate the becoming female boxer as a generative prism, and to investigate the ways in which art could be engaging with the ensuing spectrum...|$|R
50|$|Combination buses {{are built}} by {{installing}} a complete <b>box</b> <b>body</b> equipped for transporting people onto a truck chassis. The body is independent and {{separate from the}} driver. There is usually no passage between the cab and <b>box</b> <b>body</b> but there is usually an intercom system.

40|$|A Frenchman on Chicago’s Southside, a {{white man}} in the ghetto, he stumbles into the Woodlawn Boys Club, a boxing gym. He spends {{three and a half}} years there (1988 – 91). He becomes an {{accomplished}} boxer, fights and loses his bout in the Chicago amateur Golden Gloves competition. His goals were three: 1) Could he exist in this world, and could he learn how to be boxer? 2) Could he read race in the ghetto through his experiences in the Woodlawn gym? 3) Could he write a carnal sociology, a sociology of lived experience. The project is inspired by Bourdieu, who argued that the social order inscribes itself in our bodies. Wacquant’s monograph, like David Sudnow’s brilliant Ways of the Hand (1978) enters into the ways in which a <b>boxing</b> <b>body</b> is manufactured, or produced, the ways and emotions of the <b>boxing</b> <b>body.</b> The narrative coordinates three elements: Wacquant’s flesh-and-blood body situated in the fire of action; his individual consciousness as he trains to become a boxer; and the collectivity, the languages of boxing that he learns from his coach DeeDee Armour, and the othe...|$|R

5000|$|In 1986, the Avia National Concern {{comprising}} also affiliates in Brno, Ivančice and Žilina {{was incorporated}} in a so-called [...] "Industry Economical Unit" [...] together with Praga, BSS, Metaz and Kutná Hora enterprises.

Avia Letňany, as the parent factory, manufactured engines and cabs and assembled all of the chassis. A part of the chassis was fitted with a platform-type superstructure and also vehicles with a furgon-type body were manufactured there.

50|$|Because {{the lines}} ran on or {{alongside}} roads {{it was decided}} to design the locomotives as tramway or 'box' locomotives (Kastenlokomotive). They had a fully glazed, <b>box</b> <b>body</b> and the drive was covered to reduce the risk to passers-by or horses. In order to enable the engine driver to see the line there was a sliding side window. The driver himself stood to one side next to the boiler. The water tank was integrated into the rivetted plate frame. The filling points were on the front wall the left and right of the smokebox. Coal was stored behind the outer firebox on the footplate. As a result, the engines could only be laboriously coaled using baskets.|$|E

These were originally named as the [...] "integrated pickup" [...] and consisted of the cab and the box into one continuous piece, with no gap between them. The design required fewer stampings, such as {{the back of the}} cab served as {{the leading edge of the}} bed, less complicated assembly, such as the single-wall bed sides were spot-welded directly to the door sills, and the body had a less complicated path through the assembly plant's paint shop. This achieved cost savings in the manufacture of the truck, but the one-piece cab and <b>box</b> <b>body</b> was still mounted to a traditional frame-style chassis.|$|E
