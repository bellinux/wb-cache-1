5|$|Since {{statehood}} in 1845 {{there have}} been 43 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Three state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D. Bloxham, in two stints; and Reubin Askew and Jeb Bush, who each served their terms consecutively. <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham</b> almost served two terms, as he resigned with only three days left. The shortest term in office belongs to Wayne Mixson, who served three days following the resignation of his predecessor, <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham.</b>|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{investments}} {{included several}} banks, Provincetown-Boston Airlines, the Palmer Ranch {{real estate development}} near Sarasota, Florida, and movie productions including A Chorus Line and The Emerald Forest. He was criticized over a planned extension of Interstate 75 into South Florida, as its route went directly past land owned by numerous powerful investors, including Culverhouse, Governor <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham,</b> State Attorney General Jim Smith, and the Arvida Corporation.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham)</b> a tax-cut {{proposal}} {{aimed at}} lowering the marginal tax bracket from 15% to 10% {{on the first}} $19,000 of taxable income. In 2002, he proposed a tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both employers and employees. Corzine also proposed making dividend payments tax deductible to companies {{as a form of}} economic stimulus.|$|E
50|$|After several {{attempts}} Alan Heaton finally broke {{the record in}} 1960. This began a flurry of activity to add extra tops {{with the intent of}} extending the 24-hour record. It was soon discovered that the route of <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham's</b> round was not optimal for attempts on the absolute fell record so the two began to be regarded as separate challenges and have slightly different rules. The 24-hour record has now been extended to 77 tops. <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham's</b> round was left as a challenge in its own right.|$|R
50|$|On June 8, 2009, Gelber {{announced}} his candidacy for Florida Attorney General. Reminiscent of Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham's</b> Workdays, Gelber performed community service across Florida, which included serving meals to the homeless, {{cleaning up the}} Wekiva River, and joining elementary school students in writing letters to veterans.|$|R
50|$|After {{a heated}} primary race {{on both sides}} {{following}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham's</b> retirement, the Florida race {{was considered to be}} a tossup, with Democrat Betty Castor leading Republican Mel Martinez in statewide polls by a very slight margin. High Republican turnout, indicated by an unexpectedly large victory in Florida for President Bush, brought Martinez to victory.|$|R
5|$|The {{story of}} Florida International University's {{founding}} began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham)</b> presented {{the state legislature}} with the initial proposal {{for the establishment of}} a public university in South Florida. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.|$|E
5|$|While Kate {{was moving}} through the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a {{hurricane}} warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers, Florida, including the Florida Keys. Then-Governor of Florida <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency for six counties in South Florida. However, it was reversed following the relatively minor effects in the area. Officials recommended evacuation of the Florida Keys, leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12shelters. Three shelters were opened in Key West, but only 500 individuals utilized them during the storm. Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes. In Fort Lauderdale, schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham</b> in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E

5|$|During Elena's initial approach, {{the first}} series of {{hurricane}} warnings were issued between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Apalachicola, Florida. The storm's projected path quickly nudged westward, prompting the warnings {{to be extended}} to Morgan City, Louisiana, and truncated to Pensacola, Florida on their eastern reach. Heeding the advisories, nearly one million residents and vacationers fled the storm's path. Personnel on offshore oil rigs in the northern Gulf of Mexico began leaving as early as August 29. The governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida declared states of emergency by August 30. Huge crowds formed at stores as individuals searched for emergency supplies, and simultaneously, lines grew at gas stations. Due to the impending danger, many businesses closed and fortified their buildings. Across the Gulf Coast, classes at schools were cancelled, and residents in the New Orleans area were particularly wary of what was being called the first serious hurricane threat in 20 years (Hurricane Betsy caused catastrophic flooding in and around New Orleans in 1965). In Mississippi, the mass exodus created bumper-to-bumper traffic on crucial highways, such as the west–east U.S. Route 90. In Florida, then-Governor <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham</b> activated 250 National Guard troops on August 30 to facilitate efficient evacuations, stating that 1,600 more were on standby. By that time, it became evident that Elena would head farther east than initially expected, stirring more concern for the eastern Gulf Coast. Accordingly, hurricane warnings were dropped for coastal Louisiana west of Grand Isle and replaced eastward to Apalachicola, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm reached its peak {{intensity}} on November20, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Cedar Key, Florida. Later that day, {{a portion of the}} watch area was upgraded to a warning from Bay St. Louis, Mississippi to St. Marks, Florida. About 20,000employees on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated, many by helicopter. The USS Lexington left port from Naval Air Station Pensacola to ride out the storm in open waters, and aircraft in the region were flown inland. About 100,000people along the Florida Panhandle were told to leave their houses after Governor <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham</b> issued evacuation orders in 13counties. About 2,000people stayed in 34shelters in Panama City. Roads in the region suffered traffic jams from the large volume of evacuees. Portions of the Florida Gulf Coast had been threatened by Hurricane Elena earlier in the season, and some evacuees of that storm intended not to leave during Kate due to the poor shelter conditions that they had experienced. Governor Graham activated 300members of the Florida National Guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations. One person died from a stress-induced heart attack in Chipley after evacuating. Outside of Florida, about 2,200people fled Grand Isle, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Crist {{began his}} {{political}} career as a Republican, serving in the Florida Senate from 1993 to 1999, running unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1998 when he challenged incumbent <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham</b> and then serving as Florida Education Commissioner from 2001 to 2003 and Florida Attorney General from 2003 to 2007, before being elected governor in 2006.|$|E
50|$|McCollum ran for {{the other}} Florida Senate seat on Democrat <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham's</b> {{retirement}} in 2004, but succumbed to eventual Senator Mel Martinez after low fundraising allowed the challenger to overcome his early lead.

And during his two terms (1979-1987) as Florida's Governor, <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham,</b> although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people {{on the grounds of}} doubts about guilt or disproportionality.|$|E

He is Vice Chair of the bipartisan Commission on the Prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism, which has concluded that, unless action is taken, a biological attack within the United States is increasingly likely and will become a probability by 2013. Together with former Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham,</b> Chairman of the Commission, he has criticized the federal government's readiness to deal with major public health crisis'. On January 4, 2010, the two Senators published an op-ed in the Washington Post, arguing that an unsatisfactory response to the 2009 flu pandemic shows the need for better medical emergency plans.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Askew was re-elected, with J. H. Williams as {{his running}} mate.

25|$|The {{first version}} of the Patriot Act was {{introduced}} into the House on October 2, 2001 as the Provide Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (PATRIOT) Act of 2001, and was later passed by the House as the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act (H.R. 2975) on October 12. This {{was based on the}} afore-mentioned Anti-Terrorism Act, but had been changed after negotiations and work between Attorney General Ashcroft, Senators Leahy, Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), <b>Bob</b> <b>Graham,</b> Trent Lott (R-MS) and Orrin Hatch. It was introduced into the Senate as the USA Act of 2001 (S. 1510) by Tom Daschle (D-SD) where Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) proposed a number of amendments, none of which were passed. Feingold amended the provision relating to interception of computer trespasser communications, limited the roving wiretap authority under FISA and modified the provisions relating to access to business records under FISA. The USA Act was later vitiated and indefinitely postponed, because the Senate and House bills could not be reconciled in time.|$|E
