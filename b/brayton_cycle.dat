25|$|The {{working gas}} of a <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> can be helium, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide. The {{high-pressure}} working gas is expanded in a turbine to produce power. The low-pressure warm gas is cooled in an ambient cooler. The low-pressure cold gas is compressed to the high-pressure of the system. Often the turbine and the compressor are mechanically connected through a single shaft. High pressure Brayton cycles {{are expected to}} have a smaller generator footprint compared to lower pressure Rankine cycles. A <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> heat engine can operate at lower pressure with wider diameter piping. The world's first commercial <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> solar power module (100kW) was built and demonstrated in Israel's Arava Desert in 2009.|$|E

Notably, steam is not created in the core (as is present in BWRs), and no large, expensive steel pressure vessel (as required for PWRs). Since it can operate at high temperatures, {{the conversion of the}} heat to electricity can use an efficient, lightweight <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> gas turbine.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{power and}} {{efficiency}} of the open combined Brayton and two parallel inverse <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycles</b> are analysed and optimized based on the model established using finite-time thermodynamics in Part 1 of the current paper by adjusting the compressor inlet pressure of the two parallel inverse <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycles,</b> the mass flowrate {{and the distribution of}} pressure losses along the flow path. It is shown that the power output has a maximum with respect to the compressor inlet pressures of the two parallel inverse <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycles,</b> the air mass flowrate or any of the overall pressure drops, and the maximized power output has an additional maxi-mum with respect to the compressor pressure ratio of the top cycle. The power output and the thermal conversion efficiency have the maximum values when the mass flowrates of the first and the second inverse <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycles</b> are the same. When the optimization is performed with the constraints of a fixed fuel flowrate and the power plant size, the power output and ther-mal conversion efficiency can be maximized again by properly allocating the fixed overall flow area among the compressor inlet of the top cycle and the turbine outlets of the two parallel inverse <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycles.</b> The numerical examples show the effects of design parameters on the power output and heat conversion efficiency...|$|R

25|$|The gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GFR) system {{features}} a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium {{and management of}} actinides. The reactor is helium-cooled and with an outlet temperature of 850°C it is an evolution of the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) to a more sustainable fuel cycle. It will use a direct <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds.

Figures 4.1–4.2 In their simple form, modern {{gas turbines}} {{operate on the}} <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle.</b> (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected hot running clearance of the impeller.|$|E

The pulsejet uses the Lenoir cycle which, lacking an external compressive driver such as the Otto cycle's piston, or the <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle's</b> compression turbine, drives compression with acoustic resonance in a tube. This limits the maximum pre-combustion pressure ratio, to around 1.2 to 1.|$|R

2500|$|One type {{of fossil}} fuel power plant uses a gas turbine in {{conjunction}} with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). It is referred to as a combined cycle power plant because it combines the <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> of the gas turbine with the Rankine cycle of the HRSG. [...] The thermal efficiency of these plants has reached a record heat rate of 5690 Btu/(kW·h), or just under 60%, at a facility in Baglan Bay, Wales.|$|E
2500|$|The gas {{cycle is}} less {{efficient}} than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle {{works on the}} reverse <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle</b> instead of the reverse Rankine cycle. [...] As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect {{is equal to the}} product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas refrigeration cycle needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.|$|E

[...] Other cycles, such as the Otto cycle, Diesel cycle and <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle,</b> can be analyzed {{from the standpoint of}} the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells require an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|While {{illustrating}} a gas turbine's <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle,</b> Figure 5.1 [...] includes example {{plots of}} [...] pressure-specific volume and temperature-entropy.

Studying these two plots further {{we see that}} the pressure rises between the compressor inlet (station 1) and compressor exit (station 2). [...] At the same time, {{it is easy to see}} that the specific volume decreases or similarly the density increases. Studying the temperature-entropy plot we see the temperature increase with increasing entropy (loss). If we assume dry air, and ideal gas equation of state and an isentropic process, we have enough information to define the pressure ratio and efficiency for this one point. Unfortunately, we are missing several other key pieces of information if we wish to apply the centrifugal compressor to another application.|$|E
2500|$|Combining {{two or more}} {{thermodynamic}} cycles {{results in}} improved overall efficiency, reducing fuel costs. In stationary power plants, a widely used combination is a gas turbine (operating by the <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycle)</b> burning natural gas or synthesis gas from coal, whose hot exhaust powers a steam power plant (operating by the Rankine cycle). [...] This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve a best-of-class real (HHV - see below) thermal efficiency of around 54% in base-load operation, {{in contrast to a}} single cycle steam power plant which is limited to efficiencies of around 35–42%. Many new gas power plants in North America and Europe are of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine type.

40|$|The {{world trade}} in LNG (liquefied natural gas) has tripled {{in the last}} 15 years and the {{forecasts}} are for its further rapid expansion. Although the cryogenic exergy of the LNG {{could be used in}} many industrial processes, it is recognized also as a source for power cycles. When using the low temperature capacity of LNG for power production, several thermodynamic cycles can be considered. This paper reports the state-of-the art of the most relevant solutions based on conventional and non-conventional thermodynamic closed cycles. Moreover, a novel metrics framework, suitable for a fairer comparison among the energy recovery performances of the different technologies is proposed. According to the defined indicators the compounds plants with gas turbine and closed <b>Brayton</b> <b>cycles</b> perform really better, with an almost full use of LNG available cold temperature and a fuel consumption with an efficiency better than that of the current combined cycles. The Rankine cycles with organic working fluids (pure fluids or non-azeotropic mixtures) using seawater or heat available at low temperature (for instance at 150 °C) also perform in a very satisfactory way.
