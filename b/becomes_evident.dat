5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{reaction}} of the crew to the casting of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), and the subsequent changes made to The Girlie Show. This <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> when Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) changes the title of the show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) dismay. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) struggles to keep the cast and crew happy, so together with Tracy, she throws a party on a yacht.|$|E
5|$|Alex Krycek (seasons 2–9) {{is portrayed}} by Nicholas Lea. Krycek is a Russian-American, {{the son of}} Cold War immigrants, and first {{introduced}} as an FBI Special Agent assigned as a temporary investigation partner to Fox Mulder. Krycek proceeds to work with Mulder and attempts to gain his trust. However, it later <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> that Krycek is actually an undercover agent working for Cigarette Smoking Man. Krycek plays {{an important part in}} several events that are harmful to Mulder and Scully.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), her boss; and the distractions the writers of TGS face when writing sketches. This <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> when Liz's assistant, Cerie (Katrina Bowden), wears sexually suggestive clothing; and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) learns that working for Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the main star of TGS, is more than he expected.|$|E

5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's {{refuge in}} order to {{eliminate}} Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

25|$|Andersons Creek {{flows from}} {{neighbouring}} South Warrandyte and Warranwood into the Yarra {{just before the}} beginning of Pound Bend. This area is where several gullies converge and create a geographical hole, with Fourth Hill to the east and the hills on the eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek to the west. This <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> when driving through Warrandyte on Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road, as the hills guide the road down towards Andersons Creek.|$|E

25|$|As is {{well known}} in bicycle racing, the countersteering <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> when there is an {{obstacle}} preventing the wheel from countersteering (e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb). In these situations, the way to initiate a turn with the handlebars away from the obstacle is to countersteer towards obstacle to avoid crashing into it. Lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races.|$|E
25|$|Steven Gold (Hanks) is a {{struggling}} medical student who moonlights as a stand-up comedian. It quickly <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> {{that he is}} lousy at the former and excels at the latter. And yet, when he is given a chance at the big time, he cracks under the pressure. Lilah (Field) is a dedicated housewife who yearns to be a comic. She has the raw talent but {{does not have the}} command of craft that Steven possesses.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} areas of new {{settlement}} such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, New Zealand and Uruguay, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants. When it is considered that Argentina was {{second only to the}} United States (27million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such {{other areas of}} new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia; and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina <b>becomes</b> <b>evident.</b>|$|E

25|$|From 1908 to 1914 coil stamps {{were printed}} with Flat Plate presses in sheets of 400 {{which were then}} cut into strips for coiling. In 1915 the Bureau began {{printing}} coil stamps from continuous rolls of paper with the Rotary Press. The printing plates were curved and affixed around a rotating cylinder, a process that stretched the images somewhat, making them slightly longer than similar images printed from a flat-plate. The difference in size <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> when the two different types are placed side by side.|$|E
25|$|Early {{complications}} include {{infection and}} hematoma (blood outside the vascular system); late complications include an unsatisfactory breast-volume reduction that might require either surgical or liposuction revision. As with other liposuction procedures, {{the final result}} of a liposuction-only breast reduction <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> at 6-months post-operative; although the edema usually subsides at 2–3 weeks post-operative. To date, no incidence of tissue necrosis has been reported; likewise, {{there have been few}} reports of lessened nipple-sensation. Generally, the long-term rate of patient-satisfaction is high, provided that the indications for the liposuction-only technique are abided with proper patient selection.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{attempting}} to find disease-modifying agents for osteoarthritis, there is emerging {{evidence that a}} system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of osteoarthritis. Changes may occur before clinical disease is evident due to abnormalities in biomechanics, biology or structure of joints that predispose them to develop clinical disease. Research is thus focusing on defining these early pre-osteoarthritis changes using biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of osteoarthritis risk, emphasising multi-disciplinary approaches, and looking into personalized interventions that can reverse osteoarthritis risk in healthy joints before the disease <b>becomes</b> <b>evident.</b>|$|E

25|$|Babies {{born with}} severe CP often have an {{irregular}} posture; their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff. Birth defects, such as spinal curvature, a small jawbone, {{or a small}} head sometimes occur along with CP. Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older. Some babies born with CP do not show obvious signs right away. Classically, CP <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> when the baby reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise, where preferential use of limbs, asymmetry, or gross motor developmental delay is seen.|$|E
25|$|Cogan occulomotor apraxia {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of development. Affected children have difficulty moving their eyes only to a new visual target, so they will turn their head past the target to “drag” the eyes to the new object of interest, then turn the head back. This tendency <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> in late infancy and toddler years, and mostly improves with time. This contrasts to the oculomotor difficulties evident in children with A-T, which are not evident in early childhood but emerge over time. Cogan’s oculomotor apraxia is generally an isolated problem, or {{may be associated with}} broader developmental delay.|$|E
25|$|The window {{paintings}} of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the Naumburg Master, together creating unity and harmony. This <b>becomes</b> <b>evident</b> by the designs of {{the images of the}} saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten bishops of Naumburg {{at the bottom of the}} window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders were standing on the same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass {{paintings of}} their style from the 13th century.|$|E
