Partly {{as a result of}} JG 1's expansion, other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a fourth group from mid-1943.|$|E

5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> a greater degree for television.|$|E

5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E

It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E

5|$|The dwindling {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused NATO to shift to the flexible response strategy. This increased the importance of Banak, {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, in case of a Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{component}} of the F-FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small Albatroz-class patrol boats from the Portuguese Navy.

The role of the naval component is to conduct fishery and border protection patrols and ensure that the maritime line of communication to the Oecussi enclave remains open. All of the force's warships are based at Hera Harbour, which is located a few kilometres east of Dili. Under the Force 2020 plan the naval component may eventually <b>be</b> <b>expanded</b> <b>to</b> a light patrol force equipped with corvette-sized ships and landing craft.|$|E
