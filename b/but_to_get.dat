5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them to do what you want.|$|E

His employees in Key West had often traveled {{back and forth between}} Florida and Cuba looking for the best pay and conditions. By offering the anchor of land and home ownership – something most tabaqueros had never experienced, especially in land-scarce Key West – Ybor encouraged his workers to stick around. Though the workforce was still relatively fluid in the early years, enough workers remained in Tampa to keep the cigar factories fully staffed and running year-round.|$|E

500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there, you have to sit through a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; {{she thought it would}} be better to spray it onto your hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on your scalp will help it last longer".|$|E

The remainder of the 2nd Squadron were sent to Rangoon on 25 January. [...] On 28 January 1942, Newkirk told Chennault that the [...] "aeroplanes we have here are now are beginning to look like patchwork quilts for the holes in them.

By 7 March 1942, Rangoon had fallen and the defense of the Burma Road became the priority of the Flying Tigers.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} a melodic cover of [...] "Strawberry Swing" [...] by English {{alternative}} rock band Coldplay. Connor O'Neill of The Miscellany News writes that the cover begins the album with [...] "so much atmosphere you almost melt into it" [...] and then [...] "spreads you over an apocalyptic swan song". The song ends abruptly with the rude sound of an alarm clock, followed by the [...] "nightmarish" [...] song [...] "Novacane". It {{has been called a}} love song of sorts, with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn. Ocean meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl [...] "so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, has no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> gone on those same drugs". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} German Ideology, Marx {{turned to}} a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding [...] "the theory and tactics" [...] of a truly [...] "revolutionary proletarian movement" [...] operating {{from the standpoint of}} a truly [...] "scientific materialist" [...] philosophy. This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded {{one person at a time}} to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the manuscript past the government censors he called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) and offered it as a response to the [...] "petty bourgeois philosophy" [...] of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book The Philosophy of Poverty (1840).|$|E
500|$|MacLean {{testified that}} in his discussions with George Orsborne, he had formed the {{impression}} that the captain was part-owner of the vessel. Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun-running and smuggling. John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's [...] "serious allegations" [...] were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value, of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.|$|E

500|$|In late 2004, {{the group}} {{performed}} [...] "Soldier" [...] with T.I. during MTV's Total Request Live (TRL). At BET's 106 & Park Destiny's Child performed [...] "Soldier" [...] on November 15, 2004. At {{the beginning of}} the performance, Michelle Williams fell onstage during the group's entrance. Williams addressed the incident during an interview in 2014, saying, [...] "I had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up and act like it didn't happen. Because of YouTube – 10 years later, at least once a week, somebody brings it to my attention." [...] She added that it would be the last time she discussed the incident and acknowledged that although [...] "it lives on forever" [...] a lot of [...] "great things" [...] have happened to her since then. On November 16, 2004 another performance of the song was during the television show Good Morning America. Destiny's Child appeared on CBS The Early Show on December 8, 2004 and sang [...] "Soldier". The group performed the song again in early February 2005 at the British show Top of the Pops. At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, 2005 they sang [...] "Soldier" [...] and [...] "Lose My Breath".

500|$|Rindt's hesitancy {{appeared}} justified {{when both}} he and Hill suffered high speed crashes at the Spanish Grand Prix at Montjuïc. In both instances, the suspension mounted wings on the cars broke off, causing accidents that could have killed either driver. The effect of the failure lifted Rindt's car off the track and into the barriers, where it collided with the stationary car of Hill, whose accident occurred at the same spot. Although Rindt only suffered a broken nose, one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was furious with Lotus's team owner, Colin Chapman, over the failure; he told a reporter after the accident: [...] "I place the blame on him [...] and rightfully so, because he should have calculated that the wing would break." [...] In an interview on Austrian television a day later, he said: [...] "These wings are insanity [...] in my eyes {{and should not be}} allowed on racing cars. [...] <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any wisdom into Colin Chapman's head is impossible." [...] Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the accident, he replied: [...] "I never had any trust in Lotus", going on to describe his relationship with the team as [...] "purely business". His accident left him sidelined for the Monaco Grand Prix, a race that Hill won.|$|E
500|$|... "Novacane" [...] {{expresses a}} story through its lyrics, {{and has been}} {{described}} as [...] "nightmarish" [...] in nature. It has been called a [...] "love song of sorts", with influence taken from alternative hip hop group The Pharcyde. Lyrically the track explores a narrative in which the singer meets a girl attempting to pay her way through dental school by working in porn, or at least that's what she told him. Protagonist meets the girl at Coachella, a musical festival which takes place in Indio, California. Ocean serves as the protagonist in the song, in love with a girl [...] "so gone on drugs that Ocean, wanting to be close to her, has no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> gone on those same drugs". The pair get high using dental local anesthetics. Though Ocean serves as an unreliable narrator, Pitchfork wrote that he was [...] "probably still the most reliable character in the whole song." [...] The song contains reference to film director Stanley Kubrick and his 1999 drama Eyes Wide Shut. In addition, it also makes a comparison of the numbness that drugs produce with the use of auto-tune in the music business. Summing up the song, Pitchfork also commented that [...] "Novacane" [...] "is a song about personal connection but also about all the stupid numb human shit that {{gets in the way of}} personal connection, which means it's probably the most honest song about personal connection on the radio." [...] Rappers Joe Budden, Tyga and Prodigy have all released freestyles to [...] "Novacane".|$|E
