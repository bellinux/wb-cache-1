40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} generating a parametric Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> based on reparameterizing the partial surface patches in the base surfaces {{on the basis of}} Erich Hartmann method. This method is expressed as follows: Firstly, the partial region near contact curves in both base surfaces is reparameterized. The contact curves are used as the boundaries of the reparameterized partial region respectively. The reparameterized partial region in two base surfaces is called the reparameterized local base surfaces. Then the parametric Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> is generated by a linear combination of the reparameterized local base surface patches depending on one of the common parameters. Therefore, generating a Parametric Gn <b>Blending</b> <b>Surface</b> between two base surfaces is translated into generating a Parametric Gn <b>Blending</b> <b>Surface</b> between the two reparameterized local base surfaces. This paper illustrates the method to generate the Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> with some constraints by generating a G 2 <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> between the aerofoil and the body of a missile with the constraints of the forward and rear fringe curves. When the Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> with some constraints is generated, the partial region near contact curves in both base surfaces is reparameterized, and the scale factors, offset, balance factor and thumb weight are defined by meeting the constraints through using an optimization method. Then the parametric Gn <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> is generated by the linear combination of the reparameterized local base surface patches. The shape of the <b>blending</b> <b>surface</b> can be adjusted by changing the size of the reparameterized local base surface patches...|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} seismic surveys, {{the firing}} time between shots {{is such that}} the shot records do not interfere in time. However, {{in the concept of}} blended acquisition, the records do overlap, allowing denser source sampling and wider azimuths in an economic way. A denser shot sampling and wider azimuths make that each subsurface gridpoint is illuminated from a larger number of angles and will therefore improve the image quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. We show that — even with very simple blending parameters like time delays — the incident wavefield at a specific subsurface gridpoint represents a dispersed time series with a “complex code”. For shot-record migration purposes, this time series must have a stable inverse. In a next step, we show that the illumination can be further improved by utilizing the surface-related multiples. This means that these multiples can be exploited to improve the incident wavefield by filling angle gaps in the illumination and/or by extending the range of angles. In this way, the energy contained in the multiples now contributes to the image, rather than decreasing its quality. One remarkable consequence of this property is that the benefits to be obtained from the improved illumination depend on the detector locations in acquisition geometries as well. We show how to quantify the contribution of the <b>blended</b> <b>surface</b> multiples to the illuminating wavefield for a blended source configuration. Results confirm that the combination of blending and multiple scattering increases the illumination energy and, therefore, will improve the quality of shot-record migration results beyond today’s capability.

40|$|In our {{previous}} work, {{a more general}} fourth order partial differential equation (PDE) with three vector-valued parameters was introduced. This equation is able to generate a superset of the <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> of those produced by other existing fourth order PDEs found in the literature. Since it is usually more difficult to solve PDEs analytically than numerically, many references are only concerned with numerical solutions, which unfortunately are often inefficient. In this paper, we have developed a fast and accurate resolution method, the pseudo-Lévy series method. Due to its analytical nature, the comparison with other existing methods indicates that the developed method can generate <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> almost as quickly and accurately as the closed form resolution method, and has higher computational accuracy and efficiency than existing Fourier series and pseudo-spectral methods {{as well as other}} numerical methods.

40|$|The {{blending}} method {{based on}} partial differential equations (PDE) {{is an effective}} tool to generate a smooth, transition surface between base surfaces.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} prominent area {{of computer}} science is Computer Aided Geometric Design or CAGD. The main task of CAGD is to automate, {{to the greatest}} extent possible, the process of designing physical objects. A designer typically models an object {{as a collection of}} surfaces. For many objects, design specifications indicate only a few critical surfaces, with the remaining surfaces to be chosen so as to make the surface of the resulting object smooth. Smoothness is important because, in many mechanical objects, sharp edges are undesirable for functional or aesthetic reasons. For example, sharp edges on the interior surface of a gate valve retard fluid flow. Automatically calculating these remaining <b>surfaces,</b> called <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> is an important task in any CAGD system. Therefore, an understanding of the mathematics of surfaces that meet smoothly is fundamental to CAGD. Specifically, this thesis investigates the following problem: given a surface V and a point or curve W on that surface, construct surfaces that meet with V with a specified degree of smoothness along W. Working from a measure of smoothness known as geometric continuity, {{the first half of this}} thesis establishes that the space of all surfaces meeting V with the k-th order geometric continuity along W is directly related to certain algebraic structures called ideals. For example, let Z(M) (the set of point for which a polynomial M is zero) be an irreducible surface that intersects another surface Z(N) transversally (nontangentially) in an irreducible curve Z(M) Z(N). It is shown that a surface Z(F) meets Z(M) with order k geometric continuity along Z(M) Z(N) if and only if F is a polynomial of the form AM = BN^k+ 1 where A and B are free polynomials and A is nonzero on Z(M) Z(N). The second half of this work applies these results to the problem of generating <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Using the geometric properties of <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces,</b> it is shown that any surface Z(F) that smooths the intersection of two surfaces Z(M) and Z(N) must have certain algebraic properties. In particular, the degree of F must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the degrees of M^ 2 and N^ 2. Finally, existing methods for constructing <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> are shown to be consistent within the above algebraic framework. In fact, we demonstrate that these distinct methods are instances of a single general method for generating <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Moreover, this general method is shown to generate <b>blending</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the lowest possible degree...|$|R
