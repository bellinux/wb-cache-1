5000|$|The purlins are {{attached}} to the ribs using a [...] "hook" [...] <b>bolt,</b> which <b>hooks</b> through a pre-drilled hole in the rib and is secured into the purlin. The <b>hook</b> <b>bolt</b> is a unique feature of the Nissen design.|$|R
25|$|System cassettes. This is a rigid {{rectangular}} ventilated wall system {{consisting of}} curved or flat metal panels mounted and secured to a supporting structure. All four borders are pre-folded at the factory. Folded edges {{on every side}} allow large sheet metal parts to lie even with the cladding surface. Fixing is usually by riveting, screwing, or by using angle brackets or <b>bolt</b> <b>hooks</b> to fix the cassettes directly to the substrate. System cassettes are pre-profiled to meet specific architectural requirements. Links to representative photographs of cassette cladding are available.|$|R

Spools of ropes adorn {{all sides of}} the store and rigging is still {{assembled}} in a downstairs workshop. Beale's is a stunning shop, as much for its incongruity as for its dazzling display.|$|R
50|$|This type of tuner {{is almost}} obsolete, {{but is still}} used for the Portuguese guitar, itself {{historically}} {{closely related to the}} English guitar. The 18th-century incarnation of the design in England arranged the tuning <b>bolts</b> and <b>hooks</b> parallel with each other. 19th-century Portuguese luthiers developed the current fan arrangement to accommodate the extra 2 strings with the octave doubling of the lower courses and narrower fingerboard width; the English instrument had two single strings instead and a slightly wider fingerboard.|$|R

The dog-bone test circuit was 742 yd around, laid with light [...] rails on 7 lb steel sleepers and <b>hook</b> <b>bolts.</b> The track included tight curves of as low as 37 ft radius and steep gradients of as much as 1 in 17 (5.88%).|$|R
5000|$|Bachar {{posted a}} note in 1981 {{promising}} a [...] "$10,000 reward for anyone who can follow me for one full day." [...] No one took the challenge. That same year he put up Bachar-Yerian (5.11c R/X) in Tuolumne Meadows with Dave Yerian. A heady testpiece, the 300 ft vertical-to-gently-overhanging route is protected by 13 bolts (including anchor bolts), each one placed either from a stance (9) or while hanging from a hook (4). Bachar was a vocal critic of climbing tactics such as bolting on rappel, which came into vogue during the 1980s. However, {{at the time of}} the first ascent, there were critics of Bachar's decision to place certain <b>bolts</b> from <b>hooks,</b> rather than drilling and placing each bolt from a stance.|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} is a {{compilation}} of recent efforts and findings intended to solicit feedback on the approach, scenarios analyzed, findings, interpretations, conclusions, and implications for practice resulting from {{the efforts of the}} research team. Please forward comments or questions to the authors noted above. These efforts will ultimately be documented and made available to advance research efforts related to this topic and guidance for practice. The primary purpose of longitudinal safety barriers, such as cable barriers, is to contain and/or redirect errant vehicles that depart the roadway, hence keeping them from entering opposing travel lanes or encountering terrain features and roadside objects that may cause severe impacts. In this study, a detailed finite element model of a three-strand cable barrier was developed and validated against a previously conducted full-scale crash test. The full-scale crash test and simulation were setup for an impact of the cable barrier with a 2000 kg pickup truck at an angle of 25 deg and an initial velocity of 100 km/hr. This setup is in accordance with the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 guidelines for Test Level 3 safety performance. This paper provides guidelines for simulating cable barrier guardrail systems. Detailed methods for system simulation involving dynamic interactions of soil/post, post/hook <b>bolts,</b> cable / <b>hook</b> <b>bolts</b> and cable/truck are discussed. Results from the simulation and comparisons with the full-scale crash test are presented...|$|R
25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing the <b>bolts</b> and <b>hooks</b> that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts. Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The crew {{will be able to}} ingress it tomorrow, but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using had some problems with its communications equipment.|$|R
50|$|Hi-point's handguns use a {{blowback}} design {{similar to}} that used in the Walther PPK and Russian Makarov PM. In blowback weapons the mass of the slide and bolt absorbs the rearward force generated by the propulsion of the bullet. As the pressure drops to a safe level, the slide moves back, (along with the <b>bolt),</b> an extractor <b>hooks</b> the empty casing and pulls it out of the chamber, after which the case is ejected from the weapon by the ejector. When the slide has completed its rearward travel, the recoil spring moves the slide forward, chambering another round. Many, if not most, modern handguns use a locked-breech design and therefore do not require the amount of slide mass that the blowback design requires in order to remain comfortable to shoot, safe to fire, and easy to control during the firing process.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{anchor bolt}} is a cast-in-place anchor. As {{seen in the}} figure, most designs consist of a standard bolt with a hexagonal head, which is cast in the wet concrete before it sets. There are other designs, some consisting of a bent <b>bolt</b> with a <b>hook</b> on the end, or some other sort of bending. Cast-in-place anchor bolts are the strongest type of fastener, but the casting is difficult, and they are usually only used for heavy machines mounted on poured concrete floors. Another use of this anchor bolt is to connect the concrete foundation of a building to its wall. With this, the building is more resistant to earthquakes. Currently there are several devices to assist in holding and in placing anchor bolt to set in the concrete. These devices are mostly made from composite plastic.|$|R
60|$|But {{there is}} one very {{extensive}} warehouse among the rest that needs special mention--the ship's Yeoman's storeroom. In the Neversink it was down in the ship's basement, beneath the berth-deck, and you went to it {{by way of the}} Fore-passage, a very dim, devious corridor, indeed. Entering--say at noonday--you find yourself in a gloomy apartment, lit by a solitary lamp. On one side are shelves, filled with balls of marline, ratlin-stuf, seizing-stuff, spun-yarn, and numerous twines of assorted sizes. In another direction you see large cases containing heaps of articles, reminding one of a shoemaker's furnishing-store--wooden serving-mallets, fids, toggles, and heavers: iron prickers and marling-spikes; in a third quarter you see a sort of hardware shop--shelves piled with all manner of <b>hooks,</b> <b>bolts,</b> nails, screws, and thimbles; and, in still another direction, you see a block-maker's store, heaped up with lignum-vitae sheeves and wheels.|$|R

5000|$|In October 1942, {{the program}} was given the go-ahead to start {{planning}} for production. A second prototype was delivered in January, which moved the outer bomb shackles to a position inboard of the engines. Both started testing the dive bombing system installed in the 88 A-4 in February. The RLM then asked for another change, allowing the aircraft to mount either the BMW 801 or Jumo 213 engines as a complete Kraftei, or [...] "power egg" [...] unitized engine installation, that would simply be <b>bolted</b> on and <b>hooked</b> up. Concerns about the Jumo 213, now years overdue, were offset by this engine's better altitude performance, so {{it made sense to}} delay the aircraft slightly if that meant it could switch to the 213 as soon as they became available. The second Ju 188 V1 prototype was flown in at Rechlin between September and November 1943.|$|R

Patent #890,968 (1908)Process of Treating and Dressing a Bruise or Wound in the Trunk or Live Branch of a Live TreeThis process, pioneered and {{patented}} by John Davey, helped preserve and revitalize injured and/or dying trees through a method akin to surgery. By removing the decayed and unsound wood {{from the tree}} and then filling the wound with cementitious material and well-placed anchor ties, the tree could effectively be reinforced. The tree cavity was first coated with molten tar, and a drainage system installed, and a waterproof covering added to ensure sustained vitality.2. Patent #890,967 (1908)Means for Tying Tree Branches TogetherAs part of the science of tree surgery, John Davey patented the method allowing for the bracing of two branches to avoid further splitting where a wound existed at the base. This was done preparatory to surgery {{in order to maintain}} branch health. The mechanical apparatus consisted of a chain link device with <b>hook</b> <b>bolts</b> and a shank at either end, allowing the tied branches to move as a unit rather than through separate, divisive forces.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of several bridge deck fastening systems is being evaluated on the steel bridge at the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST) at the Transportation Technology Center, Pueblo, Colorado. Fastening systems tested to date include several variations using <b>hook</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{as well as}} spring clips. Results to date indicate that minor, inexpensive installation details can lead to significant increases in time required between maintenance. Details {{such as the use}} of double nuts and threaded fastener adhesive has proven to be particularly effective. At FAST, more than 500 million gross tons (MGT) of traffic passed over the bridge before tightening was required after this retrofit was applied. Other hardware details, {{such as the use of}} locking clips, can also increase time between maintenance; particularly in high-impact areas near rail joints. Locking clips have proven to extend maintenance cycles at FAST. But, some other hardware variations offered little or no benefit under the heavy axle load (HAL) traffic at FAST. Results for eight different deck fastener combinations are presented in this paper. Advantages and drawbacks, as well as failure modes, are noted based on the test experience at FAST. The bridge deck at FAST is a Conrail open-deck design with dapped oak ties. The deck has carried over 1, 200 MGT of 315, 000 -pound HAL traffic since installation in lat...|$|R
40|$|Click on the URL {{to access}} the article (may not be free). This paper focuses on the seismic {{performance}} of pallet-type steel storage rack structures in their down aisle direction. As evidenced by experimental research, the seismic response of storage racks in the down-aisle direction is strongly affected by the nonlinear moment-rotation response of the beam-to-column connections. In their down-aisle direction, rack structures are designed to resist lateral seismic loads with typical moment frames utilizing proprietary beam-to-column momentresisting connections. These connections are mostly boltless hooked type connections and they exhibit significantly large rotations resulting in large lateral frame displacements when subjected to strong ground motions. In this paper, typical hooked boltless beam-to-column connections are studied experimentally to obtain their non-linear reversed cyclic moment-rotation response. Additionally, a compound type connection involving the standard <b>hooks</b> and additional <b>bolts</b> were also tested under similar conditions. The simple introduction of the additional <b>bolts</b> within the <b>hooked</b> connection {{is considered to be}} a practical way of structural upgrade in the connection. The experimentally evaluated characteristics of the connections are compared in terms of some important performance indicators such as maximum moment and rotation capacity, change in stiffness and accumulated energy levels within the cyclic loading protocol. Finally, the obtained characteristics were used to carry out seismic performance assessment of rack frames incorporating the tested beam-to-column connections. The assessment involves a displacement based approach that utilizes a simple analytical model that captures the seismic behavior of racks in their downaisle direction. The results of the study indicate that the proposed method of upgrading appears to be a very practical and effective way of increasing the seismic performance of hooked connections and hence the rack frames in their down-aisle direction...|$|R
40|$|Wire rope is a versatile, flexible, {{high-strength}} member {{that is used}} in many mechanical systems. However, due to {{the complexity}} of wire rope, analytical investigations have been relatively limited. Previous attempts to create simplified models of wire rope were not validated with physical testing and used a cumbersome beam-and-shell or beam-and-solid method for simulating the wire rope. An improved LS-DYNA model of 19 -mm diameter 3 x 7 wire rope commonly used in roadside cable guardrail installations has been developed. A Belytschko-Schwer beam element was selected along with material *MAT_ 166. Since wire rope displays internal damping due to friction of strands and wires, low-frequency bending modes of wire rope were damped in the model using the LS-DYNA frequency range command, and high-frequency noise was reducing using the part stiffness damping. The optimum element length based on timestep, accuracy, and computational cost was determined to be between 0. 4 and 0. 8 in. (10 - 20 mm). Dynamic component tests were conducted on wire rope to determine material properties, and consisted of high-speed jerk tests of wire rope constrained at one end, and perpendicular impact of wire ropes constrained at both ends. These tests were simulated and the results compared to the physical tests. The new proposed wire rope model more accurately simulated the wire rope tension and bogie vehicle motion than previously-developed wire rope models. The wire rope was also modeled in full-scale crash test models using a Chevrolet C 2500 pickup model, consistent with NCHRP Report No. 350 TL- 3 impact conditions. Results of the crash test and simulation were compared, the wire rope response was determined to be accurate, though the wire ropes released from the <b>hook</b> <b>bolts</b> prematurely. Nonetheless, wire rope response, vehicle motion and trajectory were accurate. Therefore the new wire rope model was determined to be an improvement over existing models of wire rope and is recommended for use in cable guardrail simulations.
