5|$|In the Tour de France, Cancellara came {{in third}} of stage one's {{individual}} time trial. On the second stage, he was donned the yellow jersey {{thanks to a}} third place, which gave him four bonus seconds. He {{was involved in a}} mass pile-up on the third stage, and finished the race slowly. After a visit to the hospital, it was revealed that he had suffered two transverse process fractures in two vertebrae in his lower <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> had to abandon.|$|E
5|$|On {{the final}} climb, the Paterberg, Sagan rode away from Vanmarcke, who {{was caught by}} Cancellara {{at the top of}} the climb. They rode in pursuit of Sagan, who had a 15-second lead at the summit. The chasing pair were unable to bring Sagan <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> rode to the finish to win his first Monument. Cancellara {{finished}} second, 25 seconds back, with Vanmarcke allowing him to take second place. Kristoff won the sprint for fourth place, ahead of Luke Rowe (Sky), 49 seconds behind Sagan.|$|E

Gaeta ran to a service station after the shooter left and discovered that he was bleeding; he went to a hospital and was released within an hour.

25|$|Ranaghat {{town has}} existed since the British invaded India.

A more likely origin for {{the name of the}} town comes from Rani (Queen) or Rana (a Rajput warrior) and Ghat (steps leading to the river).|$|E

25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game {{went down in}} {{football}} history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently in the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E

The win saw Hartlepool earn a home-time against Premier League side Burnley, where he scored the first goal of the game. However, the Clarets would go on to win 2–1 after extra time.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, a {{mechanical}} engineering student called Uri Goldstein attended one of Geller's shows, and subsequently sued the show's promoters for breach of contract. He complained that Geller had promised {{a demonstration of}} several psychic powers but had delivered only sleight-of-hand and stage tricks. The case came before the civil court in Beersheba. Geller was not present as the summons {{had been sent to}} the office of the promoter Miki Peled, who had ignored it as being trivial. Goldstein was awarded 27.5 lira (around $5) for breach of contract. Later, Goldstein admitted that he went to the show specifically with the intention of suing to get his money <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> had already found a lawyer to represent him prior to attending the performance.|$|E

25|$|Andrés Bonifacio {{called for}} a general {{offensive}} on Manila and was defeated in battle at the town of San Juan del Monte. He regrouped his forces {{and was able to}} briefly capture the towns of Marikina, San Mateo and Montalban. Spanish counterattacks drove him <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> retreated to the mountains of Balara and Morong and from there engaged in guerrilla warfare. By August 30, the revolt had spread to eight provinces. On that date, Governor-General Ramon Blanco declared a state of war in these provinces and placed them under martial law. These were Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija. They would later be represented in the eight rays of the sun in the Filipino flag. Emilio Aguinaldo and the Katipuneros of Cavite were the most successful of the rebels and they controlled most of their province by September–October. They defended their territories with trenches designed by Edilberto Evangelista.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|Peter May {{required}} several {{operations and}} did not play in the 1960 season, but {{he was expected to}} return and Cowdrey was only made captain of England against South Africa as each game came up, rather than for the whole series. Even so, {{it was the first of}} only two occasions that Cowdrey captained England throughout a Test series. It proved to be an easy 3–0 win as the inexperienced Springbok side met a damp English summer and lost the first three Tests by 100 runs, an innings and 73 runs and 8 wickets. In the Third Test the South African captain Jackie McGlew was run out after colliding with an English fielder, the umpires did not allow Cowdrey to call him <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was widely blamed for not withdrawing the appeal before McGlew left the field. In the Fifth Test England were dismissed for 155, saw South Africa make 479/9 declared and were criticised by Walter Robins, the new Chairman of Selectors. In response Cowdrey made 155 and added 290 for the first wicket with Geoff Pullar (175) to save the match.|$|E

25|$|Following Lin's Winter campaign, Mao {{wanted him}} to attack targets farther south, but Lin {{disagreed}} {{because he did not}} want to leave a strong enemy at his <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> believed the defeat of a strong city would force Chiang to abandon the Northeast. By May 25, 1948, the Northeastern Field Army had completely encircled Changchun, including its airfield, and for the rest of the siege the Nationalist commander, Zheng Tongguo, depended entirely on supplies airdropped into the city. On May 19, Lin submitted a report to Mao in which he expected heavy casualties. By July 20 the siege was at a stalemate, and Lin deferred to Mao, allowing some of his army to attack Jinzhou farther south, beginning the Liaoshen Campaign. When Chiang airlifted reinforcements to defend Jinzhou, Lin ordered his army to abandon the siege and return to Changchun, but Mao disagreed and overruled him, and Lin was ordered to engage the defenders in a decisive confrontation. On October 14, the Northeast Field Army began its assault on Jinzhou with 250,000 men and the bulk of Lin's artillery and armour. After nearly 24 hours of fighting, Lin's forces were victorious, suffering 24,000 casualties but capturing the enemy commander, Fan Hanjie, and 90,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Her realm becomes {{known as}} the Val sans Retour (the Vale of No Return). Morgan's fancied good knights besides Lancelot include the rescued-but-abducted young Sir Alexander the Orphan (Alisaunder le Orphelin, a cousin of Tristan and Mark's enemy), whom she {{promises}} to heal, but he vows to rather castrate himself than to pleasure her, but promises her to defend the castle of Fair Guard (Belle Garde), {{where he has been}} held for a year, and then continues to guard it even when the castle was burnt down. In the Val sans Retour, Lancelot frees the many knights entrapped by Morgan from her power, including Morgan's own son Ywain and her former lover Guiomars who has been turned to stone by her for his unfaithfulness. Morgan captures Lancelot under her spell and keeps him prisoner in the hope Guinevere would go mad or die of sorrow, and otherwise torments the queen, causing her a great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring of protection from any power of Morgan. On one occasion, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Sir Gawain when he promises to come <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> keeps his word and does return; she eventually releases him when his health falters and he is near death.|$|E
