5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It {{would be foolish to}} claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> voracious reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E

5|$|In June 1944, Bradbury {{received}} {{orders from}} Parsons, {{who was now}} the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury {{to work on the}} explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some {{of which can be}} identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being over}} 60 {{years old and}} having {{been out of the}} Army for 25 years, the crisis of the Union {{compelled}} Greene to seek to rejoin the service. He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> firm believer in restoring the Union. He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18, 1862. The regiment of upstate New Yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal. Governor Edwin D. Morgan, although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age, saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political/military problem. During this period, Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment, but Greene chose to serve New York. The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly, gray-haired man reported for duty. They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted, which would have raised many of them in rank themselves.|$|E

5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E

25|$|Adolphe Clément-Bayard had {{no direct}} {{involvement}} in the nascent motor industry until around 1897, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> passenger in Albert Lemaître's (Peugeot) that was judged to be the official winner of what {{is considered to be}} the world's first motor race on 22 July 1894, from Paris to Rouen.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Lincoln (January 6, 1778 – January 17, 1851) was an American farmer, carpenter, {{and father}} of 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Unlike some of his ancestors, Lincoln could not write, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> well-respected {{community}} and church member known for his honesty. Lincoln struggled to make a successful living for his family and met challenges of Kentucky real estate border disputes, the early death of his first wife, and the integration of his second wife's family into his own family before making his final home in Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Stuart Charles Glyndwr MacGill (born 25 February 1971), {{commonly}} as Stuart MacGill, is {{a former}} Australian cricketer, who played 44 Tests and 3 ODIs. He is a right-arm leg spin bowler, who has been credited with having the best strike rate of any modern leg-spin bowler, {{but he did not}} have a regular place in the Australian Test team due to the dominance of Shane Warne in the position of sole spinner. His bowling was slightly slower through the air than Warne's, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> prodigious turner of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Al-Mutawakkil {{was assassinated}} {{by members of}} his Turkish {{bodyguard}} in December 861. Wasif was {{not a member of}} the assassination team, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> central figure in the plot. Al-Tabari claims that the conspiracy was hatched after al-Mutawakkil ordered Wasif's estates in Isfahan and al-Jibal to be seized in favour of al-Fath ibn Khaqan, and that the caliph had been plotting to kill Wasif and Bugha al-Sharabi, forcing the conspirators to strike against him first. For his part, Wasif was aware of the plan and sent five of his sons, including Salih ibn Wasif, to assist the assassins.|$|E

25|$|In his {{retirement}} Whitelaw undertook volunteer work with Legacy, a charitable organisation that cares for the dependents of deceased servicemen and women, {{and also the}} Victorian Country Fire Authority. Living in Upper Beaconsfield, Victoria he kept himself active through attending church and pursuing his interests in gardening, history and carpentry. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> gunner at heart and in 1955 he was offered the role of Colonel Commandant of the Royal Australian Artillery. He accepted and held this post until 1961. On 21 April 1964 {{he died of a}} heart attack while at Berwick, Victoria. He was 69 years of age and left behind his wife, Esther, and their three sons.|$|E
25|$|Gillespie seldom {{dominated}} a Test series (the most wickets {{he took in}} {{a series}} is 20), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reliable support bowler over several years for his more famous teammates Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne. However, Gillespie's career suffered an unexpectedly sharp decline. In early 2005, there were some signs that he was struggling, with somewhat poor displays against New Zealand, {{but he was still}} considered Australia's leading fast-bowling partner for McGrath. This poor form continued into the 2005 Ashes series where he struggled badly, taking just three wickets at a cost of 300 runs and, as a result, was dropped after the third Test.|$|E
25|$|Robert Mannyng or Robert de Brunne, is {{well known}} among {{scholars}} of Middle English for his works dating from the early 14th century. He led the writing of English out of its eclipse by Latin and Anglo-Norman. He is often {{said to have been}} a monk in Bourne Abbey <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Gilbertine and the abbey was Arrouaisian or Augustinian. His name which associates him with 'Brunne', the form of 'Bourne' used in his time is likely to have arisen from his having originated in the town. Since the nave of the abbey was the parish church, Robert, the boy will have known it well until he left for Sempringham in 1288.|$|E
