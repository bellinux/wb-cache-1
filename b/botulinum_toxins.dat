50|$|Neurotransmitters are spontaneously {{packed in}} vesicles and {{released}} in individual quanta-packets independently of presynaptic action potentials. This slow release is detectable and produces micro-inhibitory or micro-excitatory {{effects on the}} postsynaptic neuron. An action potential briefly amplifies this process. Neurotransmitter containing vesicles cluster around active sites, and {{after they have been}} released may be recycled by one of three proposed mechanism. The first proposed mechanism involves partial opening and then re-closing of the vesicle. The second two involve the full fusion of the vesicle with the membrane, followed by recycling, or recycling into the endosome. Vesicular fusion is driven largely by the concentration of calcium in micro domains located near calcium channels, allowing for only microseconds of neurotransmitter release, while returning to normal calcium concentration takes a couple of hundred of microseconds. The vesicle exocytosis is thought to be driven by a protein complex called SNARE, that is the target for <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins.</b> Once released, a neurotransmitter enters the synapse and encounters receptors. Neurotransmitters receptors can either be inotropic or g protein coupled. Inotropic receptors allow for ions to pass through when agonized by a ligand. The main model involves a receptor composed of multiple subunits that allow for coordination of ion preference. G protein coupled receptors, also called metabotropic receptors, when bound to by a ligand undergo conformational changes yielding in intracellular response. Termination of neurotransmitter activity is usually done by a transporter, however enzymatic deactivation is also plausible.|$|E
50|$|Südhof {{started his}} {{independent}} research career in neuroscience since 1986 {{and open the}} field of molecular neuroscience for synaptic transmission especially from the presynaptic nerve terminal perspective. Until Südhof began his work, majority of neuroscience research was aimed at the postsynaptic neuron {{and its role in}} learning and memory. Indeed, Thomas Südhof is credited with discovering much of the machinery mediating neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity in his 21 years at UT Southwestern. Südhof began with the discovery of synaptotagmins and their role in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. Synaptotagmin, a transmembrane protein found in neurosecretory vesicles, functions as a calcium sensor triggering vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Stimulation of a neuron results in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. After binding calcium ion to a region in its cytosolic domain, vesicular synaptotagmin promotes quick or slow neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron via interaction with regulatory and fusion related proteins such as members of the SNARE complex. Südhof also discovered RIMs and Muncs (most notably Munc13 and Munc18), soluble proteins which aid in the fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles to the nerve cell membrane and {{play an important role in}} synaptic plasticity. In addition, Südhof’s research uncovered the role of many other proteins facilitating vesicle binding, fusion, and resultant neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron, including members of the SNARE complex: synaptobrevin, in the vesicular membrane, syntaxin, in the cell membrane, and SNAP25, which is tethered to the cytosolic side of the cell membrane via cysteine-linked palmitoyl chains and holds the complex of four helices together. Südhof was also responsible for elucidating the action of tetanus and <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxins,</b> which selectively cleave synaptobrevin and SNAP25, respectively, inhibiting vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane.|$|E

40|$|Background—Intrasphincteric {{injection}} of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> {{is a new}} treatment option for achalasia.  Aims—To compare the immediate and long term efficacy of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> with that of pneumatic dilatation.  Methods—Symptomatic patients with achalasia were randomised to <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> (22 patients, median age 57 years) or pneumatic dilatation (20 patients, median age 56 years). Symptom scores were assessed initially, and at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months after treatment. Objective assessment included oesophageal manometry initially and at one month, and barium oesophagram initially and at one, six, and 12 months post-treatment.  Results—Pneumatic dilatation resulted in a significantly (p= 0. 02) higher cumulative remission rate. At 12 months, 14 / 20 (70 %) pneumatic dilatation and 7 / 22 (32 %) <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> treated patients were in symptomatic remission (p= 0. 017). Failure rates were similar initially, but failure over time was significantly (p= 0. 01) higher after <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> (50 %) than pneumatic dilatation (7 %).

40|$|Focal {{dystonia}} is a common, invalidating neurologic condition {{characterized by}} involuntary, sustained muscle contractions causing twisting movements and abnormal postures in one body part. Currently, <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> is {{the treatment of}} first choice. We performed a systematic review towards the pharmaco-therapeutic and pharmaco-economic value of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> as treatment for focal dystonia, which yielded the following results. <b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> {{is the most effective}} treatment for reducing dystonic symptoms measured with dystonia-specific and general questionnaires, and pain in patients with focal dystonia. Seventy-one percent of patients with cervical dystonia had a reduction in neck pain compared to 12 % in placebo groups. Adverse events occur in 58 % of patients during treatment with <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> compared to 46 % treated with placebo. Especially dry mouth, neck weakness, dysphagia, and voice changes are common. Adverse events are usually mild and self-limiting. Health-related quality of life, measured with the SF- 36 is 20 - 50 points lower in patients with focal dystonia compared to controls and the effect of <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> on health-related quality of life is unclear. <b>Botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> treatment is expensive because the drug itself is expensive. Yearly costs for treating a patient with focal dystonia with <b>botulinum</b> <b>toxin</b> range from EUR 347 to EUR 3, 633 and the gain in QALYs with BTX treatment is small.
