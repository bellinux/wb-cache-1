50|$|A {{splitting}} maul {{also known}} as a block buster, <b>block</b> <b>splitter,</b> sledge axe, or go-devil is a heavy, long-handled axe used for splitting a piece of wood along its grain. One side of its head is like a sledgehammer, and the other side is like an axe.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} a variety of <b>splitter</b> <b>blocks,</b> <b>splitter</b> cables, and similar devices available. These are usually un-fused (with the {{exception}} of C13 cords attached to BS 1363 plugs, which are always fused).|$|R
40|$|Beam {{splitter}} with curved {{entrance and}} exit surfaces introduces less chromatic aberration and Seidel aberrations in some optical systems than traditional plate or <b>block</b> beam <b>splitters.</b> Spherical-surface beam splitter {{is used in}} Schmidt-type mirror objective to split converging image-forming beam so two images are formed. Small aberrations introduced are corrected by compensator plate located at or near aperture stop...|$|R
5000|$|Internationally, it {{is renowned}} for heavy {{construction}} {{such as a}} buffer between transportation trailers and heavy steel fabrications (such as boilers, pressure vessels, reactors and many others). It is also frequently found in dry docks as a timber to separate the hull of ships from the steel supporting stands. Other uses include use in boats and ships, industrial flooring, roofing (as shingles), fine indoor and outdoor furniture, coffin wood (esteemed by Chinese due to ability to withstand rot and insect attack) and tool handles (especially those exposed to continual high impact (the wood does not splinter and thus injure hands, eyes or endanger the operator on catastrophic failure) such as shovels, axes, <b>block</b> <b>splitters,</b> sledge hammers, heavy mallets, demolition hammers, mattocks, picks, hoes and hammers). Some expert cabinet-makers treasure an ulin-headed carpenter's mallet as an excellent intermediate density hammer face between the usual wood and a metal one {{and is able to}} quite easily tap or [...] "whack" [...] stubborn highly polished metal fixtures without damage to the face or the fixture.|$|R
50|$|Teem Photonics used an ion-exchange {{process to}} produce a channel {{waveguide}} in a rare-earth doped phosphate glass. Resulting waveguides were typically single-mode waveguides, which could be easily integrated with other fiber-optic components. In addition, several different elements could be integrated in one circuit, including gain <b>blocks,</b> couplers, <b>splitters</b> and others. However, due to a relatively low refractive index contrast between the core and the cladding in these waveguides, the selection of optical elements that can be produced on such a platform was rather limited and the resulting circuit size tended to be large, i.e. comparable to then available fiber-optic counterparts.|$|R
5000|$|A {{domestic}} supply typically {{consists of}} a large cable connected to a service head, the sealed box containing the main supply fuse, treated as the supply to the premises. This will typically have a value from 40-100 A. Separate [...] and neutral cables (tails) go from here to an electricity meter, and often an earth conductor too. More tails proceed from the meter into the consumer side of the installation and into a consumer unit (distribution board), {{or in some cases}} to a Henley <b>block</b> (a <b>splitter</b> box used in low voltage electrical engineering) and thence to more than one distribution board.|$|R
500|$|There {{were several}} {{different}} categories of {{worker in the}} quarries. The quarrymen proper, who made up just over 50% of the workforce, worked the slate in partnerships of three, four, six or eight, known as [...] "bargain gangs". A gang of four typically consisted of two [...] "rockmen" [...] who would blast the rock to produce <b>blocks,</b> a <b>splitter,</b> who would split the blocks with hammer and chisel, and a dresser. A rybelwr would usually be a boy learning his trade, who would wander around the galleries offering assistance to the gangs. Sometimes a gang {{would give him a}} block of slate to split. Other groups were the [...] "bad rockmen" [...] who usually worked in crews of three, removing unworkable rock from the face, and the [...] "rubbish men" [...] who cleared the waste rock from the galleries and built the tips of waste which surrounded the quarry. One ton of saleable slate could produce up to 30tons of waste.|$|R
40|$|A phenomenological {{approach}} is developed that allows one to completely describe the effects of unwanted noise, such as the noise associated with absorption and scattering, in high-Q cavities. This noise is modeled by a <b>block</b> of beam <b>splitters</b> and an additional input-output port. The replacement schemes enable us to formulate appropriate quantum Langevin equations and input-output relations. It is demonstrated that unwanted noise renders it possible to combine a cavity input mode and the intracavity mode in a nonmonochromatic output mode. Possible applications to unbalanced and cascaded homodyning of the intracavity mode are discussed and {{the advantages of the}} latter method are shown.

50|$|Shake blocks {{are split}} into 1 inch thick slats called blanks, using either a {{hydraulic}} press with a blade attached, called a cuber, or split by hand using a froe and mallet. These blanks are uniform in thickness throughout if split {{from the same}} edge without flipping the <b>block.</b> Alternatively, the <b>splitter</b> may flip the block after a blank is taken off each edge, which results in a tapered split from end to end, called tapers or hand-split. The blanks which are not tapered require further processing before application to create this taper, and are run through a large band saw, pushed by hand to cut them from corner to corner forming a tapered shake, sawn on one face.|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} recently available photomultiplier-based photon-counting modules {{with simple}} optics and electronics, {{it is possible}} to construct highly sensitive, yet reasonably compact, fluorescence lifetime monitors, capable of working with extremely low fluorescent-light return levels. Measurements are rapid, the unit operates with relatively little excitation cross-talk (due to temporal separation of send and return signals) and the same basic apparatus {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to characterise the fluorescent decay curves from layers. The presented sensor, which is designed to interrogate Ru 2 + complex indicator dyes (fluorescence lifetime in the range 3 - 7 microseconds), derives excitation light from an HP high-intensity blue LED source (a flash-lamp is not required). With the aid of a dichroic <b>splitter</b> <b>block,</b> a single optical fibre is used to guide excitation light to the dye and to collect the resulting fluorescence...|$|R
500|$|Mechanization was {{gradually}} introduced to make most {{aspects of the}} industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine.

In 1859, John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce <b>blocks</b> for the <b>splitter,</b> then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate.

40|$|Abstract:This paper proposes new {{shorter and}} {{efficient}} designs {{by means of}} laboratory experimentation as compared to USBR type VI stilling basin models. The models are tested on 4 cm x 4 cm square opening (d = 4 cm) for Froude number (Fr) = 6. 83 with a diverging side walls at a slope of 1 V: 0. 8 H. Appurtenances of several shapes and sizes like <b>splitter</b> <b>block,</b> impact wall, baffle blocks, intermediate sill, and end sills are tested in the laboratory at different locations. It {{has been found that}} a row of wedge shaped block quite is helpful in spreading the jet of water in a shorter length of basin with diverging side walls, resulting into better and more energy dissipation. It was found that the length of stilling basin models can be reduced (12. 9 d to 10. 9 d) i. e. by more than 15 % as compared to USBR impact type VI stilling basin model...|$|R
5000|$|In 1843, the Padarn Railway {{became the}} first quarry railway to use steam locomotives, and the {{transport}} of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852. The Corris Railway opened as the horse-worked Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad in 1859, connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the River Dyfi. The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863, and the Talyllyn Railway was opened in 1866 to serve the Bryn Eglwys quarry above the village of Abergynolwyn. Bryn Eglwys grew {{to be one of}} the largest quarries in mid Wales, employing 300 men and producing 30% of the total output of the Corris district. The Cardigan Railway was opened in 1873, partly to carry slate traffic, and enabled the Glogue quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men.Mechanization was gradually introduced to make most aspects of the industry more efficient, particularly at Blaenau Ffestiniog where the Ordovician slate was less brittle than the Cambrian slate further north, and therefore easier to work by machine.
