5|$|Following {{the example}} of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of {{military}} camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward's , but he found at first that less highbrow performers like Beatrice Lillie were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> at entertaining the troops. He returned to filming in 1940, as Disraeli in Thorold Dickinson's The Prime Minister. In this morale-boosting film he portrayed the politician from ages thirty to seventy; this was, in Morley's view, {{the first time he}} seemed at home before the camera. Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years; he turned down the role of Julius Caesar in the 1945 film of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra with Vivien Leigh. He and Leigh were close friends, and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part, but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director, Gabriel Pascal. Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud's former teacher, Claude Rains.|$|E
5|$|The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> expected at the season's start. Despite that sentiment, most fans and supporters {{pointed to the}} fact that in all of Virginia Tech's losses, the deciding points came late in the fourth quarter and {{near the end of the}} game. Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities. Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia, and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 World's Best 10K he came third, {{beaten by}} Sammy Kitwara and Vincent Chepkok. He won the Lisbon Half Marathon {{for the third}} {{straight}} year, but was slower than previous times (59:34) due to warm conditions and having the flu. A run at the 2012 London Marathon saw him perform <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> did in 2010, but he lost touch with the leading pack after the halfway point and came fourteenth with a time of 2:10:41 hours. He was chosen as Eritrea's flag bearer at the 2012 London Olympics and ran in the 10,000 metres final. He set the pace early on in the race but was defeated in the sprint finish, finishing in sixth place some three seconds behind the winner Mo Farah. After the Olympics he ran at the 2012 World Half Marathon Championships. He dominated the race from just beyond the 5km point, and won it convincingly in a time of 1:00:19 hours, 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up, Deressa Chimsa. Only two weeks later he entered the Great Birmingham Run, but he appeared tired and finished third in a race where the top three all dipped under Haile Gebrselassie's course record.|$|E

5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had in weeks.|$|E

Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.|$|E

Sturt became friendly with John Oxley, Allan Cunningham, Hamilton Hume and other explorers. Sturt was keen to explore the Australian interior, especially its rivers.|$|E

25|$|Through {{questioning}} Bonin's neighbor, Everett Fraser, police {{discovered that}} 17-year-old William Ray Pugh, who had informed police he suspected Bonin {{of being the}} Freeway Killer, actually knew Bonin much <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had initially divulged. Police later learned Pugh had willingly accompanied Bonin on the murder of Harry Todd Turner. As {{a direct result of}} this knowledge, first-degree murder charges against a 20-year-old acquaintance of Bonin's named Eric Wijnaendts—brought in December, 1980—were dropped, with the county prosecutor citing insufficient evidence as the cause.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{criticism}} of race, milieu, and {{moment at the}} time the idea was created was that it did not sufficiently take into account the individuality of the artist, central to the creative genius of Romanticism. Even Zola, who owed so much to Taine, made this objection, arguing that an artist's temperament could lead him to make unique artistic choices distinct from the environment that shaped his general viewpoint; Zola's principal example was the painter Édouard Manet. Similarly, Gustave Lanson argued that race, milieu, and moment could not among themselves account for genius; Taine, he felt, explained mediocrity <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> explained greatness.|$|E
25|$|But {{even after}} {{attaining}} success while vanquishing the combined armies of his enemies, Kulothunga Chola III showed remarkable poise and dexterity in his conduct {{and treatment of}} the defeated adversaries.

His life was spared and he was allowed some land and other wealth suited to his new station'. Possibly, Kulothunga Chola III also had a hand in the identification and enthronement of the next Pandya monarch Vikrama Pandya after his victory over Vira Pandya.|$|E

25|$|Alma-Tadema left Taeye's {{studio in}} November 1858 {{returning}} to Leeuwarden before settling in Antwerp, where {{he began working}} with the painter Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, whose studio {{was one of the}} most highly regarded in Belgium. Under his guidance Alma-Tadema painted his first major work: The Education of the children of Clovis (1861). This painting created a sensation among critics and artists when it was exhibited that year at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp. It is said to have laid the foundation of his fame and reputation. Alma-Tadema related that although Leys thought the completed painting <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> had expected, he was critical of the treatment of marble, which he compared to cheese.|$|E
25|$|The journey {{down the}} Coppermine River took {{far longer than}} planned, and Franklin quickly lost faith in his first nation guides, who in fact knew the area little <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> did, and assured him that the sea was close, then far, then close again. The Arctic Ocean was finally sighted on 14 July 1821, shortly before the {{expedition}} encountered its first Inuit camp. The Inuit fled, and Franklin's men never {{had the opportunity to}} make further contact or trade for supplies as he had hoped. The abandoned camp gave a further indication of the scarcity of food in the area; the stocks of dried salmon were rotting and maggot-infested, and the meat which was drying consisted mainly of small birds and mice.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the excuse that they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|E
