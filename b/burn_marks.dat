5|$|The case of Newirth's death, {{the latest}} in several of its kind, is {{assigned}} to local detective Kelly Ryan (Kate Twa). She seeks help from Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), her former instructor at the FBI Academy. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) also takes part in the investigation, believing Newirth died from spontaneous human combustion. While searching the home of an earlier victim, the agents realize that both she and Newirth had recently traveled by train. Meanwhile, Banton sits in a train station, cautiously looking at the floor; because the room is lit by soft light, his shadow cannot be seen. After he leaves, Banton is confronted by two police officers patrolling the area. Despite Banton's warnings, the officers step into his shadow and disappear, leaving more <b>burn</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and <b>burn</b> <b>marks</b> on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E
25|$|Apart from pure metal chains, {{cable ties}} are also {{often used as}} {{a quick way to}} tie someone up securely. These ties can leave <b>burn</b> <b>marks</b> on the skin when applied too tightly, and because of their {{durability}} and resistance to struggling, must be handled carefully when applied to joints or being left in place for a longer time.|$|E

25|$|Holland was {{reported}} missing from her house in Goodna on 23 September 1991; she had been {{on her way to}} nearby shops. Three days later her partly unclothed body was found in nearby Redbank Plains. She had been killed with at least ten blows to the head from a blunt instrument, and there were <b>burn</b> <b>marks</b> on her lower body, possibly from a cigarette.|$|E
25|$|After daybreak on {{the morning}} of 26 December, {{servicemen}} returned to a small clearing near {{the eastern edge of the}} forest and found three small impressions in a triangular pattern, as well as <b>burn</b> <b>marks</b> and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 a.m. the local police were called out again, this time to see the impressions on the ground, which they thought could have been made by an animal. Georgina Bruni, in her book You Can't Tell the People, published a photograph of the supposed landing site taken {{on the morning}} after the first sighting.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1985, {{another victim}} was found near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County on interstate 75. Although her murder {{occurred}} three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, {{she was already}} in an advanced state of decomposition. Like the others, she was white and had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely {{between the ages of}} 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered. The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, a shirt and jeans. The Jane Doe had green or hazel eyes, which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and <b>burn</b> <b>marks</b> on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when murdered by an undisclosed method. She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.|$|E

The court heard that [...] "three circular burn type marks" [...] had been found on Nevill's back.

2500|$|Arone fell {{unconscious}} {{after several}} hours of beatings, after shouting [...] "Canada! Canada! Canada!" [...] as his last words. When Brown mentioned the event to Sergeant J.K.

2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} released {{footage of}} a captured RQ-170 on 8 December. The captured drone {{appeared to be}} largely intact, except for minor damage on its left wing. Dan Goure, {{an analyst at the}} Lexington Institute, stated the largely intact airframe ruled out the possibility of an engine or navigational malfunction: [...] "Either this was a cyber/electronic warfare attack system that brought the system down or it was a glitch in the command-and-control system". On 8 December, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is thought to have crashed. After examining the video on 8 Dec, US officials confirmed that the drone was genuine, even though some civilians had initially expressed doubt. Bill Sweetman, an author with an interest in military planes, speculated that the Iranians did not shoot down the plane (citing the lack of <b>burn</b> <b>marks,</b> holes, or outward damage) or hack into the system, postulating that a system failure downed the plane, and that the plane could be intact from what is known as a [...] "flat spin" [...] or [...] "falling leaf departure".|$|E
