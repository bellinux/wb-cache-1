50|$|Citizens of the 2nd Territorial District {{petitioned the}} 1855 Free State {{convention}} to incorporate a <b>black</b> exclusion <b>clause</b> in the Topeka Constitution. This {{was rejected by}} officials including James H, Lane, convention president, who allowed the issue to be voted separately in the January 1856 elections; the results favored exclusion.

40|$|The Master's thesis {{provides}} {{readers with}} a basic analysis of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010. The mentioned regulation confers a benefit of the so called block exemption on broad spectrum of vertical agreements including in this context also certain agreements among competing undertakings. Since agreements enjoying {{the benefit of the}} block exemption are presumed to meet criteria stipulated in Article 101 (3) TFEU, the block exemption eliminates legal uncertainty which undertakings whose agreements distort competition within the meaning of Article 101 (1) TFEU would otherwise face. It follows that {{it is not necessary to}} examine such agreements on its merits. Thus, transaction costs are reduced. Structure of the thesis is chosen so that it reflects three main questions concerning applicability of the block exemption, namely whether (i) an agreement falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010, whether (ii) it contains <b>black</b> <b>clauses</b> (hard-core restrictions) and whether (iii) it contains (non-severable) grey clauses. After a brief description of wider connections and general issues in Chapter One, in Chapter Two the thesis deals with the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010 with respect to the notion of vertical agreement, the role of intellectual property rights, the treatment of [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{return for}} Russia's service in {{preventing}} Austrian support {{being given to}} France, Gorchakov looked to Bismarck for diplomatic support on the Eastern Question, and he received an instalment of the expected support when he successfully denounced the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>clauses</b> {{of the treaty of}} Paris. This was justly regarded by him as an important service to his country and one of the triumphs of his career, and he hoped to obtain further successes with the assistance of Germany. However, the cordial relations between the cabinets of St Petersburg and Berlin did not last much longer.|$|R
50|$|After his {{retirement}} from politics, he {{was active in}} levee affairs and was a delegate to the Mississippian constitutional convention of 1890, in which he supported the <b>black</b> disenfranchisement <b>clause</b> that the state's Democrats had introduced the new constitution. He was twice married: in 1839 to Mary C. Stewart of Kentucky, who died in 1849; and in 1850 to Amelia Walton Glover of Alabama. In his later life, Alcorn practiced law in Friars Point, Mississippi, and lived quietly at his home, Eagle's Nest, in Coahoma County, until his death and interment in the family cemetery in 1894. Alcorn had a statue made of himself and after his death it was put on his grave.|$|R
5000|$|The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 {{broke out}} {{within a few}} days of Lord Granville's quoting in the House of Lords (11 July 1870) the opinion of the {{permanent}} under-secretary (Edmund Hammond) that [...] "he had never known so great a lull in foreign affairs." [...] Russia took advantage of the situation to denounce the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>clauses</b> of the Treaty of Paris, and Lord Granville's protest was ineffectual. In 1871 an intermediate zone between Asiatic Russia and Afghanistan was agreed on between him and Shuvalov; but in 1873 Russia took possession of the Khanate of Khiva, within the neutral zone, and Lord Granville had to accept the aggression (See also: The Great Game).|$|R
25|$|The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when France {{was crushed}} in the Franco-Prussian War. While Prussia {{and several other}} German states united into a {{powerful}} German Empire, Napoleon III was deposed {{in the formation of}} the French Third Republic. Napoleon had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question in order to gain the support of Britain. But the new French Republic did not oppose Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire because that did not significantly threaten French interests. Encouraged by the decision of France, and supported by the German minister Otto, Fürst von Bismarck, Russia denounced the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>clauses</b> of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As Britain alone could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.|$|R
50|$|This type of debt bondage, {{for blacks}} and poor whites, led to a populist {{movement}} in the late 19th century that began to bring blacks and whites together for a common cause. This early populist movement is largely credited with helping to cause state governments in the South, mostly controlled by the planter elite, to enact various laws that disenfranchised poor whites and <b>blacks,</b> through grandfather <b>clauses,</b> literacy tests, poll taxes, and various other laws.|$|R
2500|$|Peace {{negotiations}} {{began in}} 1856 under the Emperor Nicholas I's successor, Alexander II. Under the ensuing Treaty of Paris, the [...] "Four Points" [...] plan proposed earlier was largely adhered to; most notably, Russia's special privileges {{relating to the}} Danubian Principalities were transferred to the Great Powers as a group. In addition, warships of all nations were perpetually excluded from the Black Sea, once the home to a Russian fleet (which had been destroyed during the war). The Emperor of Russia and the Sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on that sea coast. The <b>Black</b> Sea <b>clauses</b> came at a tremendous disadvantage to Russia, for it greatly diminished the naval threat it posed to the Ottomans. Moreover, all the Great Powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when France was {{defeated}} by Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. While Prussia and several other German states united to form a powerful German Empire, the Emperor of the French, Napoleon III, was deposed to permit {{the formation of a}} Third French Republic. During his reign, Napoleon III, eager for the support of the United Kingdom, had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question. Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire, however, did not in any significant manner threaten the interests of France. Thus, France abandoned its opposition to Russia after the establishment of a republic. Encouraged by the decision of the French, and supported by the German minister Otto von Bismarck, Russia renounced the <b>Black</b> Sea <b>clauses</b> of the treaty agreed to in 1856.

5000|$|Peace {{negotiations}} at the Congress of Paris {{resulted in}} {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Paris on 30 March 1856. In compliance with article III, Russia restored to the Ottoman Empire the city and citadel of Kars in common with [...] "all other parts of the Ottoman territory of which the Russian troop were in possession". Russia returned the Budjak, in Bessarabia, back to Moldavia. By article IV Britain, France, Sardinia and Turkey restored to Russia [...] "the towns and ports of Sevastopol, Balaklava, Kamish, Eupatoria, Kerch, Jenikale, Kinburn as well as all other territories occupied by the allied troops". In conformity with article XI and XIII, the Tsar and the Sultan agreed not to establish any naval or military arsenal on the Black Sea coast. The <b>Black</b> Sea <b>clauses</b> weakened Russia, and it no longer posed a naval threat to the Ottomans. The principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia were nominally returned to the Ottoman Empire; in practice they became independent. The Great Powers pledged to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

Previously, during the 1920s and 1930s, the Court had interpreted the commerce clause narrowly, often striking down laws {{on the grounds that}} Congress had overstepped its authority.

Although she did not win the contest (for [...] "Miss Panther Woman" [...] in the 1932 film, Island of Lost Souls), Patrick was offered a standard contract. She visited the studio officials by herself and asked to negotiate.

40|$|In June of 1844, James D. Saules, a black sailor turned farmer {{living in}} Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s Willamette Valley, {{was arrested and}} convicted for {{allegedly}} inciting Indians to violence against a settler named Charles E. Pickett. Three years earlier, Saules had deserted the United States Exploring Expedition, married a Chinookan woman, and started a freight business on the Columbia River. Less than two months following Saules 2 ̆ 7 arrest, Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s Provisional Government passed its infamous 2 ̆ 2 Lash Law, 2 ̆ 2 banning the immigration of free black people to the region. While the government repealed the law in 1845, Oregon passed a territorial black exclusion law in 1849 and included a <b>black</b> exclusion <b>clause</b> in its 1857 state constitution. Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s territorial delegate also convinced the U. S. Congress to exclude black people from the 1850 Donation Land Act. In each case, Oregon politicians suggested {{the legacy of the}} Saules case by stressing the need to prevent black men, particularly sailors, from coming to Oregon and collaborating with local indigenous groups to commit acts of violence against white settlers. This thesis explains the unusual persistence of black exclusion laws in Oregon by focusing on the life of Saules, both before and after white American settlers came to the region in large numbers. Black exclusion in Oregon was neither an anomalous byproduct of American expansion nor a means to prevent slavery from taking root in the region. Instead, racial exclusion was central to the land-centered settler colonial project in the Pacific Northwest. Prior to the Americanization of the Pacific Northwest, the region was home to a cosmopolitan and increasingly fluid culture that incorporated various local Native groups, exogenous fur industry workers, and missionaries. This was a milieu made possible by colonialism and the rise of merchant capitalism during the Age of Sail, a period which lasted from the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. This was also likely a world very familiar to Saules, who had spent his entire adult life aboard ships and in various seaports. However, the American immigrants who began arriving in Oregon in the early 1840 s sought to dismantle this multiethnic social order, privatize land, and create a homogenous settler society based on classical republican principles. And although Saules was born in the United States, American settlers, emboldened by a racialist ideology, denied most non-whites a place in their settler society. Furthermore, during the early decades of resettlement, white American settlers often felt vulnerable to attacks from the preexisting population. Therefore, many settlers viewed free black men like Saules, a worldly sailor with connections among Native people, as potential threats to the security of their nascent communities...|$|R
