40|$|The {{process of}} {{brownfield}} revitalisation still poses {{a challenge in}} the SEE area. It is delayed and hindered because of legal, financial, environmental and image problems. These areas of old industrial cities represent an underexplored economic value, are areas for investment and could be motors for job creation. In our paper {{we would like to}} present the main goals of the revitalisation process. The main long-term goal is to develop an internationally competitive business location that will be able to attract new <b>businesses</b> <b>dealings</b> in higher value added environmentally friendly production and knowledge based services, aiming thus at faster and stable economic development of the region...|$|R

5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; team-mates and opponents alike found him hard to get along with. He was unsuccessful in <b>business</b> <b>dealings</b> and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career as a sports administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E

Behar's article covers topics including L.

Later that month, on May23, the Senate held its confirmation hearing, which covered a variety of topics. Although Pritzker's family <b>business</b> <b>dealings</b> had been a target of Republican criticism when Obama announced her nomination, only three questions at the hearing related to her family.

5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's <b>business</b> <b>dealings</b> from 1981. Confident in strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E

5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its <b>business</b> <b>dealings.</b> However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
5|$|In the 1997 reunion mini-series, Abby sells {{her house}} and prepares to leave the {{cul-de-sac}} and move to Malibu. However, the IRS freezes her assets for non-payment of back taxes, and she temporarily moves in with Karen and Mack, and gets a job from Gary at the construction company he runs with Karen. However, Abby's motives are to obtain a legal document from their company {{in order to help}} Greg Sumner, who is being sued. Should she obtain the document, Greg will pay her the $1 million she needs. Greg then informs her he no longer needs the document. Abby tries to infiltrate his other <b>business</b> <b>dealings</b> to her advantage. Instead of paying her off, Greg offers her a job overseeing one of his business operations in Thailand, which will make her rich again. Before departing, Abby learns that Brian's girlfriend (Kate Whittaker) is expecting their first child, thus making her a grandmother.|$|E

Barbara has ties to the Hired Truck Program scandal and the blue bag recycling controversy. Other investors include relatives of Daley's political adviser Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among the investors was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority’s director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F.

5|$|Another wealthy family, the Eccles, {{commissioned}} Arrington {{to write}} a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan {{part of the family}} originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent <b>business</b> <b>dealings.</b> To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.|$|E
