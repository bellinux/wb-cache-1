5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his <b>back</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations {{on the basis of}} accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E
5|$|The third column, {{commanded}} by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, included 11battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, {{commanded by}} the dependable Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps and approached {{on the far}} Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn {{it so that the}} French army's <b>back</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they would approach the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups, and approached Kandern from several sides, up the steep slopes, by coordinating contact between his column and Latour's, using Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's regiment as the link between them.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} May, the {{government}} replaced Kuhn with Lanther, who immediately announced a prohibition on openly bearing arms. At the same time, he also announced {{that the value of}} the remaining feudal titles would be bought out, and that this process was to be completed by January 1803. While such a buy-out would in practice abolish those titles and the associated taxes, it remained unclear whether the buying <b>back</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be done by the canton, or the peasants. Because of the lack of clarity, the countryside remained agitated, and over the following weeks, {{the government}} enjoined Lanther to clamp down firmly on the population.|$|E
500|$|Beadle {{later wrote}} to his fellow High Court judge Benjamin Goldin {{that he thought he}} had [...] "saved the situation" [...] by going to London, [...] having persuaded Wilson to give some ground on the terms for the Royal Commission, but his trip alarmed the pro-UDI camp in the Rhodesian Cabinet, who feared that Beadle might be {{carrying}} a message to the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs telling him to [...] parliament. Smith and his Cabinet declared independence on 11 November 1965, while Beadle was at Lusaka Airport on his way home. Smith later rejected the suggestion that Beadle could have had anything significant to tell them on his return, saying that [...] "the only thing that Beadle could have done when he got <b>back</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have talked us out of insisting on our questions".|$|E

Dalewood {{is the middle}} school he attended before moving to Atlanta and the school is not that {{far away from the}} road [...] "Usher Raymond Parkway" [...] that was presented to Usher in 2001. Usher spoke to students at the Center for the Creative arts explaining the importance of education. His effort of giving <b>back</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> honor the legacy of his grandmother who passed early in the year. Who he called Nanny expressed to singer at a young age [...] "whatever you want to do, I promise you can do it. We're going to look back one day, your teachers and I, and be very proud of you". At CCC, a donation of an undisclosed amount was made by the singer that would pay for new surfaces for the floors of two dance studios, a new digital lighting board and LED lights for the performing arts school's auditorium. Usher's second stop was Orange Grove Center, a nonprofit that serves adults and children with intellectual disabilities. There, he took part in a groundbreaking for planned improvements to the facility's track, said development director Heidi Hoffecker. The track will be named the Nancy Lackey Memorial Track to honor his grandmother.|$|E

2500|$|Greig was now {{experimenting with}} finger-spin to {{complement}} his medium pace. He {{set off to}} the West Indies with the England team in early 1974 and ran straight into a major controversy. On {{the second day of}} the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, the West Indies had cruised to a first innings lead of 143, thanks mainly to 142 not out from Alvin Kallicharran. With four wickets still in hand, the home team was in a dominant position when the last ball of the day was bowled to Bernard Julien, who blocked it past Greig (fielding in close on the off side) and then headed off to the pavilion with Kallicharran. However, Greig fielded the ball, whirled around, threw down the stumps, and appealed for a run out decision against Kallicharran. Umpire Douglas Sang Hue gave the batsman out, and a near-riot broke out in the crowd. The spectators stormed the ground and laid siege to the pavilion, calling for the decision to be revoked. Technically, the decision was correct as Sang Hue had not called time on the day's play, but Greig's actions were considered unsporting, and together with the crowd's reaction, the England captain revoked the appeal. Kallicharran was reinstated the following day, when he took his score to 158. The incident was controversial - some believing it a black stain on his character, others prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. [...] For his part, Greig claimed that his actions were not premeditated, that his <b>back</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> the play and he was unaware that proceedings were over. If his actions had been premeditated, they would have been rather reckless given the risk of stirring up the notoriously volatile Trinidadian crowd. England convincingly lost the Test and Greig failed with bat and ball.|$|E
