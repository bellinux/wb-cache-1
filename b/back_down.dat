Dissatisfied with their findings, the soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern Columbia County. They captured a number of residents of Sugarloaf Township on August 31, but these were soon released.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't <b>back</b> <b>down,</b> and I admire that.|$|E

5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go <b>back</b> <b>down</b> and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E

Gekko, realizing that his stock is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns {{on the evening news}} that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.|$|E

5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} interview, Earp claimed that George Hoyt had {{intended}} to kill him, although newspaper accounts from that time report differently. He also said he and Bat Masterson had confronted Clay Allison when {{he was sent to}} Dodge City to finish George Hoyt's job, and that they had forced him to <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> Two other accounts contradicted Earp, crediting cattleman Dick McNulty and Long Branch Saloon owner Chalk Beeson with convincing Allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns. Cowboy Charlie Siringo witnessed the incident and left a written account.|$|E

5|$|Lownds infuriated the Special Forces {{personnel}} {{even further}} when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian {{refugees from the}} area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB. Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position {{a short distance from}} the perimeter and from there some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked <b>back</b> <b>down</b> Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E
5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his {{printing}} presses to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling were printed {{for the first and}} second edition). This amount proved to be enough for Millar to sell, although he had to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> from a second printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition to ensure that the originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E
5|$|Notts County's fate {{went in the}} {{opposite}} direction. They were relegated in bottom place the season after the 1996 play-off final defeat, only to win the 1997–98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion.

The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the league structure.|$|E

Queen Mary 2 followed {{the route of}} the original ship Britannia, calling first at Halifax, Nova Scotia. After a day there, she headed first upriver into the harbor, using her bow thrusters and swivel-pod motors to negotiate the tight turnaround to come <b>back</b> <b>down</b> close to the cityfront.

5|$|On 22 November, Haislip gave Leclerc {{permission}} to advance on Strasbourg. Leclerc surprised the Germans by advancing over country roads and tracks to bypass their defences. Strasbourg was reached on 25 November, and that afternoon the Tricolour {{flew over the}} Strasbourg Cathedral. The German offensive in the Ardennes in December and in Alsace in January led Eisenhower to consider abandoning Strasbourg, but strong opposition to the idea from the French caused him to <b>back</b> <b>down.</b> As a result, the 2e DB was transferred to de Lattre's command {{to assist in the}} reduction of the Colmar Pocket.|$|E

Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company <b>back</b> <b>down</b> the hill.|$|E
