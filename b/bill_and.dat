40|$|Effective <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> {{collection}} {{systems are}} {{a critical component}} for ensuring the viability of a service provider. Improving <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection activities has an immediate impact on {{the revenue streams of}} a service provider that can, in turn, help the service provider in improving services. However, while effective <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection practices depend on many internal factors (including customer databases, the extent of metered and unmetered service provision, tariff <b>and</b> <b>billing</b> structures, delivery of <b>bills,</b> <b>and</b> facilities for customer payments), the institutional arrangements under which service providers operate and provide services determine whether such practices will remain sustainable in the long term. Efficient <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection practices can set incentives for the provider to effectively charge <b>and</b> collect water <b>bills</b> while also fulfilling a commercial orientation to services. This note draws on national and international cases to explore what it takes to implement an effective <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection system that encourages commercial and operational efficiencies for aiding the expansion and delivery of improved, reliable, and sustainable services. The note starts with an explanation of how poor <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection hurt the service provider, followed by the key principles of an effective <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection strategy, illustrated through national <b>and</b> international <b>billing</b> <b>and</b> collection practices.
