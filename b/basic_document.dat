50|$|The {{book ends}} ambiguously. One {{possibility}} is that though Kinnal himself was executed or imprisoned for life, what he started developed into a widespread movement or cult, of which the book itself is in effect the Scriptures or <b>basic</b> <b>document,</b> and which eventually succeeded in overthrowing the established order. The other {{possibility is that}} all this {{was nothing more than}} a hallucination which Kinnal experienced under the influence of his drug, and that what he started ended with him. Both possibilities are left open—which evidently was Silverberg's deliberate intention.|$|E
50|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>document</b> {{needed to}} {{establish}} a person's identity and citizenship {{in order to obtain}} a passport is a birth certificate.
