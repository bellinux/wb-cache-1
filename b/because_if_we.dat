25|$|This allows all the {{language}} and theory of vector spaces (or more generally, modules) {{to be brought to}} bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side is called their span, and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a basis of linearly independent vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its dimension) cannot be larger than m or n, but it can be smaller. This is important <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have m independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side, and otherwise not guaranteed.|$|E

Robin Raftis, the white {{editor of the}} Cedar Key Beacon, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore's story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, [...] "Things happened {{out there in the}} woods. There's no doubt about that. How bad? We don't know... So I said, 'Okay guys, I'm opening the closet with the skeletons, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't learn from mistakes, we're doomed to repeat them'."

500|$|Svensson {{reported}} that the original game assets given to them from Capcom Japan were incomplete, and even after requesting old hard drives and computers to recover more assets, Ready at Dawn was still required to recreate some from scratch. Furthermore, the game had to be recoded to change optimizations that were made for the PlayStation 2 version; Svensson stated that [...] "part of the reason we didn't show it until we started showing it was <b>because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> showed it {{in a form that}} was anything less than near-perfect, people were going to freak out". Ready at Dawn's creative director Ru Weerasuriya later reflected that porting Ōkami to the Wii was a challenging task—"we started with no assets and literally reverse-engineered the whole thing back onto the Wii"—they did out of love for the game, but the level of effort would preclude them from attempting such a port again.|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> played all together nothing would get done. We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but we were also really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Doctor Who fandom's initial {{response}} to the serial was not so positive; John Peel, writing in the fanzine TARDIS in 1979, decried it as [...] "total farce... I simply couldn't believe this was Doctor Who... the continual buffoonery is getting on my nerves". A similar view was held by Gary Russell who, reviewing the VHS release in 1991, said, [...] "City of Death, like most Douglas Adams material, is overrated and misses the mark for me, falling between the stools of good pastiche and bad parody and making fairly unsatisfactory viewing". This line was countered by Vanessa Bishop who called it [...] "the Doctor Who story it's alright to laugh at... we must now accept that City of Death is funny— <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> didn't the Crackerjack-style sleuths, scientists and all... would leave it knocking about {{near the bottom of}} all the Doctor Who story ranking polls" [...] and, responding to the criticisms about the levels of comedy, that [...] "it's precisely these things that make it seem so special". Reviewing the serial in 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times stated he disliked the smug tone to the humour and Ward's [...] "snooty" [...] portrayal of Romana. Despite this, he noted that the serial had good production values and direction, as well as a few jokes that he enjoyed.|$|E

500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 4–5 February, a few protesters {{continued}} to camp out in Tahrir Square. Early in the morning shots were fired as protesters said pro-Mubarak activists tried to assault the square. Troops then fired into the air to disperse them. Demonstrators later formed a human chain to prevent tanks from passing through the barricades into the square; a witness said scuffles broke out when an army general asked demonstrators to take down their makeshift barricades of corrugated steel and debris. As the army tightened access to Tahrir Square, {{the head of the}} army met protesters and asked them to return home. Protesters responded that [...] "he (Mubarak) will go" [...] and they would not. The army was also more organized and present than on any other day of the protest. A heavy military presence continued in central Cairo. An Interior Ministry spokesman said that [...] "the army remains neutral and is not taking sides <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> protect one side we will be perceived as biased....our role is to prevent clashes and chaos as we separate the opposing groups." [...] Scuffles were reported during the day in Tahrir Square and one protester was said to have died. A group of foreigners including an English protester on the 5th and a Swede on the 6th joined the protesters in Tahrir Square, handing out flowers in a sign of solidarity and holding up a banner in English. Five hundred protesters arrived in Tahrir Square from Suez. There were reports of over 10,000 people continuing to stay in Alexandria through the night.|$|E

It seems that the legal framework prefers to serve foundational commitments such as the harmonious co-existence of different ethnic and religious communities, because [...] "community or racial harmony form the bedrock upon which peace and progress in Singapore are founded". In his 2009 National Day Rally speech Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong characterized racial and religious divides as [...] "the most visceral and dangerous fault line" [...] in Singapore society, and earlier he had said that [...] "we must respect one another's religions, we must not deliberately insult or desecrate what others hold sacred <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> want to live peacefully together, then we must live and let live, there must be tolerance, there must be mutual respect".|$|E
2500|$|The {{intention}} {{behind the}} amendments {{has long been}} called into question. The Akritas plan, written in {{the height of the}} constitutional dispute by the Greek Cypriot interior minister Policarpos Yorgadjis, called for the removal of undesirable elements of the constitution so as to allow power-sharing to work. The plan envisaged a swift retaliatory attack on Turkish Cypriot strongholds should Turkish Cypriots resort to violence to resist the measures, stating “In the event of a planned or staged Turkish attack, it is imperative to overcome it by force in the shortest possible time, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> succeed in gaining command of the situation (in one or two days), no outside, intervention would be either justified or possible.” Whether Makarios's proposals were part of the Akritas plan is unclear, however it remains that sentiment towards enosis had not completely disappeared with independence. Makarios described independence as [...] "a step on the road to enosis". Preparations for conflict were not entirely absent from Turkish Cypriots either, with right wing elements still believing taksim (partition) the best safeguard against enosis.|$|E

You must do this, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> you don't, <b>we</b> will do even more damage to you and your economy. So give us your deposits, give us your money, pay more taxes, suffer fewer social programs, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> you don't, <b>we</b> will impose even worse on you." [...] It's the basic idea of austerity across the board and in our country, too.
