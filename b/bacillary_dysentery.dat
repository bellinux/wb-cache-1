5|$|In General Sir Thomas Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Australian Army in April 1942, Fairley {{was appointed}} director {{of medicine at}} Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne. Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign. An epidemic of <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery</b> was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea. On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The disease {{was known to}} be caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the disease was easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1585, {{war broke}} out between England and Spain. The Anglo-Spanish War {{was not limited to}} Europe—extending to Spanish and English territories in the Americas. In November 1595, Sir Francis Drake, the vice-admiral in command of the Royal Navy fleet that tackled the Spanish Armada, and Sir John Hawkins {{attempted}} an unsuccessful invasion of San Juan. Both Hawkins and Drake died of illness {{in the course of the}} campaign. On June 15, 1598, the English fleet, led by George Clifford, landed in Santurce and held the island for several months. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery</b> among his troops. In 1599, 400 additional soldiers and 46 cannons were sent to the island along with a new governor, Alonso de Mercado, to rebuild the city.|$|E
50|$|The {{housefly}} is a {{very common}} and cosmopolitan species which transmits diseases to man. The organisms of both amoebic and <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysenteries</b> are picked up by flies from the faeces of infected people and transferred to clean food either on the fly's hairs or by the fly vomiting during feeding. Typhoid germs may be deposited on food with the fly's faeces. The house fly cause the spread of yaws germs by carrying them from a yaws ulcer to an ordinary sore. Houseflies also transmit poliomyelitis by carrying the virus from infected faeces to food or drink. Cholera and hepatitis are sometimes fly-borne. Other diseases carried by houseflies are Salmonella, tuberculosis, anthrax, and some forms of ophthalmia. They carry over 100 pathogens and transmit some parasitic worms. The flies in poorer and lower-hygiene areas usually carry more pathogens. Some strains have become immune to most common insecticides.|$|R
50|$|The {{troops were}} charged with making an {{extremely}} difficult trek inland over the Kapa Kapa Trail toward Jaure, where they were to flank the Japanese on the Kokoda Trail. The total distance over {{the mountains to the}} Japanese positions was over 130 mi, and most of the trail was barely a goat path. Hundreds of men suffered from malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, amoebic <b>dysentery,</b> <b>bacillary,</b> along with jungle rot, dobie itch, trench foot, athlete's foot and ringworm. Their rate of advance compared to the Australian soldiers was considerably slower.|$|R
2500|$|Their field craft {{showed the}} lack of training, and malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, amoebic <b>dysentery,</b> <b>bacillary,</b> along with jungle rot, dobie itch, trench foot, athlete's foot and {{ringworm}} quickly struck hundreds of men. Their rate of advance compared to the Australian soldiers was considerably slower. It rained hard every afternoon at about three o'clock, and beginning on 15 October they were drenched by five days of steady rain. [...] Constant tropical downpours, searing heat, and dripping humidity left the soldiers constantly wet. At night in the higher altitudes, temperatures dropped rapidly, leaving the men chilled.|$|R
25|$|Intracellular {{bacteria}} need {{to enter}} host cells (cells of the infected organism) {{in order to}} replicate and propagate infection. Many species of Shigella (causes <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery),</b> Salmonella (typhoid fever), Mycobacterium (leprosy and tuberculosis) and Listeria (listeriosis), to name but a few, are intracellular.|$|E
2500|$|Canavan's {{research}} {{focused on}} the effects of nervous system damage on the mind and body. She was also very interested in bacteriology; the first of the 79 articles she published was on <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery</b> and the first article she co-authored with Southard concerned bacterial invasions of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. She studied the pathology of diseases affecting the optic nerve, spleen, brain, and spinal cord, and she examined cases of sudden death, multiple sclerosis, and microscopic hemorrhage. By prior agreement, she performed the autopsy on Frank Bunker Gilbreth, identifying the arteriosclerosis that had caused his death. And in 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, a report on her examination of the brains of her mentor and his parents. She also trained neuropathologist Louise Eisenhardt, who became a renowned expert in diagnosing brain tumors. In 1959 she was credited with training 70% of the neurosurgeons then certified. She had a particular interest in the neuropathology of mental illness. With Southard and others, she contributed to a monograph series called Waverley [...] Researches in the Pathology of the Feeble-Minded.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduation}} from Sewickley High School, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baldock studied {{for two years}} at Ohio University in Athens, (1955–57), receiving military training in the Army ROTC program, which proved significant when Baldock became a combatant in the 26th of July Movement insurgency against Fulgencio Batista led by Fidel Castro in Cuba. He {{became aware of the}} Cuban Revolution seeing movie newsreels in Akron, where he was working at a B.F. Goodrich rubber plant in the fall of 1957. He went on to work at the New York Herald Tribune as a copyboy; there he had privileged access to ticker-tape coverage of the Cuban insurrectionary movement as well as to maps and press passes. With a college friend who knew Spanish {{he made his way to}} Havana in the spring of 1958. From Havana the two made their way to the Sierra Maestra, where they became part of Fidel Castro’s group of rebel combatants, which included (besides Castro) Celia Sánchez, Haydée Santamaría, and Camilo Cienfuegos. Baldock remained in this group for five months until becoming ill with <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery.</b> [...] Baldock and his friend were then moved covertly out of the country through an underground network consisting primarily of small Catholic churches. In Miami, hospitalized, he met with a United Press representative to whom he gave the two notebooks of his observations and interviews, consenting for them to be used as needed by UP. These notebooks were subsequently lost.|$|E
40|$|The {{pathology}} of the alimentary {{tracts of}} nine patients dying of Salmonella typhimurium infection is reviewed. Two patients had previous gastric operations, supporting previous reports that such patients {{are more susceptible}} to food poisoning. Four had no parietal (oxyntic) cells in the gastric mucosa, suggesting hypo- or anacidity. Only one had acute gastritis. None had acute enteritis, but in half of the patients, subtle histological changes suggested an 'enteropathy'. Acute diffuse colitis with abundant crypt abscesses, without stromal abscesses in the lamina propria, was the most constant finding and reparative features started very early, and occurred in later deaths. Under ideal circumstances this crypt abscess is readily distinguished from that of idiopathic ulcerative colitis, but can be confused with the crypt abscess of acute <b>bacillary</b> (sonne) <b>dysentery.</b> While the florid colonic changes may have settled in the late deaths, active inflammation is commonly present in the appendix mucosa on histology. The pathology of the alimentary tract in S typhimurium infection differs from that of S typhi and S paratyphi infections. There is little evidence of gastroenteritis, although subtle changes occur in the stomach and small intestine. The features are those of acute diffuse colitis with histological appendicitis, distinguishable from idiopathic ulcerative colitis...|$|R
5000|$|After {{becoming}} {{disillusioned with}} the film industry, Caldecott traveled to India and West Asia in 1990 for a year-long trip on a budget of only a [...] "few dollars a day". [...] During this year he studied Indian classical music in Chennai and Varanasi, India; and buddhist meditation in Bodhgaya, India; and Nilambe, Sri Lanka. During his travel and study he became very ill, at one point suffering from both <b>bacillary</b> and amoebic <b>dysentery.</b> After leaving India he traveled in a weakened state to the Northern Area of Pakistan, including Gilgit, the Hunza valley and Pasu. It was in these areas, renowned for their long-lived inhabitants, healthy food and glacial water that he [...] "partially recovered" [...] from his illness. He {{then went on to}} travel throughout Iran, spending several weeks as the guest of a Sufi master in Shiraz.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bacillary</b> <b>dysentery</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with diarrhea caused by other bacterial infections. One characteristic of <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery</b> is blood in stool, which is the result of invasion of the mucosa by the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Salmonellosis {{caused by}} Salmonella enterica (serovar Typhimurium) {{has also been}} {{described}} as a cause of <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery,</b> though this definition is less common.

50|$|The {{bacterial}} genus Shigella is {{the cause}} of <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery,</b> a potentially severe infection that claim the lives of over a million people annually. The genus (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, S. sonnei) have evolved from the common intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli, rendering that species parephyletic. E. coli itself can also cause serious dysentery, but the difference in the genetic makeup between the E. coli and Shigella causes different medical conditions and symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Although traveler's {{diarrhea}} usually resolves {{within three}} to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases, the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10%, the illness duration exceeds one week. [...] For those prone to serious infections, such as <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery,</b> amoebic dysentery, and cholera, TD can occasionally be life-threatening. [...] Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, immunosuppressed persons, persons with inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes, and those taking H2 blockers or antacids.|$|E

50|$|RnaG {{is a small}} {{regulatory}} non-coding RNA encoded by the virulence plasmid of Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative {{pathogenic bacterium}} that causes human <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery.</b> It is a first regulatory RNA characterised in S. flexneri. The RNA is 450 nucleotides long (which makes {{it one of the}} largest regulatory sRNAs) and it contains a region with specific secondary structure that interacts with icsA (virG) mRNA and forms a transcription terminator. Acting as antisense, RnaG is transcribed from the complementary strand of its target, icsA mRNA.The activity of the incA protein is crucial for spreading of the bacterial pathogen in the host cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{dysentery}} is <b>bacillary</b> <b>dysentery,</b> which is typically a mild illness, causing symptoms normally consisting of mild stomach pains and frequent passage of stool or diarrhea. Symptoms normally present themselves after one to three days, and are usually no longer present after a week. The frequency of urges to defecate, the large volume of liquid feces passed, and the presence of mucus, pus, and blood depends on the pathogen causing the disease. Temporary lactose intolerance can occur, as well. In some caustic occasions severe abdominal pain, fever, shock, and delirium can all be symptoms.|$|E

50|$|The term Type III {{secretion}} {{system was}} coined in 1993. This secretion system is distinguished {{from at least}} five other secretion systems found in Gram-negative bacteria. Many animal and plant associated bacteria possess similar T3SSs.
