5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance.

5|$|After {{the attack}} on Yokosuka, the Nagatos crew removed all {{casualties}} from the ship and conducted limited repairs. Some of the ship's ballast tanks were also flooded {{to give the impression}} that she had been sunk. During the early hours of 2August Nagato was ordered to put to sea to intercept an Allied force. However, this sortie was canceled before she had completed preparations to leave port as the report of Allied ships was determined to <b>be</b> <b>false.</b> On 30August the ship was surrendered to the U.S.Navy. She was one of the target ships for the two atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll on 1 and 28July 1946 during Operation Crossroads, and sank there during the night of 29–30July.|$|E
5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to <b>be</b> <b>false</b> or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E

Although these claims were later proven to <b>be</b> <b>false,</b> speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E
5|$|Stricken {{from the}} naval {{register}} on 2 August 1947, the ship remained as a training vessel until August 1951, {{when she was}} sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. After preparing from 5 to 18 September, São Paulo was given an eight-man caretaker crew and taken under tow by two tugs, Dexterous and Bustler, in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to Greenock and the breakers. When north of the Azores in early November, the two lines snapped during a strong storm. American B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and British planes were launched to scour the Atlantic for the missing ship. The ship was reported as found on the 15th, but this proved to <b>be</b> <b>false.</b> The search was ended on 10 December without finding São Paulo or her crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to <b>be</b> <b>false.</b>|$|E
40|$|Physicalism (P) entails minimal physicalism (MP), MP entails minimal supervenience (MS), and MS is {{the thesis}} that there is {{covariance}} between the supervenient and the subvenient stuff.

In this essay, I begin by showing what the minimal physicalist thesis is: MP is, essentially, MS. Next, I look at qualia and the trouble they pose to MS and hence MP: if {{it is possible that}} qualia can be inverted without a behavioral change, then it follows that MS, MP, and P <b>are</b> <b>false.</b> In other words, the possibility of inverted qualia show that P <b>is</b> <b>false.</b> Seeing that this possibility does not establish a very robust dualism, I turn to the issue of inverted selves: if inverted selves are possible, then full-blown substance dualism follows. I argue that inverted selves are possible...|$|R

All allegations were proved to <b>be</b> <b>false</b> and the government and police were cleared of wrongdoing by a Special Investigation Team. The initial report on the case was filed by the Gujarat police, accusing 46 people, all of whom the Special Court deemed unreliable. In 2008, the Supreme Court of India formed a Special Investigation Team to investigate the case. In 2009, the team submitted its report, which accused 70 people of wrongdoing, 61 of whom were charged.

During their construction, the two dreadnoughts {{were subject to}} numerous rumors involving Argentina selling the two battleships to a country engaged in the First World War, but these proved to <b>be</b> <b>false.</b> After Moreno was completed in March 1915, a series of engine problems occurred during the sea trials which delayed its delivery to Argentina to May 1915. The next decade saw the ship based in Puerto Belgrano {{as part of the}} Argentine Navy's First Division before sailing to the United States for an extensive refit in 1924 and 1925. During the 1930s the ship was occupied with diplomatic cruises to Brazil, Uruguay, and Europe until the Second World War broke out. During this time, Moreno was employed little as Argentina was neutral. Decommissioned in 1949, Moreno was scrapped in Japan beginning in 1957.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} {{obsolescent}} cruiser. Rumors that year of a potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French cruiser , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria. Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to <b>be</b> <b>false.</b> A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The cruiser sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship. Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E
