40|$|<b>Black</b> band <b>disease</b> of corals {{consists}} of a microbial community dominated by the cyanobacteriurn Phormidium corallyticum. The disease primarily affects reef-framework coral species, Active <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> continually opens up new substrate in reef environments by destroying coral tissue as the disease line advances {{across the surface of}} infected colonies. A field study was carried out to determine the abundance and distribution of <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> on the reef building corals in the Florida Keys. During July of 1992 and 1993, up to 0. 72 % of coral colonies were infected with <b>black</b> band <b>disease.</b> Analysis of the distribution showed that the disease was clumped. Seasonal patters varied, with some coral colonies infected year round, others exhibiting reinfection from summer 1992 to summer 1993, and some colonies infected for one year only. Statistical analysis of <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> incidence in relation to various environmental parameters revealed that <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> was associated with relatively shallow water depths, higher temperatures, elevated nitrite levels, and decreased ortho-phosphate levels. Additional field studies determined recovery of scleractinian coral colonies damaged or killed through the activities of <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> over a five-year period. These studies determined if the newly exposed substrate was recolonized through scleractinian recruitment, if there was overgrowth of the damaged areas by the formerly diseased colony, or if coral tissue destruction continued after the cessation of <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> activity. Tissue loss continued on all coral colonies with only one colony exhibiting new tissue growth. The majority of recolonization was by non-reef-framework corals and octocorallians, limited recruitment by framework species was observed. Physiological studies of P. corallyticum were carried out to investigate the photosynthetic capacity of this cyanobacterium, and to determine if this species has the ability to fix dinitrogen. The results of this research demonstrated that P. corallyticum reaches maximum photosynthetic rates at very low light intensities (27. 9 μE/m/sec), and that P. corallyticum is able to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis in the presence of sulfide, an ability that is uncommon in prokaryotic organisms. ...|$|R

40|$|The fungus causing {{anthracnose}} {{disease in}} mango, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, (C g.), infects immature fruit {{early in the}} season, then enters a long latent phase. After harvest, when fruit start to ripen, the latency breaks and the fungus ramifies through the peel and pulp tissues causing <b>black</b> <b>disease</b> lesions. The breaking of pathogen latency in ripening mango fruit has been correlated with decreasing concentrations of the endogenous antifungal resorcinol compounds (Droby et al., 1986). The level of these antifungal resorcinols vary among mango cultivars (Droby et a 1, 1986). Controlling diseases by managing natural resistance of fruit to fungal attack could minimize the use of pesticides, which have become of major public concern on health and environmental grounds. The plant resistance activator benzo(l, 2, 3) thiadiazole- 7 -carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (trade name Bion®) has been widely reported as an effective inducer of systemic resistance.

40|$|The {{present study}} reports coral mortality, driven {{primarily}} by coral diseases, around Shingle Island, Gulf of Mannar (GOM), Indian Ocean. In total, 2910 colonies were permanently monitored {{to assess the}} incidence of coral diseases and consequent mortality for 2 yr. Four types of lesions consistent with white band disease (WBD), <b>black</b> <b>disease</b> (BD), white plaque disease (WPD), and pink spot disease (PSD) were recorded from 4 coral genera: Montipora, Pocillopora, Acropora, and Porites. Porites were affected by 2 disease types, while the other 3 genera were affected by only 1 disease type. Overall disease prevalence increased from 8 % (n = 233 colonies) to 41. 9 % (n = 1219) over the 2 yr study period. BD caused an unprecedented 100 % mortality in Pocillopora, followed by 20. 4 and 13. 1 % mortality from WBD in Montipora and Acropora, respectively. Mean disease progression rates of 0. 8 +/- 1. 0 and 0. 6 +/- 0. 5 cm mo(- 1) over live coral colonies were observed for BD and WBD. Significant correlations between temperature and disease progression were observed for BD (r = 0. 86, R- 2 = 0. 75, p < 0. 001) and WBD (R- 2 = 0. 76, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{examines}} {{the life and}} veterinary contribution of Dr Harold E. Albiston. Through his professional life can be traced the history of veterinary science in Victoria, from the horse doctor days of pre World War I to the re-establishment of the University of Melbourne Veterinary School in September 1962. Special {{attention is paid to}} the late 1920 s which saw veterinary teaching cease at the end of 1927 and the University of Melbourne Veterinary School officially close in June 1928. Albiston, who was {{on the staff of the}} Veterinary School, witnessed this critical time in Victorian veterinary history. During the world-wide veterinary recession from 1920 to 1935, due to the declining influence of the horse, Albiston was one of the first veterinarians to appreciate that a new direction was necessary for the profession. While he was assistant-director, he upgraded the facilities of the Veterinary School, and encouraged research and diagnostic work on farm animals. As the day of the horse passed Albiston had built up the Veterinary School or the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) as it became known in 1931, into an organisation of status serving the emerging livestock industries. The VRI was a unique establishment since it functioned as a normal university department, under the aegis of the University of Melbourne, yet performed diagnostic and research work for the Department of Agriculture. The VRI became an enlightened veterinary centre - a meeting place where veterinarians would visit, browse in the library and discuss problems with Harold Albiston or the VRI senior staff. It also became the centre of post graduate veterinary education in Victoria since all conferences, meetings and seminars were held there and for twenty-three years it was the home of the Australian Veterinary Journal (AVJ). The thesis also examines Albiston's research and diagnostic achievements before he was engulfed by administrative responsibilities. In 1927 he helped to solve <b>black</b> <b>disease,</b> or infectious necrotic hepatitis, which was costing the sheep industry millions of pounds. He also played a major role in diagnosing and eradicating the first Newcastle disease outbreak in Australia in 1930. In 1933 he was credited with giving the first post-graduate veterinary course in Australia when he gave a series of poultry lectures at the VRI. So successful was this venture that he gave a similar course on cattle diseases the following year. Harold Albiston has been the longest serving member of the faculty of veterinary science, the longest serving editor of the AVJ and the longest serving member of both the Veterinary and Zoological Boards of Victoria. His contribution came from his humanity and a dogged determination, at board, faculty or committee level to make the most effective use of his talents - his warmth, his lack of pomposity, his consultative ability and his capacity for hard work. In 1959 Harold Albiston was awarded the Gilruth Prize for meritorious service to veterinary science. In 1963 he was awarded the honour of Commander of the British Empire.

40|$|Recently, {{reports of}} coral disease have {{increased}} significantly {{across the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s tropical oceans. Despite increasing efforts to understand the changing incidence of coral disease, very few primary pathogens have been identified, and most studies remain dependent on the external appearance of corals for diagnosis. Given this situation, our current understanding of coral disease and the progression and underlying causes thereof is very limited. In the present study, we use structural and microbial studies to differentiate different forms of black band disease: atypical <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> and typical <b>black</b> band <b>disease.</b> Atypical <b>black</b> band diseased corals were infected with the <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> microbial consortium yet did not show any of the typical external signs of <b>black</b> band <b>disease</b> based on macroscopic observations. In previous studies, these examples, here referred to as atypical <b>black</b> band <b>disease,</b> would have not been correctly diagnosed. We also differentiate white syndrome from white diseases {{on the basis of}} tissue structure and the presence/absence of microbial associates. White diseases are those with dense bacterial communities associated with lesions of symbiont loss and/or extensive necrosis of tissues, while white syndromes are characteristically bacterium free, with evidence for extensive programmed cell death/apoptosis associated with the lesion and the adjacent tissues. The pathology of coral disease as a whole requires further investigation. This study emphasizes the importance of going beyond the external macroscopic signs of coral disease for accurate disease diagnosis...|$|R
