Rammaya and Rajgopal on seed {{germination}} and early seedling growth of four test plant species including mustard, <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet,</b> corn and spinach was evaluated under laboratory conditions. Aqueous extract of L. procumbens at different concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100 % stock solution) inhibited germination of three test {{species in the}} order: spinach > mustard > corn; germination of millet was not significantly influenced. Root and shoot growth of all four species was substantially reduced by Launaea extract. The growth was reduced in the order: spinach > mustard > corn > millet. When different modes of extract application were tested, {{it was found that}} only the soil application of the aqueous extract had a significant retarding effect on wheat growth while shoot spray or root dip treatment had no such effect. Decaying shoot of L. procumbens in sandy-loam at 5, 10 and 20 g/ 400 g soil caused substantial inhibition of germination and seedling growth of <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet</b> (Pennisetum americanum) at high dosages.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the design and}} implementation of {{a study of the}} quality of <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet</b> purchased stored and distributed by a government cereal marketing board and of an assessment of the losses of grain that occurred in the marketing system. The selection of appropriate techniques and methods for sampling bagged millet in central storage and for the analysis of samples is described. Problems encountered in the assessment of weight losses in millet are discussed and the choice of particular methods explained. Spillage from damaged sacks was found to be an important problem and high levels of fine impurities were found to be the most serious form of low quality. It is concluded that losses of grain to biological causes during the study were very low and it is argued that the measurement of weight losses in itself is of limited value. 1 t is suggested that a thorough understanding of the attitudes to loss of those responsible for the grain is essential to the successful introduction of loss reduction measures...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in two villages of Mughunga and Pohama in Singida Rural District, central Tanzania, to assess the {{economic}} value of agricultural land for community livelihoods within the context of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Market price valuation method was used to assess the economic value of agricultural land. Findings showed that a good number of people in both villages depend on agriculture (96. 4 %) and livestock keeping (90. 1 %) for their livelihoods. The economic value of agriculture land was revealed to be 35, 871, 750 and 49, 259, 382 Tsh per acre for Mughunga and Pohama villages respectively, with high contribution from sunflower, followed by sorghum and maize crops. The study results revealed lower economic value, mainly of food crops such as maize and <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet.</b> This implicates changes in the agricultural land as these crops were valued high in the past. The major reasons for such changes include decline in agricultural production and increased pressure for land resources. For sustainability of agricultural land in the study area, efforts need to be scaled up towards conservation of agricultural land by all parties, that is, communities, government and private entities.

40|$|A {{research}} paper on rural food consumption patterns in Zimbabwe, {{presented at the}} Fourth Annual Conference on Food Security In Southern Africa, 31 October- 3 November, 1988. Government programmes concerned with family food security require an understanding of o who is most vulnerable to inadequate food intake, o strategies used by households to secure access to food, o how do the poor change food consumption patterns when circumstances change, o {{to what extent is}} on-farm food production shortfall the problem, o the role of other farm and nonfarm activities in household food security, and o programme interventions that will raise food intake. To address these issues requires data on food consumption patterns, household level food availability, and nutritional status of individuals within the household. Since the primary variable to improve household nutritional status is access to food resources, this paper looks primarily at data relating to household food availability and consumption. Basic food grains supply the bulk of calories of most rural households, so the analysis focuses on food grains. For Zimbabwe these are, in order of importance, maize, sorghum, <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet</b> (mhunga), and finger millet (rapoko). This study uses cross-sectional data to look at grain consumption behaviour among rural households in Zimbabwe. While the sample-in terms of the universe of communal areas-is inevitably narrow, the study provides an opportunity to investigate grain consumption behaviour among a broad spectrum of communal producers.

40|$|Protein energy {{malnutrition}} (PEM) is {{the most}} serious nutritional problem affecting pre-school children in developing countries. The low energy and nutrient density of the diet and the presence of anti-nutritional factors contribute to this condition, as do the low frequency of feeding and transmission of diarrhoea-causing pathogens via the food. The overall objective of this thesis was to evaluate the use of lactic acid fermentation in order to improve the nutritional quality and microbiological safety of cereal weaning foods. The study focused on Tanzanian cereal staple foods, and the nutritional factors specifically studied included dietary bulk properties, in vitro protein digestibility and in vitro estimation of iron availability. The microbiological study evaluated the survival of diarrhoea-causing pathogens in lactic acid-fermented gruels. A prospective epidemiological study was carried out to evaluate the effect of regular consumption of lactic acid-fermented gruels on the diarrhoea prevalence in pre-school children living in a rural setting of Tanzania. With a fermentation technique using a natural lactic acid starter culture and addition of flour of germinated seeds, it was possible to prepare liquid cereal gruels from maize, white sorghum, <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet</b> and finger millet with a 30 to 35 % flour concentration. The energy density of such a lactic acid-fermented gruel was about 1. 2 kcal/g, as compared with 0. 4 kcal/g in a non-fermented gruel prepared to the same consistency. This represents a threefold increase in energy density. Fermentation of high-tannin sorghum gruels only resulted in a double increase of the energy density while maintaining a liquid consistency. The in vitro protein digestibility of high-tannin cereal varieties was significantly (p Lactic acid fermentation of non-tannin cereals with added fluor of germinated sorghum grain or wheat phytase increased the iron solubility from about 4 % to 9 % and 50 %, respectively. Soaking the flour in water before fermentation had a similar effect as addition of wheat phytase. The increase in soluble iron was strongly related to enzymatic degradation of phytate (p Lactic acid-fermented gruels inhibited the proliferation of inoculated Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium as well as Gram-positive bacteria. The mean number of diarrhoea episodes in a group of pre-school children over a 9 -month period was 2. 1 per child using fermented gruels, compared with 3. 5 per child using non-fermented gruels (p< 0. 001) ...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum and millet {{were the}} {{indigenous}} staple foods {{of much of}} Africa before maize became popular, after its introduction by the Portuguese in the 17 th century. They remain the staples of thirteen African countries with a total population of some 200 million people. Research indicates the potential for substantial yield increases and improved technology could provide better processing and new uses for these hardy grain crops. As Africa strives {{to close the gap}} between population and food production, sorghum and millet will become of increasing importance. This will be especially so where weather patterns are unpredictable because maize is much less adaptable to inadequate erratic rainfall. There are two broad categories of sorghum; red or brown sorghums, which often contain bitter tasting tannins in the seed coat, and white sorghums, which do not. The tannins deter predators but must be removed in order to make grain acceptable for human consumption. Sorghum is both drought-resistant and able to tolerate waterlogging better than maize because of its deep and well-branched root system. It is also remarkably pest-resistant, but unfortunately the compounds that help protect the crop from birds and insects make the grain and the stover less palatable and less digestible for people and livestock. Search for new varieties There are also two major types of millet; finger millet and <b>bulrush</b> <b>millet.</b> They are very different in appearance. The grain of finger millet is contained in a 'hand' of digits (hence the name) and the plant seldom grows higher than 1. 3 metres. <b>Bulrush</b> <b>millet</b> can grow to 3 metres. Millets are even more drought resistant than sorghum and can give good yields on infertile, sandy soil which would be unsuitable for most cereals. But millets are very susceptible to bird damage and, as more children attend school and are not available to scare birds, this can cause considerable losses. Farmers are also inclined to switch to maize, as has happened in Kenya and Tanzania, because millets and sorghum demand a great deal more work to harvest, store and process. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) based in Hyderabad, India, has collected the seeds of over 22, 500 varieties of sorghum and 15, 500 varieties of millet. During the past decade, expeditions to India, northern Nigeria, southern Sudan, Malawi and Sierra Leone collected many sorghums and millets, including some wild ones. From this seed-bank of genetic diversity {{it should be possible to}} breed more new varieties with higher yields and even great resistance to drought. ICRISAT also has operations in Africa in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger and Zimbabwe. The two main bases in Africa are the ICRISAT Sahelian Centre (ISC) near Niamey, Niger, and the SADCC/ICRISAT sorghum and millets improvement programme at Matapos, near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Inter-African research collaboration is also assisted through the Semi-Arid Foodgrains Research and Development (SAFGRAD) of the Organization of African Unity, which is based in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso. Improved processing and new uses Sorghum and millet are very similar to maize in their nutritional value. Traditionally both grains are prepared by pounding to remove the husks but, millet and sorghum flour does not keep well and fresh flour has to be prepared regularly. New techniques for easier processing are urgently needed and there have been some promising developments in mechanical decortication. A dry abrasive technique for milling of the husk off sorghum was developed from a Canadian design and promoted by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). About 40 machines were made locally and installed in Botswana, and trials and demonstrations set up in several other SADCC countries. These decorticators proved well-suited to small-scale operations, as the cost of equipment is low. The cost of transportation of grain and products to and from the mill is minimized, employment is created in rural areas and, when milling a reasonably pure strain of white sorghum, a high yield of excellent quality product can be obtained. However, it is more difficult to process mixed crops to acceptable levels of colour and taste. An alternative technique for semi-wet milling of sorghum has been developed by the UK Natural Resources Institute (NRI). The whole sorghum grain is wetted with up to 25 % water and after 12 hours the conditioned grain is milled in a roller mill in the same way as maize or wheat. Even in highly bird resistant varieties of red sorghum the endosperm is normally white, and using this technique the white endosperm is effectively separated, leaving the bran and most of the coloured layers clean and almost intact. Semi-wet milling is not the answer for all situations, however, since it is unlikely that the process will be economically viable at a throughput of less than two tonnes per hour. Also, the meal produced has over 20 % moisture and is unsuitable for long-term storage. If techniques can be perfected to make sustainable use of much larger quantities of millet and sorghum (particularly red sorghum), which can be grown on the extensive and still under-utilized semi-arid lands of Africa, the consequences will be profound and far reaching: on food security, on rural employment and on agricultural income in many parts of the continent. Sorghum and millet were the indigenous staple foods of much of Africa before maize became popular, after its introduction by the Portuguese in the 17 th century. They remain the staples of thirteen African countries with a total population of some [...] ...|$|E
