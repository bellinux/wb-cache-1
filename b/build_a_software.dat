Motorola decided {{to open the}} centre in April after winning a number of incentives, including becoming the supplier for a government radio network, and a contract was signed in June.

50|$|There {{are many}} uses for a {{reference}} model. One use {{is to create}} standards for both the objects that inhabit the model and their relationships to one another. By creating standards, the work of engineers and developers who need to create objects that behave according to the standard is made easier. Software can be written that meets a standard, and developers can copy that software to use it again, or <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> factory that generates that code. When done well, a standard can make use of design patterns that support key qualities of software, {{such as the ability}} to extend the software in an inexpensive way.|$|E
30|$|The {{model is}} based on a graph {{structure}} representing scenarios of interest in terms of facts, processes, and technologies. Moreover, it adopts an algorithm specifically proposed to find a minimum cost composition of processes.

50|$|Pristine Sources is a {{software}} management concept coined by the developers of the short-lived Bogus Linux distribution and popularized by Marc Ewing, co-founder of Red Hat Inc, after he adopted it and RPM Package Manager as a development philosophy for Red Hat Linux. It was {{the concept that}} enabled Red Hat to build Linux distributions faster and more reliably than had been possible previously. Briefly, the problem with building an operating systems out of the myriad pieces of open source (or free software) components available from teams across the Internet {{was that there were}} many of these components and they all upgraded on different schedules at different times. Ewing's insight was to recognize that he could not take responsibility for these components. He and Erik Troan, wanted to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> package management system, RPM, that allowed the team at Red Hat to avoid changing any of the source code of the software components they needed to use to build their Red Hat Linux operating system.|$|E
50|$|Milestone Systems {{was founded}} in 1998 to <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>software</b> {{development}} company that could improve business through managing and distributing digital video data regardless of time or location. Co-founders Henrik Friborg and John Blem saw that their experience in developing IP technology for real-time data systems in the European financial sector could also {{be applied to the}} handling of video images. With that mindset the first Milestone VMS is launched in 1999. At that time, digital video technology was not in use in the security surveillance industry. The security market back then was mainly operating with proprietary analogue equipment, and the digital share of sales grew slowly at first. This gradual pace allowed Milestone to grow organically, without the need for external funding. From the beginning and throughout its maturing phases, the company has stayed independent and entirely self-funded with very healthy growth rates. To fuel the commercial development of the organization, more like-minded professionals were hired. CEO Lars Thinggaard and a sales team of account managers, top software system architects, expert support staff, marketing and technical documentation talent were included in Milestone team.|$|E

Modern software systems, such as the embedded software required for NASA's space station initiative, stretch current software engineering techniques.
