5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding that was considered controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

25|$|When Carrera {{arrived to}} Chiantla in Huehuetenango, he {{received}} two altenses emissaries {{who told him}} that their soldiers {{were not going to}} fight his forces <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lead to a native revolt, much like that of 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control. The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid, helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of Miguel Garcia Granados arrived from Guatemala City looking for him.|$|E
25|$|Under the Palo Alto Daily News model, {{papers are}} {{delivered}} to public {{places such as}} coffee shops, restaurants, stores, gyms, schools, corporate campuses, and news racks.

25|$|Another way {{to think}} of the proof is that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But that leads to a {{contradict}}ion: no element of B can map to B <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> contradict the criterion of membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E

25|$|The {{trenches}} were hot, dusty, and miserable, but {{conditions were}} worse between the lines, {{where thousands of}} wounded Federal soldiers suffered horribly without food, water, or medical assistance. Grant was reluctant {{to ask for a}} formal truce that would allow him to recover his wounded <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be an acknowledgment he had lost the battle. He and Lee traded notes across the lines from June 5 to 7 without coming to an agreement, and when Grant formally requested a two-hour cessation of hostilities, {{it was too late for}} most of the unfortunate wounded, who were now bloated corpses. Grant was widely criticized in the Northern press for this lapse of judgment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} week of February 2012, {{temperatures}} inside reactor No. 2 became unstable. On 7 February, the amount of cooling water was increased from 10.5 tons to 13.5 tons per hour. After a slight initial decrease in temperature, sensor readings again showed the temperature rising at some locations {{in the bottom of the}} reactor. On 11 February, temperatures rose once again. On 12 February, the temperature rose to 78.3°C (172.94°F). TEPCO denied the possibility of the core going critical again, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> produce xenon, which was still below detectable levels.

25|$|An {{important}} {{question for the}} NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed {{it would make the}} Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and z axis that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the x-axis {{can be assigned}} to a line that {{is parallel to the}} foul line, the y-axis to the line parallel to the boards, and the z-axis to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the x-axis, side-roll is rotation about the y-axis and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the z-axis. The pure full-roller delivery is a combination of forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
