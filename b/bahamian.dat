This included every single Summer Olympics starting from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, but excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the Soviet Union. The Bahamas had, as of 2008, never had an appearance in any Winter Olympics. The <b>Bahamian</b> delegation in Beijing included twenty-five athletes, one of its largest delegations in its history up to that point. Prior to Beijing, <b>Bahamian</b> athletes had won four gold medals, one silver and four bronze; a total of nine medals. Bahama's delegation in Beijing added one silver and one bronze medal to the tally, increasing the total number of <b>Bahamian</b> medals to eleven. The flag bearer at ceremonies was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie. The <b>Bahamian</b> delegation was 41st in line during the flagbearing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The men's 4×400meters relay {{included}} a <b>Bahamian</b> team that, in total, included six <b>Bahamian</b> athletes. Of those athletes, Avard Moncur and Ramon Miller participated {{only in the}} qualification round alongside Michael Mathieu and Andrae Williams. In the qualification round, which took place on 22 August, the <b>Bahamian</b> team participated on the second heat against the British, Jamaican, Trinidadian, Japanese, Greek and Dominican teams.

5|$|Born on New Providence Island, she {{completed}} her secondary education {{and became a}} teacher. After teaching for 17 years, Johnson returned to school to earn a master's and doctorate degree in educational administration. During this period, she traveled {{back and forth between}} school and her <b>Bahamian</b> home organizing labor and suffrage efforts. Upon graduation, Johnson was unable to find work because of her activism. She made a compelling speech to the <b>Bahamian</b> legislature in 1959, pleading for women's suffrage and subsequently made a similar plea to the Colonial Office in London. Once the right to vote had been secured, Johnson immediately entered politics in 1961, running in the first election in which women were allowed to participate. Though she lost her bid, she worked with the Progressive Liberal Party to gain <b>Bahamian</b> independence. When the country gained its freedom from colonial rule, Johnson was appointed to the Senate and served the government until her death, a decade later.|$|E

5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The <b>Bahamian</b> Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The <b>Bahamian</b> Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the <b>Bahamian</b> National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E
5|$|Five-time Olympian {{and former}} Louisiana State University athlete Laverne Eve, the oldest <b>Bahamian</b> athlete in the Beijing delegation, {{was the sole}} <b>Bahamian</b> {{participant}} in women's javelin throw.

She threw the javelin 55.22meters during the first round (placing thirteenth), and improved to 57.36meters in her second round (placing fourth). She threw 55.15meters the third round, but did not place.

5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of necrotic tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on <b>Bahamian</b> reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Barry {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{that left the}} Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had upper-level wind shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, the disturbance was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the disturbance into an area of low wind shear, and the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression Four {{on the evening of}} August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern <b>Bahamian</b> Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Frances was {{the sixth}} named storm, the fourth {{hurricane}}, {{and the third}} major hurricane, of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The system crossed the open Atlantic in mid and late August, moving {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles while strengthening. Its outer bands struck Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands while passing north of the Caribbean Sea. The storm's maximum sustained wind peaked at , achieving Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the system's forward motion slowed, the eye passed over San Salvador Island and very close to Cat Island in the Bahamas. Frances was the first hurricane to impact the entire <b>Bahamian</b> archipelago since 1928, and almost completely destroyed the agricultural economy there.|$|E
