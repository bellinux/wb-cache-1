5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> vitro, in vivo, and in silico. In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments {{are useful for}} learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E

Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens.

5|$|Koht {{graduated}} with a cand.philol. degree from the Royal Frederick University in 1896. He studied history with geography as a minor subject until 1895; his main history teacher was Gustav Storm. The next examination was in different languages, both classical and modern. Koht had the choice between Ancient Greek and Classical Latin or Norwegian and German (including Norse); he chose the Norwegian and German. In 1895, after finishing his history studies, he spent three months in the Mediterranean, travelling with three ships, the first from Norway to Venice, the second from Venice to Constantinople, the third back to Norway. He studied German literature during this travels. In December 1896 Koht was finally examined by Sophus Bugge and earned his degree. He was one of just three students to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> Norwegian and German in late 1896, and {{had been the only}} candidate in history the previous year.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{high school}} years usually have two semesters, {{starting}} in September and February. In some rural areas, operation {{may be subject to}} agricultural cycles. The number of lessons offered by school on a weekly basis is very subjective, and largely depends on the school's resources. In addition to normal lessons, periods for private study and extracurricular activity are provided as well. The academic curriculum consists of Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Ideology & Political Science, Music, Fine Arts, PE, Technology, Computing etc. Some schools may also offer vocational subjects. Generally speaking, Chinese, Mathematics and English are considered as three main subjects as they will definitely <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> Gaokao. In most provinces, students also need to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> either natural sciences, which incorporate Physics, Chemistry and Biology, or social sciences, which incorporate Geography, History and Ideology & Political Science.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water in}} a solution of sodium chloride must <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding gaseous oxygen in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Cl− ions, cation, which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium ion. The anion will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing chloride ion.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bowles' inability to speak Welsh contravened {{not only one}} of the Articles of Religion and the Act for the Translation of the Scriptures, but also the Act of Uniformity 1662.

However, Hay therefore concluded that clergy should <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> Welsh before being inducted into the benefice. Bowles had been lawfully inducted and instituted to the benefice, and therefore held the ecclesiastical freehold, so Hay doubted whether he had the power to deprive him of it.|$|E

25|$|As {{commonly}} argued by Dewey’s greatest critics, he was {{not able}} to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women’s suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. “Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures”.

25|$|The {{initial draft}} of the law was {{proposed}} in 2003 by then Minister of Culture Jean-Jacques Aillagon (Union for a Popular Movement, UMP).

The government (the cabinet of ministers, as represented by the Minister of Culture) had declared the law to be urgent, which means, under the Constitution of France, that the law would be examined only once by each house of Parliament; the reason given by the minister was that France was threatened by the European Commission with sanctions if it failed to implement the directive.|$|E

25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E
25|$|According to Christina Romer, {{the money}} supply growth caused by huge {{international}} gold inflows was a crucial source of {{the recovery of the}} United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe. In their book, A Monetary History of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors, and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System. Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery. Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors, particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system, and pointed out that the Depression should <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> <b>in</b> an international perspective.|$|E
