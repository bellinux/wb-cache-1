25|$|Two <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> {{variants}} of the Type 100 were produced {{during the course}} of the war: the Type 100/40 was an early version with bipod and heavy bayonet lug, judged unsatisfactory because of frequent jamming of the feed mechanism, and the Type 100/44 was a simplified 1944 version that had a higher rate of fire and much greater reliability. A third variant was a lightened version of the early Type 100/40 design which was delivered with a folding stock for navy paratroopers.|$|E
25|$|The Airbus Helicopters H160 takes {{advantage}} of several advanced manufacturing technologies and materials {{in order to produce}} a lighter, more efficient design. One weight-saving measure was the replacement of conventional hydraulic landing gear and brakes with electrical counterparts, the first helicopter in the world to do so; according to Airbus the elimination of hydraulic components makes the rotorcraft both lighter and safer. In 2015, Airbus claimed that the all-composite H160 would deliver the same <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> as the rival AgustaWestland AW139 while being a ton lighter, having a lower fuel consumption and offering 15–20% lower direct operating costs. The composite fuselage also provided for greater design freedom of the rotorcraft's external styling. During the aircraft's development, features such as full de-icing equipment and a fly-by-wire control system, were deemed too heavy or costly for the benefits involved and were eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning {{featured}} a conformal ventral store to house either a fuel tank or a rocket engine. The rocket engine, a Napier Double Scorpion motor, also contained a reserve of [...] of high-test peroxide (HTP) {{to drive the}} rocket’s turbopump and act as an oxidizer; fuel would have been drawn from the aircraft internal tankage. The rocket engine was intended {{at an early stage}} in the Lightning’s development to boost performance should non-afterburning (reheated) engines be fitted; the subsequent <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> with reheated Avons was deemed sufficient and the rocket engine option was cancelled in 1958. The ventral store was routinely used as an extra fuel tank, holding [...] of usable fuel. On later variants of the Lightning, a ventral weapons pack could be installed to equip the aircraft alternatively with different armaments, including missiles, rockets, and cannons.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Illiniwek's {{dance was}} derived from [...] "Indian Lore" [...] studies done by {{university}} students who had been Boy Scouts. The three- or four-minute dance is based on fancy dance, a style that originated from the Plains Indians {{as a means of}} providing a more secular display than purely sacred dancing, and which is practiced today by many Native Americans at pow-wows. The dance has evolved over time; each student who performs the role of the Chief augments the <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> with his own movements and steps. Although it is claimed the dance is similar to traditional fancy dance, the Chief's routine includes mid-air splits, which are rarely found in Native fancy dance. Only the music has remained unchanged, with the Chief always performing to the Three in One. In the 1990s, literature distributed by the University ceased describing the dance as [...] "authentic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Scorpion {{demonstrator}} completed pre-flight taxi trials on 25 November 2013 {{in preparation}} for its first flight. The Scorpion first flew on 12 December 2013 for 1.4 hours. The aircraft has the civilian registration N531TA and is designated as a Cessna E530. The flight occurred 23 months after the aircraft's conception, and the flight certification program will last two years. Textron AirLand aimed to complete 500 flight hours and verify <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> features {{by the end of}} 2014.

However, Rudd would return in 1994. This {{is not the first time}} Wright appeared in an AC/DC video for a track originally recorded with Rudd.

2500|$|These {{personnel}} scandals deepened in April {{when the}} D.C. City Council revealed {{it failed to}} identify inaccuracies on Few's résumé, submitted in 2000. The résumé incorrectly listed a college degree Few did not earn, and an honor ("1998 Fire Chief of the Year" [...] by the International Association of Fire Fighters) he did not receive. Some members of the District of Columbia Financial Control Board, which hired Few, said they might have vetoed his employment had they known about the inaccuracies. Few was also accused of misleading Congress by implying {{that he was a}} certified paramedic when he was not. Few blamed the mayor's office for submitting an incorrect résumé to the control board and Congress. A few days later, an internal DCFEMS report concluded that Anderson, Cowan, and Garland had not only failed to meet <b>basic</b> <b>performance</b> goals but also that departmental performance had actually declined under them. Under Anderson, ambulances met their arrival-time goals only 41.6 percent of the time, down from 50.2 percent of the time a year earlier. (The national standard is 90 percent, and the city's goal was 80 percent.) The average time for an ambulance to arrive after a patient's call was 15.5 minutes, far above the national average. Under Garland, the emergency fleet continued to deteriorate as well. Not a single new fire engine had been ordered since October 2000, and the average age of engines in reserve was 15 years (nearly 50 percent higher than the 11-year lifespan of the vehicles). Although Garland's goal was to buy four engines in 2001 and six in 2002, only a single small [...] "brush truck" [...] was ordered. Cowan, who supervised the city's building inspection program, was on track to inspect 3,243, buildings, far short of the goal of 5,980 inspections.|$|E
