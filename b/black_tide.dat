60|$|I fear I must be of a {{somewhat}} gruesome turn of mind. My sympathies are {{always with the}} melancholy side of life and nature. I love the chill October days, when the brown leaves lie thick and sodden underneath your feet, and a low sound as of stifled sobbing is heard in the damp woods--the evenings in late autumn time, when the white mist creeps across the fields, making it seem as though old Earth, feeling the night air cold to its poor bones, were drawing ghostly bedclothes round its withered limbs. I like the twilight of the long grey street, sad with the wailing cry of the distant muffin man. One thinks of him, as, strangely mitred, he glides by through the gloom, jangling his harsh bell, as the High Priest of the pale spirit of Indigestion, summoning the devout to come forth and worship. I find a sweetness in the aching dreariness of Sabbath afternoons in genteel suburbs--in the evil-laden desolateness of waste places by the river, when the yellow fog is stealing inland across the ooze and mud, and the <b>black</b> <b>tide</b> gurgles softly round worm-eaten piles.|$|E
60|$|If {{we cannot}} claim {{with all the}} {{patriotic}} confidence we should like to feel that it was Irving who set Christmas in that light in which Dickens saw its aesthetic capabilities, it is perhaps because all origins are obscure. For anything that we positively know to the contrary, the Druidic rites from which English Christmas borrowed the inviting mistletoe, if not the decorative holly, may have been accompanied by the recitations of holiday triads. But {{it is certain that}} several plays of Shakespeare were produced, if not written, for the celebration of the holidays, and that then the <b>black</b> <b>tide</b> of Puritanism which swept over men's souls blotted out all such observance of Christmas with the festival itself. It came in again, by a natural reaction, with the returning Stuarts, and throughout the period of the Restoration it enjoyed a perfunctory favor. There is mention of it; often enough in the eighteenth-century essayists, in the Spectators and Idlers and Tatlers; but the world about the middle of the last century laments the neglect into which it had fallen. Irving seems to have been the first to observe its surviving rites lovingly, and Dickens divined its immense advantage as a literary occasion. He made it in some sort entirely his for a time, and there can be no question but it was he who again endeared it to the whole English-speaking world, and gave it a wider and deeper hold than it had ever had before upon the fancies and affections of our race.|$|E

White mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) is the third-most dominant, followed by botoncillo (Conocarpus erectus); both are generally found further inland and are inundated by the tide less frequently. The dominance of different species over others correlates with the frequency of floods, water quality, and levels of salinity.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the study of oil spill {{pollution}} of both surface and subsurface in the intertidal area of sandy beaches. The central objective is to provide increased insights regarding the forcing mechanisms of oil arrival, subsequent burial, and natural degradation in order to improve the current oil spill response management protocols. This study entails a threefold approach: field surveys, numerical modelling, and experimentation. The surveys have been mainly conducted on Prestige oil polluted sandy beaches, Nemi√±a and O Rostro beaches (NW Spain), from 2004 to 2011. The beach monitoring program has provided evidence of recurrent Prestige oil pollution in both surface and subsurface (up to 1. 8 m depth) even nine years after the accident. The study of sediment colour {{has been used as a}} tool to detect contamination when oil concentration is below the detection limits of conventional hydrocarbons analysis. Numerical modelling wave propagation has predicted which beach areas are more exposed to recurrent contamination. Hydrodynamic conditions and beach morphodynamics have revealed as the main factors controlling surface contamination distribution and oil burial and exhumation cycles both early and later stages of <b>black</b> <b>tides.</b> These two factors also have conditioned the maximum depth of oil burial. Theoretical estimation of the depth of oil burial along the intertidal area has been obtained from an equilibrium beach profile combined with a shoreline evolution model. Simulated test cases have revealed the existence of two main patterns of beach profiles behaviour under varying oceanographic and sedimentological conditions. Type A and Type B are characterized by intertidal slopes of time-constant and time-varying steepness, respectively. Type A underscores the existence of burial or exhumation along entire intertidal zone; whereas Type B combines both burial and exhumation depending on the considered intertidal area. These outcomes have a direct effect in the own definition of the depth of oil burial. Laboratory experiments under controlled environmental conditions have been designed to study the behaviour of buried oil. The results have underlined the influence of sediment composition in the buried oil degradation process from tar balls to oil microparticles and/or oil coatings. They draw attention to carbonates which enhance the appearance and development of oil coatings. The findings of this research have opened new prospects for assessment, monitoring and response programs for oil polluted sandy beaches. These can be addressed in different stages: identification of the problem, dimensioning the affected zone and improving the clean-up operations. The identification of sensitive areas of beaches could be performed due to the knowledge of its exposure to oceanographic conditions. Based on the changes in the oceanographic and sedimentological parameters, the affected area mainly burial depth could be predicted at low computational cost. The current clean-up techniques could be improved, including the addition of bioclastic carbonate sands to retain the oil in a specific site, and hence, limiting its expansion toward more sensitive areas.

There was a mound over which my path lay, and as I came out on the top of it I looked down the long, shallow valley of Waterloo.

Now there were but long, ragged fringes of broken and {{exhausted}} regiments upon the two ridges, but a real army of dead and wounded lay between. For two miles in length and half a mile across the ground was strewed and heaped with them. But slaughter was no new sight to me, and it was not that which held me spellbound. It was that up the long slope of the British position was moving a walking forest-black, tossing, waving, unbroken. Did I not know the bearskins of the Guard? And did I not also know, did not my soldier's instinct tell me, that it was the last reserve of France; that the Emperor, like a desperate gamester, was staking all upon his last card? Up they went and up--grand, solid, unbreakable, scourged with musketry, riddled with grape, flowing onward in a <b>black,</b> heavy <b>tide,</b> which lapped over the British batteries. With my glass I could see the English gunners throw themselves under their pieces or run to the rear. On rolled the crest of the bearskins, and then, with a crash which was swept across to my ears, they met the British infantry. A minute passed, and another, and another. My heart was in my mouth.|$|R
