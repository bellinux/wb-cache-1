40|$|The {{efficiency}} of uranium leaching determines the economic viability of treating low grade uranium deposits, and is quite sensitive to ore characteristics. The interrelationship between mineralogy, mineral liberation and the leaching behaviour of uranium {{is not well}} defined. Uraninite's leaching kinetics are well studied, but relatively little leaching {{research has been conducted}} for other uranium minerals. Dissolutions higher than 90 % are very difficult to achieve under the normal operating conditions employed for acid leaching of South African ores. In this paper, a mineralogy-leachability explanation is presented to rationalise the difficulty in exceeding 90 % dissolution from low grade uranium ores in the Vaal River region (averaging 0. 3 kg U 3 O 8 /t). Based on the findings, further discussed in the paper, it appears that <b>brannerite's</b> intrinsic inertness is responsible for not obtaining optimum recoveries. It is also shown that for low grade uranium ores in the Witwatersrand context, the real value of uranium leaching could lie in the unlocking of extra gold (0. 4 - 0. 6 g/t) by the uranium leaching process that typically precedes cyanide leaching of gold. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To develop an effective process for the extraction of uranium from <b>brannerite</b> containing ores and improve the extraction from the ores currently being processed, it is necessary to understand the chemistry of the <b>brannerite</b> leaching process. As this study has shown, <b>brannerite</b> is typically an altered and amorphous mineral, with an extent of alteration depending on the age of the sample and the geological history of the deposit. A sample of <b>brannerite</b> from Cordoba, Spain, was leached over a range of conditions in acidic ferric sulphate media.

40|$|The uranium {{titanate}} mineral <b>brannerite</b> (UTi 2 O 6), {{which is}} found in numerous uranium ore bodies around the world, is a mineral {{that may be a}} potential future source for increased uranium production. In this thesis the characteristics and dissolution chemistry of both natural and synthetic brannerites have been investigated in detail. Natural samples were investigated to identify the major minerals that are in close association with naturally occurring <b>brannerite.</b> Leaching chemistry of all natural and synthetic brannerites have been studied under conditions that are used in uranium minerals processing. An electrochemical leaching study of synthetic <b>brannerite</b> was undertaken to examine the surface behaviour of synthetic <b>brannerite</b> suspended in tank based leaching conditions similar to those used in uranium mineral processing. Characterisation studies conducted on two naturally occurring brannerites ore bodies from South Australia, focussed on their chemistry and mineralogy, and involved the use of use of multiple characterisation techniques (X-ray Diffraction Analysis, Raman Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Electron Probe Micro Analysis). Recrystallization of the natural <b>brannerite</b> samples (via heat treatment) were also investigated. From the results obtained, the natural <b>brannerite</b> samples contained <b>brannerite</b> that was rich in thorium and also uranothorite and thorianite-uraninite phases. Gangue mineralogy phases found in both mineral samples were rutile quartz, aluminosilicates, unidentified REE-containing phosphates, zircon, titanates and apatite. After heat treatment the natural <b>brannerite</b> samples contained a high-Th <b>brannerite</b> and the thorianite-uraninite phase in the unheated samples was decomposed into separate ThO 2 and UO 2 phases. One of the research aims of this thesis was to synthesise and characterise a <b>brannerite</b> that has little impurities (rutile and uraninite) and use this synthetic product to investigate the maximum extraction of uranium. This investigation was undertaken to gain detailed knowledge into the rate of dissolution of the synthesised <b>brannerite</b> over a range of conditions (temperature, [H 2 SO 4] and [Fe] / ORP). One for the major findings from this research indicated that [Fe(III) ] (over the range 3 – 12 g/L) did not have a significant influence on dissolution at a reaction temperature of 50 °C (in 15 g/L H 2 SO 4). Yet at 95 °C in 15 g/L H 2 SO 4, increasing [Fe(III) ] (over the range 3 – 12 g/L) leads to significant increases in the dissolution rate. These aforementioned dissolution tests were conducted to probe the mechanism of synthetic <b>brannerite</b> dissolution and were compared with respect to the electrochemical behaviour of this synthetic mineral. An investigation was undertaken to determine the reason why this uranium mineral is not readily leachable under mild conditions and to determine if passivation was occurring on the surface of synthetic <b>brannerite.</b> When dissolution tests for the two natural <b>brannerite</b> samples were conducted under identical conditions investigated for synthetic <b>brannerite,</b> the results showed that the effect of increasing [Fe(III) ], [H 2 SO 4], and temperature was to increase the solubility of uranium from <b>brannerite.</b> Uranium recovery processes from <b>brannerite</b> is not straightforward process and influenced by the mineralogical characteristics of the ore.

40|$|<b>Brannerite,</b> UTi 2 O 6, is {{the most}} {{important}} uranium mineral after uraninite and coffinite, and the most common refractory uranium mineral. As the more-leachable ores become exhausted, it is necessary to process complex and refractory ores to meet the growing demand for uranium as an energy source. The present study was carried out to provide information that will enable the development of a more effective processing strategy for the extraction of uranium from ores containing <b>brannerite.</b> A detailed study was carried out to understand the leaching behaviour of <b>brannerite</b> in sulphate media (10 – 200 g/L H 2 SO 4) under moderate temperature conditions (25 – 96 °C), and in alternative acid and alkaline systems. The feed and the leached residues were characterised by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry techniques. The <b>brannerite</b> dissolved up to 95 % after 5 h leaching in ferric sulphate media, up to 89 % in ferric chloride media under similar conditions, and up to 82 % in 24 h in sodium carbonate media. The alkaline leaching was repeated with a high-carbonate brannerite-bearing ore, which showed comparable extractions. Mineralogical characterisation showed that altered and amorphous regions are a regular feature of <b>brannerite,</b> and that pitting is typically observed {{on the surface of the}} leached grains. <b>Brannerite</b> was shown to generally dissolve congruently, with altered and amorphous regions in the <b>brannerite</b> grains dissolving faster than the crystalline regions, which implies that the extent of <b>brannerite</b> alteration is a key parameter in the process selection, along with the grade, liberation size and gangue mineralogy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Brannerite,</b> ideally UTi 2 O 6 is a {{refractory}} uranium mineral {{found in}} many uranium and rare earth element ore deposits around the world, including many in Australia. As <b>brannerite</b> is refractory, ores containing <b>brannerite</b> require more intense leaching conditions than typical uranium ores. <b>Brannerite</b> {{is the most common}} refractory uranium mineral, and the most important uranium ore mineral after uraninite (UO 2) and coffinite (U(SiO 4) 1 -x(OH) 4 x). Several high-brannerite uranium deposits in Australia remain un-developed, despite being discovered as early as the 1950 s. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the leaching chemistry of <b>brannerite</b> in a variety of systems, starting with the conventional acidic ferric sulphate system and alternatives including the ferric chloride-hydrochloric acid system and the alkaline-carbonate system. The principal assumption is that an improved understanding of the leaching chemistry of <b>brannerite</b> will lead to more effective extraction processes, improving the extractions at existing mines, and enabling the development of new ones. <b>Brannerite</b> was found to undergo congruent dissolution in acid, contrary to the often-reported mechanism in which a titanium oxide coating forms on the surface. Phosphate released by gangue minerals such as apatite can cause the formation of this layer however. When leaching with acidic ferric solutions, sulphate media is superior to chloride media. Alkaline carbonate leaching was also found to be effective for <b>brannerite</b> leaching, albeit much slower than acid leaching. These same alkaline leaching conditions were applied to a sample of refractory uranium ore from Queensland high in acid soluble gangue and shown to be effective. These findings are discussed in detail below. A sample of <b>brannerite</b> from the Dieresis deposit in the Sierra Albarrana region of Spain was characterised in detail by XRD and SEM-EDX methods. The <b>brannerite</b> was found to be altered and metamict (rendered amorphous by self-irradiation), as is typical for <b>brannerite.</b> Many <b>brannerite</b> particles contained linear zones of titanium oxide surrounded by silicon enriched and uranium depleted <b>brannerite,</b> consistent with descriptions of naturally altered <b>brannerite.</b> These altered zones were more susceptible to leaching, regardless of the leaching conditions. All leached residues were analysed by the same methods to understand the changes taking place in the solid phase during leaching. This suggests that the extent of natural alteration influences the leachability of a particular <b>brannerite.</b> The leaching of <b>brannerite</b> was studied in acidic ferric sulphate media (0. 05 mol/L or 2. 8 g/L Fe 3 +) over a range of temperatures (25 - 96 °C) and acid concentrations (10 - 200 g/L H 2 SO 4) for five hours. Leached <b>brannerite</b> was pitted and corroded. The rate of leaching was strongly dependent on temperature and weakly dependent on acid concentration. At lower temperatures, <b>brannerite</b> dissolved incongruently in the early stages of leaching. At higher temperatures <b>brannerite</b> dissolved congruently for the entirety of the leaching experiment. The transition between these two mechanisms happened at lower temperatures when the acid concentration was higher. In the incongruent dissolution reaction, the activation energies for uranium and titanium release were 36 and 48 kJ/mol respectively. In the congruent dissolution process, the activation energy was 23 kJ/mol for both uranium and titanium dissolution. At high temperatures (> 75 °C) and low acid concentrations (< 25 g/L H 2 SO 4), the concentration of titanium dropped after the first hour of leaching and some secondary anatase (TiO 2) formed. This anatase was distinct from the anatase in the original material in that it contained iron and did not contain uranium, confirming that it formed during leaching. Ferric chloride and cupric sulphate lixiviants were studied over a similar range of temperatures and acid concentrations. As with the ferric sulphate leaching tests, the oxidising cation concentration was kept constant at 0. 05 mol/L. The leaching behaviour of <b>brannerite</b> in cupric sulphate media was quite similar to what was observed in ferric sulphate media; the rate of leaching was slightly lower than what was observed in ferric sulphate media under comparable conditions. In chloride media, the rate of leaching was slow compared to sulphate media at the same temperature and acid concentration. This suggests that the formation of stable uranium complexes is an important part of the dissolution process. Uranyl sulphate complexes are much stronger than uranyl chloride complexes. Certain leaching experiments were repeated with the addition of minerals commonly associated with <b>brannerite</b> to gain a clearer understanding of the effects of deleterious gangue. These experiments were run at the extremes and middle of the range of temperatures and acid concentrations studied. Ilmenite accelerated the precipitation of anatase while fluorite significantly increased the rate of uranium and titanium dissolution. Fluorapatite greatly reduced the rate of <b>brannerite</b> dissolution. These results showed a previously unknown interaction between phosphorus and titanium. Phosphate helped to initiate the formation of a titanium oxide coating on the leached <b>brannerite,</b> inhibiting the leaching reaction. Higher concentrations of sulphuric acid reduced these negative effects. Interestingly, phosphate improved the rate of leaching in chloride media, suggesting that chloride leaching may be a viable option when processing high-phosphate refractory uranium ores. Alkaline leaching may be an effective alternative processing option. While it is often reported that <b>brannerite</b> and similar minerals will not readily dissolve in alkaline media, leaching experiments with sodium carbonate based lixiviants showed that alkaline leaching of <b>brannerite</b> is possible. Compared with acid leaching, it is slow however. Uranium extractions of 83...|$|E

The three main types of uranium minerals that are found at the world&# 039;s largest single uranium bearing ore body at Roxbury Downs, South Australia are uraninite (nominally UO 2), coffinite [U(SiO 4) 1 - x(OH) 4 x], and <b>brannerite</b> [U(Ti, Fe) 2 O 6]. Detailed knowledge of the influence of temperature, [H 2 SO 4] and [Fe]/solution oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) on the dissolution of uraninite are well known, yet little information on the influence of the aforementioned on the dissolution of <b>brannerite</b> has been reported in the literature.

In each sample, the <b>brannerite</b> was found to be thorium-rich (~ 8 - 10 wt. % Th) indicating partial solid solution between <b>brannerite</b> and thorutite (ThTi 2 O 6). Other minerals identified in the samples were thorutite (ThTi 2 O 6), uranothorite ([Th, U]SiO 4), a thorianite-uraninite solid solution ([Th, U]O 2) and gangue minerals including rutile, quartz, aluminosilicates, zircon, titanite, apatite and unidentified REE-containing phosphates.

40|$|<b>Brannerite,</b> UTi 2 O 6, {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{refractory}} uranium minerals and it requires aggressive leaching conditions for efficient uranium extraction.

While the effects of these gangue minerals on uranium leaching processes are well documented, there is little to no information on these effects specific to <b>brannerite</b> containing ores. At the high acid concentrations required for <b>brannerite</b> dissolution (> 25 g/L H 2 SO 4), acid soluble gangue will dissolve faster, posing a bigger problem than under milder conditions. The addition of 10 g/L fluorapatite reduced the extraction of both uranium and titanium from <b>brannerite</b> over the full range of leaching conditions studied (25 – 96 °C, 25 – 100 g/L H 2 SO 4, 2. 8 g/L Fe 3 +). Phosphate caused the formation of secondary titanium oxide on the surface of leached <b>brannerite</b> particles. This was not observed when leaching in the absence of phosphate. The secondary titanium oxide phase was enriched in phosphorus. The negative effects of phosphate on uranium leaching were reduced at higher acid concentrations (> 50 g/L H 2 SO 4) and increased at higher temperatures (96 °C). When leaching high-P refractory uranium ores, higher acid concentrations are needed for effective extraction compared with low-P uranium ores. Elevated temperatures were less effective for increasing uranium extraction, suggesting that the optimum temperature for leaching high-P refractory uranium ores is lower than the optimum temperature for leaching low-P uranium ores. Fluorite (10 g/L) had a positive effect on uranium and titanium extraction.

The efficient extraction of uranium from ores containing <b>brannerite</b> requires a detailed understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the rate and extent of dissolution. These mechanisms are often complicated by the presence of gangue minerals which consume reagents and impact on the solution chemistry. In this study, the acidic ferric sulphate leaching of an exceptionally pure, natural <b>brannerite</b> mineral (35. 8 % U, 20. 1 % Ti) was investigated under atmospheric conditions. Hence the variation in mineral composition was not present as a complicating factor and the results were able to identify some of the inhibiting mechanisms, and also the preferred conditions for the leaching of <b>brannerite</b> in an acidic ferric sulphate system. The effects of temperature (40 - 80 C), ferric ion concentration (0 - 100 g/L), H 2 SO 4 concentration (10 - 200 g/L), redox potential (424 - 752 mV vs. Ag/AgCl), and particle size on uranium and titanium extractions were studied for leach times up to 48 h. Under relatively mild conditions (40 C, 24 h leach time, 40 g/L H 2 SO 4), the extent of uranium extraction was 94. 4 %. The extractions improved with the use of a higher temperature, a finer particle size, and a longer leach time. The presence of ferric iron was essential for enhanced dissolution rates, but had only a minor effect on the final uranium extractions, particularly at 60 C and 80 C. All of the leach residues studied had some crystalline anatase (TiO 2) and lead sulphate (anglesite) present. A strong correlation was found between the concentrations of unleached uranium and the amount of titanium precipitated in the residues, which could be explained by the observation of a Ti-enriched diffusion layer on the surface of the dissolving grains of <b>brannerite,</b> which hindered the extraction process. These findings further the current understanding of the extraction process and lead a step closer to elucidation of the mechanism of the extraction process...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} metasomatic uranium {{deposits}} {{in the area}} around Mount Isa in Queensland, containing a total of 56, 400 t of uranium. Many of these ores are refractory in nature, meaning that relatively high leach temperatures (> 75 °C) and reagent dosages (> 50 g/L H 2 SO 4) are needed to effectively extract the uranium from them. Also, these ores are hosted in alkaline rock which means that acid leaching is unlikely to be economical. While refractory uranium ores are not typically leached in alkaline media, previous work has shown that uranium can be extracted from <b>brannerite</b> in alkaline media, albeit slowly. The same leaching conditions previously shown to be effective for the extraction of uranium from <b>brannerite</b> were repeated with a sample of refractory uranium ore from a deposit near Mount Isa in north western Queensland.

The ores were leached over a range of temperatures and Fe (III) and H 2 SO 4 concentrations. As well, samples of the ores were calcined at 1200 C in air to investigate the effect of thermally induced recrystallisation on uranium dissolution. For the unheated samples, a maximum of ∼ 80 % U dissolution was obtained using an Fe (III) concentration of 12 g/L, an acid concentration of 150 g/L H 2 SO 4 and a temperature of 95 C. The heat treated samples performed poorly under identical conditions, with maximum uranium dissolution of < 10 % recorded. High uranium dissolution from natural <b>brannerite</b> can be achieved providing; (i) acid strength, oxidant strength and temperatures are maintained at elevated levels (compared to those traditionally used for uraninite leaching), and, (ii) the <b>brannerite</b> has not undergone any significant recrystallisation (e. g. through metamorphism) ...|$|E

The three main types of uranium minerals that are found at the world&# 039;s single largest uranium bearing ore body (Olympic Dam, South Australia) are: tetravalent and hexavalent uraninite [UO 2, UO 3]; coffinite [U(SiO 4) 1 -x(OH) 4 x]; and <b>brannerite</b> [U(Ti, Fe) 2 O 6]. Detailed knowledge of the factors that influence the dissolution of uraninite are well known, yet little information on the dissolution of <b>brannerite</b> has been reported in the literature. In this study the influence of a number of parameters on the rate of UTi 2 O 6 dissolution under acidic conditions were investigated. The parameters that were investigated included temperature, [H 2 SO 4], total iron concentration and oxidation/reduction potential (ORP).

During MOX fuel production, residues unsuitable for further recycle will be produced. Due to their high actinide content MOX residues require immobilization within a robust host matrix. Although {{it is possible to}} immobilize actinides in vitreous wasteforms; ceramic phases, such as <b>brannerite</b> (UTi 2 O 6), are attractive due to their high waste loading capacity and relative insolubility. A range of uranium brannerites, formulated GdxU 1 -xTi 2 O 6, were prepared using a mixed oxide route. Charge compensation of divalent and trivalent cations was expected to occur via the oxidation of U 4 + to higher valence states (U 5 + or U 6 +). Gd 3 + was added to act as a neutron absorber in the final Pu bearing wasteform. X-ray powder diffraction of synthesised specimens found that phase distribution was strongly affected by processing atmosphere (air or Ar).

40|$|Interpretations {{of mineral}} textures {{have long been}} used to better {{understand}} the processes involved in the formation of mineral deposits. At the Olympic Dam iron-oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) -Ag-U deposit, South Australia, the genesis and evolution of the U-mineralization is difficult to reconstruct unequivocally. Uraninite, coffinite and <b>brannerite</b> are the dominant Uminerals, however previous studies have focussed on the parts of the deposit which have elevated U-grade and are dominated by massive- or vein-type uraninite. Few prior studies documented the textural and chemical variability of these minerals from a broad range of samples throughout the deposit. Based on detailed mineralogical and microanalytical analysis, this study has addressed some of these shortcomings. The data and interpretation thereof allow for models and hypotheses to be made about the formation and alteration mechanisms involved in forming the mineral textures as observed today. Two generations of uraninite have been identified, and these can be split into four main textural classes. The early generation consists of the primary, zoned and cob-web textural classes. These represent single uraninite crystals with high-Pb and ΣREE+Y (ΣREY), which have been progressively altered both chemically and texturally. The simplest cubic, euhedral morphology is displayed by the primary uraninites, which also often exhibit oscillatory and sectorial zonation of lattice-bound Pb and ΣREY, and commonly have elevated Th contents. Zoned uraninites are typically coarser, sub-euhedral to prismatic grains and contain unique zonation patterns defined by distinct zones of high- and low-Pb and ΣREY which differ to the zoning contained within the primary uraninites. The greatest heterogeneity is observed within the cob-web class, with variable hexagonal to octagonal morphologies, varying degrees of rounding, and rhythmic intergrowths of uraninite with Cu-(Fe) -sulfides ± fluorite from core to margin. There is also a late generation of uraninite which occurs in the highest-grade parts of the deposit and exists as μm-sized grains to aphanitic varieties which form larger (up to mmsized) aggregates and vein-fillings. Late uraninites typically have lower-Pb, but higher Ca±Si contents compared to the early generation. The early crystalline uraninites are only sparsely preserved, with the more massive-aphantitic uraninite representing the majority of the uraninite contained within the deposit. Nanoscale characterization of selected uraninite crystals from the early generation has revealed these have a defect-free fluorite structure, and contain lattice-bound Pb+ΣREY within chemically distinct zones or domains. Micro- and nanoscale inclusions of galena, Cu- (Fe) -sulfides and REY-minerals are also present within the cob-web uraninites. The presence of both lattice-bound Pb within distinct zones and domains, as well as inclusions of galena within these uraninites, are attributed to healing of radiogenic damage via solid-state traceelement mobility, and subsequent fS₂-driven percolation of a Cu-bearing fluid allowing for inclusion nucleation and recrystallization. Crystal-structural formulae for uraninite have been calculated, and the key underlying assumption for these formulae is that lattice-bound radiogenic Pb is present, at least in part, in the tetravalent state. To distinguish the two uraninite generations, in addition to the textural and chemical differences, the oxidation state [U⁶⁺/(U⁴⁺+U⁶⁺) ] was calculated and it was revealed that these potentially experienced different formation conditions. The early uraninites are thought to have formed from higher temperature, granite-derived hydrothermal fluids, with later hydrothermal alteration of the zoned and cob-web types; whereas the late uraninites have formed hydrothermally at lower temperatures (< 250 °C). Additional characterization of the zoned and cob-web uraninite using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) has further developed our understanding of the processes involved in their evolution. Zoned uraninite has been interpreted to have formed as a result of multiple superimposed effects, including alteration of initial oscillatory zoning (as displayed by the primary uraninite) from interaction with hydrothermal fluids and/or from self-annealing of radiation damage. Zones of weakness were created within uraninite {{as a result of the}} accumulation of defects and dislocations into tilt boundaries that correlate to one of the active slip systems in uraninite. High diffusivity pathways were generated along these zones of weakness, and aided in element mobility and exchange between uraninite and the hydrothermal fluid/s. The rhythmic intergrowths of uraninite and Cu-(Fe) -sulfides, of which the cob-web uraninites comprise, are attributed to replacement of uraninite by bornite. Replacement is thought to be controlled by the inherent chemical zoning (of Th) within the uraninite crystal, and part of the replacement occurs via coupled dissolution-reprecipitation (CDR) reaction. Initially, the bornite inherits the crystallographic orientation of the parent uraninite, but different orientations of bornite are possible due to epitaxial nucleation. Based on the presence of Cu-(Fe) -sulfide ± fluorite inclusions and the chemistry of the proposed replacement, it is suggested that replacement was driven by a F-rich hydrothermal fluid that was also enriched in Cu, S, Fe and Ca. This is the first known study which integrates the use of EBSD and other micro- and nanoscale characterization techniques to study uraninites and associated minerals. The application of CDR-driven replacement to systems which have no common chemical constituents is also at present unique. The combined use of various microand nanoscale characterization techniques has therefore provided some fresh insights into the reactions and enhanced our knowledge about the evolution and progressive in-situ alteration of uraninite at Olympic Dam. Much of the past work conducted on the U-minerals at Olympic Dam has indicated that there were numerous cycles of U dissolution and reprecipitation, but few studies have further explored this hypothesis. Both <b>brannerite</b> and coffinite have also been characterized in the present study. <b>Brannerite</b> has a diverse morphology which ranges from complex irregular shaped aggregates, irregularly-shaped blebs, replacement bands, and discrete elongate seams. The internal structure of <b>brannerite</b> consists of randomly orientated hair-like needles and blades to a mix of uniform-massive or bleb-like irregular masses. Compositions range between that of uraniferous rutile and stoichiometric <b>brannerite.</b> The more uniform-massive <b>brannerite</b> blebs, typically have higher ΣREY, Pb, Nb ± As contents compared to the more needle-like, irregular-shaped, aggregated <b>brannerite</b> which contains elevated Fe, Mg ± Mn ± Na ± K. Based on chemical and textural observations, <b>brannerite</b> has been grouped into four distinct groups. Coffinite is typically globular to collomorph in appearance, and is often found on the margin of quartz grains and nucleates from a range of minerals including Cu-(Fe) - sulfides, galena, <b>brannerite,</b> uraninite, and chlorite. Variations in Ca, ΣREY, P ± As ± Nb appear to be responsible for much of the chemical heterogeneity. Three different coffinite groups have been identified based on chemical variability and textural observations, however there are some textural differences and variable mineral associations within these groups. It is likely that the textural heterogeneity is due to local variation in fluid-rock interactions. It is concluded that <b>brannerite</b> and coffinite are a result of a late-stage U-event(s), and this may have involved the dissolution and/or reprecipitation of earlier precipitated uraninite, or may have involved a fresh influx of U. Factors which support late-stage formation of both <b>brannerite</b> and coffinite include their low-Pb contents and the occurrence of coffinite on the edges of uraninite or <b>brannerite,</b> indicating that the coffinite may have formed after either of these minerals. Additional features like banding, scalloped edges, alteration rinds, variable compositions etc. are also indicative that these minerals may have formed as a result of alteration and by processes which occur after initial deposition of the mineral on which they occur. The precipitation of uraninite, <b>brannerite</b> and coffinite all require different conditions and chemical components, thus it is unlikely a single fluid could precipitate all of these minerals at one time. It is clear that some of the uraninites precipitated early in the formation of the deposit, but deciphering the subsequent generations of U-minerals is somewhat subjective. The results of this study will clearly document the range of textures and compositions of uraninite, <b>brannerite</b> and coffinite found within the Olympic Dam deposit and will provide evidence for a number of mechanisms which have contributed to their textural appearance. But, the genetic implications of these findings and what they mean for the genesis of the deposit remains unconstrained and will undoubtedly form the basis for future research. Thesis (Ph. D.)

An attempt is here made to co-ordinate and assess the evidence and conclusions presented by the various workers. Commercial ore is almost exclusively restricted to quartz pebble conglomerate beds near the base of the Lower Huronian quartzites and a direct relationship exists between maximum conglomerate development and grade of uranium. The detrital material was derived from Archaean basement rocks to the northwest and was probably deposited under deltaic conditions near a northward-migrating shore line. The ore minerals are uraninite, <b>brannerite,</b> and minerals of the gummite group in variable proportions. <b>Brannerite</b> is the most generally accepted as detrital mineral but even here the evidence is not altogether convincing. Age determinations show that definite detrital minerals, such as zircon and monazite, have an age corresponding to that of the Archaean base-ment while the uranium minerals show an age closer to that of the deposition of the Lower Huronian sediments. Pending more convincing evidence that the <b>brannerite</b> is detrital, it is concluded that: (1) The uranium minerals were deposited contemporaneously, or shortly after, deposition of the conglomerate beds, but as precipitates from supergene solution rather than as detrital minerals. (2) The present uranium minerals resulted from recrystallization or reaction with other minerals after burial. (3) Hydrothermal action does not appear to have played a more significant role than aiding such recrystallization and the redistribution of uranium within the conglommerate beds...|$|E

The experimental approach was to saturate each phase by adding more than the solid solubility limit of the given cation, using a nominated substitution scheme, and then analyzing the candidate phase that formed to evaluate the solid solubility limit under firing conditions. Confirmation that the solid solution limit had been reached insofar as other phases rich in the cation of interest was also required. The candidate phases were monazite, titanite, zirconolite, perovskite, apatite, pyrochlore, and <b>brannerite.</b> The valences of Pu and U were typically deduced from the firing atmosphere, and charge balancing in the candidate phase composition as evaluated from electron microscopy, although in some cases it was measured directly by x-ray absorption and diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (for U). Tetravalent Pu and U have restricted (< 0. 1 formula units) solid solubility in apatite, titanite, and perovskite. Trivalent Pu has a larger solubility in apatite and perovskite than Pu 4 +.

40|$|Refractory uranium ores {{containing}} uranium as multiple oxides typically require leaching at elevated temperatures (> 75 °C) {{and acid}} concentrations (> 50 g/L H 2 SO 4) {{in order to}} effectively extract the uranium. Some uranium ores contain large amounts of acid-soluble gangue, such as carbonates or soluble silicates and when the carbonate content exceeds approximately 8 %, the acid consumption by gangue may render acid leaching uneconomical. In these situations, leaching in alkaline-carbonate is a potential option. The advantages of this approach include improved selectivity for uranium over other elements, reduced gangue dissolution {{and the ability to}} recycle the lixiviant. One disadvantage is slower rates of leaching and hence the need for finer grinding. However, when a uranium ore contains significant amounts of acid-soluble gangue with refractory uranium mineralisation (a double refractory ore), the process options are more limited. Refractory uranium minerals, such as <b>brannerite,</b> are often reported as slow to dissolve in alkaline carbonate media. If a double refractory uranium ore is to be processed effectively, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of minerals like <b>brannerite</b> in the alkaline leaching system. In the present study, a sample of <b>brannerite</b> was leached in a sodium carbonate solution (1 mol/L total carbonate) for 24 h at temperatures from 50 to 90 °C.
