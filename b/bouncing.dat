5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the <b>bouncing</b> pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The <b>bouncing</b> mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E
5|$|After {{pitching}} out of {{the bullpen}} while <b>bouncing</b> {{back and forth between}} Texas and its Triple-A affiliate in 2005–07, Feldman converted to a starter in 2008. He established himself in 2009 with a breakout season for the Rangers. He was 17–8, tied for 4th in the American League in wins, and tied the major league record with 12 victories on the road.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerine {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large.

50|$|In 2016, news {{sources and}} polls {{differed}} greatly {{on the size}} of the convention <b>bounces</b> received by Donald Trump after the GOP convention in Cleveland and by Hillary Clinton after 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. For Trump, CNN, via its polling, reported Trump gaining a 6-point <b>bounce,</b> the first major convention <b>bounce</b> in CNN's polling since the 2000 election, when Al Gore and George W. Bush both had an identical 8-point <b>bounce</b> following their conventions. NBC, however, reported no bump for Trump following the convention, via its NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll.

5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's <b>bouncing</b> kickoff and {{returned}} it 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line.

50|$|Interpretation of the <b>bounce</b> rate measure {{should be}} {{relevant}} to a website's business objectives and definitions of conversion, as having a high <b>bounce</b> rate {{is not always a}} sign of poor performance. On sites where an objective can be met without viewing more than one page, for example on websites sharing specific knowledge on some subject (dictionary entry, specific recipe), the <b>bounce</b> rate would not be as meaningful for determining conversion success. In contrast, the <b>bounce</b> rate of an e-commerce site could be interpreted in correlation with the purchase conversion rate, providing the <b>bounces</b> are considered representative of visits where no purchase was made. Typically, an average <b>Bounce</b> Rate for e-commerce is around 60%, with top performers operating at a 36% average <b>Bounce</b> Rate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Oyster {{farms are}} well {{detected}} by SAR. Characteristics of polarimetric {{features of the}} oyster farming structures are presented in this paper. The results of AIRSAR L-band POLSAR data and experiments in laboratory are discussed. HH- and VV-polarized signals showed strongly returns from the target area in the AIRSAR image. The ratio of single <b>bounce</b> to double <b>bounce</b> scattering depends of vertical pole height, direction of horizontal pole to azimuth pass, and incidence angle as well as sea surface conditions. Radar returns from vertical poles are stronger than those from horizontal poles by 10. 5 dB. Single <b>bounce</b> components are as strong as double <b>bounce</b> components and more sensitive to antenna look direction. Double <b>bounce</b> shows linear relation with height of vertical poles, which implies double <b>bounced</b> components are more useful to determine water level than total power. L-band HH-polarization generally produces strong radar returns among the three polarizations. Double <b>bounce</b> is main scattering mechanism in oyster farms standing above seawater, while single <b>bounce</b> is stronger than double <b>bounce</b> when bottom surface is exposed to air...|$|R
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling backwards in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, <b>bouncing</b> {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backwards in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|During WorldWarI, {{approximately}} 120,000 ANZAC personnel convalesced in Weymouth {{after being}} injured at Gallipoli or other theatres of the war. Weymouth and Portland were bombed by German planes in WorldWarII; Portland harbour {{had a large}} naval base, and Weymouth was home to Nothe Fort, next to Nothe Gardens. 517,816 troops embarked through the borough to fight at the Battle of Normandy. The <b>Bouncing</b> bomb was tested in the Fleet lagoon {{to the west of}} town. The history of the area was documented at the Timewalk museum in Brewers Quay.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerine {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large.

25|$|Another type of pass is the <b>bounce</b> pass. Here, the passer <b>bounces</b> {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and <b>bounces</b> up toward the receiver. The <b>bounce</b> pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the <b>bounce</b> pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|R

Bana required extensive {{damage to his}} teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace his mouth in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a rerecording session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded his lines so they could rotoscope his mouth into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the <b>bouncing</b> light created by the camp fire.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events have}} bonus stages that add to a player's score, {{even if it}} has already reached the maximum number. In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by falling into the water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, <b>bouncing</b> a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.|$|E
5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, <b>bouncing</b> {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E

5000|$|A common snare drum roll is {{the closed}} (or [...] "buzz" [...] or [...] "concert") roll. The concert roll is {{performed}} by creating 3 equal sounding <b>bounces</b> on each hand alternating right to left. The 3 <b>bounces</b> are {{made even more}} equivalent in sound by using the acoustic properties of the snare drum. Strokes closer to the rim will have a lower volume than strokes {{on or near the}} sweet spot of the drum. Therefore by placing the first of the 3 <b>bounces</b> closer to the rim and moving the second <b>bounce</b> towards the sweet spot and finally the third <b>bounce</b> in the sweet spot will produce three equal sounding <b>bounces.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pitches in Zimbabwe closely {{resemble}} those in South Africa.

Most pitches have slower <b>bounce,</b> hence batting is more favourable in Zimbabwe.|$|R
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound <b>bouncing</b> off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves <b>bouncing</b> around {{a room with a}} slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.|$|E
