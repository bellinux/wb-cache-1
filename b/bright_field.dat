5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the {{different levels of}} the game, the city viewed through the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played {{in a similar manner}} to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a person involved in the game appears above it. Flower includes PlayStation Network trophies in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many are centered on relaxing and watching the scenery.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparatively}} old {{globular cluster}} NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200light-years distant and somewhat obscured by dust clouds near the galactic plane. The globular cluster NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially obscured by dust, but spans more arc minutes. It is 18,900light-years away from Earth and 23,000light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> of stars. Another dark nebula in the constellation is BHR 71.|$|E

25|$|In digital {{holographic}} microscopy (DHM), interfering wave fronts from {{a coherent}} (monochromatic) light-source are recorded on a sensor. The image is digitally reconstructed {{by a computer}} from the recorded hologram. Besides the ordinary <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> image, a phase shift image is created.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bright</b> <b>field</b> {{microscopy}} is {{the simplest}} of all the light microscopy techniques. Sample illumination is via transmitted white light, i.e. illuminated from below and observed from above. Limitations include low contrast of most biological samples and low apparent resolution due to the blur of out-of-focus material. The simplicity of the technique and the minimal sample preparation required are significant advantages.|$|E
25|$|EELS spectrometers {{can often}} be {{operated}} in both spectroscopic and imaging modes, allowing for isolation or rejection of elastically scattered beams. As for many images inelastic scattering will include information {{that may not be}} of interest to the investigator thus reducing observable signals of interest, EELS imaging can be used to enhance contrast in observed images, including both <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> and diffraction, by rejecting unwanted components.|$|E

25|$|The use of oblique (from the side) {{illumination}} {{gives the}} image a three-dimensional (3D) appearance and can highlight otherwise invisible features. A more recent technique {{based on this}} method is Hoffmann's modulation contrast, a system found on inverted microscopes for use in cell culture. Oblique illumination suffers from the same limitations as <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> microscopy (low contrast of many biological samples; low apparent resolution due to out of focus objects).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Torbjörn Caspersson {{developed}} a quinicrine fluorescent staining technique (Q-banding) which revealed unique banding patterns for each chromosome pair. This allowed chromosome pairs of otherwise equal size to be differentiated by distinct horizontal banding patterns. Banding patterns are now used to elucidate the breakpoints and constituent chromosomes involved in chromosome translocations. Deletions and inversions within an individual chromosome {{can also be}} identified and described more precisely using standardized banding nomenclature. G-banding (utilizing trypsin and Giemsa/ Wright stain) was concurrently developed in the early 1970s and allows visualization of banding patterns using a <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> microscope.|$|E
25|$|Live {{cells in}} {{particular}} generally lack sufficient contrast {{to be studied}} successfully, since the internal structures of the cell are colorless and transparent. The most common way to increase contrast is to stain the different structures with selective dyes, but this often involves killing and fixing the sample. Staining may also introduce artifacts, which are apparent structural details that are caused by the processing of the specimen and are thus not legitimate features of the specimen. In general, these techniques make use of differences in the refractive index of cell structures. It is comparable to looking through a glass window: you (<b>bright</b> <b>field</b> microscopy) don't see the glass but merely the dirt on the glass. There is a difference, as glass is a denser material, and this creates a difference in phase of the light passing through. The human eye is not sensitive to this difference in phase, but clever optical solutions have been devised to change this difference in phase into a difference in amplitude (light intensity).|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} mode of {{operation}} for a TEM is the <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> imaging mode. In this mode the contrast formation comes from the sample having varying thickness or density. Thicker areas of the sample and denser areas or regions with a higher atomic number will block more electrons and appear dark in an image, while thinner, lower density, lower atomic number regions and areas with no sample in the beam path will appear bright. The term [...] "bright field" [...] refers to the bright background field {{where there is no}} sample and most of the beam electrons reach the image. The image is assumed to be a simple two dimensional projection of the sample's thickness and density down the optic axis, and to a first approximation may be modelled via Beer's law, more complex analyses require the modelling of the sample image to include phase information.|$|E

60|$|They {{had come}} out later than on the {{previous}} night; and the moon, already risen above the high walls of the garden, seemed a vast silver shield caught in the interlacing tops of the old pear-trees, whose branches crossed its <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> like dark bends or bars.
