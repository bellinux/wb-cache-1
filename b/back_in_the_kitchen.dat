5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
60|$|<b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> at home Mrs. Bell {{was waiting}} for her husband to bring the horse to the door. She was a slight, dark-eyed little woman, with thin, vivid-red cheeks. From out of the swathings in which she had wrapped her bonnet, her face gleamed sad and troubled. Now and then she sighed heavily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Bell again, {{and this}} time there was a tear in her eye. Sanders was little better than an [...] "orra man," [...] and Sam'l was a weaver, and yet---- But it was too late now. Sanders gave the pig a vicious poke with a stick, and when it had ceased to grunt, Bell was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> She had {{forgotten}} about the milk, however, and Sam'l only got water after all.|$|E
60|$|The {{ten minutes}} had barely passed when Sam'l was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farm <b>kitchen.</b> He was too flurried to knock this time, and, indeed, Lisbeth {{did not expect}} it of him.|$|R
60|$|However, {{he begged}} {{until at last}} he got leave to go, but {{he was forced to}} promise that he would be <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> when <b>the</b> roast had to be turned.|$|R

Jean {{had not been}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> for two minutes before she raised the blind. Her eyes were close to the glass, when she saw another face almost meet hers, as you may touch your reflection in a mirror. But this face was not her own. It was white and sad. Jean suppressed a cry, and let the blind fall, as if shutting the lid on some uncanny thing.|$|E
50|$|After a cup {{of coffee}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> Tildy reads Charity’s coffee grounds where she predicts a vision of what is in store for Charity’s future.

50|$|Ashton's Cinderella {{is his own}} {{realised}} {{dream of}} a Petipa ballet and the ballet itself enacts the realisation of dreams, notably Cinderella's own. When we first see her she is a demi-caractere dancer dreaming of being a ballerina—that {{seems to be the}} balletic point of her solo with the broomstick in the kitchen—and it is as a ballerina that she magically enters the ballroom, stepping en pointe down the stairs and advancing in pas de bourree {{to the front of the}} stage. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> she recalls the slipper (or rather the pointe shoe) that she carries in her apron; the shoe is the clue to her dream and persuades her it was true. The Prince finds Cinderella, but in his arms she discovers her own identity as a ballerina and her dream of herself has been realised. Cinderella's mice design the gown.|$|E

Eventually, Anne realizes that they can be killed by bananas, due to Sam being allergic to bananas. As a result, Jack would share the same vulnerabilities, since he absorbed some of Sam's genetics in Snowmonton. Everybody soon makes a big batch of banana smoothies, which they then use to kill the tiny snowmen. However, one of them crawls back to Jack, fatally wounded. Jack picks it up and observes it, and then watches it slowly die in his arms.|$|E

Now it's <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and he has another four tasks to complete. These objectives are common household chores easily done by humans, but with Octodad and the control scheme used, it can be more problematic. The main tasks are to clear the red counter of anything left on it, putting dishes into the sink, and then clearing out the fridge, as well as mopping the floor. These can be more problematic than the previous tasks, although when clearing the fridge, all items in the fridge within it can be left on the floor and be considered completed. Once all the objectives are complete, your wife hands Octodad the banana and the player must exit the kitchen to progress to the next mission.|$|E
