40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} both national and global welfare costs of <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on textiles and apparel using an applied {{general equilibrium model}} which covers <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on exports of textiles and apparel negotiated between three major developed importing countries (the US, Canada and the EEC) and 34 supplying developing countries under {{the provisions of the}} Multifibre Arrangement applying in mid- 1980 s (MFA 111).

This suggests that despite foregone rent transfers, developing countries would receive gains by eliminating the MFA. In the central variant analysis, all developing countries gain by eliminating tariff and MFA restrictions because, contrary to popular belief, the developing countries (including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan) are relatively small compared to developed countries even in apparel production. Rather than losing share to other developing countries under an MFA elimination, higher Income developing countries (like other developing countries) gain market share at the expense of reduced developed country production. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since the 1950 s, {{global trade}} in {{textiles}} and clothing has seen {{the evolution of a}} global system of <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> governing North-South trade in textiles and wearing apparel. As of 2005, these have been removed {{under the terms of the}} 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. In theory, the ATC was to have led to a smooth and progressive liberalization in the sector. In reality and especially when looking at trade flows from China, it appears that political leaders throughout the ATC period instead backloaded the problem of adjustment, delaying much of it until the very end of the ATC. In this paper, we explore econometrically the evolution of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sectors (T&C). Working with a panel of bilateral trade data on textile and clothing trade, underlying bilateral tariffs, and the coverage of quotas under the WTOs Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) we first develop an estimation framework for calculating the tax equivalents of ATC <b>quota</b> restrictions on <b>bilateral</b> trade. Within this framework, we track the price impact of the quotas through the ten year phase-out period. We also discuss a major concern of LDC exporters the impact of quota elimination on market access. Finally, as these quotas are a potentially significant omitted variable, the ATC episode provides us with an opportunity to examine the impact of <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on the econometric estimation of trade elasticities...|$|R
40|$|In October 2004 the European Union and the MERCOSUR {{tried to}} reach an {{agreement}} for creating what would be the world's largest free-trade area accounting for 650 millions people. But despite five years of bilateral work to strike a deal, the two parties stayed on ropes at their meeting in Portugal the 18 th of October 2004. The stumbling blocks are the MERCOSUR's demand for a greater access to EU's agricultural markets and the EU's demand for expanded access for industrial goods, services and investments. Though, both partners made great efforts to comply with each other requests, it wasn't enough. In this paper we are interested in the possible last EU's offer to enlarge access to its market through the allocation of <b>bilateral</b> tariff-rate <b>quotas</b> for some MERCOSUR's agricultural products namely corn, wheat, beef, poultry, swine and dairy products. Following the methodology of Elbehri and Pearson (Elbehri and R. 2000) we model <b>bilateral</b> tariff-rate <b>quotas</b> in GTAP using GEMPACK. We then, carry out our simulation to estimate the potential effects of expanding the MERCOSUR's access to these EU's markets.

40|$|Rapid {{industrialization}} in East Asia, particularly China, {{is raising}} questions about who will feed {{the region in the}} next century and how Asia will pay for its food imports. The paper addresses this question by first reviewing existing food sector projections and then taking an economy-wide perspective using projections to 2005, based on the global CGE model known as GTAP. After showing the impact of implementing the Uruguay Round, the paper explores the effects of slower global agricultural productivity growth and of slower economic growth in China. Several policy shocks are also examined. They include the entry of China (and hence Taiwan) into the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the failure to fully abolish the <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> on textiles and clothing trade as promised under the Uruguay Round. A slow-down in farm productivity growth could be very costly to the world economy, as could slower economic growth in China. Failure to honour Uruguay Round obligations to open textile and clothing markets in OECD countries is shown to reduce East Asia’s industrialization and thereby slow its net imports of food. On the other hand, the trade reform that is likely to accompany China’s WTO membership would greatly benefit the economies of China and the world. It would boost exports of manufactures and strengthen food import demand, not only by China, but also its densely populated neighbours with whom its intra- and inter-industry trade in manufactures would intensify.

40|$|Emphasizing the {{importance}} of evaluating the Uruguay Round {{in the context of}} a changing world economy, the authors base their projections on a model that incorporates certain economic shifts: 1) that the center of economic gravity will shift toward the South and toward Asia (a shift that is already under way and shows no signs of abating), and 2) that the pattern of comparative advantage will continue to change, with the East Asian economies gaining comparative advantage in the production of physical and human-capital-intensive products. The authors argue that these changes in the global economy significantly affect their analysis of the Uruguay round reforms, for two reasons. First, with the global distribution of trade and production shifting toward Asia, the deeper Uruguay Round cuts inthat region become more important, giving rise to a 17 percent increase in the proportionate welfare gain after implementation of tariff cuts. Second, without the Round, almost all of the <b>bilateral</b> <b>quotas</b> associated with the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) would have become more binding and the resulting distortion would have been significantly greater. In this analysis, the global gain from MFA reform is 60 percent greater than it would have been without taking into account the effects of growth. Of course, procedures for implementation of the MFA reforms are more complex than they have conveyed for purposes of analysis. In practice, one must also consider the impact of accel quota growth under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. But even when the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing is implemented over the period for which projections were made, quota rents rise for many bilateral flows. This is a consequence both of shifts in comparative advantage toward the supplying countries and of simultaneous cuts in tariffs on textiles and clothing. The projections approach used here may be viewed as a logical extension of the growing econometric literature seeking to explain the determinants of economic growth through regression analysis. By offering a bridge between econometric evidence and computable general equilibrium modeling, the authors hope to combine the two approaches to help shed light on the interaction between trade reform and economic growth.

40|$|Since the mid-eighties Austria has {{attempted}} to slow the growth in trans-boundary trucking. The number of trucking permits which is regulated in <b>bilateral</b> treaties (<b>quotas)</b> is increased only slowly, the permitted number of transit trips of trucks registered in Austria and in the EU was capped at the 1991 level in Austria's transit treaty with the EU. This change in road transport policy already {{can be seen in}} the statistics of trans-boundary trucking. While the volume of shipments increased by an average of 3 percent p. a., the number of road trips has remained constant for the last five years. As a result rail transport gained significant market shares. Austria's restrictive quota policy with respect to trucking permits has already caused occasional capacity bottlenecks. It is expected that the EU internal market and the opening up of reform countries will lead to a significant increase in international commodity transport in Austria. This will lead to an increasing shortage in road transport <b>quotas</b> (<b>bilateral</b> permits, eco points). They will be in high demand by trucking firms, since transport rates will increase as a result of scarce supply. In the past permits have been distributed free of charge according to the "established interest" rule: firms which already in the past had carried out regular transport activities to or through the respective partner countries have received priority treatment. When firms change hands, transport permits are transferred to the new owner. This practice leads to the result that these "quasi-automatic permits" play a major role in the valuation of trucking firms. In this way the road transport business has come to be dominated by a number of firms which have been in the business for a long time. It was nearly impossible for new dynamic firms to enter the market. In general, this lack of competition leads to low efficiency. One way to determine who is the most efficient user of a permit would be to auction off the permits. A firm which expects to obtain higher profit from a permit than its competitors would be willing to offer a higher price. The auction mechanism could be a uniform price procedure with the rent going to the public hand. These auction revenues could be used to finance measures to reduce environmental damages caused by trucks.

40|$|There {{are several}} factors favouring a {{prominent}} role for Japan in a future North-east Asian maritime regime for fisheries and the environment: its economic and technological dominance, its knowledge and experience, its web of bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries, and its lack of the political dichotomies which hamper China and Korea. Leadership of such a regime might benefit Japan by delaying the implementation of EEZs by China and South Korea and the escalation of boundary disputes which would inevitably result. Benefits would also include conservation of fisheries resources, protection of the environment, elimination of the transaction costs and frustration entailed in annual <b>bilateral</b> fishing <b>quota</b> negotiations, and enhancement of Japan's status in the region. However, for the foreseeable future, there are strong factors mitigating against Japan assuming a leadership role. Internationally, the Kurile Islands dispute, the memories of Japan's expansionist wars, and Japan's propensity for placing economic gain above all else constrain its regional leadership possibilities. Bureaucratic inertia, resulting from the need for consensus among Japan's many domestic political entities forces Japan into a reactive rather than proactive role when maintenance {{of the status quo}} becomes no longer tenable. Nevertheless, the rapidly increasing density of unilateral, bilateral and multilateral pronouncements and agreements involving Japan show a distinct trend towards a nation which is becoming more comfortable with a larger role in the region. ...|$|R
40|$|International {{trade in}} apparel and {{textiles}} is regulated {{by a system}} of <b>bilateral</b> tariffs and <b>quotas</b> known as the Multifiber Arrangement or MFA. Using a time series of detailed product-level data from the United States on the quotas and tariffs that comprise the MFA, we analyze how the MFA affects the sources and prices of US apparel imports, with a particular focus on the effects on East Asian exporters during the 1990 s. We show that while a large fraction of US apparel is imported under binding quotas, there are many quotas that remain unfilled. We also show that binding quotas substantially raise import prices, suggesting both quality upgrading and rent capture by exporters. In contrast, tariffs reduce import prices. Lastly, we argue that the substantial shift of US apparel imports away from Asia in favor of Mexico and the Caribbean during the 1990 s is only partly due to discriminatory trade policy: the other reason is an increasing demand for timely delivery that gives a competitive advantage to nearby exporters. ...|$|R

Abstract Explicit modeling of tariff rate quotas (TRQs) is important in the current World Trade Organization negotiations. In order to do such modeling with GTAP, extra data is required and extra equations must be added to the model. This paper provides tools for assisting modelers to carry out explicit modeling of <b>bilateral</b> tariff rate <b>quotas</b> in GTAP using GEMPACK. The paper describes how the extra data for sugar TRQ applications was obtained and reconciled with the standard GTAP data. Supplied with the paper is a TABLO Input file TRQDATA. TAB which others can use for reconciling their TRQ data with the usual GTAP data. Supplied with the paper is a module which can be added to the standard TABLO Input files for GTAP. This module contains the extra equations required to model TRQs. Detailed hands-on examples are supplied with the paper, as is a TRQ application relating to a partial liberalization of sugar TRQ. Readers of the paper can replicate these applications. A windows interface TRQmate is supplied with the paper. This is a relatively general-purpose interface which automates the steps in carrying out TRQ applications with GTAP and GEMPACK. If you wish to carry out your own bilateral TRQ applications with GTAP and GEMPACK, the tools supplied with this paper will make it relatively straightforward for you to do so once you have collected the extra data you need. ...|$|R
40|$|Trade {{policy is}} defined at the tariff line. Yet most {{analyses}} of trade liberalization are conducted {{at a much}} more aggregated level. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are universally susceptible {{to the problem of}} policy aggregation. Moreover, these models become increasingly irrelevant as policy negotiations intensify into sensitive sectors. At this level of detail, countries employ a mix of standard and nonstandard policies at very disaggregate levels, which are not well represented in current CGE analyses. ^ Further commitments to liberalize trade in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) will be implemented at the tariff line. Hence, from a practical standpoint, it is important that future CGE-based analyses be able to accurately represent trade policy options at this level. The purpose of this thesis is to extend CGE analysis to the tariff line in selected sectors by developing a detailed, econometrically estimated, tariff line sub-sector model and embedding this in a global CGE framework. In doing so, this thesis will improve our understanding of the effects of agricultural border policies that are defined and negotiated at the tariff line. ^ A case-study approach is adopted focusing on the heavily protected U. S. dairy sector which contains a number of tariff-rate quotas, complex administration methods, high Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs and preferentially applied tariff rates. A mixed-complementarity formulated sub-sector model calibrated to 2001 policy levels in U. S. dairy represents bilateral and multilateral trade policy at the tariff line. Equilibrium outcomes in the sub-sector model are iteratively introduced in a modified CGE model tracking liberalization results from dairy reforms. The analysis examines a comprehensive set of TRQ reform options viz á viz over-quota tariff reductions, quota expansion, simultaneous liberalization as well as competition for and expansion of the global, MFN quota. ^ The results suggest that the path of dairy trade liberalization in the U. S. economy is quite different depending on the reform approach undertaken, particularly when both MFN and country-specific quotas are incorporated into the analysis. This study is {{the first of its kind}} to showcase this interaction between <b>bilateral</b> and MFN <b>quota</b> administration in a quantitative framework. ...|$|R
