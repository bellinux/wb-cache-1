40|$|Extraction {{of frozen}} canine cardiac muscle {{rendered}} soluble over 90 % of the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity. The residual activity was membrane-bound. Ion exchange chromatography of the soluble activity on DE- 52 {{allowed for the}} resolution of three distinct cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase fractions termed PDE-I, PDE-II and PDE-III in order of elution from the column by a linear NaCl gradient. The relative ratio of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity exhibited by these three peaks was 1 : 0. 65 : 0. 82 and of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity was 1 : 0. 52 : 0. 05 for PDE-I, PDE-II and PDE-III respectively. PDE-II and PDE-III were further purified by re-chromatography on DE- 52. Fractions PDE-II and PDE-III were thermolabile at 50 degrees, decaying as single exponentials with half lives of 180 sec and 77 sec respectively. All three species exhibited non-linear Lineweaver-Burke plots for the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP, exhibiting both high and low affinity components. Hydrolysis of cyclic GMP by all three components obeyed normal kinetics, yielding linear plots. PDE-I was a Ca 2 +/calmodulin-activated species which exhibited a low Km for both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP but hydrolysed cyclic GMP with a higher Vmax than for cyclic AMP. PDE-II exhibited a much lower Km for cyclic AMP than for cyclic GMP and a much higher Vmax for the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP. PDE-III exhibited a low Km for both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, however, its Vmax for cyclic AMP was about 40 -fold higher than for cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP acted as a potent inhibitor (IC 50 = 6. 3 microM) of cyclic AMP hydrolysis catalysed by PDE-III but not of the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP by PDE-II (IC 50 = 33. 2 microM). The phosphodiesterase inhibitors milrinone, CI- 930, UK- 35, 493, carbazeran and <b>buquineran</b> acted as potent inhibitors of cyclic AMP hydrolysis catalysed by both PDE-II and PDE-III enzymes. They did not inhibit PDE-I activity. PDE-II, when prepared {{in the absence of}} protease inhibitors exhibited a reduced potency to inhibition by these compounds. Treatment of purified PDE-II with trypsin caused a reduction in enzyme activity and reduced dramatically the sensitivity of PDE-II activity to inhibition by these various compounds. The action of proteolysis in attenuating the inhibitory effect of these compounds on PDE-II was most dramatic with CI- 930, milrinone, amrinone, <b>buquineran</b> and UK 35, 493 and least dramatic with carbazeran and IBMX...|$|E
