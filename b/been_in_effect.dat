5|$|On September 12, WWE {{confirmed}} {{they had}} sent Hardy {{home from a}} European tour. Following this, Hardy began posting videos on his YouTube channel expressing his disinterest in the WWE product and insisting {{that he wanted to}} be released from the company. On October 15, 2010, WWE announced that Hardy had been released from his contract. Hardy later stated that his release had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> two weeks before WWE made the announcement.|$|E
5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, the New York Daily News {{reported}} that Bonds had {{tested positive for}} amphetamines. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players {{were not to be}} identified for a first positive test, but the New York Daily News leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate Mark Sweeney, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's triumph marked {{their fifth}} European Cup {{and the first}} by an English team since Manchester United had {{defeated}} Bayern Munich in the 1999 final in Barcelona. By winning the European Cup for a fifth time, Liverpool earned the privilege of wearing a multiple-winner badge {{and the right to}} keep the trophy (under normal competition rules, the winning club can keep the trophy for only 10 months, as they must deliver it to UEFA two months before the next year's final). The 2005–06 participants competed for a new identical trophy. The rule to keep the trophy, which had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> since the 1968–69 season, was changed for the 2009–10 season, so that the actual trophy remained with UEFA at all times, thus Liverpool was the fifth and last club to accomplish the feat.|$|E
5|$|One of Combs' first {{official}} actions as governor {{was to call}} a special session of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting {{the issue of a}} convention on the ballot in two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by legal scholars that the constitution was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special legislative session. The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special legislative session and again during the subsequent regular legislative session in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on the ballot in November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.|$|E

25|$|By 1982, the {{perceived}} passivity of the FARC, {{together with the}} relative success of the government's efforts against the M-19 and ELN, enabled {{the administration of the}} Liberal Party's Julio César Turbay Ayala (1978–82) to lift a state-of-siege decree that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect,</b> on and off, for most of the previous 30 years. Under the latest such decree, president Turbay had implemented security policies that, though of some military value against the M-19 in particular, were considered highly questionable both inside and outside Colombian circles due to numerous accusations of military human rights abuses against suspects and captured guerrillas.|$|E
25|$|In modern North Germanic languages, the {{adjectival}} form svensk and its plural svenskar {{have replaced}} the name svear and is, today, used to denote all the citizens of Sweden. The distinction between the tribal Swedes (svear) and modern Swedes (svenskar) appears to have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> by the early 20th century, when Nordisk familjebok noted that svenskar had almost replaced svear as {{a name for the}} Swedish people. Although this distinction is convention in modern Norwegian, Danish and Swedish, Icelandic and Faroese do not distinguish between svíar (Icelandic) or sviar (Faroese) and sænskir (Icelandic) or svenskarar (Faroese) as words for modern Swedes.|$|E

A large scale population shift had also <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect</b> since the conflict began, with most of the Armenians living in Azerbaijan fleeing to Armenia and the Azerbaijanis in Armenia to Azerbaijan. The battle was preceded by the controversial capture of the town and the location of Karabakh's only airport in Khojaly by Armenians in February 1992. With the loss of Khojaly, Azeri commanders concentrated the rest of their firepower upon Stepanakert, which Shusha overlooked.|$|E
25|$|A second theory proposes an {{autochthonous}} development out of {{the local}} Mesolithic cultures. Although the Starčevo-Körös entered southern Hungary about 6000 BC and the LBK spread very rapidly, {{there appears to be}} a hiatus of up to 500 years in which a barrier seems to have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>effect.</b> Moreover, the cultivated species of the near and middle eastern Neolithic do not do well over the Linear Pottery culture range. And finally, the Mesolithics in the region prior to the LBK used some domestic species, such as wheat and flax. The La Hoguette culture on the northwest of the LBK range developed their own food production from native plants and animals.|$|E
