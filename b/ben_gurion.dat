5|$|When Sde Dov does close, its {{military}} terminal would be relocated to the Palmachim Airbase and civilian activities would be relocated to <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport. With capacity at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> projected {{to reach a}} maximum {{over the next few}} decades however, the concept of building an airport offshore in the Tel Aviv region may yet be revived in the future. Sde Dov itself is operating near to capacity, however, with annual passenger movements around 700,000 and a potential capacity of 950,000.|$|E
5|$|This act {{signaled}} {{the climax of}} the capture of the Old City and the ability of Jews to once again access their holiest sites. Emotional recollections of this event are related by David <b>ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> and Shimon Peres.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main problem at {{the airport is}} the lack of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Willie Walsh {{advised the}} airline would {{continue}} to use flight paths over Iraq despite the hostilities there. A few days earlier Qantas announced it would avoid Iraqi airspace, while other airlines did likewise. The issue arose following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, and a temporary suspension of flights to and from <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{airport is}} the <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport in Lod, Israel, {{but because of}} {{restrictions}} governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their {{lack of access to}} foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to Amman, Jordan to use the Queen Alia International Airport, which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} 1972. The Fatah subgroup Black September hijacked Sabena Flight 572 {{en route to}} Vienna and forced it to land at the <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport in Lod, Israel. The PFLP and the Japanese Red Army carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport, killing twenty-four civilians. Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan Kanafani {{was a response to}} the PFLP's involvement in masterminding the latter attack. Two days later, various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station, killing eleven civilians.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1948 war the Arab {{orchards}} to {{the east}} of Tel Aviv were opened for development, and the military started using the Sde Dov airport on a regular basis. The airport regained its commercial operations, initially serving domestic flights, mostly to single customers, on Piper Cub aircraft. It later expanded operations to scheduled service on larger aircraft to various parts of Israel. As a result of the land availability, an additional, northsouth, runway was built with no opposition. By 1960, land in Tel Aviv became scarce, and the municipality demanded that the airport be relocated northward, so as to allow residential development in its place. However, a committee that investigated in 1961 the options for such a relocation found no feasible site in proximity to Tel Aviv and suggested that flights be moved to Lod airport (now known as <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport), and that road access from Tel Aviv to Lod be improved. This option, however, was blocked by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|Eilat Airport was {{established}} in 1949 by the Israel Air Force, following the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. During its early years, the airport aimed to establish a comprehensive set of connections to towns across the country, most notably with Tel Aviv and Haifa. Consequently, a regular route from Eilat to Lod Airport (now <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport) was started. Soon after, a route to Haifa Airport became operational. In December 1950, following their establishment, Arkia Israel Airlines became the largest domestic operator at Eilat Airport, taking {{the position of the}} former companies Eilata and Aviron. To this day, they retain this position. Later, in 1964 the runway was expanded to 1500m, and a passenger terminal was built. Five years later, the runway was further expanded increasing the length to 1900m. In 1975, Eilat Airport started to attract Scandinavian airlines. The first international flight arrival to Eilat, of the Danish airline, Sterling Airlines landed in this year. Since then, many international routes have been established directly linking Eilat with Europe, however, the airport is still unable to handle landings of large aircraft which have to fly to Uvda International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate the Negev. <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion,</b> on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the number}} of Bedouin {{students}} in Israel is on the rise. Arabic summer schools are being developed. In 2006, 162 Bedouin men and 112 Bedouin women were studying at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> University. In particular, {{the number of}} female students grew sixfold from 1996-2001. The university offers special Bedouin scholarship programs to encourage higher education among the Bedouin. In 2013, there were 350 Bedouin women and 150 Bedouin men studying at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> University.|$|E
25|$|The airport's {{name was}} changed from Lod to <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport in 1973 to honour Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport is {{considered}} to be among the five best airports in the Middle East due to its passenger experience and its high level of security. Security forces such as Israel Police officers, IDF and Israel Border Police soldiers are complemented by airport security guards who operate both in uniform and undercover. The airport has been the target of several terrorist attacks, but no attempt to hijack a plane departing from <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> airport has succeeded.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport {{has been}} a target of Palestinian attacks, the {{adoption}} of strict security precautions has ensured that no aircraft departing from <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> airport has ever been hijacked. On the other hand, airliners hijacked from other countries have landed at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion,</b> contributing to two major incidents in the airport's history. In the first, on 8 May 1972, four Palestinian Black September terrorists hijacked a Sabena flight en route from Vienna and forced it to land at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> airport. Sayeret Matkal commandos led by Ehud Barak stormed the plane, killing two of the hijackers and capturing the other two. One passenger was killed. Later that month, on 30 May 1972, in an attack known as the Lod Airport Massacre, 24 {{people were killed and}} 80 injured when three members of the Japanese Red Army sprayed machine gun fire into the passenger arrival area. The victims included Aharon Katzir, a prominent protein biophysicist and brother of Israel's 4th president. Those injured included Efraim Katzir and a group of twenty Puerto Rican tourists who had just arrived in Israel. The only terrorist who survived was Kozo Okamoto, who received a life sentence but was set free in a prisoner exchange with the PFLP-GC.|$|E
25|$|Israel's main {{international}} airport, <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport (previously {{known as}} Lydda Airport, RAF Lydda, and Lod Airport) {{is located on}} the outskirts of the city.|$|E
25|$|In June 2001, one of Israir's ATR 42-320 {{aircraft}} was {{damaged beyond repair}} following a heavy landing at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> Airport. Despite the aircraft being written off, no passengers were injured in this incident.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, an Israir Airlines {{aircraft}} {{flew from}} Eilat Airport to <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport {{with a small}} hole in its frame. The hole was discovered by mechanics at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> {{and there is an}} ongoing probe {{as to whether or not}} Israir knew of the hole, which, as it turns out, was caused by Israir workers in Eilat when they crashed a mobile staircase into the aircraft's body. The plane was scheduled to fly to Italy from Tel Aviv, and at an altitude of over 10,000 meters, the plane would most likely have experienced a decompression, possibly explosive, and could have resulted in injuries or fatalities.|$|E
25|$|On 26 May 1948, Prime Minister David <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> officially {{set up the}} IDF as the country's army. On 18 August 1948, {{mandatory}} conscription {{for single}} and married women without children (born between the years 1920-1930) began.|$|E

25|$|In December 2006, <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport ranked {{first among}} 40 European {{airports}} and 8th out of 77 airports in the world, in a survey, conducted by Airports Council International, {{to determine the}} most customer-friendly airport. Tel Aviv placed second in the grouping of airports which carry between 5 and 15 million passengers per year behind Japan's Nagoya Airport. The survey consisted of 34 questions. A random sampling of 350 passengers at the departure gate were asked how satisfied they were with the service, infrastructure and facilities. <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> received a rating of 3.94 out of 5, followed by Vienna, Munich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, Copenhagen and Helsinki. The airport retained its title as the best Middle Eastern airport in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 surveys.|$|E
25|$|Adelson owns a {{fleet of}} private jets through Las Vegas Sands. On January 2, 2017 Adelson's Airbus A340-500 jet set a record for the <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport by making the longest flight ever leaving the airport by flying nonstop to Honolulu, Hawaii {{by way of the}} Arctic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, the Israeli {{government}} decided to hire Evergreen's Boeing 747 Supertanker to help extinguish the blaze. The plane landed at 01:00 at <b>Ben</b> <b>Gurion</b> International Airport. The plane {{took off and}} at about 11:00 it released its first cargo of water.
