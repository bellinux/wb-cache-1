5|$|The finance {{ministry}} {{started the}} budget preparation process by preparing instructions, forms and schedules {{for the upcoming}} state budget and prepared a preliminary balance of revenues and expenditures using data estimated by the State Planning Committee (Gosplan). This preliminary budget was then sent, together with instructions, to the all-Union ministries and ministries of finance of the Union's republics. The Union branches of the Ministry of Finance then prepared a <b>budget</b> <b>estimate</b> with information received from the lower Union ministries and information given {{to them by the}} all-Union Ministry of Finance. The state budget was conceived after the Union Ministry negotiated a compromise with its republican and local branches and each Soviet republic was given its own state budget. The Economic Committees of the Supreme Soviet voted on the state budget which, if it received enough support, would become policy.|$|E
25|$|Corman {{financed the}} picture, {{serving as the}} film's uncredited Executive Producer. The budget was $75,000. Shooting began on April 15, 1965, with a {{production}} crew consisting of only seven individuals. During {{the first two days}} of the production, actual shooting was extremely limited due to near-constant rain which caused severe flooding in the areas they had planned to shoot. Hellman estimated that $5,000 of the already small budget was eaten up by the wasted time. Another $10,000 of the budget was for the horse wranglers' salaries, the only union element of the film, apart from the actors. Corman's deal with Hellman and Nicholson was that if the film went over budget, any additional costs would come out of their own pockets. Despite the initial problems, the film was completed for the original <b>budget</b> <b>estimate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early {{technical}} {{delays and}} project management issues caused the DOE {{to begin a}} comprehensive [...] "Rebaseline Validation Review of the National Ignition Facility Project" [...] in 2000, which took a critical look at the project, identifying areas of concern and adjusting the schedule and budget to ensure completion. John Gordon, National Nuclear Security Administrator, stated [...] "We have prepared a detailed bottom-up cost and schedule to complete the NIF project... The independent review supports our position that the NIF management team has made significant progress and resolved earlier problems". The report revised their <b>budget</b> <b>estimate</b> to $2.25billion, not including related R which pushed it to $3.3billion total, and pushed back the completion date to 2006 with the first lines coming online in 2004. A follow-up report the next year included all of these items, pushing the budget to $4.2 billion, and the completion date to around 2008.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of appropriation bills into the Parliament, the expenditure proposed in those bills is referred to Senate legislation committees for inquiry.

40|$|In road asset management, {{knowledge}} of current condition {{and understanding of}} deterioration rates of pavement strength is essential input parameter for estimating fund allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation work. However, the cost of collecting data on road pavement strength is relatively high. In a previous pilot study, a procedure was developed for optimising longitudinal sampling intervals for collection of pavement strength data for use in network level of road asset management for the State of Queensland, Australia. The findings indicated that pavement strength data could be collected at 1000 -meter intervals rather than at 200 -meter intervals for a tropical region of northeast Queensland, Australia. This paper {{presents the results of}} the continuing research to assess the reliability of the usage of the 1000 -metre interval pavement strength data in predicting <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> for road maintenance and rehabilitation at the network level. In the reliability assessment, the 95 th percentile <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> were compared with the <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> calculated from 1000 -metre interval pavement strength data. The results indicated that the differences between the 95 th percentile <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> and the <b>budgets</b> <b>estimated</b> from the 1000 -metre interval pavement strength data were less than four per cent for 10 -, 15 -, 20 - and 25 -year <b>budget</b> <b>estimates,</b> and were approximately 12. 25 per cent for 5 -year periods...|$|R

40|$|Queensland Department of Main Roads, Australia, spends {{approximately}} A 1 {{billion annually}} for road infrastructure asset management. To effectively manage road infrastructure, firstly road agencies not {{only need to}} optimise the expenditure for data collection, {{but at the same}} time, not jeopardise the reliability in using the optimised data to predict maintenance and rehabilitation costs. Secondly, road agencies need to accurately predict the deterioration rates of infrastructures to reflect local conditions so that the <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> could be accurately estimated. And finally, the prediction of budgets for maintenance and rehabilitation must provide a certain degree of reliability. This paper presents the results of case studies in using the probability-based method for an integrated approach (i. e. assessing optimal costs of pavement strength data collection; calibrating deterioration prediction models that suit local condition and assessing risk-adjusted <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> for road maintenance and rehabilitation for assessing life-cycle <b>budget</b> <b>estimates).</b> The probability concept is opening the path to having the means to predict life-cycle maintenance and rehabilitation <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> that have a known probability of success (e. g. produce <b>budget</b> <b>estimates</b> for a project life-cycle cost with 5...|$|R
