50|$|The device {{described}} in World War II patent works as follows: The shell contains a micro-transmitter which uses the shell body as an antenna and emits a continuous wave of roughly 180-220 MHz. As the shell approaches a reflecting object, an interference pattern is created. This pattern changes with shrinking distance: every half wavelength in distance (a half wavelength at this frequency is about 0.7 meters), the transmitter is {{in or out}} of resonance. This causes a small cycling of the radiated power and consequently the oscillator supply current of about 200-800 Hz, the Doppler frequency. This signal is sent through a <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter,</b> amplified, and triggers the detonation when it exceeds a given amplitude.|$|E

5000|$|KZFT filter is {{design for}} a {{reconstruction}} of periodic signals or seasonality covered by heavy noise. Seasonality {{is one of the}} key forms of nonstationarity that is often seen in time series. It is usually defined as the periodic components within the time series. Spectral analysis is a powerful tool to analyze time series with seasonality. If a process is stationary, its spectrum is a continuous form as well. It can be treated parametrically for simplicity of prediction. If a spectrum contains lines, it indicates that the process is not stationary and contains periodicities. In this situation, parametric fitting generally results in seasonal residuals with reduced energies. This is due to the season to season variations. To avoid this problem, nonparametric approaches including band pass filters are recommended. [...] Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Fourier Transform (KZFT) is one of such filters. The purpose of many applications is to reconstruct high resolution wavelet from the noisy environment. It was proven that KZFT provides the best possible resolution in spectral domain. It permits the separation of two signals on the edge of a theoretically smallest distance, or reconstruct periodic signals covered by heavy noise and irregularly observed in time. Because of this, KZFT provides a unique opportunity for various applications. A computer algorithm to implement the KZFT has been provided in the R software. The KZFT is essentially a <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> that belongs to the category of Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a unique time window.|$|E

50|$|TIMBRE 1/2OSC1/OSC2/NOISEOSC1 (Oscillator 1) {{allows one}} to select from eight {{different}} oscillator algorithms, including basic analog synthesizer waveforms such as SAW and PWM, Cross Modulation, and Korg's proprietary DWGS (Digital Waveform Generator System) originally developed for the Korg DW-8000 synthesizer. A signal such as a mic, instrument or line input from the AUDIO IN 1/2 jacks can also be processed.OSC2 (Oscillator 2) {{allows one to}} select from three types: SAW, SQU, and TRI. It {{can also be used}} as an oscillator for the Sync or Ring modulation.NOISE (Noise Generator) produces white noise which can be used for sound effects and introducing harmonic distortions to waveforms. The 64 single-cycle, wavetable-like internal waveforms {{that can be used in}} the oscillator 1. Taken from mid-80's Korg DW-8000 synthesizer, these waveforms allow the creation of bell and electric piano-like sounds. Also, ring modulation and sync are available as modulation sources to generate sweep and vintage lead sounds.MIXERUsed for adjusting the levels of OSC1, OSC2 and NOISE. The combined signal is then sent to the FILTER.FILTERThe FILTER cuts or emphasizes frequency components of the signal from the oscillator, affecting tone and brightness. Three primary types of filtering are available: -12 or -24 dB/oct LPF (Low Pass Filter), -12 dB/oct BPF (<b>Band</b> <b>Pass</b> <b>Filter),</b> or -12 dB/oct HPF (High Pass Filter). Using EG1 to create time-variant changes in cutoff frequency adds a fourth type of filtering.AMPThe AMP stage consists of AMP (Amplifier), DIST (Distortion), and PAN (Panpot). AMP sets the volume, and PAN sets the sound's location in the stereo field. Using EG2 can create time-variant changes in volume. Quite harsh tones can be created by turning DIST on, and adjusting the filter cutoff and resonance, higher-pitched rings and tonalities are created with various harmonics layered on.EG1/2The Envelope Generator applies a time-variant change to each timbre parameter. On the MS2000/MS2000R, there are two standard ADSR EG’s for each timbre. EG1 is assigned as the envelope source that produces time variant changes in the FILTER cutoff frequency, while EG2 is assigned as the envelope source that produces time variant changes in the AMP volume. The MS2000's VIRTUAL PATCH module can be used to assign EG1 and EG2 to other parameters. LFO 1/2The LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) applies cyclic change to sound parameters. The MS2000/MS2000R provides two LFO’s for each timbre, each with four waveforms. LFO1 is assigned as the modulation source for OSC1. LFO2 is assigned as the modulation source for the pitch modulation controlled by the modulation wheel. As with the EG's, VIRTUAL PATCH can be used to assign LFO1 and LFO2 to other parameters.VIRTUAL PATCHVIRTUAL PATCH allows the use of not only EG or LFO, but even keyboard velocity (keyboard playing dynamics) or keyboard tracking (the area of the keyboard that is played) as modulation sources which can be assigned to sound parameters for greater freedom in timbre editing and sound creating. Four routings (combinations) can be specified for each timbre.MOD SEQUENCEMOD SEQUENCE is a step sequencer that lets you apply time-variant change to various sound parameters in a way similar to analog synthesizers of the past. The sixteen knobs on the main panel can be used to set the value of each step and then the sequence is played back. The sound can be further modulated by the arpeggiator and by VIRTUAL PATCH. The knobs can also be operated in realtime, and their movements (parameter values) recorded in each step (Motion Rec function). Since each timbre can have up to three sequences, very complex tonal changes can be obtained.|$|E
