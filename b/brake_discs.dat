5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on the No. 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an oil pressure sensor failure and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in the No. 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned in the gravel at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back to the garage for repairs to its front-left corner. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning the No. 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at the Porsche Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E

25|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>discs</b> and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

25|$|For {{automotive}} use, disc <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> {{are commonly}} manufactured {{out of a}} material called grey iron. The SAE maintains a specification for the manufacture of grey iron for various applications. For normal car and light-truck applications, SAE specification J431 G3000 (superseded to G10) dictates the correct range of hardness, chemical composition, tensile strength, and other properties necessary for the intended use. Some racing cars and airplanes use brakes with carbon fiber discs and carbon fiber pads to reduce weight. Wear rates tend to be high, and braking may be poor or grabby until the brake is hot.|$|E
25|$|The discs are {{commonly}} made from cast iron {{and a certain}} amount of surface rust is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.|$|E

25|$|In {{racing and}} very-high-performance road cars, other disc {{materials}} have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking {{systems such as}} those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon–carbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing unsprung weight, giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid 1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use.

The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from the engine block to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine.
