40|$|Using panel data on six Chinese {{manufacturing}} industries {{over the}} period 2005 – 2007, this article explores the interrelationship among foreign presence, domestic sales and export intensity of local firms. We find that the domestic sales and exports are complementary for local firms in China’s pharmaceutical industry, whereas {{in the case of}} the textile, transportation <b>equipment,</b> <b>beverage,</b> communication <b>equipment</b> and general equipment manufacturing industries, domestic sales and exports are substitutes. An increase in the average domestic sales increases foreign presence in all industries. The same applies to an increase in the average export intensity. An increase in the level of competition in China’s textile industry increases the export intensity as well as domestic sales of local textile firms. However, an increase in the level of competition in the pharmaceutical industry leads to a very large decrease in export intensity of local pharmaceutical firms. In the case of China’s transportation equipment manufacturing industry, an increase in the level of competition decreases domestic sales of local firms. Furthermore, an increase in the firm size increases domestic sales of Chinese firms in all six manufacturing industries...|$|R

40|$|Based on a dataset of {{manufacturing}} sectors from five major European economies (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) between 2000 and 2011, we identify {{a number of}} key sector-level features that, according to established economic research, {{have a positive impact on}} the likelihood of collusion. Each feature is proxied by an "Antitrust Risk Indicator" (ARI). We rank the sectors according to their ARI scores. At 2 -digit level, sectors that appears more exposed to collusion risk are those that tend to score high in most of the ARIs: Tobacco, Pharmaceuticals, Beverages, Chemicals. The 4 -digit analysis suggests higher anticompetitive risk in Tobacco products, Spirits, Sugar, Railway Locomotives and Aircraft (high concentration and fixed costs), Coating of Metals and Printing (low import penetration), Tobacco products, Meat products, Footwear and Clothing (high market stability), Plastic products and Spinning/Weaving of textiles (high symmetry of market leaders). We then rank sectors according to the distribution of antitrust intervention by the European Commission between 2000 and 2013, in terms of merger control and anti-cartel enforcement. Tobacco, Paper and paper products, Pharmaceuticals and Food products are the sectors for which a notified merger has a greater likelihood of being deemed problematic by the Commission. There has been a greater incidence of anti-cartel action in Chemicals, Tobacco, <b>Beverages,</b> Electric <b>equipment</b> and Rubber and plastic. Antitrust investigations are based on the identification of narrow product markets. The characteristics of these markets are not necessarily well represented by average measures at sector level. Nevertheless, a simple comparison exercise shows that the European Commission's interventions have been largely consistent with sector rankings based on market concentration...|$|R

40|$|Industrial cluster {{approach}} as an development {{strategy has been}} adopted nationally {{and continues to be}} strengthened in recent years. National Development Programme of 2003 mandated the {{cluster approach}} in the development of small and medium industries. Presidential Regulation No. 07 of 2005 states that national industrial development focused on strengthening and growth of the ten priority industrial clusters. The research is aimed to formulated strategy of cashew ind ustry cluster development in East Java. The data used are primary and secondary data, analyzed using Porter 2 ̆ 7 s Diamond. The research was conducted in S umenep, Sampang, and Bangkalan, using the survey in March - April 2011. Data analysis was conducted descriptively using Porter 2 ̆ 7 s Diamond Model. The results showed that the cashew industry cluster in East Java has not been going well as expected. The linkage between upstream and downstream industries are still weak, so is the quality of the products produced. Classical problems which have obstructed the development of the cashew industry in this region are crop productivity, product quality, regulatory and policy difficult to implement, still can not fully overcome. Determinant factor is the key to successful development of industrial clusters is the availability of raw cashew nuts, infrastructure, government policy, the interaction between players in the industry, the availability of supporting institutions, upstream and downstream industries, product demand conditions and the availability of foreign investors. Therefore, the handling can not be done spatially, must be supported by all sides and done in an integrated way. Cashew cluster industry development strategy needs to be done by improving government policy (regulation of markets for industrial products cashew, cashew export tax implementation, mandatory SNI nut products, improvement of the domestic market); strengthening the upstream and downstream industries (productivity and quality of cashew, increase the ability of the cashew processing industry); and optimization of the interaction between the core industry by supporting industry and other related institutions (farmers 2 ̆ 7 cashew, cashew industry, food industry and <b>beverage,</b> industrial <b>equipment</b> & machinery, exporters, traders, government agencies, research and development institutes, associations industry, transportation and financial services/banking) ...|$|R
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) {{is used in}} a {{wide variety}} of {{products}} and objects for consumers use (digital media such as CD's and DVD's, sport <b>equipment,</b> food and <b>beverage</b> containers, medical <b>equipment).</b> Here, we demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of this contaminant in foods with a background level of contamination of less than 5 μg/kg in 85 % of the 1498 analysed samples. High levels of contamination (up to 400 μg/kg) were found in some foods of animal origin. We used a probabilistic approach to calculate dietary exposure from French individual consumption data for infants under 36 months, children and adolescents from 3 to 17 years, adults over 18 years and pregnant women. The estimated average dietary exposure ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 14 μg/kg body weight per day (bw/d) for infants, from 0. 05 to 0. 06 μg/kg bw/d for children and adolescents, from 0. 038 to 0. 040 μg/kg bw/d for adults and from 0. 05 to 0. 06 μg/kg bw/d for pregnant women. The main sources of exposure were canned foods (50 % of the total exposure), products of animal origin (20 %) and 30 % as a background level. Based on the toxicological values set by the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) for pregnant women, the risk was non negligible. Thus, we simulated scenarios to study the influence of cans and/or food of animal origin on the BPA-related risk for this specific population...|$|R

These could vary from personal care products to electronics, consumer durables, commodities, house hold <b>equipments,</b> <b>beverages,</b> automobiles, banking, insurance & other financial services, telecommunications services to name a few. In order to fulfill their quest for varied range of products and services organizations have {{to be geared to}} supply the consumer demand with consumer centric products and services. The consumer oriented products and services business is very competitive world wide. Therefore companies thrive for excellence in order to win over the consumer. In doing so the companies {{need to look at the}} total value chain to deliver the best product range at the lowest cost in quickest time. Sales and distribution is a very important aspect of a consumer centric organization's value chain. It is sales and distribution that makes the final contact with the end consumer who is considered the "king". Therefore creating an efficient and effective sales and distribution process is imperative for the success of an organization. Currently most consumer sales organizations in Sri Lanka practice a manual sales and marketing process which has many negative elements such as delays, inaccurate data, room for fraud, customer dissatisfaction to name a few. This is a big drawback for an organization when competing in the "best to market" era. However few organizations operate automated sales force systems but with certain limitations. The aim of this project was to develop an advanced Sales Force Automation System with real time data capturing and updating which will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the sales and distribution process by many leaps and bounds. Through this advanced Sales Force Automation System an organization could go to market with its product in a much shorter time span. Also it could improve it documentation and reporting with near zero mistakes. Sales Force Automation System will also help an organization in its decision making with accurate information in real time that will be a definite competitive advantage in the modern business world...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of beverage manufacturers prefer natural refrigerants over synthetic refrigerant options as the working fluid for their <b>beverage</b> display cooling <b>equipment.</b> The two major refrigerants considered for these light commercial applications are CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and R 290 (propane). CO 2, {{used in a}} transcritical cycle, offers advantages in terms of flammability, however, reduced performance at high ambient temperatures and safety {{issues related to the}} high working pressures need to be addressed in order to design efficient and cost-competitive systems. The challenges encountered with CO 2 are typically no concern for R 290; however, the major risk associated with propane is the flammability of the refrigerant. One way to mitigate the risk is rigorous reduction of refrigerant charge to levels that are substantially below legal limits. This task has been accomplished by employing experimentally validated simulation models {{that can be used to}} reliably predict the refrigerant charge in each component at different ambient conditions. Design and optimization efforts have to be focused on the compressor oil type and charge amount which dissolves large quantities of propane that does not contribute to generating the desired cooling effect. The other component that bears significant potential to reduce refrigerant charge is the condenser; low internal volumes are desired that can provide an optimal balance between required refrigerant charge, heat transfer, and pressure drop. A serpentine style microchannel heat exchanger design featuring low fin density on the air side was developed and implemented. The reduced number of fins on the air side reduces maintenance requirements and allows the system to be used in dusty environments. The improvements along with further optimizations were implemented into a beverage cooler holding 700 cans with a volume of 355 mL per can. The achieved cooling capacity was on the order of 1 kW featuring a propane refrigerant charge of less than 50 g. The performance of the redesigned beverage display cooler was experimentally validated at an ambient temperature of 40 oC and it was found that all of the manufacturers’ pull-down and energy consumption test requirements were successfully achieved...|$|R
