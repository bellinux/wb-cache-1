40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of the low phytic acid (lpa) seed trait for human and animal nutrition, and for phosphorus management in non-ruminant animal production, are well documented. However, {{in many cases the}} lpa trait is associated with impaired seed or plant performance, resulting in reduced yield. This has given rise to the perception that the lpa trait is tightly correlated with reduced yield in diverse crop species. Here we report a powerful test of this correlation. We measured grain yield in lines homozygous for each of six barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) lpa mutations that greatly differ in their seed phytic acid levels. Performance comparisons were between sibling wild-type and mutant lines obtained following backcrossing, and across two years in five Idaho (USA) locations that greatly differ in crop yield potential. We found that one lpa mutation (Hvlpa 1 - 1) had no detectable effect on yield and a second (Hvlpa 4 - 1) resulted in yield losses of only 3. 5 %, across all locations. When comparing yields in three relatively non-stressful production environments, at least three lpa mutations (Hvlpa 1 - 1, Hvlpa 3 - 1, and Hvlpa 4 - 1) typically had yields similar to or within 5 % of the wild-type sibling isoline. Therefore in the case of barley, lpa mutations can be readily identified that when simply incorporated into a cultivar result in adequately performing lines, even with no additional <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> within the lpa line. In conclusion, while some barley lpa mutations do impact field performance, a substantial fraction appears to have little or no effect on yield...|$|E
40|$|Selective <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> has {{resulted}} in distinct breeds of horse, such as the Quarter Horse (bred for acceleration) and the Arab (bred for endurance). Rapid acceleration, seen during Quarter Horse racing, requires fast powerful muscular contraction and the generation of large joint torques, particularly by the hind limb muscles. This study compared hind limb moment arm lengths in the Quarter Horse and Arab. We hypothesized that Quarter Horse hind limb extensor muscles would have longer moment arms {{when compared to the}} Arab, conferring a greater potential for torque generation at the hip, stifle and tarsus during limb extension. Six Quarter Horse and six Arab hind limbs were dissected to determine muscle moment arm lengths for the following muscles: gluteus medius, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius (medialis and lateralis) and tibialis cranialis. The moment arms of biceps femoris (acting at the hip) and gastrocnemius lateralis (acting at the stifle) were significantly longer in the Quarter Horse, although the length of the remaining muscle moment arms were similar in both breeds of horse. All the Quarter Horse muscles were capable of generating greater muscle moments owing to their greater physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and therefore greater isometric force potential, which suggests that PCSA is a better determinant of muscle torque than moment arm length in these two breeds of horse. With the exception of gastrocnemius and tibialis cranialis, the observed muscle fascicle length to moment arm ratio (MFL : MA ratio) was greater for the Arab horse muscles. It appears that the Arab muscles have the potential to operate at slower velocities of contraction and hence generate greater force outputs when compared to the Quarter Horse muscles working over a similar range of joint motion; this would indicate that Arab hind limb muscles are optimized to function at maximum economy rather than maximum power output...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1967, the Swedish New Forest Pony Society (SNF) shows interest in <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> in dressage, show jumping, and eventing competitions. The {{purpose of this}} study was to carry out genetic analyses on available recordings from young pony performance tests and competitions, in order to evaluate their usefulness in future selection for New Forest breeding ponies. Heritabilities, genetic correlations and breeding values were estimated using Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) animal models. Data were composed of 467 ponies who participated in Young Pony Test (YPT) for 3 -year olds between 2002 - 2014, 609 ponies who participated in Riding Pony Quality Test (RPQT) for 4 - and 5 -year olds between 1990 - 2014, lifetime competition results of 2225 ponies (that participated in dressage, show jumping and/or eventing between 1993 - 2011), and pedigree records for 60595 ponies. Ten traits considering conformation, gaits and jumping ability were analysed in YPT and RPQT data, and four lifetime competition traits transformed with 10 -log for each discipline (show jumping, dressage and eventing). Estimated heritabilities ranged from 0. 06 (walk in hand) to 0. 36 (jumping talent) in YPT, from 0. 11 (jumping technique) to 0. 62 (overall conformation) in RPQT, and from 0. 00 (eventing) to 0. 24 (show jumping) in competitions. Eventing data was not used for further analyses due to few participating ponies. Lifetime points in dressage and show jumping were found to be the most relevant traits to use for competition. Within YPT, the highest positive genetic correlation was estimated between jumping technique and temperament for jumping (1. 00). Conformation traits were similarly correlated with gaits (0. 31 to 1. 00) or with jumping traits (0. 27 to 1. 00), with one exception between trot in hand and correctness of legs (- 0. 12). The most strongly correlated gait with jumping traits was free canter (0. 72 to 0. 87). Within RPQT, all genetic correlations were positive, the highest being between overall conformation and temperament for gaits (0. 84). Overall conformation had moderate to high but not significant correlations with jumping traits (0. 29 to 0. 49), and high correlations with gaits (0. 53 to 0. 70). The most strongly correlated gait with jumping traits was trot under rider (0. 40 and 0. 49) but not significantly. All significant genetic correlations between corresponding traits in YPT and RPQT were high (0. 47 to 0. 96). A few significant correlations were estimated between young pony test traits and competition traits, the highest being between jumping talent in RPQT and lifetime points in show jumping competitions (0. 98). The mostly moderate heritabilities and positive genetic correlations between young pony test traits and competition traits found in this study suggests that the traits are suitable to be used for future genetic evaluation of the breed. New Forest pony stallions having more than 10 tested or competed offspring were ranked according to their Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) for talent traits in YPT and RPQT and two competition traits (lifetime points and ratio lifetime points/number of starts). However, the Swedish New Forest pony population is quite small and few ponies participate in YPT and RPQT, which contributes to less reliable genetic parameter estimations compared with larger populations. SNF should encourage breeders and owners to test their ponies in order to enable a reliable genetic evaluation for the breed in the future. All important traits should be stated in the breeding objectives and be measurable, which is not entirely the case for New Forest ponies...|$|E

40|$|Traits {{that have}} been stringently {{selected}} to conform to specific criteria in a closed population are phenotypic stereotypes. In dogs, Canis familiaris, such stereotypes have been produced by <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> conformation, <b>performance</b> (behaviors), etc. We measured phenotypes on a representative sample to establish breed stereotypes. DNA samples from 147 dog breeds were used to characterize single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequencies for association mapping of breed stereotypes. We identified significant size loci (quantitative trait loci [QTLs]), implicating candidate genes appropriate to regulation of size (e. g., IGF 1, IGF 2 BP 2 SMAD 2, etc.). Analysis of other morphological stereotypes, also under extreme selection, identified many additional significant loci. Behavioral loci for herding, pointing, and boldness implicated candidate genes appropriate to behavior (e. g., MC 2 R, DRD 1, and PCDH 9). Significant loci for longevity, a breed characteristic inversely correlated with breed size, were identified. The power of this approach to identify loci regulating the incidence of specific polygenic diseases is demonstrated by the association of a specific IGF 1 haplotype with hip dysplasia, patella luxation, and pacreatitis.

40|$|Background: In {{crossbreeding}} programs, various genomic prediction {{models have}} been proposed for using phenotypic records of crossbred animals to increase the selection response <b>for</b> crossbred <b>performance</b> in purebred animals. A possible model is a model that assumes identical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects <b>for</b> the crossbred <b>performance</b> trait across breeds (ASGM). Another model is a genomic model that assumes breed-specific effects of SNP alleles (BSAM) <b>for</b> crossbred <b>performance.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to derive and validate equations for predicting the reliability of estimated genomic <b>breeding</b> values <b>for</b> crossbred <b>performance</b> in both these models. Prediction equations were derived for situations when all (phenotyping and) genotyping data have already been collected, i. e. based on the genetic evaluation model, and for situations when all genotyping data are not yet available, i. e. when designing breeding programs. Results: When all genotyping data are available, prediction equations are based on selection index theory. Without availability of all genotyping data, prediction equations are based on population parameters (e. g., heritability of the traits involved, genetic correlation between purebred and crossbred performance, effective number of chromosome segments). Validation of the equations for predicting the reliability of genomic breeding values without all genotyping data was performed based on simulated data of a two-way crossbreeding program, using either two closely-related breeds, or two unrelated breeds, to produce crossbred animals. The proposed equations can be used for an easy comparison of the reliability of genomic estimated breeding values across many scenarios, especially if all genotyping data are available. We show that BSAM outperforms ASGM for a specific breed, if the effective number of chromosome segments that originate from this breed and are shared by selection candidates of this breed and crossbred reference animals is less than half the effective number of all chromosome segments that are independently segregating in the same animals. Conclusions: The derived equations can be used to predict the reliability of genomic estimated <b>breeding</b> values <b>for</b> crossbred <b>performance</b> using ASGM or BSAM in many scenarios, and are thus useful to optimize the design of breeding programs. Scenarios can vary in terms of the genetic correlation between purebred and crossbred performances, heritabilities, number of reference animals, or distance between breeds...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to SSR markers, the whole genome resequences/pseudomolecules and transcriptomic sequences of multiple rice genotypes enabled rapid discovery {{and development of}} genomic and genic SNP and InDel (insertion-deletion) markers in silico at a genome-wide scale. Recently, an international initiative, i.e., “The 3000 rice genome sequence project” has been completed to generate 20 million SNPs by genome resequencing of 3000 rice genotypes (Alexandrov et al. 2015). Similar efforts also {{have been made by}} Indian scientists to generate genome/gene-derived SNP and InDel markers by low-coverage resequencing specifically of diverse indica genotypes, including aromatic rice. For instance, non-redundant 2495052 SNP and 324034 InDel markers have been discovered by comparing the NGS-based whole-genome resequencing data of six elite indica inbred lines (three of each cytoplasmic male sterile and restorer lines) to accelerate genomics-assisted <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> hybrid <b>performance</b> in rice (Subbaiyan et al. 2012). Subsequently, the whole genome resequencing of three drought/salinity tolerant (Nagina 22 and Pokkali) and sensitive (IR 64) rice accessions identified non-redundant 1784583 SNPs and 154275 InDels between reference Nipponbare and three resequenced rice accessions. Based on this outcome, genome-wide 401683 SNPs between IR 64 and Pokkali and 662509 SNPs between IR 64 and Nagina 22 that are well-distributed across coding and non-coding regions of these sequenced genomes were discovered with the eventual aim to deploy them in marker-assisted <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> abiotic stress tolerance in rice (Jain et al. 2014). More recently, the comparison of whole genome resequencing data of a widely cultivated low glycemic index-containing indica rice variety, Swarna, with reference genome Nipponbare, identified 1, 149, 698 SNPs (65, 984 non-synonymous SNPs) and 104, 163 InDels for deciphering the genetic basis of complex glycemic index quantitative trait in rice (Rathinasabapathi et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} disease of wheat crops in Europe. Because of the partial nature of genotypic resistance or the increasing resistance against fungicides, the tolerance, i. e. maintaining yield {{in the presence of}} expressed disease, is a relevant alternative. Tolerance is generally estimated through the yield loss per unit of source reduction, contrasts of tolerance between genotypes have been observed previously suggesting that either increasing the source availability or improving the use of stored assimilate could improve tolerance. This paper aims at developing a source/sink approach to understand the tolerance mechanism and identifying potential traits to increase tolerance of STB. A field experiment was designed to explore the relation between tolerance of STB and source/sink balance. Based on six wheat genotypes contrasting for tolerance exposed to natural STB epidemics, late nitrogen fertilization and a 50 % spikelet removal were applied to change the source/sink balance. The tolerance of genotypes was quantitatively estimated over three additional field experiments. We found that STB tolerance was correlated with traits of healthy crops (high individual grain weight and high green leaf lamina area as the proportion of leaf 3). The spikelet removal revealed a highly variable degree of source limitation for grain filling amongst the six genotypes. Thus, we proposed an easily calculated index that highly correlated positively with the labor intensive estimation of STB tolerance. Finally, potential yield and tolerance were not correlated, which suggests that <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> yield <b>performance</b> and tolerance could be possible...|$|R
30|$|The {{domestication}} {{of plant}} and animal species has historically centred very much on exploiting favourable interactions between genetic improvement and management inputs, with domesticated stocks requiring but rewarding intensified management inputs. A classic example of favourable, synergistic interactions in plant breeding is afforded by the dwarf wheats of the “Green Revolution” which began in Mexico in the 1950 s. These wheats could respond very well to increased fertiliser, with greatly increased yields (Borlaug 1970), whereas such fertiliser inputs made the more traditional long-strawed wheats prone to lodging which would vitiate their yield potential. (Admittedly, a question now exists over the long-term sustainability of such fertiliser use, but it is not seen as detracting from the illustrative value of this example.) In animal breeding, a good example exists in <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> improved reproductive <b>performance</b> in sheep in New Zealand (Young 2015), boosting lambing percentages with twins and triplets instead of mainly single lambs. That can mean much improved meat production from the same, or even fewer, capital stock (see Figure 8 in Cocks and Brown 2005). But it does depend for its practical success on providing benign farm conditions with reliable and plentiful supplies of high-quality feed (Burton n.d.), so almost all the lambs can survive and prosper.|$|R

The differences in breeding values had in both years the same trend. In the younger sires, the <b>breeding</b> value <b>for</b> fat percentage was higher by 0. 42 % in the Lysine homozygotes compared to the Alanine homozygotes (P). A higher milk breeding value in the Alanine homozygotes (811 kg) was found compared to the Lysine homozygotes (256 kg) (P), and the fat yield breeding value was higher in the Lysine sires (DGAT 1 K / DGAT 1 K 29. 6, DGAT 1 A / DGAT 1 A 15. 9). The <b>breeding</b> value <b>for</b> the protein percentage was higher in the sires carrying the Lysine variant (0. 02) than in the Alanine homozygotes (- 0. 03, P), and the protein yield was higher in the Alanine homozygotes (DGAT 1 K / DGAT 1 K 10. 9, DGAT 1 A / DGAT 1 A 25. 0, P). Because of the high emphasis of the index on the protein yield, the relative <b>breeding</b> value <b>for</b> milk was 110 among Alanine homozygotes, and 104 among Lysine. Comparing old and young sires, the genetic background against which the effect of DGAT 1 is evaluated has changed. The selection on <b>breeding</b> value <b>for</b> protein yield increased the prevalence of DGAT 1 A / DGAT 1 A genotypes in protein and milk yield, and in relative <b>breeding</b> value <b>for</b> milk. In the old group, there was the highest protein yield in the heterozygous sires DGAT 1 KA, it {{could be explained by}} another genetic background of the tested female population. Because the <b>breeding</b> value <b>for</b> fat percentage of heterozygous sires has lain within the values of homozygotes in both old and young sires, we assume the intermediary heredity on the locus. The differences of genotypic and allelic frequencies among old and young sires were not significant, however, there was certain tendency of increase of allele A (0. 60 old sires, 0. 64 young).

40|$|<b>Breeding</b> <b>for</b> postharvest <b>performance</b> in ornamentals is challenging, {{since many}} {{different}} deteriorative processes determine vase life. In {{order to improve}} postharvest performance by breeding, selection should take place on these processes separately. To define processes that are important <b>for</b> chrysanthemum postharvest <b>performance,</b> vase life was assessed {{after two weeks of}} cold storage in a set of 44 chrysanthemum cultivars. Since disk floret degreening was the most frequent reason for ending vase life, we further investigated this trait in a large biparental population (n = 381). To quantify disk floret degreening in this large number of genotypes, we developed a high-throughput phenotyping method. The method consists of the quantification of loss of green color as expressed by an increase of intensity of red divided by the intensity of green (R/G) in dark-held detached capitula. R/G increases when disk florets lose green color. The increase in R/G correlated significantly with the number of days until disk floret degreening occurred during vase life. This was the case for the 44 -cultivar cultivar panel (Pearson’s correlation coefficient (ρ) of − 0. 70; p < 0. 0001) as well as in a subset of the biparental pulation (n = 145; ρ = − 0. 67; p < 0. 0001). R/G increase segregated in a quantitative manner in the full biparental population, and had a moderately high heritability of 0. 73. Carbohydrate content after harvest was measured in a smaller subset of the biparental population (n = 55). The R/G increase correlated with carbohydrate content (ρ=- 0. 56; p < 0. 0001). Since carbohydrate content did not explain all variation in degreening sensitivity, we discuss different possible mechanisms to cope with carbohydrate starvation and avoid degreening. In conclusion, disk floret degreening is an important postharvest trait in chrysanthemum, and it is related to carbohydrate starvation. The quantitative segregation suggests involvement of multiple alleles, probably at multiple loci. The moderately high heritability makes it a suitable trait for QTL mapping, which we will commence in the near future...|$|R

The status quo of the current polled breeding pool of genetically-closely related artificial insemination sires with lower <b>breeding</b> values <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> traits raises questions regarding the effects of intensified selection based on this founder pool. Methods: We developed a stochastic simulation framework that combines the stochastic simulation software QMSim and a self-designed R program named QUALsim that acts as an external extension. Two traits were simulated in a dairy cattle population for 25 generations: one quantitative (QMSim) and one qualitative trait with Mendelian inheritance (i. e. polledness, QUALsim). The assignment scheme for qualitative trait genotypes initiated realistic initial breeding situations regarding allele frequencies, true <b>breeding</b> values <b>for</b> the quantitative trait and genetic relatedness. Intensified selection for polled cattle was achieved using an approach that weights estimated breeding values in the animal best linear unbiased prediction model for the quantitative trait depending on genotypes or phenotypes for the polled trait with a user-defined weighting factor. Results: Selection response for the polled trait was highest in the selection scheme based on genotypes. Selection based on phenotypes led to significantly lower allele frequencies for polled. The male selection path played a significantly greater role for a fast dissemination of polled alleles compared to female selection strategies. Fixation of the polled allele implies selection based on polled genotypes among males. In comparison to a base breeding scenario that does not take polledness into account, intensive selection for polled substantially reduced genetic gain for this quantitative trait after 25 generations. Reducing selection intensity for polled males while maintaining strong selection intensity among females, simultaneously decreased losses in genetic gain and achieved a final allele frequency of 0. 93 for polled. Conclusions: A fast transition to a completely polled population through intensified selection for polled was in contradiction to the preservation of high genetic gain for the quantitative trait. Selection on male polled genotypes with moderate weighting, and selection on female polled phenotypes with high weighting, could be a suitable compromise regarding all important breeding aspects...|$|R

Performance records on 40 437 South African Holstein cows in 766 herds were used. (Co) variance estimates were obtained by multitrait analysis, using the REML procedure. Heritability estimates were moderate for age at first calving (0. 24 ± 0. 02) and low for calving interval (0. 03 ± 0. 01). Genetic correlations between age at first calving and yield traits were low to moderately negative, ranging from - 0. 17 ± 0. 07 with second lactation butterfat percentage to - 0. 50 ± 0. 05 with first lactation butterfat yield. Calving interval had moderate to highly positive genetic correlations with yield traits, ranging from 0. 37 ± 0. 10 with second lactation milk yield to 0. 69 ± 0. 06 with first lactation milk yield.

40|$|When <b>breeding</b> alfalfa <b>for</b> yield <b>performance,</b> it is {{necessary}} to use high-yielding parents obtained by different breeding methods. The assumption at the onset of this research was that crossing highest-yielding domestic cultivars with divergent populations from geographically distant breeding centers could result in the expression of heterotic effects in their hybrids contributing to increased alfalfa yield. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine yield and yield components and heterotic effects in hybrid progenies obtained by crossing the domestic cultivars NS Banat ZMS II and NS Mediana ZMS V with the cultivars Pella, Dolichi and Hyliki from Greece, UMSS 2001 from Bolivia and Jogeva 118 from Estonia in two series. The field trial planted in 2006, included 13 F 1 hybrids and 6 of 7 initial parents in both series. Heterotic effects for yields of forage and hay were observed in 4 combinations (C NS Banat ZMS II x E Hyliki; C NS Banat ZMS II x E UMSS 2001; C NS Mediana ZMS V x E Hyliki; C NS Mediana ZMS V x E Dolichi). The populations that exhibited heterosis in a set of crossings are recommended for use as parent components for development of high-yielding synthetic alfalfa cultivars. ...|$|R
