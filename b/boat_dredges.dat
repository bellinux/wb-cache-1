Was it invention to place a screw for dredging at the stem of the boat? Nothing more than this was in reality suggested by the patentee." [...] But previous <b>boats</b> used as <b>dredge</b> <b>boats</b> did that. They just ran the boats backwards. [...] "They were turned end for end, and the stern {{was used as the}} bow, and the screws went forward, working in the bottom deposit in advance of the vessels."

[...] Even though all the elements of Brady's <b>dredge</b> <b>boat</b> were old, could there be invention in combining them? [...] "Did he make a selection and combination of these elements that would not have occurred to any ordinary skilled engineer called upon, with all this previous knowledge and experience before him, to devise the construction of a strong <b>dredge</b> <b>boat</b> for use {{at the mouth of the}} Mississippi? We think not. We think that there is no reasonable ground for any such pretension." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{sustainability of}} seven Tagus estuary fisheries – beam trawl, <b>boat</b> <b>dredge,</b> nets for glass eel, gill nets, eel basket, squid jig and octopus traps – is analysed using RAPFISH. This technique relies upon ordination of scored attributes, grouped in fields that cover ecological, economic, social, technological and ethical sustainability, performed using multi-dimensional scaling. Fisheries were analysed within each discipline and using all the attributes for an interdisciplinary approach. Leverage analysis {{is used to}} determine how much each attribute influences the ordination. Concerning the cross-discipline ordination, the studied fisheries lay around the mid-range of sustainability. The most sustainable fishery is octopus traps (57 %) followed by squid jig (56 %) that has the same results except for technological dimension. Eel basket and gill nets show the next best sustainability scores (55 % and 53 %, respectively). Glass eel fishery presents a poor sustainability (46 %), lying close to the <b>boat</b> <b>dredge</b> and beam trawl, the fisheries with lowest sustainability (44 % and 43 %, respectively). The low leverage values show that ordinations are truly multivariate and that the results are not dominated by any one attribute. More studies should be conducted on the Tagus estuary fisheries in order to get more information about resources, fishers and their activity, which will contribute to improve sustainability...|$|R
5000|$|Dredging - There are {{types of}} dredges used for {{collecting}} scallops, oysters or sea cucumbers from the seabed. They have {{the form of}} a scoop made of chain mesh and they are towed by a fishing <b>boat.</b> <b>Dredging</b> can be destructive to the seabed, because the marine life is unable to survive the weight of the dredge. It is extremely detrimental to coral beds since they take centuries to rebuild themselves. Unmonitored dredging can be compared to unmonitored forest clearing, where it can wipe out ecosystems. Nowadays, this method of fishing is often replaced by mariculture or by scuba diving.|$|R

[...] "Their object is, by their rapid revolution, to displace the sand and mud on the bottom and, stirring them up, to mix them with the water so that they may be carried off by the current." [...] The boat has a series of watertight compartments into or out of which water is pumped so as to sink the vessel to the required depth for dredging.|$|R

40|$|The {{green turtle}} Chelonia mydas {{is a widely}} distributed, slowly {{maturing}} species with a complex life cycle, using both oceanic and coastal environments. The species is exposed to different threats and is considered an environmental sentinel that indicates variation among, and the severity of hazards to marine ecosystems. This study aimed to describe both anthropogenic impacts, and infectious and parasitic diseases in C. mydas - including cases along the Brazilian coast - and implications for conservation. Bycatch is reported as the main threat to the conservation of this species, followed by debris ingestion, collisions with <b>boats,</b> <b>dredging,</b> and chronic environmental contamination. All of these impacts may directly or indirectly cause death, by facilitating contact with pathological agents and by increasing vulnerability to secondary diseases. The pathological agents associated with lesions include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. Fibropapillomatosis {{is an example of}} a chronic disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral tumors that affects mostly juvenile C. mydas worldwide and is associated with the Chelonid herpesvirus 5. The bacterias Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas fluorescens are found in the aquatic environment and among C. mydas lesions in various organs. Trematode adults and eggs of the family Spirorchiidae are also frequent in systemic cardiovascular diseases of C. mydas. The direct impacts of anthropogenic activities and diseases are synergistic and may affect the specie’s health and conservation. Therefore, the monitoring and systematic diagnosing of diseases and causes of death - including necropsy, histopathology, and molecular exams - are necessary to assess a population’s health, to support appropriate decisions of coastal management and to target future research topics that optimize C. mydas conservation...|$|R
5000|$|Buy-boats {{saw their}} heyday {{in the first}} half of the 20th century when most oysters from the Chesapeake Bay were {{harvested}} by tongers in small flat bottomed row <b>boats,</b> or <b>dredged</b> by sail powered skipjacks. Interstate highways, bridges and tunnels such as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, and smaller bridges that span the many tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay were non-existent prior to the 1950s, therefore it was much faster to haul seafood to market by boat than by truck.
