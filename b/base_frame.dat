The park received its eighth roller coaster named Tony Hawk's Big Spin, which was {{located on the}} former Zonga concrete pad. The ride featured a unique layout compared to the three other coasters which share the name, including a <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> instead of permanent concrete footers and a higher top speed.

For reaching economically feasible yield levels, it is reported that Particle-per-Reticle-Pass (PRP) levels should be better than 0. 0001 for particles larger than 18 nm.

5000|$|A CAN network can be {{configured}} to {{work with}} two different message (or [...] "frame") formats: the standard or <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> format (described in CAN 2.0 A and CAN 2.0 B), and the extended frame format (only described by CAN 2.0 B). The only {{difference between the two}} formats is that the [...] "CAN base frame" [...] supports a length of 11 bits for the identifier, and the [...] "CAN extended frame" [...] supports a length of 29 bits for the identifier, made up of the 11-bit identifier ("base identifier") and an 18-bit extension ("identifier extension"). The distinction between CAN <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> format and CAN extended frame format is made by using the IDE bit, which is transmitted as dominant in case of an 11-bit frame, and transmitted as recessive in case of a 29-bit frame. CAN controllers that support extended frame format messages are also able to send and receive messages in CAN <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> format. All frames begin with a start-of-frame (SOF) bit that denotes the start of the frame transmission.|$|E

50|$|Two {{specific}} types of analytic frames are case and aspect <b>based</b> <b>frames.</b> Framing by case refers to researchers using concepts to classify the phenomena they study, while framing by aspect refers to using concepts to characterize the phenomena. For example, a scientists describing a restaurant, a bus, a coffeehouse and a waiting room as a noninteraction places is assigning them into the same category, thus framing them by case. Framing by aspect is going further and differentiating between cases in a given category (how exactly is noninteraction achieved in those places, what forms of social interaction are permitted in those places, etc.).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{approach}} {{is presented to}} detect faces and facial features on a video segment based on multi-cues, including gray-level distribution, color, motion, templates, algebraic features and so on. Faces are first detected across the frames by using color segmentation, template matching and artificial neural network. A PCA-based (Principle Component Analysis, PCA) feature detector for still images is then used to detect facial features on each single frame until the resulting features of three adjacent <b>frames,</b> named as <b>base</b> <b>frames,</b> are consistent to each other. The features of frames neighbor hooded to the <b>base</b> <b>frames</b> are first detected by the still-image feature detector, then verified and corrected according to the smoothness constraint and the planar surface motion constraint. Experiments have been performed on video segments captured under different environments, and prove the presented method to be robust and accurate over variable poses, ages and illumination conditions...|$|R
