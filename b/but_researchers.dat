5|$|Coevolution is {{primarily}} a biological concept, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> have applied it by analogy to fields such as computer science, sociology, and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no obvious}} single {{source for the}} plot of The Tempest, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> have seen {{parallels}} in Erasmus's Naufragium, Peter Martyr's De orbe novo, and eyewitness reports by William Strachey and Sylvester Jordain of the real-life shipwreck of the Sea Venture on the islands of Bermuda, and the subsequent conflict between Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers. In addition, one of Gonzalo's speeches is derived from Montaigne's essay Of the Canibales, and much of Prospero's renunciative speech echoes a speech by Medea in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses. The masque in Act 4 {{may have been a}} later addition, possibly in honour of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. The play was first published in the First Folio of 1623.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet <b>researchers,</b> <b>but</b> most cetacean <b>researchers</b> are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.|$|R
50|$|Many {{theorists have}} posited that {{self-regulation}} depletes energy <b>but</b> SDT <b>researchers</b> have proposed and demonstrated that only controlled regulation depletes energy, autonomous regulation {{can actually be}} vitalizing.|$|R
25|$|The {{dermatological}} {{symptoms are}} caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin. The nature of this material is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> have suggested {{that it may be}} a glycoprotein, a glycolipid, an acid mucopolysaccharide, altered collagen or elastic tissue.|$|E
25|$|Research on CCSVI {{has been}} fast tracked <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> {{have been unable}} to confirm whether CCSVI has a role in causing MS. This has raised serious {{objections}} to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating multiple sclerosis. Additional research investigating the CCSVI hypothesis is underway. A 2013 study found that CCSVI is equally rare in people with and without MS, while narrowing of the cervical veins is equally common.|$|E
25|$|During the nesting season, {{burrowing}} owls {{will collect}} {{a wide variety}} of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal dung, usually from cattle. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask the scent of the juvenile owls, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{position}} of Tritylodontidae {{in relation to}} Mammalia is still debated, <b>but</b> most <b>researchers</b> agree they are closely related, ususally considering Tritylodontidae to be non-mammaliaform, mammaliamorph cynodonts.|$|R
25|$|It is {{recognised}} that an epidemiological {{account of}} the plague {{is as important as}} an identification of symptoms, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.|$|E
25|$|Physicians {{began to}} take more {{interest}} in paramedics from a research perspective as well. By about 1990, the fluctuating trends began to diminish, being replaced by outcomes-based research. This research then drove further evolution {{of the practice of}} both paramedics and the emergency physicians who oversaw their work, with changes to procedures and protocols occurring only after significant research demonstrated their need and effectiveness (an example being ALS). Such changes affected everything from simple procedures such as CPR, to changes in drug protocols. As the profession grew, some paramedics went on to become not just research participants, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> in their own right, with their own projects and journal publications.|$|E
25|$|Lake Superior {{has fewer}} {{dissolved}} nutrients relative to its water volume {{than the other}} Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an oligotrophic lake. This {{is a result of}} the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed. However, nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century. They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health; but this steady, long-term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup. It may relate to anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake's ecology.|$|E

The prayer was originally published in the newspaper HaTzofe on September 20, 1948, and in Haaretz on the following day. Over the years {{it was assumed that}} Nobel laureate S. Y. Agnon was the one who actually composed the prayer, <b>but</b> <b>researcher</b> Yoel Rappel showed that Agnon was only asked to assist in composing it. This was confirmed by Agnon's son Hemdat.|$|R

25|$|The {{records of}} the first people near Willow Bunch are few, but they left behind a piece of {{themselves}} at the St. Victor petroglyphs. St. Victor is 19km west of Willow Bunch. The petroglyphs are carvings of many Great Plains Indian symbols. Carvings include several variations of human faces, many types of hooves, turtles, grizzly bear paws, and human handprints. These were carved into the rock faces approximately AD 500-1700. Since there are no carvings of horses or horse hooves, researchers assume the carvings were created before 1750, the approximate year horses arrived {{in the northern part of}} the plains. The carvings' use may have been for records or as a way of communication, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> are unsure.|$|E
25|$|Physical cues such as pressure, velocity, flow patterns, and {{shear stress}} {{are known to}} act on the {{vascular}} network in a number of ways, including branching morphogenesis, enlargement of vessels in high-flow areas, angiogenesis, and the development of vein valves. The mechanotransduction of these physical cues to endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall can also trigger the promotion or repression of certain genes which are responsible for vasodilation, cell alignment, and other shear stress-mitigating factors. This relationship between genetics and environment is not clearly understood, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> are attempting to clarify it by combining reliable genetic techniques, such as genetically-ablated model organisms and tissues, with new technologies developed to measure and track flow patterns, velocity profiles, and pressure fluctuations in vivo.|$|E
500|$|The Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} is classified {{along with the}} modern Liberian {{pygmy hippopotamus}}, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> sometimes place the Liberian hippo in two different genera. The pygmy hippopotamus was originally classified as Choeropsis by Samuel G. Morton in 1849. [...] In 1977, the pygmy hippopotamus was reclassified {{as a member of}} Hexaprotodon along with fossil species from Asia. Further examination, however, has discovered differences between the pygmy hippopotamus and the Asian hippos, prompting its reclassification by some as Choeropsis.|$|E

[...] The golden-crowned sifaka can be observed feeding and resting higher in the canopy during the dry season (May through October). It sleeps in the taller trees (the emergent layer) of the forest at night.|$|E
500|$|Basic or pure {{research}} investigates how organisms behave, develop, and function. Those {{opposed to}} animal testing object that pure research {{may have little}} or no practical purpose, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> argue that it forms the necessary basis for the development of applied research, rendering the distinction between pure and applied research—research that has a specific practical aim—unclear. Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research. Fruit flies, nematode worms, mice and rats together account for the vast majority, though small numbers of other species are used, ranging from sea slugs through to armadillos. Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include: ...|$|E
500|$|Lordosis, {{also known}} as swayback, low back or soft back, {{has been found to}} have a {{hereditary}} basis in Saddlebreds and a recessive mode of inheritance. The precise mutation has not yet been located, <b>but</b> <b>researchers</b> believe it to be somewhere on horse chromosome 20. Researching this condition may help more than just the Saddlebred breed as it may [...] "serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species." [...] Due to the head position common in the show ring, Saddlebreds can have impairments to the upper respiratory system, while the shoeing and movement required of the horses can cause leg and hoof injuries and increased lameness. [...] A swayback is penalized as a fault at shows, in addition to other conformation flaws.|$|E
5000|$|Some authors {{claim that}} Gelasius {{replaced}} Lupercalia with the [...] "Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary," [...] <b>but</b> <b>researcher</b> Oruch {{says that there}} is no written record of Gelasius ever intending a replacement of Lupercalia. Some researchers, such as Kellog and Cox, have made a separate claim that the modern customs of Saint Valentine's Day originate from Lupercalia customs. Other researchers have rejected this claim: they say there is no proof that the modern customs of Saint Valentine's Day originate from Lupercalia customs, and the claim seems to originate from misconceptions about festivities.|$|R
5000|$|One source {{claims that}} the name [...] "des Moines" [...] {{is the result of}} a hoax. In 1673 Father Jacques Marquette met some representatives of the Peoria tribe near the mouth of the Des Moines River. He asked them the name of the rival tribe who lived upriver. The Peoria told him that tribe was called the Moingoana, from which 'Moines' was derived. <b>But</b> <b>researcher</b> Michael McCafferty of Indiana University, while {{studying}} the now extinct Miami-Illinois language of the Peoria, discovered that Moingoana, translated literally, meant [...] "shit faces."
