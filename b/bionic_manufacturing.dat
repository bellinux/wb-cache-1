40|$|The new {{organisational}} structures used {{in world}} wide manufacturing systems require {{the development of}} distributed applications, which present solutions to their requirements. The work research in the distributed manufacturing control leads to emergent paradigms, such as Holonic Manufacturing Systems (HMS) and <b>Bionic</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> Systems (BMS), which translates the concepts from social organisations and biological systems to the manufacturing world. This paper present a framework {{for the development of}} distributed manufacturing applications, based in an agent-based architecture, which implements some Holonic and <b>Bionic</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> Systems concepts. Keywords: distributed manufacturing systems, holonic manufacturing, multi-agents, system integration. 1...|$|E
40|$|National audienceA {{decentralized}} architecture {{product model}} (PM), {{based on a}} social approach to production management, is presented. The approach {{is based on a}} <b>bionic</b> <b>manufacturing</b> paradigm, where raw materials carry information on possible processing. The PM is introduced into a common experimental platform, developed by the partners of the project on the Synchronous Production among Order-Givers and Subcontractors (SPOGS). The discrete-event type simulation of the distributed production system, amongst order-givers and subcontractors, confirms the potential of the PM. The approach integrates all the elements necessary for the management of production by interaction via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) among order-givers and subcontractors...|$|E

According to the growth requirements of new bone tissue cell on the porosity and pore size of bionic bone tissue model, an approach for modeling of bionic-bone tissue scaffold based on the surface model of bone tissue is presented by filling the profile model of bone tissue with the delamination of hollow unit cell. The hollow cubic unit cell is designed with controllable porosity and pore size. The algorithm for filling the profile of bone tissue with delamination of porous unit cell is provided for generating the model of bionic bone with pore structure. The scaffold model is stored in Common Layer Interface (CLI) file for the Rapid Prototyping Manufacturing (RPM) of scaffold...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} of organizations, firms, {{management}} and control, in general, a silent conceptual movement has been under way for less than 50 years now, beginning in 1967, when Arthur Koestler formally introduced the concepts of holon, holarchy (a hierarchical structure of holons) and holonic network (a reticular structure of holons). Thirty years later, Ken Wilber tried to generalize the holonic perspective. The new holonic perspective forces us to observe the surrounding universe (at a physical and biological level, and in the real or formal sense) by {{taking into account the}} whole/part (holarchies) and the before/after (holonic networks) relationships: any observable unit {{is at the same time}} a whole-composed of smaller parts-and part of a larger whole. In order to clarify the holonic vison and the ideas behind holons, holarchies and holonic networks, this study will examine some significant uses of these concepts and, in particular, the main sources of inspiration for those production systems referred to as the holonic manufacturing systems, comparing these to those defined as <b>bionic</b> and fractal <b>manufacturing</b> systems. Some forms of inter-organizational networks, as well as holonic and virtual organizations, have also been considered...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{competitive}} settings, characterised by development being promoting by {{the predominance}} of knowledge, means that mul- tidisciplinary approaches must be adopted for dealing with specific problems. Indeed, techniques and tools have been created by imitating human beings’ behaviour and applying them to productive and technological contexts to increase efficiency and enable a quick response. This paper deals with this topic and {{presents the results of}} scientometric- and technological surveillance-based research for revealing life sciences’ impact on technological development and its management. It was found that such impact has been mainly reflected in producing concepts and applications for topics such as intelligent manufacturing, biological manu- facturing systems and holonic and <b>bionic</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> thereby providing manufacturing and information management with hu- man attributes such as adaptation, self-learning, flexibility and the ability to evolve. It may thus be concluded that technological factor management has been strengthened, based on fields such as biology, thereby leading to direct outcomes regarding pro- duction...|$|E
40|$|National audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a new multi-agent {{approach}} to control manufacturing process where agents represent products, assemblies and parts, which results in increased reactivity and flexibility. The approach {{is based on a}} <b>bionic</b> <b>manufacturing</b> paradigm, where raw materials carry information on possible processing. The approach results in a decentralized product-approach model with communication based on a social approach to production management. The manufacturing system (MS) is managed by a set of autonomous and intelligent agents just as the activities in a society result from actions of individuals. The discrete-event type simulation of the control system, built from agents of materials, parts and products, confirms the potential of self-scheduling production. An experimental case study is studied by simulation. Agents able to negotiate operations that the materials, parts and products must undergo on the manufacturing workstations are attached to the former. These agents have all the necessary information on production environment, objectives, constraints and rules. They make decisions and they interact. This is how production is managed. The results show that our approach is able to schedule and control a simple production system without a prearranged schedule...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of using friction to transmit power and prevent slippage is very widely used, many animals {{have very strong}} adhesion climbing ability, and it has important theoretical significance and wide application prospect to research and the prepare bionic surface to increase transmission friction using the bionic technology. In recent years, the research of foot structure of climbing animals shows that their surface morphology has both macro and micro scale features, and only study from the macro to the micro scale surface structure can be better elucidate the mechanism of increasing-friction of climbing animal. This paper will study bionic surface structure on mesoscopic scale from micron to millimeter level, research the influence of foot structure of climbing animal under mesoscopic scale on characteristics of increasing friction using bionic technology, prepare the bionic non-smooth surface of convex or concave using <b>bionic</b> <b>manufacturing</b> technology, establish the friction model of non-smooth surface, investigate the increasing-friction mechanism of the bionic surface morphology on mesoscopic scales, reveals the influence of surface morphology, layout, size and material properties on the friction characteristics, provide the design of bionic friction surface and calculation method of friction coefficient and provide reliable theoretical basis for engineering application...|$|E
