50|$|In February 2013, {{as part of}} a {{national}} initiative to eliminate <b>ballast</b> <b>tracks</b> at major stations, washable aprons—ballastless tracks or tracks on a concrete bed—were installed along the entire length of tracks of platforms 3, 4 and 5 at the terminus. Washable aprons that are already present for a few metres in some of the platforms at the terminus will be extended, viz. 30 m on platform 3, 200 m on platform 4, and 50 m on platform 5, while new ones will be built on platforms with <b>ballast</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>ballast</b> <b>track</b> {{structures are}} still being used in high speed railways lines with success, however technical problems or performance features have led to non-ballast track solution in some cases. A considerable maintenance work is needed for <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> due to the track deterioration. Therefore {{it is very important}} to understand the mechanism of track deterioration and to predict the track settlement or track irregularity growth rate in order to reduce track maintenance costs and enable new track structures to be designed. The objective of this work is to develop the most adequate and efﬁcient models for calculation of dynamic trafﬁc load effects on railways track infrastructure, and then evaluate the dynamic effect on the <b>ballast</b> <b>track</b> settlement, using a <b>ballast</b> <b>track</b> settlement prediction model, which consists of the vehicle/track dynamic model previously selected and a track settlement law. The calculations are based on dynamic ﬁnite element models with direct time integration, contact between wheel and rail and interaction with railway cars. A initial irregularity proﬁle is used in the prediction model. The track settlement law is considered to be a function of number of loading cycles and the magnitude of the loading, which represents the long-term behavior of ballast settlement. The results obtained include the track irregularity growth and the contact force in the ﬁnal interaction of numerical simulatio...|$|R

25|$|Building a {{slab track}} is more {{expensive}} than building traditional <b>ballasted</b> <b>track,</b> which has slowed its introduction outside of high-speed rail lines. Slab track is also difficult to modify {{after it has been}} installed, and the curing time of concrete makes it difficult to convert an existing, busy railway line to a ballastless set-up.|$|E
2500|$|Where it is {{critical}} to reduce noise and vibration, the concrete slab can be supported on soft resilient bearings. This configuration, called [...] "floating slab track", is expensive and requires more depth or height in the track structure, but it can reduce noise and vibration by around 80%. GERB quote up to 35-40dB of attenuation using their steel sprung system. Alternatively, the rail can be supported along its length by an elastic material; when combined with a smaller rail section, this can provide a significant noise reduction over traditional <b>ballasted</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like <b>ballasted</b> <b>track</b> the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

30|$|Railway {{infrastructure}} {{is divided into}} technical subsystems, including substructure, track, electrical system, signalling system, and telecom system [23]. The rolling stock is treated as a different technical subsystem, depending on what is being transported, passengers or goods [1, 2]. For trains to run on time {{the condition of the}} infrastructure must be sufficient [3]. The purpose of a railway track is to provide a stable, safe, and efficiently guided platform for the train to run at various speeds with different axle loadings [24]. There are two types of railway tracks: conventional <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks</b> and slab tracks [5]. Current studies indicate slab tracks may be more cost effective than conventional <b>ballasted</b> <b>tracks,</b> considering life cycle, maintenance cost, and traffic disruption during maintenance [25]. The slab track incurs higher initial construction costs and repair costs, but structural damage takes longer to occur [5, 25]. Most railway tracks in Sweden are of the traditional ballasted type.|$|R

3000|$|Well-graded {{asphalt mix}} with the merits of high sound absorption, low water permeability, {{excellent}} strength, and easy construction is an important option for high-speed railway substructures. On the basis of finite element method, a model with conventional <b>ballasted</b> <b>trackbed</b> (T 0) and four ballasted trackbeds models with different positions of asphalt layer were analyzed, in which 15  cm thick asphalt layer was used to replace the different sub-track layers, the bottom {{and the top of}} upper subgrade and of <b>ballasted</b> <b>trackbed,</b> named as T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4, respectively. The results showed that the range of peak vertical accelerations on the top of subgrade surface of T 2 and T 4 were smaller than T 1 and T 3; T 1 and T 2 perform better in decreasing the maximum vertical deformation of subgrade than T 3 and T 4; the maximum transversal tensile strain of T 4 is almost twice than the other three. The trackbed bears more stress when the asphalt layer is [...] located at the lower part of railway trackbed.|$|R
40|$|In railway applications, track {{alignment}} represents the forming {{curvature of the}} running edge of the rails. During construction, alignment measurements are normally obtained with chord measuring systems. When traditional surveying methods are implemented, {{track alignment}} is taken at sparse spaced points directly from the versine measurement – i. e., the offset observed at an intermediate point from a straight line chord. In contrast, track recording vehicles either apply the chord measuring technique directly or employ a combination of an inertial/gauge sensing system. For <b>ballast</b> <b>track</b> sections, deviations in track alignment from the projected track settlement would raise serious concerns for track buckling. This is because any deviation from the nominal geometry reduces the load needed to induce buckling. Today, modern lining systems and automated maintenance procedures are used to restore track surface and alignment. Contrary to the <b>ballast</b> <b>track</b> technique, the connection of the slab track and the underground is rigid. Consequently, adaptations to the nominal geometry after paving over are only possible with additional expenditure. As a result, positional accuracy requirements in slab track projects are very high...|$|R
25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without <b>ballast.</b> <b>Track</b> may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|R
