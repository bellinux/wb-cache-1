500|$|The Queen {{inspired}} main antagonist {{characters in}} the otherwise unrelated titles, such as the stepmother queen in the Russian animated film The Wild Swans (1962), the Witch Queen in the Spanish film Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood (1962), the goddess Venus in the anime version of Unico, Queen Admira in the American film The Hugga Bunch (1985), and {{the queen of the}} witches in the video game Curse of Enchantia (1992). Lady Macbeth in Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth resembles the Queen in her costume, make-up, and even the manner of her death; Lady Macbeth was also visually based on the Queen in a 1982 comic book adaptation. The evil Queen Bavmorda from 1988's film Willow bears a resemblance too, so much that Cinefantastique editor Frederick S. Clarke described her as [...] "simply Snow Whites Wicked Queen, right down to her hooded costume." [...] Robin Wood has drawn a connection between the looks of the Witch and of the Emperor in the Star Wars franchise (which eventually also became a Disney property). According to the designer Steve Brown, the Queen's old Witch form served as an inspiration for the main character Witch Queen in his 1985 video game Cauldron. Brigitte Nielsen said she has also based her role as the <b>Black</b> <b>Witch</b> (who also kidnaps a prince character out of jealously for a princess) in the 1992 Italian film Fantaghirò 2 on Disney's [...] "Grimilde" [...] (an Italian name for the Queen in the comics).|$|E

6000|$|HECTOR. You {{are under}} a spell, man. Old Shotover sold {{himself to the}} devil in Zanzibar. The devil gave him a <b>black</b> <b>witch</b> for a wife; and these two demon daughters are their mystical progeny. I am tied to Hesione's apron-string; but I'm her husband; and if I did go stark staring mad about her, at least we became man and wife. But why should you let {{yourself}} be dragged about and beaten by Ariadne as a toy donkey is dragged about and beaten by a child? What do you get by it? Are you her lover? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} in the West Indies," [...] she said; [...] "and the writing of a woman slave was the writing in the little book. The slave wrote about her mother. Her mother was a black--a Witch in her own country. There was a forest in her own country. The devil taught her Witchcraft in the forest. The serpents and the wild beasts were afraid to touch her. She lived without eating. She was sold for a slave, {{and sent to the}} island--an island in the West Indies. An old man lived there; the wickedest man of them all. He filled the <b>black</b> <b>Witch</b> with devilish knowledge. She learned to make the image of wax. The image of wax casts spells. You put pins in the image of wax. At every pin you put, the person under the spell gets nearer and nearer to death. There was a poor black in the island. He offended the Witch. She made his image in wax; she cast spells on him. He couldn't sleep; he couldn't eat; he was such a coward that common noises frightened him. Like Me! Oh, God, like me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus Giotto or Fra Angelico {{would have}} at once {{admitted}} theologically that God {{was too good}} to be painted; but they would always try to paint Him. And they felt (very rightly) that representing Him as a rather quaint old man with a gold crown and a white beard, like a king of the elves, was less profane than resisting the sacred impulse to express Him in some way. That is why the Christian world is full of gaudy pictures and twisted statues which seem, to many refined persons, more blasphemous than the secret volumes of an atheist. The trend of good is always towards Incarnation. But, on the other hand, those refined thinkers who worship the Devil, whether in the swamps of Jamaica or the salons of Paris, always insist upon the shapelessness, the wordlessness, the unutterable character of the abomination. They call him [...] "horror of emptiness," [...] as did the <b>black</b> <b>witch</b> in Stevenson's Dynamiter; they worship him as the unspeakable name; as the unbearable silence. They think of him as the void {{in the heart of the}} whirlwind; the cloud on the brain of the maniac; the toppling turrets of vertigo or the endless corridors of nightmare. It was the Christians who gave the Devil a grotesque and energetic outline, with sharp horns and spiked tail. It was the saints who drew Satan as comic and even lively. The Satanists never drew him at all.|$|E
50|$|The film {{begins with}} members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a {{box-shaped}} urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful <b>black</b> <b>witches.</b> In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.|$|R

Wicked Things are detailed in the sourcebook of the same name, the third supplement to Fairy Meat.|$|R

50|$|The {{novel is}} set in the town of Black Spring, New York (Beek in the {{original}} Dutch version), where its inhabitants are routinely terrorized by the ghost of the <b>Black</b> Rock <b>Witch.</b> The witch was formerly a woman by the name of Katherine van Wyler, who was put to death in 1664 and had her eyes and mouth sewn shut after death. She will randomly appear in places throughout Black Spring and the townpeople track her progress via the HEX mobile app, which they use to avoid her as much as possible. The town has several core rules and safeguards in place to ensure that a delicate balance is kept. Two of the most major rules is that no outsiders can ever learn about the <b>Black</b> Rock <b>Witch's</b> existence and her stitches must never be removed. Leaving the town is not an option, as being away for longer than a few days causes townspeople to become suicidal. The townspeople try to make do as best as possible and discourage new people from coming into town, but this is not always successful.|$|R
