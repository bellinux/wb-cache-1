50|$|The {{infrastructure}} requirements were {{drastically reduced}} during the mid-1990s, when CMOS mainframe designs replaced the older <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology.</b> IBM claimed that its newer mainframes could reduce data center energy costs {{for power and}} cooling, {{and that they could}} reduce physical space requirements compared to server farms.|$|E

The damage {{produced in the}} ICs in the real experiment can be underestimated if fast irradiations are carried out, while experiments done at the real dose rate are usually unpractical due to the still high total doses involved. In this work the sensitivity to LDRE of two <b>bipolar</b> <b>technologies</b> proposed for the ATLAS-SCT experiment at CERN is evaluated, finding one of them free of those effects. (12 refs) ...|$|R
50|$|Fairchild's Noyce and Texas Instrument's Kilby had {{independently}} {{invented the}} integrated circuit (IC) based on <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology.</b> In 1960, Noyce invented the planar integrated circuit. The industry preferred Fairchild's invention over Texas Instruments' because the transistors in planar ICs were interconnected {{by a thin}} film deposit, whereas Texas Instruments' invention required fine wires to connect the individual circuits. Noyce's invention was enabled by the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni.|$|E
50|$|An RTD can be {{fabricated}} using {{many different}} types of materials (such as III-V, type IV, II-VI semiconductor) and different types of resonant tunneling structures, such as the heavily doped p-n junction in Esaki diodes, double barrier, triple barrier, quantum well, or quantum wire. The structure and fabrication process of Si/SiGe resonant interband tunneling diodes are suitable for integration with modern Si complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and Si/SiGe heterojunction <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
50|$|A killer micro is a {{microprocessor-based}} {{machine that}} infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf. It originally {{referred to the}} replacement of vector supercomputers built with <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology</b> by Massively Parallel Processors (MPP) assembled from {{a larger number of}} lower performing microprocessors. These systems faced initial skepticism, {{based on the assumption that}} applications do not have significant parallelism, because of Amdahl's law, but the success of early systems such as nCUBE and the fast progress in microprocessor performance following Moore's law led to a fast replacement.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} phenomena {{which will}} ultimately limit miniaturization of planar bipolar integrated circuits are examined. The maximum packing density is obtained by minimizing the supply voltage {{and the size}} of the devices. The minimum transistor size is determined by junction breakdown, punch through and doping fluctuations. For circuits that are fully active the maximum number of circuit functions per chip is determined by power dissipation. The packing density of read-only memories becomes limited by the area occupied by devices and interconnections. The limitations of MOS and <b>bipolar</b> <b>technologies</b> are compared. It is concluded that read-only memories will reach approximately the same performance and packing density with MOS and <b>bipolar</b> <b>technologies,</b> while fully active circuits will reach the highest levels of integration with dynamic MOS or complementary MOS technologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of an electrostatic barrier in the oxide bulk on the radiation-induced degradation of <b>bipolar</b> <b>technologies</b> is investigated by performing a thermal annealing operation before switching the dose rate from high to low.

These devices and technology were {{the basis of the}} first integrated circuits; nonetheless, many of the scaling issues and underlying physical effects are integral to IC design, even after four decades of IC development. With these early generations of IC, process variability and parametric yield were an issue—a theme that will reemerge as a controlling factor in future IC technology as well.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{design to}} be {{produced}} in their newly set-up MOS fab in Worcester, was the MK1001, a simple shifter chip. This {{was followed by a}} 1k [...] PMOS aluminum-gate DRAM, the MK4006 that was manufactured in their Carrollton facility. Mostek had been working with Sprague Electric to develop the ion implantation process which provided a tremendous gain in the control of doping profiles. Using ion implantation, Mostek became an early leader in MOS manufacturing technology, while their competition was still mostly using the older <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology.</b> The resulting increased speed and lower cost of the MK4006 memory chip made it the runaway favorite to IBM and other mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers (cf.

5000|$|Process control issues—both for the {{intrinsic}} devices {{and all the}} associated parasitics—presented formidable challenges and mandated {{the development of a}} range of advanced physical models for process and device simulation. Starting in the late 1960s and into the 1970s, the modeling approaches exploited were dominantly one- and two-dimensional simulators. While TCAD in these early generations showed exciting promise in addressing the physics-oriented challenges of <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology,</b> the superior scalability and power consumption of MOS technology revolutionized the IC industry. By the mid-1980s, CMOS became the dominant driver for integrated electronics. Nonetheless, these early TCAD developments [...] set the stage for their growth and broad deployment as an essential toolset that has leveraged technology development through the VLSI and ULSI eras which are now the mainstream.|$|E
50|$|Amdahl perhaps enjoyed {{its best}} success during IBM's {{transition}} from bipolar to CMOS {{technology in the}} early to mid-1990s. The first generations of IBM's CMOS mainframe processors, the IBM 9672 G3 and G4, could not perform as well as those from the Enterprise System/9000 family, which were based on <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology,</b> giving Amdahl a temporary advantage. However, IBM's CMOS strategy paid off in the long run, allowing IBM's Poughkeepsie factory to produce even faster mainframes at lower cost as the technology matured. By the time IBM introduced its 64-bit zSeries 900 in 2000, Amdahl's hardware business could no longer compete with IBM with its Millennium and OmniFlex servers that only had 31-bit-addressing. In late 2000, Fujitsu/Amdahl announced that the company had no plans to invest the estimated US $1 billion (or more) to create an IBM-compatible 64-bit system.|$|E

40|$|A {{physical}} model is developed {{to quantify the}} contribution of oxide-trapped charge to enhanced low-dose-rate gain degradation in bipolar junction transistors. Multiple-trapping simulations show that space charge limited transport is partially responsible for low-dose-rate enhancement. At low dose rates, more holes are trapped near the silicon-oxide interface than at high dose rates, resulting in larger midgap voltage shifts at lower dose rates. The additional trapped charge near the interface may cause an exponential increase in excess base current, and a resultant decrease in current gain for some NPN <b>bipolar</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

5000|$|When {{explained}} visually, {{the bulb}} of percussion is {{visible on the}} ventral face {{as opposed to the}} dorsal face (where it is smoother) and considered to be on the [...] "inside" [...] of the parent core. The bulb of percussion is the primary feature that identifies the ventral surface of a flake or blade artifact. Locating its position reveals which is the proximal end of an artifact. Along the proximal end there may be the formation of ripple marks. These ripple marks allow for the direction traveled by the applied force through the lithic when it was detached. Typically, the striking of the flake is produced by knapping (or flintknapping), a process in which requires the user to chip away material from high-silica stones like [...] "flint" [...] in a carefully controlled manner with special tools to produce sharp projectile points or tools. A common characteristic that is associated with the bulb of applied force is a bulbar scar. This scar is from a small chip or flake on the bulb. This is known as an eraillure flake scar. It is produced during the initial impact of flake removal. Occasionally, {{there is more than one}} contact point on a striking platform which creates a series of superimposed waves. The eraillure flake is a chip removed through contact of a dominant force wave that creates the conchoidal flake and inferior waves. Bulb of applied force is not produced by <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology</b> or wedging initiation.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a general}} lack of {{research}} concerning the technological aspect of pebble stone artifacts throughout the Northern Plains. As a result, {{little is known about the}} manufacture of these materials except that it is generally accepted that <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology</b> was the predominant manufacturing technique used because of the small size of the pebbles. However, research regarding <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology</b> has also been limited. Furthermore, many researchers have indicated that this technique is crude, poorly controlled, and that it only supplies a marginal product. The research outlined within this thesis examines the manufacture and archaeological significance of pebble stone materials. The ultimate aim of this is to provide some clarification regarding the use of the bipolar method in relation to pebble stone materials. Therefore, the mode of manufacture of pebble stone artifacts will be, in part, accomplished by an examination of experimentally replicated split pebbles using the bipolar technique. As a final point, considering the obvious wide geographic distribution and frequency of use of <b>bipolar</b> <b>technology</b> and pebble stone materials it is unlikely that this technique was thought of so unfavorably by pre-contact groups or that pebble materials were considered marginal or used only when superior quality raw material was not available...|$|E
