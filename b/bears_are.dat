5|$|<b>Bears</b> <b>are</b> carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} Ursidae. They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. <b>Bears</b> <b>are</b> found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.|$|E
5|$|Bears, {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

50|$|AG <b>Bear</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in several colors. The traditional <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> brown. Other <b>bear</b> colors included white and grey. Several other <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> released over time, including GrandPaw AG and GrandMaw AG, Bearonica AG's sister, and several Baby AG's.|$|R
50|$|Big <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> {{a big old}} Teddy Bear loves {{gardening}} and cooking and can usually be found in his vegetable patch or kitchen. Although big and clumsy, Big <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> a good listener and is a loyal and trusted friend. Big <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> voiced by Wayne Forester.|$|R
5|$|The Hitmen {{are active}} within the community, {{supporting}} numerous programs and charities. They host an annual teddy bear toss each December. The 13th annual Petro Canada Teddy Bear Toss, held on , 2007, saw what the Hitmen {{claim to be}} a world record 26,919 bears tossed on to the ice by 17,341 fans. The <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> donated to charities throughout the Calgary area. A few of the <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> personally delivered by the players to the Alberta Children's Hospital, an event highly anticipated by patients attending the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Brown bears {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in {{disputes over}} carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> much rarer than with brown bears, because {{of differences in}} habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common, polar <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.|$|E
5|$|Several bear {{species are}} {{dangerous}} to humans, especially {{in areas where}} they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans. Injuries caused by <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> rare, but are widely reported. Bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.|$|E
50|$|The Atlas <b>bear</b> <b>was</b> Africa's only native {{bear that}} survived into modern times. Once inhabiting the Atlas Mountains and {{neighbouring}} areas, from Morocco to Libya, {{the animal is}} now thought to be extinct. The Atlas <b>bear</b> <b>was</b> brownish black in colour, and lacked a white mark on the muzzle. The fur on the underparts was reddish orange. The fur was 4 - 5 in long. The muzzle and claws were shorter {{than those of the}} American black <b>bear,</b> though it <b>was</b> stouter and thicker in body. The Atlas <b>bear</b> <b>was</b> said to have been 9 feet long and weighed up to 1000 lbs kg. It apparently fed on roots, acorns and nuts. The Atlas <b>bear</b> <b>was</b> said to have been mostly herbivorous, but since most <b>bears</b> today <b>are</b> omnivores, the Atlas <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> believed {{to have been able to}} eat meat as well.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E
5|$|Extant <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} sixty {{countries}} {{primarily in the}} Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the Andean region. The sun bear's range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. The Atlas bear, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> {{opportunistic}} omnivores {{and consume}} more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
50|$|The Merced <b>Bears</b> <b>were</b> a {{minor league}} {{baseball}} team in the Class C California League in 1941. <b>Bears</b> <b>is</b> also {{the name of the}} athletic teams of Merced High School.|$|R
25|$|Jazz <b>Bear</b> <b>is</b> the mascot for the Utah Jazz, a National Basketball Association (NBA) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Salt Lake City. Jazz <b>Bear</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced to the}} league on November 4, 1994.|$|R
50|$|The Russian <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} {{national}} personification for Russia (as {{well as the}} former Soviet Union) despite the country having no appointed national animal. The brown <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> Finland's national animal.|$|R
5|$|Polar <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> {{the iconic}} symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use as a last resort. A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011. Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3,000 polar bears, with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E
5|$|The drop bear is an {{imaginary}} creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of dancing <b>bears</b> <b>was</b> made illegal in India in 1972 {{but in the}} decades that followed sloth <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> still poached from the wild and forced to perform for tourists.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. <b>Bear</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} by Schuco, and Little <b>Bear</b> <b>was</b> {{a special edition}} Steiff, [...] "Jackie Bear." [...] Both were purchased in the 1950s {{with the help of}} Dare's brother, Blaine Wright.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Asian Black Bears entered Hata Town, {{in search}} of food. Crops of local farmers {{suffered}} a lot of damage. Between 10 and 15 <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> caught using mustard spray, and then the <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> returned to the mountains. The <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> tracked with radar tracking technology, and follow-up surveys <b>were</b> conducted. <b>Bears</b> continue to enter Hata, due to dwindling food supplies in their habitats.|$|R
5|$|The {{peoples of}} eastern Asia use bears' body parts and {{secretions}} (notably their gallbladders and bile) {{as part of}} traditional Chinese medicine. More than 12,000 <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> thought to be kept on farms in China, Vietnam, and South Korea {{for the production of}} bile. Trade in bear products is prohibited under CITES, but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in Canada, the United States and Australia.|$|E
5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. <b>Bears</b> <b>are</b> known to use sit-and-wait tactics {{as well as}} active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti, and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E

50|$|The Louisiana bear {{hunting season}} has {{remained}} closed since 1988. From 1964 through 1967, 161 black <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> live-trapped in Cook County, Minnesota and {{released in the}} Mississippi and Atchafalaya River bottoms of Louisiana {{in an effort to}} restock black bear to the state. By 1968 there was evidence that the translocated <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> reproducing. However, most of the relocated <b>bears</b> <b>were</b> killed on roads, as nuisance animals, or during recapture.|$|R
50|$|Big <b>Bear</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{released in}} 1992. It {{should be noted}} that despite Red Star's resemblance to Colonel Brekhov, both Red Star and Big <b>Bear</b> <b>were</b> entirely new characters developed for the action figure line.|$|R
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar <b>bears</b> <b>are</b> protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bears</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} bulky {{and robust}} animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|Evergreen oaks, rhododendrons, and {{conifers}} predominate in the hills. sal (Shorea robusta), silk {{cotton tree}} (Bombax ciliata), Dalbergia sissoo, Mallotus philippensis, Acacia catechu, Bauhinia racemosa, and Bauhinia variegata (camel's foot tree) {{are some other}} trees of the region. Albizia chinensis, the sweet sticky flowers of which are favoured by sloth <b>bears,</b> <b>are</b> {{also part of the}} region's flora. A decade long study by Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala concluded that the Valley of Flowers is endowed with 520 species of higher plants (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes), of these 498 are flowering plants. The park has many species of medicinal plants including Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Picrorhiza kurroa, Aconitum violaceum, Polygonatum multiflorum, Fritillaria roylei, and Podophyllum hexandrum. In the summer season of 2016, a large portion of forests in Uttarakhand caught fires and rubbled to ashes during Uttarakhand forest fires incident which resulted in the damage of forest resources worth billions of rupees and death of 6 people with hundreds of wild animals died during fires.|$|E
50|$|The grizzly <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> {{the state}} animal of Montana. The California golden <b>bear</b> <b>is</b> the state animal of California. Both animals are sub-species {{of the brown}} bear, and the species was extirpated from the latter state.|$|R
