40|$|How does {{information}} sharing between lenders affect borrowers repayment behavior? We show-in a laboratory credit market-that {{information sharing}} increases repayment rates, as borrowers anticipate {{that a good}} credit record improves their access to credit. This incentive effect of information sharing is substantial when repayment is not third-party enforceable and lending is dominated by one-shot transactions. If, however, repeat interaction between borrowers and lenders is feasible, the incentive effect of credit reporting is negligible, as bilateral banking relationships discipline <b>borrowers.</b> <b>Information</b> sharing nevertheless affects market outcome by weakening lenders' ability to extract rents from relationships.

40|$|Peer-to-peer lending has {{sprung up}} in recent years, defined by its {{flexibility}} {{to meet the needs}} of loan applicants from a range of financial backgrounds. Institutional investors’ reluctance to fund small business owners has facilitated the widespread acceptance of peer-to-peer lending, which represents a convenient investment medium for prospective borrowers, individual investors, and P 2 P companies. Though, the inclusive model inherent in P 2 P lending breeds practical concerns for investors who expect to maximize returns while minimizing default risks. This paper proceeds to explore the value of information, the importance of information in principle-agent relationships, and how information must be leveraged further by P 2 P platforms to maintain high returns on investments for individual investors. Due to the importance of accurate, up-to-date <b>borrower</b> <b>information,</b> the literature herein suggests that P 2 P companies should outsource the procurement of <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> to increase investment values and attract larger volumes of credit from individual investors. As a result of the absence of academic literature that explores the incorporation of microfinance institutions’ core competencies into the P 2 P business model, advantages of this business partnership are thus considered on a foundational level, leaving room for further empirical research in the future. Hence, this paper represents a working solution to be explored over time...|$|E

40|$|In many countries, lenders voluntarily provide {{information}} about their borrowers to private credit registries. A recent World Bank survey reveals that the display of a lender's own <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> is often not reciprocated. That is, access to these registries {{does not require the}} prior provision of proprietary data. We argue that incumbent lenders release information about a portion of their profitable borrowers for strategic reasons. The reasoning is that the pool of unreleased borrowers becomes characterised by a severe adverse selection problem. This prevents the entrants from bidding for all the incumbent's profitable borrowers and reduces their scale of entry. Copyright 2006 The Authors.

We use data on individual loans by the largest international banks to their various countries of operations to examine whether banks’ access to <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> affected the transmission of the financial shock across borders. The simultaneous use of country and bank-fixed effects allows us to disentangle credit supply and demand and to control for general bank characteristics. We find that during the crisis banks continued to lend more to countries that are geographically close, where they are integrated into a network of domestic co-lenders, and where they had gained experience by building relationships with (repeat) borrowers. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a model analyzing how asymmetric information {{problems in a}} bank-loan market may evolve {{over the age of}} a borrowing firm. The model predicts a life-cycle pattern for banks ’ interest rate markup. Young firms pay a low or negative markup, thereafter the markup increases until it falls for old firms. Furthermore, the pattern of the life-cycle depends on the informational advantage of the inside bank and when bank competition yields more dispersed <b>borrower</b> <b>information.</b> By applying a new measure of the informational advantage of inside banks and a large sample of small Norwegian firms, we find support for the predicted markup pattern.

30|$|In a lending {{market with}} {{multiple}} lenders and multiple <b>borrowers,</b> <b>information</b> asymmetry (Akerlof 1970) {{is a common}} problem. Borrowers typically have more accurate information than lenders about their willingness and ability to repay a loan. Information asymmetry will not only affect lenders’ actions but also the entire market’s efficiency. Since the expected gains from the loan contract are a function of both the pricing and the probability of repayment, when lenders can’t distinguish good borrowers from bad borrowers, all borrowers would be charged the same interest rate that reflects their pooled experience. Such a scenario will cause the adverse selection problem (good borrowers {{drop out of the}} market due to the high interest rate) and the moral hazard problem (borrowers have incentive to default since there is no future consequence) (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981).|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., {{the process}} by which a {{mortgage}} is secured by a borrower is called origination. This involves the borrower submitting a loan application and documentation related to his/her financial history and/or credit history to the underwriter, which is typically a bank. Sometimes, a third party is involved, such as a mortgage broker. This entity takes the <b>borrower's</b> <b>information</b> and reviews a number of lenders, selecting the ones that will best {{meet the needs of the}} consumer. Origination is regulated by laws including the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (1974). Credit scores are often used, and these must comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Additionally, various state laws may apply. Underwriters receive the application and determine whether the loan can be accepted. If the underwriter is not satisfied with the documentation provided by the borrower, additional documentation and conditions may be imposed, called stipulations.|$|R

40|$|We exploit {{detailed}} data on approved and rejected small business loans {{to assess the}} impact of the introduction of a credit registry in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our findings are threefold. First, mandatory information sharing tightens lending at the extensive margin as more applications are rejected, in particular in areas with strong credit market competition. These rejections are increasingly based on hard information—especially positive <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> from the new registry—and less on soft information. Second, lending standards also tighten at the intensive margin: the registry leads to smaller, shorter and more expensive loans. Third, the tightening of lending along both margins improves loan quality. Default rates go down in particular in high competition areas and for first-time borrowers. This suggests that a reduction in adverse selection is an important channel through which information sharing affects loan quality...|$|E
40|$|Three {{development}} finance institutions (DFIs) which {{operate in}} KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province were assessed in 1996 / 97 {{to see how}} they could improve financial viability and outreach to emerging farmers, agribusiness and micro-entrepreneurs. Improved service quality and emphasis on mobilising savings would help clients and enable the DFIs to diversify their portfolios. Better access to branches and lower loan approval times (improved screening and administrative procedures) could also lower client transaction costs. Charging a suitable interest rate spread is necessary but not sufficient for lenders to achieve subsidy independence. Reducing arrears through stricter loan contract enforcement (borrower accountability for loan repayment, lower collateral specific risks, secure and transferable collateral) will also promote financial viability. Providing both savings and loan services together would reduce borrower access costs, and allow savings to serve as a form of collateral and <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> for lenders.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} (1) {{the change}} in commercial banks ’ risk taking as states in the United States removed restrictions on bank branching within state borders and (2) the channels through which the removal of these restrictions affects bank risk taking. I find that, after the liberalization of branching restrictions, banks that do not expand their branch network into other markets decrease risk taking, while expanding banks do not change risk taking. Existing theories, which focus {{on the importance of}} market structure on risk taking, are not able to explain this pattern. Therefore I provide a theoretical framework, building on theories from organizational economics, which can account for this by showing that non-expanding banks have a comparative advantage in lending to informationally difficult borrowers, which induces them to lower risk taking as competitors expand. Empirical evidence supports this channel and highlights the importance of <b>borrower</b> <b>information,</b> since nonexpanding banks decrease risk taking more as competitors expand if they operate in a county with more informationally difficult borrowers...|$|E
40|$|Conference for helpful {{comments}} and suggestions. The analysis expressed herein {{does not necessarily}} reflect {{the views of the}} Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve We use a large matched sample of individual loans, borrowers, and banks to investigate whether bank financial health affects terms of lending, holding constant proxies for <b>borrower</b> risk and <b>information</b> costs. In particular, we focus on measuring effects of borrower and bank characteristics on loan interest rates; we also investigate implications of borrower and bank characteristics for indirect measures of credit availability. Our principal findings are six. First, even after controlling for <b>borrower</b> risk and <b>information</b> costs, the cost of borrowing from low-capital banks is higher than the cost of borrowing from well-capitalized banks. Second, this cost difference is traceable to <b>borrowers</b> for which <b>information</b> costs and incentive problems are a priori important. Third, weak bank effects on the cost of funds are higher in periods of rising interest rates. Fourth, estimated weak bank effects remain even after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity in the matching of borrowers and banks. Fifth, weak bank effects are quantitatively important only for high-information-cos...|$|R
40|$|Many {{believe that}} a key {{innovation}} by the Grameen Bank is to encourage borrowers {{to help each other}} in hard times.

We derive a lending mechanism which efficiently induces mutual insurance. It is necessary for borrowers to submit reports about each other to achieve efficiency. Such cross-reporting increases the bargaining power of unsuccessful borrowers, and is robust to collusion against the bank. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{literature}} on the wealth effects of bank loan announcements by examining the association between these wealth effects and the quality of governance of the borrowers and the opaqueness of the information market for the borrower’s stock. Using an extensive sample of over 1000 commercial loan announcements over a period of more than 20 years, we find that loan announcement returns {{are more likely to be}} positive for firms with weak corporate governance, a result that is consistent with the argument that banks are substitute monitors for good governance for borrowers. We also find that bank loan announcements are more likely to have positive wealth effects for firms that are informationally opaque. The relations between loan announcement returns, borrower governance, and <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> opaqueness appear to have changed in recent years, a result that is consistent with the evidence presented by Fields, Fraser, Berry, and Byers (2006) that the positive response to loan announcements has decreased over time...|$|E
30|$|The {{association}} between information-sharing bureaus and financial access {{can be seen}} from the view of adverse selection (from lenders) on the one hand and the perspective of moral hazard (from borrowers) on the other. Information-sharing agencies provide lenders of financial institutions with <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> and credit histories that enable the reduction of substantial interest rates, which were the previous consequence of adverse selection on the part of financial institutions. When borrowers are granted credit, they automatically become liable to moral hazard, because their economic activities related to granted credit could be concealed in order to reduce compliance with their financial obligations towards the bank or lender. The responsibility therefore falls on the credit bureaus to discipline borrowers on the severe consequences of not complying with their periodic financial obligations. It is within this framework that information-sharing bureaus reduce moral hazard in borrowers, essentially by educating them on the perils of debt defaults and resorting to the informal financial sector as a sustainable alternative to the formal banking sector.|$|E
40|$|To {{transfer}} {{loans from}} one debtor to another debtor, banks might transmit <b>borrower</b> <b>information</b> which is {{collected in the}} lending process to potential acquirers. In this paper, we investigate the importance of banks in {{the effectiveness of the}} takeover mechanism and hence in corporate governance. Using unsolicited takeovers between 1992 and 2003, we find that bank lending intensity and bank client network (the number of firms that the bank deals with) have a significant and positive effect on the probability of a borrower firm becoming a target. We find that this effect is enhanced in cases where the target and acquirer have a relationship with the same bank and is robust to the inclusion of several firm characteristics including the presence of large external shareholders. Moreover, takeover completion rates are positively related to bank lending intensity. Finally, we find that the equity market views takeovers where the target and the acquirer deal with the same bank more positively relative to takeovers with no bank involvement. Overall, the evidence supports the view that banks increase the disciplining role of the market for corporate control. ...|$|E
40|$|We study loan {{enforcement}} in informal credit markets with multiple lenders but no sharing of credit histories, and derive {{the dynamics of}} loan size and interest rates for relational lending. In {{the presence of a}} sufficient fraction of ‘natural defaulters’, the rest of the market can be incentivized against default by micro-rationing—sharper credit limits and possibly higher interest rates that serve as gateways into new borrowing relationships. When there are too few natural defaulters in the market, this can be supplemented by macro-rationing—random exclusion of some <b>borrowers.</b> When <b>information</b> collection is endogenized, multiple equilibria may arise. ...|$|R
30|$|Information {{protection}} is also of particular value to Internet credit services. First, identity matching results have commercial value. For example, 100 Credit provides collection support service to help financial institutions contact borrowers. Financial institutions may have outdated contact information, {{which can be}} updated through identity matching. If the <b>borrowers</b> contact <b>information</b> is sold directly to lenders, they can resell the information even to their competitors (and contact information is not as dynamic as rating information). To avoid such deeds reducing {{the value of the}} identity matching information produced by 100 Credit, they provide collection support as a service rather than selling borrowers’ recent contact information.|$|R
40|$|We offer a novel {{explanation}} for collateral {{based on the}} notion that lenders make discretionary credit decisions that are too conservative. There is no <b>borrower</b> asymmetric <b>information</b> or moral hazard. Rather, the problem is that if lenders cannot extract the full surplus from the projects they finance (e. g., due to credit market competition), they may reject low-, but positive-NPV projects. Collateral provides lenders with additional protection in bad states, thus improving their payoffs from projects with a relatively high likelihood of bad states and thus precisely from those projects that are inefficiently rejected. Our model is consistent with existing empirical evidence and provides new empirical predictions. ...|$|R
