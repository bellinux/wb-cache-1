Here we examined potential interactions between a recombinant 21 -kDa bioactive fragment of BPI, rBPI 21, and the gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. rBPI 21 bound to pneumococci and pneumolysin (Ply) in a direct and specific fashion. We observed an enhanced inflammatory response in mouse macrophages when rBPI 21 was combined with killed pneumococci or supernatant from overnight growth of pneumococci. In addition, rBPI 21 augmented the proapoptotic activity of Ply+ (but not Ply−) pneumococci in TLR 4 -defective murine macrophages (known to be defective also in their apoptotic response to pneumolysin) in a tumor necrosis factor alpha-dependent manner. rBPI 21 also enhanced the association of pneumococci with murine macrophages. In a model of invasive pneumococcal disease in TLR 4 -defective mice, the intranasal administration of rBPI 21 following intranasal inoculation of Ply+ pneumococci both enhanced upper respiratory tract cell apoptosis and prolonged survival.

We have recently demonstrated that epithelia cells express the anti-infective molecule bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). Here, we extend these findings to examine molecular mechanisms of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) BPI expression and function. Initial experiments revealed a variance of BPI mRNA and protein expression among various IEC lines. Studies of BPI promoter expression in IECs identified regulatory regions of the BPI promoter and revealed a prominent role for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein and especially Sp 1 /Sp 3 in the basal regulation of BPI. To assess the functional significance of this protein, we generated an IEC line stably transfected with full-length BPI. We demonstrated that, whereas epithelia express markedly less <b>BPI</b> <b>protein</b> than neutrophils, epithelial BPI contributes significantly to bacterial killing and attenuating bacterial-elicted proinflammatory signals. Additional studies in murine tissue ex vivo revealed that BPI is diffusely expressed along the crypt-villous axis and that epithelial BPI levels decrease {{along the length of the}} intestine.

To further define the mechanism of epithelial SPLUNC 1 -mediated antibacterial action, we carried out studies to determine how SPLUNC 1 pro-tects the host from acute respiratory infections. P. aeruginosa treated with recombinant human SPLUNC 1 protein showed de-creased growth in vitro. This antibacterial activity was due to growth inhibition, as a consequence of a SPLUNC 1 -induced in-crease in bacterial cell permeability. Removal of SPLUNC 1 allowed the recovery of P. aeruginosa and suggested no permanent cell injury or direct killing of bacteria. Further investigation showed coating of bacterial cells by SPLUNC 1. We suggest that this “bacterial cell coating ” is necessary for the bacteriostatic function of SPLUNC 1. Additionally, we demonstrated a novel role for SPLUNC 1 as a chemoattractant that facilitated migration of macrophages and neutrophils. Taking the findings together, we pro-pose synergistic roles for human SPLUNC 1 as an antibacterial agent with bacteriostatic and chemotactic activities.

40|$|Abstract: The bactericidal/permeability-increas-ing protein (BPI) is a 456 -residue {{cationic}} protein {{produced only}} by precursors of polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMN) and {{is stored in}} the primary granules of these cells. The potent (nM) cytotoxicity of BPI is limited to gram-negative bacteria (GNB), reflecting the high affinity (F 10 nM) of BPI for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The biological effects of isolated BPI are linked to complex formation with LPS. Binding of BPI to live bacteria via LPS causes immediate growth arrest. Actual killing coincides with later damage to the inner membrane. Complex formation of BPI with cell-asssociated or cell-free LPS inhibits all LPS-induced host cell responses. BPI-blocking antibod-ies abolish the potent activity of whole PMN lysates and inflammatory fluids against BPI-sensitive GNB. The antibacterial and the anti-endotoxin activities of BPI are fully expressed by the amino terminal half of the molecule. These properties of BPI have prompted preclinical and subsequent clinical test-ing of recombinant amino-terminal fragments of BPI. In animals, human <b>BPI</b> <b>protein</b> products protect against lethal injections of isolated LPS and inocula of GNB. Phase I trials in healthy human volunteers and multiple Phase I/II clinical trials have been completed or are in progress (severe pediatric meningococcemia, hemorrhagic trauma, partial hepatectomy, severe peritoneal infections, and cystic fibrosis) and two phase III trials (menin-gococcemia and hemorrhagic trauma) have been initiated. In none of G 900 normal and severely ill individuals have issues of safety or immunogenicity been encountered. Preliminary evidence points to overall benefit in BPI-treated patients.

The latter effect of LBP requires the C-terminal domain for delivery of LPS to CD 14, so we postulated that the C-terminal region of BPI may serve a similar delivery function but to distinct targets. LBP, holoBPI, BPI- 21, and LBP/BPI chimeras were compared {{for their ability to}} promote uptake by human phagocytes of an encapsulated, phagocytosis-resistant strain of Escherichia coli. We show that only bacteria preincubated with holoBPI are ingested by neutrophils and monocytes. These findings suggest that, when extracellular holoBPI is bound via its N-terminal domain to Gram-negative bacteria, the C-terminal domain promotes bacterial attachment to neutrophils and monocytes, leading to phagocytosis. Therefore, analogous {{to the role of the}} C-terminal domain of LBP in delivery of LPS to CD 14, the C-terminal domain of BPI may fulfill a similar function in BPI-specific disposal pathways for Gram-negative bacteria...|$|R

Here we investigated the immune modulating effects of OCX- 36 and enzymatically digested OCX- 36 (dOCX- 36) in vitro and in a mouse model of endotoxemia. OCX- 36 alone dose-dependently induced both TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) production by RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells, and this immunostimulatory effect was reduced by enzymatic digestion. In the presence of LPS, dOCX- 36 was more effective than intact OCX- 36 at reducing LPS-induced secretion of TNF-α from RAW 264. 7 cells, but did not reduce NO production. In contrast, OCX- 36 increased LPS-induced NO production, both in the presence and absence of FBS, PCR array analysis confirmed that OCX- 36 and dOCX- 36 differentially regulated genes involved in innate immunity, and dOCX- 36 down-regulated the expression of genes involved in LPS signaling and inflammatory responses.

The recently determined crystal structure of human BPI permits a structure/function analysis, presented here, of the conserved regions of these two proteins sequences. In the seven known sequences of BPI and LBP, 102 residues are completely conserved and may be classified in terms of location, side-chain chemistry, and interactions with other residues. We find that the most highly conserved regions lie at the interfaces between the tertiary structural elements that help create two apolar lipid-binding pockets.

Recently, antiangiogenic properties were ascribed to an endogenous molecule that until only recently was known for its anti-bacterial effects. This molecule, bactericidal/permeability-increasing <b>protein</b> (<b>BPI),</b> that was discovered as a bacterial permeabilizing and lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing protein, was found to inhibit angiogenesis by specific induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells. This paper gives a short introduction on angiogenesis and reviews the current knowledge on BPI as an angiogenesis inhibitor. In addition, the issue of commonality between antibacterial and anti-angiogenic functions will be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Antineutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCA) are {{a heterogeneous}} group of circulating antibodies {{directed toward the}} cytoplasmic constituents of neutrophils and monocytes. ANCA have been de scribed in various diseases including idiopathic systemic vasculitides, connective tissue diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune liver diseases, infectious diseases, and some drugs. ANCA recognize different target antigens such as proteinase 3 (PR 3 -ANCA), myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA), cathepsin G, lactoferrin, bactericidal/permeability-increasing <b>protein</b> (<b>BPI),</b> and some others. However, only PR 3 -ANCA and MPO-ANCA are closely associated with systemic vasculitides, in particular Wegener´s granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis and its renal limited manifestation, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental data strongly support a pathogenic role for ANCA in vasculitis and glomerulonephritis...|$|R
40|$|The {{bactericidal}} / permeability-increasing <b>protein</b> (<b>BPI)</b> ofneu-trophils and BPI fragments {{neutralize the}} effects of isolated Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides both in vitro and in vivo. Since endotoxin most commonly enters the host as con-stituents of invading Gram-negative bacteria, we raised the question: Can BPI and its bioactive fragments also protect against whole bacteria? To determine whether the bactericidal and endotoxin-neutralizing activities of BPI / fragments are ex-pressed when Gram-negative bacteria are introduced to the complex environment of whole blood we examined {{the effects of}} added BPI and proteolytically prepared and recombinant NH 2 -terminal fragments on: (a) the fate of serum-resistant en-capsulated Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseu-domonas aeruginosa that survive the antibacterial actions o...|$|R
40|$|Bactericidal {{permeability}} increasing <b>protein</b> (<b>BPI),</b> a 55 - 60 kDa protein, {{first reported}} in 1975, has {{gone a long}} way as a protein with multifunctional roles. Its classical role in neutralizing endotoxin (LPS) raised high hopes among septic shock patients. Today, BPI is not just a LPS-neutralizing protein, but a protein with diverse functions. These functions can be as varied as inhibition of endothelial cell growth and inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, or as an anti-angiogenic, chemoattractant or opsonization agent. Though the literature available is extremely limited, it is fascinating to look into how BPI is gaining major importance as a signalling molecule. In this review, we briefly summarize the recent research focused on the multiple roles of BPI and its use as a therapeutic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The bactericidal/permeability-increas-ing <b>protein</b> (<b>BPI)</b> is an endotoxin-binding neutro-phil leukocyte-granule protein with {{antibacterial}} and anti-endotoxin properties. A recombinant form of BPI (rBPI 21) {{has been}} developed and is being tested as a therapeutic agent to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections and exposure to Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a target antigen of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCA are present in cys-tic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appears associated with a higher in-flammatory disease activity and greater organ dam-age. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at other neutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate in-flammation by nonspecific effects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCA may further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI to promote clearance of Gram-neg-ative bacteria and bacterial-associated endotoxin...|$|R
