5|$|On 14 July 2016 it was {{reported}} that the AH-64 had successfully completed testing of the MBDA <b>Brimstone</b> anti-armor missile.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, {{both the}} Sea Eagle anti-ship missile and the ALARM {{anti-radiation}} missile that previously equipped the RSAF's Tornados had been withdrawn from service. As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, {{such as the}} short range air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the <b>Brimstone</b> and Storm Shadow cruise missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient. A {{possible}} source of the name is the bright yellow male of the <b>brimstone</b> (Gonepteryx rhamni); another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during {{the spring and summer}} butter season while the grass was growing.|$|E
50|$|A local {{story goes}} {{to say that}} the bass of the organ was so low, the mortar in between the <b>brimstones</b> started to brittle to nothing.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{not being}} part of the movie line, <b>Brimstone's</b> design is based on a {{motorcycle}} from the Revenge of the Fallen film seen in Mikaela's garage.|$|R
50|$|Often {{seen with}} Undermine, who also {{transformed}} into a prehistoric saurian, <b>Brimstone's</b> chief role in the series {{was that of a}} loyal underling and aerial scout. He is not very bright.|$|R
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification {{to perform in}} medium level operations that the RAF adopted in the 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the <b>Brimstone</b> anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} <b>brimstone</b> in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

50|$|This site is ecologically diverse {{boulder clay}} woodland, {{with a range}} of wildflowers, {{including}} oxlips and the uncommon green hellebore. There are butterlies such as <b>brimstones,</b> large whites, orange-tips and speckled woods.|$|R
50|$|Gonepteryx is a genus of {{butterfly}} in the Pieridae family. They live in Europe, Asia, and Northern Africa. They {{are commonly}} known as <b>brimstones</b> for the bright yellow colour of the wings of most species.|$|R
5000|$|Fifteen {{species of}} {{butterfly}} {{have been recorded}} in this wood, including <b>brimstones,</b> speckled woods and purple hairstreaks. There are many wild cherry trees, and twenty-two seasonal ponds, which have scarce and protected great crested newts.|$|R
25|$|<b>Brimstone</b> {{was used}} {{extensively}} during Operation Ellamy over Libya in 2011. According to a British Ministry of Defence News report, dated 26 March 2011, RAF Tornado GR4 aircraft launched several <b>Brimstone</b> missiles over {{the towns of}} Misrata and Ajdabiya destroying {{a total of five}} armoured vehicles belonging to the Gaddafi regime. Sixty <b>Brimstone</b> were fired in the first four weeks of the Libya campaign, out of 110 <b>Brimstone</b> fired in all operations up to that time. This prompted the MoD to ask MBDA to convert more missiles to the dual-mode version. 150 dual-mode missiles had been ordered in December 2010, but according to the Royal United Services Institute, stocks of usable dual-mode missiles fell to single figures at one stage of the Libya campaign. The 500th dual-mode <b>Brimstone</b> was delivered in March 2012, at which time over 200 had been fired in combat. The single-mode missile was not fired in combat until 15 September 2011 when a pair of RAF Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron fired 22 missiles (including a salvo of 12 by one aircraft) against an armoured column near Sebha/Sabha, 400 miles south of Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|In November 2016, the German Air Force {{announced}} {{as part of}} a closer cooperation between Germany and the UK to procure <b>Brimstone</b> 2 dual mode missiles for their fleet of Eurofighter aircraft from 2019 on. Germany decided against their own missile development as the <b>Brimstone</b> 2 missile already meets 90% of the demanded requirements.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brimstones</b> first {{commercial}} release was in The Netherlands on 12 January 2017, becoming Martin Koolhovens fifth consecutive hit film. It was also released on March 10, 2017 in selected theaters and {{video on demand}} in the United States.|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} {{large number of}} species of dragonfly and damselfly are recorded, as well as good populations of southern aeshna, common sympetrum and common blue damselfly. The emperor dragonfly visits occasionally. Patches of nettle and thistle attract many butterflies and teasel attracts <b>brimstones</b> and encourages goldfinches.|$|R
50|$|Sylvester Marston {{was born}} in Ontario, Canada. He {{was a member of}} Baron <b>Brimstone's</b> Satan Squad when they fought Machine Man. He later joined the Enforcers and fought Spider-Man. He was {{impersonated}} by the Eel as part of a plot involving Daredevil, Mister Hyde, and the Enforcers.|$|R
25|$|In March 2005, <b>Brimstone</b> entered {{service with}} No. 31 Squadron RAF. Full Operational Capability (FOC) was {{declared}} for the Tornado GR4 in December 2005 The first operational sortie of dual-mode <b>Brimstone</b> was over Iraq {{as part of}} Operation Telic on 18 December 2008 by a Tornado GR4 of IX(B) Squadron. It was first fired in combat in June 2009, the month that the Tornado GR4's of 12 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick.|$|E
25|$|Each launch system {{incorporates}} three rails, i.e. {{one system}} carries three missiles. This allows a single aircraft to carry {{large numbers of}} missiles; for example, a Typhoon could carry up to six launch systems, one each on six individual pylons, which gives a maximum payload of eighteen <b>Brimstone</b> missiles, {{in addition to a}} useful air-to-air payload. The missile is carried by the Tornado GR4 in RAF service. In February 2014 the National Audit Office warned of a possible capability gap under existing plans to fit <b>Brimstone</b> to Typhoon in 2021, two years after the Tornado retired; in June 2014 the MoD announced a study to accelerate this to 2018 and look at a common launcher that could also launch SPEAR Cap 3. MBDA have fired test rounds from an MQ-9 Reaper and are studying the use of <b>Brimstone</b> on attack helicopters and from surface launchers. Both the US and France have expressed interest in buying it for their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, Tornado GR4 strike {{aircraft}} of No. 2 Squadron RAF began flying armed sorties over Iraq {{in support of}} Operation Shader, the UK's contribution to the Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On September 30, the aircraft flew their first bombing raids, engaging a heavy artillery position with a Paveway IV laser-guided bomb and an armed pickup truck with a <b>Brimstone</b> air-to-ground missile. <b>Brimstone</b> is the preferred weapon {{for these kinds of}} targets because it is the only air-launched low-fragmentation fire-and-forget weapon that is effective against moving targets that the allied inventory possesses.|$|E
50|$|These woods {{are home}} to species {{including}} chaffinch, robin, yellowhammer, greenfinch, blackbird and, during the summer, chiffchaff.The site is an important refuge for birds, with Sparrowhawk (Accipitier nisus), Green Woodpecker (Picus viridis),Long Tailed Tit (Aegithalos caudatus), Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and Redwing (Turdus iliacus) recorded as wellas a good variety of small species. This {{is also a good}} site for butterflies including peacocks and <b>brimstones.</b>|$|R
25|$|Karou and Akiva {{attempt to}} {{infiltrate}} Jael's lodgings, but are expected. However, {{using the same}} spell Akiva used to synchronise the burning of <b>Brimstone's</b> portals, {{they are able to}} set an incendiary charge on Jael and force him to return to Eretz unarmed. Zuzana and Mik wish for Eliza to be returned to her best possible self, and she regains her memories as Elazael and transforms into a Seraphim.|$|R
5000|$|Upon realizing Karou's identity, Akiva defies {{his brother}} and sister, who want Karou dead. In a {{confrontation}} {{that takes place in}} public, exposing angels to the human world, Akiva sends Karou off to safety from his siblings. In Akiva's flashbacks, the truth is unveiled - <b>Brimstone's</b> business was to build new bodies using the teeth he collects, by which means he was able to endlessly resurrect fallen chimaera soldiers in the war against the seraphim, and [...] "Karou" [...] is simply the human incarnation of a deceased chimaera - born into a human body using the baby teeth once mentioned by Izil. Karou's original identity was that of Madrigal Kirin, a chimaera who once spared the life of Akiva when she found him on the battlefield, and subsequently fell in love and started an affair with the seraph. Because of this, she was eventually publicly executed. Once Akiva realizes this, he also helps Karou see the truth by shattering her wishbone necklace, restoring the memories of Karou's previous life. At last, however, Akiva must also reveal to her that his previous efforts to end the seraphim-chimaera war was by destroying <b>Brimstone's</b> business, and that all Karou's chimaera family is dead.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the semi-autonomous ability to decide its own targets, the <b>Brimstone</b> {{has the capacity to}} determine where on a target to best impact causing the most damage or resulting in elimination of the target.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} week of July 2008, in the Operation <b>Brimstone,</b> dozens of U.S. and foreign naval ships came to undergo joint {{exercises}} for possible military activity in the shallow waters off the coast of Iran.|$|E
25|$|In flight, Colias croceus {{is easily}} {{identifiable}} by the intense yellow colouring, much brighter {{than that of}} the lemon-yellow male common <b>brimstone</b> which also lacks black colour. Like all Colias species they never open their wings at rest.|$|E
50|$|Officially {{designated}} a Site of Nature Conservation Importance in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, {{much of the}} Worth Way forms an important wildlife corridor supporting {{a wide variety of}} fauna and flora. The former railway cuttings and embankments have been progressively colonised by trees, notably silver birch, ash, hazel and sallow, which have developed into mature woodland. In addition, in areas where chalk was used {{in the construction of the}} railway line, chalk-loving plants such as guelder rose, common spotted orchid, twayblade and wild strawberry have flourished. The trees and plants attract in turn a variety of wildlife, including over two hundred species of insect which feed on the sallow. Butterflies are also common, with <b>brimstones</b> in spring, the white admiral and speckled wood from June followed by meadow brown, ringlet and skippers in high summer.|$|R
50|$|After Red drops O'Grady off, <b>Brimstone's</b> Sheriff Bartlett {{asks him}} to help take care of some thugs. This {{includes}} battling an evil coup led by Jack Swift along with other bounties. After all the bounties are complete, he asks for the bounty on the coupes' head. He is told by Griffon, now the city's governor, that the gold wagon carrying the head has not yet arrived and later learns {{that one of the}} townsfolk, Annie Stoakes, is in danger of losing her farm and that Governor Griffon owns part of Bear Mountain. Recalling that his family was killed over that very mine, he goes to discuss the issue with Annie. After the talk, he is led back to Sheriff Bartlett, from whom he discovers that General Diego and Colonel Daren are still alive and court bound. Finally, with the aid of his Native American cousin Shadow Wolf, Red attacks Diego's fort and kills Daren. Afterwards, Red strikes out on his own and disables the train carrying Diego's gold. In the ensuing firefight, Diego is critically wounded. He offers Red everything. However, Red declines and kills General Diego.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been to the}} Common," [...] said Seth. [...] "Dinah's been {{speaking}} the Word to a little company of hearers at <b>Brimstone's,</b> as they call him. They're folks as never go to church hardly--them on the Common--but they'll go and hear Dinah a bit. She's {{been speaking}} with power this forenoon from the words, 'I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.' And {{there was a little}} thing happened as was pretty to see. The women mostly bring their children with 'em, but to-day there was one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year old, that I never saw there before. He was as naughty as could be at the beginning while I was praying, and while we was singing, but when we all sat down and Dinah began to speak, th' young un stood stock still all at once, and began to look at her with's mouth open, and presently he ran away from's mother and went to Dinah, and pulled at her, like a little dog, for her to take notice of him. So Dinah lifted him up and held th' lad on her lap, while she went on speaking; and he was as good as could be till he went to sleep--and the mother cried to see him." ...|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the limited}} ground attack {{capabilities}} of the RAF Typhoons in the campaign against ISIL, the UK has delayed the retirement of one squadron of Tornados and is attempting to bring forward the deployment of <b>Brimstone</b> missiles on the Eurofighters to 2017.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Charles {{worked as}} Associate Producer {{on the film}} version of <b>Brimstone</b> and Treacle with Executive Producer Naim Attallah and Producers Alan E. Salke, Herbert F.

25|$|The Litening 3 and RAPTOR pods, ASRAAM, Enhanced Paveway III, ALARM, <b>Brimstone</b> and Storm Shadow {{were not}} {{qualified}} {{for use on}} the GR9. A GR9 in Afghanistan typically carried a DJRP, a Sniper pod, two Paveway IV and two of either CRV-7, Paveway IV or Maverick.|$|E
60|$|Wilhelmus Kieft, who in 1634 {{ascended the}} gubernatorial chair, {{to borrow a}} {{favorite}} though clumsy appellation of modern phraseologists, was of a lofty descent, his father being inspector of windmills in the ancient town of Saardam; and our hero, we are told, when a boy, made very curious investigations into the nature and operation of these machines, which was one reason why he afterwards came to be so ingenious a governor. His name, {{according to the most}} authentic etymologists, was a corruption of Kyver; that is to say, a wrangler or scolder; and expressed the characteristic of his family, which for nearly two centuries had kept the windy town of Saardam in hot water, and produced more tartars and <b>brimstones</b> than any ten families in the place; and so truly did he inherit this family peculiarity that he had not been a year in the government of the province before he was universally denominated William the Testy. His appearance answered to his name. He was a brisk, wiry, waspish little old gentleman, such a one as may now and then be seen stumping about our city in a broad-skirted coat with huge buttons, a cocked hat stuck {{on the back of his}} head, and a cane as high as his chin. His face was broad, but his features were sharp; his cheeks were scorched into a dusky red, by two fiery little gray eyes, his nose turned up, and the corners of his mouth turned down pretty much like the muzzle of an irritable pug-dog.|$|R
25|$|On 6 February 2015, an RAF Tornado GR4 patrol {{worked closely}} with a {{coalition}} surveillance platform to provide air support for Peshmerga forces, who were engaged in close combat with ISIL terrorists near Mosul. When an ISIL mortar position opened fire on the Peshmerga, the Tornados responded with a <b>Brimstone</b> missile, scoring a direct hit.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2015, Martin Koolhoven {{confirmed}} that Jack Roth joined {{the cast of}} the film <b>Brimstone.</b> In June 2015, The Hollywood Reporter {{confirmed that}} Fanning and Kit Harington had replaced Mia Wasikowska and Robert Pattinson in the film, respectively. The set of primary recording began June 15 and {{will be held in}} Romania, Spain, and Germany.|$|E
