5000|$|Bicycle wheel {{sizes are}} not precise measurements: a 29-inch {{mountain}} bike wheel with a 622 mm <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> diameter (the term, <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> diameter (BSD), {{is used in}} the ETRTO tire and rim sizing system), and the average 29" [...] mountain bike tire is (in ISO notation) 59-622 corresponds to an outside diameter of about 29.15 inches (740 mm).|$|R

5000|$|Also {{referred}} to as [...] "simulated beadlocks". Streetlocks are a decorative element in which the wheel manufacturer casts or machines the appearance of bolt heads into the rim of a wheel. This provides the appearance of beadlocks, but no functional benefits beyond the internal <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> common to automotive wheels.|$|R
50|$|Some cyclists {{have avoided}} the price premium for a {{tubeless}} system by sealing the spoke holes {{with a special}} rim strip and then sealing the valve stem and <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> with a latex sealer. However, tires not designed for tubeless application do not have as robust a sidewall as those that are.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{passenger}} vehicles and tubeless tires typically use one-piece rims with a [...] "safety" [...] rim profile. The safety feature {{helps keep the}} tire bead held to the rim under adverse conditions by having a pair of safety humps extending inwardly of the rim toward the other tire <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> from an outer contoured surface of the rim.|$|R
50|$|A {{tubeless}} {{bicycle tire}} system requires a compatible tire, an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, spoke holes (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire <b>bead</b> <b>seat.</b> The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|R

50|$|Most road {{bicycles}} use 700C bicycle wheels (622 mm <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> diameter) {{with matching}} 20-25 mm wide tires. The wheels greatly affect {{the performance of}} a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the tire. For hill climbs, however, energy losses due to the higher weight of most aerodynamic rims are greater than the aerodynamic drag reduction that they offer, so a traditional lighter box-sectioned rim is often used to make it go faster.|$|R
50|$|The {{tire bead}} {{is the part}} of the tire that {{contacts}} the rim on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The <b>bead</b> <b>seats</b> tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.|$|R
50|$|Tires {{are complex}} {{composite}} structures made {{of many different}} components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV. These include variations in: tread extrusion thickness and symmetry, tread splice, body ply splices, inner liner splice, bead symmetry, turn-up symmetry, building drum alignment, transfer ring alignment, curing press <b>bead</b> <b>seating,</b> shaping bladder alignment and control, mold runout, and mold alignment. All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things.|$|R
40|$|UMTRI has {{completed}} an experimental program {{to determine the}} inflation pressure required to fail a sample of thirty individual 16 inch light truck tires when those tires are mounted on 16. 5 inch wheels. It is possible to improperly installed a 16 inch tire (metric 215 / 85, in this case) on a 16. 5 inch tire wheel. When this is the case, the tire bead may make and air tight seal against the wheel, even though the bead is not properly seated. If inflation pressure is than elevated, the improper seating of the tire can generate excessive stresses in the bead wire, eventually resulting in failure of the wire and explosive deflation of the tire as {{the integrity of the}} <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> is lost. Such a failure was obtained for each of thirty tires tested...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of an {{experiment}} done by UMTRI to determine the inflation pressure required to fail 16 inch light truck tires, when improperly mounted on 16. 5 inch wheels. In an interim report titled "Report on Failure Testing of Thirty Tires" UMTRI reported on the test results of thirty tires fro six different manufactures. In this final report, the test results of twelve more tires from two additional manufactures are also considered. It is possible to improperly mount a 16 inch tire (metric 215 / 85, in this case) on a 16. 5 inch tire wheel. When this is the case, the tire bead makes an air tight seal against the improper seating generates excessive stresses in the tire bead wire. Eventually, failure of the wire and explosive deflation of the tire will occur as {{the integrity of the}} <b>bead</b> <b>seat</b> is lost.

40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly radial load and inflation pressure. The radial load is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four tires to balance the weight of a car. The radial load is applied to the rim at the <b>bead</b> <b>seats</b> with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the rim flange. This project studied the influence of the radial load and the tire inflation pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim. A computer aided design model of an aluminum alloy wheel rim is analyzed using ANSYS. The geometrical parameters of the rim is further optimized to reduce weight...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} wear and/or {{corrosion}} properties of car engine components, different techniques of surface treatment like transformation hardening, surface temelting and cladding with CO 2 laser radiation are presented. These techniques {{are applied to}} different car engine components like crankshafts for transformation hardening (hardening of bearing, <b>seats</b> and <b>radii),</b> camshafts for surface remelting and valve seats for cladding with stellite powder...|$|R
40|$|Weftless bead design used in tires {{has long}} been the cause of failure. This type of bead design is {{generally}} used in agriculture, buses, trucks and passenger car tires. The main problem with this kind of bead is the splice region. It has ten cut wires, five at each over and underlap region. It is known since 1950 that Weftless design of the tire bead had failures within about 5 cm {{from the end of the}} overlapping parallel wire ribbon. The cause for this failure is generally attributed to the mounting process in which the diameter of the tire bead is changed during the mounting process as it moves from the well of the rim to the <b>bead</b> <b>seat.</b> The ideal <b>bead</b> design is a high strength flexible cable with minimal cross section, having same over and under windings to prevent stress concentrations in deflections as used in a normal steel cable. A finite element model of the tire bead was developed using ANSYS and tested under the known stresses of the mounting and final use conditions. Finite element calculations show the failure point of the Weftless bead is almost always at the under lap or at the starting point of this bead. Cable bead have significant advantages in safety over the Weftless bead still used in tires...|$|R
50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold <b>bead</b> <b>seat,</b> a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|R
5000|$|A {{need was}} {{experienced}} by avid 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travelers {{for a simple}} tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer. The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the <b>bead</b> <b>seat.</b> Further, if a ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. The large bead retainers of ATV's do {{such a good job}} keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: 1) [...] "Shoe and Lever mechanism", 2) [...] "Plier-type mechanism", 3) [...] "Clamp and Ram mechanism". The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails {{because of the nature of}} the design. The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall. [...] Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies. The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle. However the pivot point results in a arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages. It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use your body weight to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies. Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool [...] is by far the most effective and compact tool for breaking beads on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires. The only company who makes a this style of ATV Bead Breaker is BeadBuster. This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and it uses a padded clamp that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little user effort. The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely breaks the bead loose in one motion. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. The Clamp and Ram tool (aka. [...] "BeadBuster") is extremely portable and easily fits in a tool box or glove compartment, and is priced at $99 up to $200 for a professional model.|$|R
