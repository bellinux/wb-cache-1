50|$|In 1843 Warren {{published}} a large <b>botanical</b> <b>chart</b> {{for use in}} schools to educate children about botany. Entitled A <b>Botanical</b> <b>Chart</b> for the Use of Schools, it was dedicated to Hooker. Although well reviewed, it was not particularly successful or widely used.|$|E
50|$|With Pierre Riquet, he was {{editor of}} Pharmacopoeia, jussu Senatus insulensis {{tertiary}} edita. In 1774, he issued Carte de botanique, a <b>botanical</b> <b>chart</b> that combined {{the system of}} Joseph Pitton de Tournefort with that of Linnaeus.|$|E
50|$|Her {{studies and}} {{tutoring}} stimulated her own interest in science, and her fondness for children {{led her to}} apply her knowledge to early education. She published First Book of Botany, designed to Cultivate the Observing Powers of Children (New York, 1870) and Second Book of Botany (1873). These were intended to promote the systematic study of plants as objects {{in place of the}} object lessons in general use. She prepared an enlarged edition of Henslow's <b>Botanical</b> <b>Charts</b> (1873), translated from the French Quatrefages' Natural History of Man (1875), and contributed to the Popular Science Monthly and other periodicals. Youmans also published Descriptive Botany, a Guide to the Classification of Plants, with a Popular Flora (1885), and an abridgment of Bentley's Physiological Botany, as a sequel (1886).|$|R

50|$|Leopold Kny was a {{specialist}} in research involving the morphology of fungi and cryptogams (mosses, ferns and algae). He is remembered for producing Botanische Wandtafeln, which {{was a series of}} 117 <b>botanical</b> wall <b>charts</b> that were published between 1874 and 1911. Kny's charts were known for their high level of detail, and were widely used in classrooms long after his death. They were accompanied with a 554-page textbook for explanatory purposes. Today these wall charts are housed in several different museums.|$|R
40|$|Worlds Within was {{a unique}} {{collaboration}} between Rob Kesseler, the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation and The Miller Gallery, two venues, {{at either end of}} the Carnegie Mellon University campus. The exhibition celebrated the extraordinary aesthetic interrelationships between historically different methods of visually interpreting the wonders of botanical phenomena, which are not readily visible to the naked eye. The graphic impact of historical instructive <b>botanical</b> wall <b>charts</b> was propsed through the juxtaposition with a collection of Kesseler's monumentalized, hand-coloured micrographs of seeds and pollen. Using a selection of newly configured and specially created images the exhibition constructed a remarkable visual bridge between the conventional purpose of scientific illustration as used in educational materials, and the aesthetic interpretation of scientific imagery in contemporary art. At the Hunt Institute the work was shown alongside 19 th-century <b>botanical</b> wall <b>charts</b> from Carl Ignaz Leopold Kny’s series Botanische Wandtafeln, restored specifically for the exhibition. Complementing the forms represented in these charts and photographs were a selection of models of marine organisms made of glass in the 19 th-century by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka and made of glacite in the early 20 th-century by Edwin H. Reiber on loan from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The Miller Gallery exhibition featured further juxtaposed pairings and a fuller range of Kesseler's recent micro images. Both sections of this joint exhibition celebrated the extraordinary aesthetic interrelationships between historically different methods of visually interpreting the wonders of botanical phenomena, which are not readily visible to the naked eye. A new video work Like unto each form yet none alike, was specially created for the exhibition. The title of the video is a line taken from the poem The Metamorphosis of Plants by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe from his book of the same name. From his investigation into plant form he envisioned a more holistic way of experiencing nature beyond the detached classification of the Linnean system in which plants are experienced both symbolically and scientifically. The movie presents a succession of pollen grains, seeds and plant details that appear in a continuous stream, each fusing with the next, a lineage of “supersensuous archetypes”...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the expedition's work with the Nootkas, astronomical observations were made to fix the location of Nootka Sound and calibrate the expedition's chronometers. Nootka Sound was surveyed and mapped with an accuracy far greater than had previously been available. Unexplored channels were investigated. The maps were also linked to the baseline established by Captain Cook, allowing calibration between Spanish and British <b>charts.</b> <b>Botanical</b> studies were carried out, including {{an attempt to make}} a type of beer out of conifer needles that was hoped to have anti-scorbutic properties for combating scurvy. The expedition ships took on water and wood, and provided the Spanish outpost with many useful goods, including medicines, food, various tools and utensils, and a Réaumur scale thermometer.|$|R
