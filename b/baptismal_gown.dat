50|$|Saints Louis and Zélie Martin, {{the parents}} of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, were married in the church on 13 July 1858, {{and it was there}} that Thérèse {{received}} the sacrament of baptism on 4 January 1873. The <b>baptismal</b> <b>gown</b> used for the ceremony is displayed in the basilica as a relic for the veneration of the faithful, and a stained glass window in the baptistry commemorates the ceremony. Finally, Zélie's funeral was held there after her death in 1877.|$|E
5000|$|The {{night before}} {{it came time}} to remove her <b>baptismal</b> <b>gown,</b> she stole out in the dark wearing one of Nonnus's chitons. She headed for Jerusalem, where she built a cell on the Mount of Olives. She lived there for three or four years, disguising herself as a male recluse and eunuch under the name Pelagius. She then died, {{apparently}} as a result of extreme asceticism, which had emaciated her to the point she could no longer be recognized. Upon the discovery that the renowned monk had been a woman, the [...] "holy fathers" [...] tried to keep it a secret, but the gossip spread and her relics drew pilgrims from as far off as Jericho and the Jordan valley.|$|E
5000|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, most {{of those}} born into the faith are baptized as infants. The {{traditional}} clothing for a child being baptized into the Roman Catholic faith is a <b>baptismal</b> <b>gown,</b> a very long, white infants' garment now made especially for the ceremony of christening and usually only worn then. They are in fact the normal, or at least [...] "best", outer clothing of Western babies until about the 19th century. The moment of progression to shorter dresses (for both boys and girls) was known as [...] "shortcoating", which usually coincided {{with the beginning of}} crawling, which was difficult in a long robe, or at five to six months of age. Christening gowns are usually made of fine white linen or cotton fabric, and may be trimmed with tucks, lace, whitework embroidery, and other handwork. Baptismal gowns often have matching bonnets, and may become family heirlooms, used generation after generation.|$|E

It is said that it was once common for lovers to exchange mundillo lace with romantic inscriptions.|$|R
5000|$|She {{went to the}} {{basilica}} of Saint Julian to see them; when Nonnus demanded surety {{that she would not}} return to her former life, she fell to the ground and threatened that if she were refused admission to the Church, all her future sins would be held against him at his judgment. The archbishop was informed and sent the deaconess Romana to clothe her in the <b>baptismal</b> <b>gown.</b> Nonnus took her confession and baptized [...] "Margarita" [...] under her birth name Pelagia, with Romana serving as her godmother. The devil shortly afterward arrived to complain, but was driven off when Pelagia made the Sign of the Cross and breathed upon him. He returned the next night to renew his complaints and was driven off the same way. On the third day, Pelagia directed her slave steward to inventory her possessions. She then turned them over to Nonnus, who disbursed them to the widows, orphans, and poor of the city. She further freed her slaves, male and female, [...] "taking their golden torcs off with her own hands". She then began living with Romana.|$|E
