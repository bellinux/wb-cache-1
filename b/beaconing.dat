Of sub-officers, soldiers and sailors in mutiny by land and water. Of soldiers, at Nanci, as we shall see, needing to be cannonaded by a brave Bouille. Of sailors, nay the very galley-slaves, at Brest, needing also to be cannonaded; but with no Bouille to do it. For indeed, to say it in a word, in those days there was no King in Israel, and every man did that which was right in his own eyes. (See Deux Amis, iii. c. 14; iv. c. 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 14.

6000|$|There {{are a few}} of us {{who keep}} the faith, who do not bow the knee to Baal, who hold fast to what is high and good in the {{doctrine}} of political equality; in whose hearts the altar-fires of rational liberty are kept aglow, <b>beaconing</b> the darkness of that illimitable inane where their countrymen, inaccessible to the light, wander witless in the bogs of political unreason, alternately adoring and damning the man-made gods of their own stature. Of that bright band fueling the bale-fires of political consistency I can not profess myself a member in good standing. In view of this general recreancy and treason to the principles that our fathers established by the sword--having in constant observation this almost universal hospitality to the solemn nonsense of hereditary rank and unearned distinction, my faith in practical realization of republican ideals is small, and I falter in the work of their maintenance in the interest of a people for whom they are too good. Seeing that we are immune to none of the evils besetting monarchies, excepting those for which we secretly yearn; that inequality of fortune and unjust allotment of honors are as conspicuous among us as elsewhere; that the tyranny of individuals is as intolerable, and that of the public more so; that the law's majesty is a dream and its failure a fact--hearing everywhere the footfalls of disorder and the watchwords of anarchy, I despair of the republic and catch in every breeze that blows [...] "a cry prophetic of its fall." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} degrees of MAC {{consciousness}} in devices. The highest of these {{corresponds to a}} self-beaconing device, which is able to perform <b>beaconing</b> on its own. The following degree represents directed-beaconing devices, which are unaware of MAC frames and have limited <b>beaconing</b> capabilities, depending on the host to detect and beacon for nearby devices. Lastly there are non-beaconing devices, which have a very limited ability to transmit and receive; on the other hand, devices which are undetectable by the host can not be affected by these devices, nor can affect them.|$|E
50|$|In navigation, an {{electric}} <b>beacon</b> (or electromagnetic <b>beacon)</b> {{is a kind}} of <b>beacon,</b> a device which marks a fixed location and allows direction finding equipment to find relative bearing, the direction to the <b>beacon.</b> The most common are radio <b>beacons,</b> which broadcast a radio signal which is picked up by radio direction finding systems on ships, aircraft and vehicles to determine the bearing to the <b>beacon,</b> but the term also covers infrared and sonar <b>beacons.</b>|$|R

50|$|In addition, W-USB hosts {{have other}} {{responsibilities}} which go beyond {{those of a}} wired host; namely, their MAC sublayer is responsible for supervising the suitability of device MAC layers. If needed, this requires assisting them in their <b>beaconing</b> duties and processing the <b>beaconing</b> data that could be sent to them. Furthermore, the UWB radio and associated bandwidth may be shared with other entities, and the host must {{make sure that the}} defined policies are satisfied; according to shared use (which may be coordinated to avoid interference) {{it will be able to}} offer full or partial functionality.|$|E

50|$|The SkyCube radio emits {{periodic}} <b>beaconing</b> pings {{which contain}} 120-byte {{messages from the}} Kickstarter backers. These pings are transmitted at 915 MHz, using the AX.25 protocol at 9600 baud with BPSK modulation, with a callsign of WG9XMF.|$|E
50|$|In general, the zigbee {{protocols}} {{minimize the}} time the radio is on, so as to reduce power use. In <b>beaconing</b> networks, nodes only need to be active while a beacon is being transmitted.

50|$|The media {{access control}} (MAC) enables the {{transmission}} of MAC frames {{through the use of}} the physical channel. Besides the data service, it offers a management interface and itself manages access to the physical channel and network <b>beaconing.</b> It also controls frame validation, guarantees time slots and handles node associations. Finally, it offers hook points for secure services.|$|E

Advanced <b>beacons</b> encode a GPS or GLONASS position into the signal. All <b>beacons</b> are located by doppler triangulation to confirm the location. The digital data identifies the registered user. A phone call by authorities to the registered phone number often eliminates false alarms (false alarms are the typical case). If there is a problem, the <b>beacon</b> location data guides search and rescue efforts. No <b>beacon</b> is ignored. Anonymous <b>beacons</b> are confirmed by two doppler tracks before beginning <b>beacon</b> location efforts.|$|R
50|$|In Wales, the Brecon <b>Beacons</b> {{were named}} for <b>beacons</b> used to warn of {{approaching}} English raiders. In England, {{the most famous}} examples are the <b>beacons</b> used in Elizabethan England to warn of the approaching Spanish Armada. Many hills in England were named <b>Beacon</b> Hill after such <b>beacons.</b> In the Scottish borders country, a system of <b>beacon</b> fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. Hume and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network. The Great Wall of China is also a <b>beacon</b> network.|$|R
50|$|Every Bismarck {{tower was}} {{intended}} as a beacon. Their braziers were to be lit on specified days in honour of the former chancellor to commemorate his achievement in unifying Germany in 1871. Though most towers included firing installations, plans for a nationwide <b>beaconing</b> failed and many local initiatives chose deviating designs. The architects of these towers included Wilhelm Kreis himself, who built 58 (47 to the Götterdämmerung design), and Bruno Schmitz.|$|E
50|$|He was {{designated}} in 1852 for the <b>beaconing</b> of the São Francisco River, having traveled and explored the river with its tributaries from Pirapora to the Atlantic Ocean along {{a total of}} more than 2,000 km.

He had 16 children altogether from his 3 marriages.|$|E
50|$|Thus, non-beaconing devices {{can only}} operate in very close {{vicinity}} to the host. Directed- and self-beaconing devices {{must be able}} to identify their hidden neighbors, which they do by emitting beacons. On their end, hosts manage global timers with the precision the physical medium requires (20 ppm). Channel time is sent within MMC's, and it is used for slot allocation, so it is important that hosts perform accurate <b>beaconing.</b> Devices may as well beacon reservation declarations.|$|E
