50|$|<b>Broparestrol</b> is {{a mixture}} of E- and Z- isomers (LN-1643 and LN-2299, respectively), both of which are active and are {{similarly}} antiestrogenic but, unlike <b>broparestrol,</b> were never marketed.|$|E

50|$|A diethoxylated {{derivative}} of triphenylbromoethylene, estrobin (DBE), {{is also an}} estrogen, but, in contrast, was never marketed. An ethylated {{derivative of}} triphenylbromoethylene, <b>broparestrol</b> (BDPE), is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has been marketed.|$|E
50|$|Estrogens {{closely related}} to the stilbestrols include {{paroxypropione}} (a metabolite of diethylstilbestrol) and the anise and fennel-derived compounds anol, dianol, anethole, dianethole, and photoanethole (from which the stilbestrol estrogens were actually originally derived). The triphenylethylene group of estrogenic drugs that includes triphenylethylene itself, estrobin, chlorotrianisene, <b>broparestrol,</b> ethamoxytriphetol, clomifene, tamoxifen, and more recently developed derivatives is also very closely related structurally to the stilbestrols.|$|E
50|$|<b>Broparestrol</b> (INN) (brand names Acnestrol, Longestrol; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} LN-107), {{also known as}} α-bromo-α,β-diphenyl-β-p-ethylphenylethylene (BDPE), is a synthetic, nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group that is or was used in Europe as a dermatological agent and {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer. The drug is described as slightly estrogenic and potently antiestrogenic, and inhibits mammary gland development and suppresses prolactin levels in animals. It is structurally related to clomifene and diethylstilbestrol.|$|E
50|$|Chlorotrianisene, or tri-p-anisylchloroethylene (TACE), is {{a potent}} marketed {{estrogen}} and a derivative of triphenylchloroethylene in which {{each of the three}} phenyl rings has been substituted with a 4-methoxy group. Estrobin, or DBE, is a related, never-marketed estrogen {{in which there is a}} bromine in place of the chlorine and two of the three phenyl rings have ethoxy groups. <b>Broparestrol,</b> or BDPE is a marketed selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has a bromine in place of the chlorine of triphenylchloroethylene and an 4-ethyl group on one of the phenyl rings. The SERM clomifene is also a derivative of triphenylchloroethylene.|$|E
50|$|TPE is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ligands. It includes the estrogens chlorotrianisene, estrobin (DBE), triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene; the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) afimoxifene, brilanestrant, <b>broparestrol,</b> clomifene, clomifenoxide, droloxifene, endoxifen, etacstil, fispemifene, idoxifene, miproxifene, miproxifene phosphate, nafoxidine, ospemifene, panomifene, and toremifene. The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E
