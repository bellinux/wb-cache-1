Jesse Littleton of Corning discovered the cooking potential of borosilicate glass by giving his wife a casserole dish made from a cut-down Nonex <b>battery</b> <b>jar.</b> Corning removed the lead from Nonex and developed it as a consumer product.

40|$|By {{utilizing}} ordinary {{laboratory equipment}} and a spherical feces-urine separator, a simple, inexpensive metabolism cage for small mammals can be constructed. A hardware cloth animal cage over a cylindrical <b>battery</b> <b>jar</b> containing a spherical feces-urine separator affords {{the following advantages}} not commonly found in commercial metabolism cages: 1) complete separation of feces and urine through minimal contact, 2) minimal evaporation of urine due to proximity of storage vessel and lack of exogenous air currents, and 3) extremely low cost of less than five dollars. The metabolism cage is designed to allow measurement of fluid intake, and to separate and collect feces and urine for numerous qualitative and quantitative determinations. In addition, the metabolism cage permits observation of the animal, feces, and urine at all times, is readily cleaned or sterilized, and is easily fashioned from common laboratory equipment...|$|E

The Hemingray company had factories in Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky with main production in Muncie, Indiana.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{toxicity}} of three chemicals (diquat dibromide, endothall, and fluridone) to the early life stages of fish. Acute toxicity studies on several species and age classifications were conducted. Some studies were done with and without the presence of sediment in the test system. In addition, persistence of the chemicals in the presence of sediment was explored. In this review, only the results relevant to diquat dibromide will be discussed. Methods Static non-renewal toxicity tests (were conducted in order to approximate natural conditions following the herbicide treatment of a lake. The tests were conducted following Weber (1991) and Weber (1993), US EPA methods for measuring acute toxicity to aquatic organisms. The toxicity tests were conducted using 2 -L glass jars containing 1500 ml of test solution, except for 84 -d old walleyes which were tested in 20 -L <b>battery</b> <b>jars</b> each containing 16 L of test solution.

It had disks with a diameter of 1.65 m and was connected to a <b>battery</b> of Leyden <b>jars</b> to store the charge produced. With this machine a 61 cm (2 ft) spark could be produced of, which comes down to roughly 330.000 Volt. Van Marum believed that with larger machines, currents and charges more scientific progress could be made. The machine was based on a smaller model produced by Jonathan Cuthbertson shortly before, but with some significant changes, such as glass poles instead of wooden ones. Based on empirical studies Cuthbertson made changes to the scaled-up model. Finally the machine was installed in December 1784 and he received the sum of 3000 guilders for it.|$|R

50|$|The first {{evidence}} that a capacitor and inductor could produce electrical oscillations was discovered in 1826 by French scientist Felix Savary. He found that when a Leyden jar was discharged through a wire wound around an iron needle, sometimes the needle was left magnetized {{in one direction and}} sometimes in the opposite direction. He correctly deduced that this was caused by a damped oscillating discharge current in the wire, which reversed the magnetization of the needle back and forth until it was too small to have an effect, leaving the needle magnetized in a random direction. American physicist Joseph Henry repeated Savary's experiment in 1842 and came to the same conclusion, apparently independently. British scientist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1853 showed mathematically that the discharge of a Leyden jar through an inductance should be oscillatory, and derived its resonant frequency. British radio researcher Oliver Lodge, by discharging a large <b>battery</b> of Leyden <b>jars</b> through a long wire, created a tuned circuit with its resonant frequency in the audio range, which produced a musical tone from the spark when it was discharged. In 1857, German physicist Berend Wilhelm Feddersen photographed the spark produced by a resonant Leyden jar circuit in a rotating mirror, providing visible evidence of the oscillations. In 1868, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell calculated the effect of applying an alternating current to a circuit with inductance and capacitance, showing that the response is maximum at the resonant frequency. The first example of an electrical resonance curve was published in 1887 by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in his pioneering paper on the discovery of radio waves, showing the length of spark obtainable from his spark-gap LC resonator detectors as a function of frequency.|$|R
60|$|The {{art that}} thus {{separates}} is itself first separated. Art {{must not be}} a superficial talent, but must begin farther back in man. Now men do not see nature to be beautiful, and they go to make a statue which shall be. They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible, and console themselves with color-bags and blocks of marble. They reject life as prosaic, and create a death which they call poetic. They despatch the day's weary chores, and fly to voluptuous reveries. They eat and drink, that they may afterwards execute the ideal. Thus is art vilified; the name conveys to the mind its secondary and bad senses; it stands in the imagination as somewhat contrary to nature, and struck with death from the first. Would it not be better to begin higher up,--to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to serve the ideal in eating and drinking, in drawing the breath, and in the functions of life? Beauty must {{come back to the}} useful arts, and the distinction between the fine and the useful arts be forgotten. If history were truly told, if life were nobly spent, it would be no longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from the other. In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful. It is therefore beautiful because it is alive, moving, reproductive; it is therefore useful because it is symmetrical and fair. Beauty will not come at the call of a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or America its history in Greece. It will come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave and earnest men. It is in vain that we look for genius to reiterate its miracles in the old arts; it is its instinct to find beauty and holiness in new and necessary facts, in the field and road-side, in the shop and mill. Proceeding from a religious heart it will raise to a divine use the railroad, the insurance office, the joint-stock company; our law, our primary assemblies, our commerce, the galvanic <b>battery,</b> the electric <b>jar,</b> the prism, and the chemist's retort; in which we seek now only an economical use. Is not the selfish and even cruel aspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to mills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary impulses which these works obey? When its errands are noble and adequate, a steamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old and New England and arriving at its ports with the punctuality of a planet, is a step of man into harmony with nature. The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies along the Lena by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime. When science is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by love, they will appear the supplements and continuations of the material creation.|$|R
