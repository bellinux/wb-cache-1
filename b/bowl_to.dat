Also, the Champs Sports Bowl was deemed to be the fourth-most prestigious non-BCS bowl while the Meineke game was number-six.|$|E

5|$|Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did {{not repeat}} as {{national}} {{champion in the}} late 1960s. The team finished with an 8–2–1 record in 1969 and was invited {{to play in the}} postseason Cotton Bowl. The school had a long-standing policy in place forbidding the team from playing bowl games, but the university urgently needed funds for minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from the <b>bowl</b> <b>to</b> fund them.

5|$|Smith {{nevertheless}} obtained {{an injunction}} from a Virginia court {{to allow him}} to participate in the game, which was being held in Louisiana.

On the day of the game, the NCAA attempted to appeal the decision to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals, but a three-judge panel denied the appeal. By this time, the game was about to begin, and Smith was allowed to play.|$|E
