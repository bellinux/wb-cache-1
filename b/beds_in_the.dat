5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mountains}} in southwestern Wyoming, Wilkins Peak {{is part of}} the Green River Formation, a formation of the intermontane Lake Gosiute environment during the Eocene epoch. Similar to its neighboring Aspen Mountain, Wilkins Peak {{is part of the}} Rock Springs Uplift, and some of the largest oil shale and trona <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region are located near the mountain. Wilkins Peak also has its own distinct segment of the Green River Formation, which is known as the Wilkins Peak Formation.|$|E
5|$|Mary Anning (21 May 1799– 9 March 1847) was an English fossil collector, dealer, and {{paleontologist}} {{who became}} known {{around the world}} for important finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England. Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E

5|$|The Blackdown Hills form a flat plateau {{dominated}} by hard chert bands, {{made up of}} clay with flints, of Upper Greensand with some remnants of chalk. The cretaceous rocks rest over eroded Jurassic and Triassic beds, with an outcrop of Rhaetian <b>beds.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> western areas the Upper Greensand is devoid of calcareous material but the sands yield fossils of marine bivalves and gastropods (snails) preserved in silica.|$|E
5|$|The limey oozes and mud {{were later}} lithified into the {{limestone}} and interbedded siltstone of the up-to-300foot (90m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths {{that are found}} only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Claron.|$|E
5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also {{occur in the}} creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals {{at a rapid}} pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E

5|$|Many fossil sites {{worldwide}} contain beetles {{from the}} Cretaceous. Most are in Europe and Asia and {{belong to the}} temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous. Lower Cretaceous sites include the Crato fossil <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Araripe basin in the Ceará, North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation; the latter was near the equator at that time. In Spain, important sites are near Montsec and Las Hoyas. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, South Gippsland, Victoria, are noteworthy. Major sites from the Upper Cretaceous include Kzyl-Dzhar in South Kazakhstan and Arkagala in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Mountain hare (apparently {{absent from}} Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now {{abundant}} and predated on by wild cat and pine marten. Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{species is}} P. lujiatunensis, {{found in the}} lowest beds of the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other beds of the Yixian, the age {{of which is the}} subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of Psittacosaurus, most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon-argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation to about 128mya, and the highest to approximately 122mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium-lead dating, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2mya, while agreeing with an age of 122mya for the upper beds.|$|E

5|$|At 01:00 on 2 May, the Soviets {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire and stating that emissaries would come under a white flag to Potsdamer bridge. Early {{in the morning of}} 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. General of the Artillery Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, surrendered with his staff at 06:00. Down in the Führerbunker, Chief of the Army General Staff General Hans Krebs and Hitler's Chief Adjutant Generalleutnant Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vorbunker; the clear mark of cyanide appeared on their faces.|$|E

5|$|The debtors' {{prison at}} the castle {{came in for}} {{particular}} scrutiny. It emerged {{that out of the}} 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of £5 or less (£373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes. A penalty of up to £7 (£522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way. The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week {{for the use of the}} <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended on friends or relatives for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original parishes.|$|E

5|$|The pachycephalosaurs Dracorex and Stygimoloch may be {{specimens}} of Pachycephalosaurus {{in which the}} dome and horns are not well-developed, either because the animal was a juvenile or a female. This consideration was supported at the 2007 {{annual meeting of the}} Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Jack Horner of Montana State University presented evidence, from analysis of the skull of the single existing Dracorex specimen, that this dinosaur may well be a juvenile form of Stygimoloch. In addition, he presented data that indicates that both Stygimoloch and Dracorex may be juvenile forms of Pachycephalosaurus. Horner and M.B. Goodwin published their findings in 2009, showing that the spike/node and skull dome bones of all three 'species' exhibit extreme plasticity, and that both Dracorex and Stygimoloch are known only from juvenile specimens while Pachycephalosaurus is known only from adult specimens. These observations, in addition to the fact that all three forms lived in the same time and place, lead them to conclude that Dracorex and Stygimoloch were simply juvenile Pachycephalosaurus, which lost spikes and grew domes as they aged. The discovery of baby skulls assigned to Pachycephalosaurus that were described in 2016 from two different bone <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hell Creek Formation have been presented as further evidence for this hypothesis. The fossils, as described by David Evans and Mark Goodwin et al are identical to all three supposed genera in the placement of the rugose knobs on their skulls. This and further studies of the different, more mature skulls, suggested that the knobs present in the skull developed very early in the dinosaur's life while the iconic, domed head developed later. A 2010 study by Nick Longrich and colleagues also supported the hypothesis that all flat-skulled pachycephalosaurs were juveniles, suggesting that flat-skulled forms like Goyocephale and Homalocephale represent juveniles of dome-skulled adults.|$|E
