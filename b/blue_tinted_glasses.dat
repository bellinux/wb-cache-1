40|$|Background and purpose. Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that wearing <b>blue</b> <b>tinted</b> <b>glasses</b> helps relieve the symptoms of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD). Though not formally tested, changes in the eye, resulting from PD, have been documented. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if wearing <b>blue</b> <b>tinted</b> <b>glasses</b> would result in an immediate decrease in the bradykinesia/akinesia associated with PD as measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Nine Hole Peg Tests. Methods. A single-blind design with randomized trials was used. Subjects with a diagnosis of PD and rated in Hoehn and Yahr stages two to four were recruited. Each subject was tested under four randomized conditions: no glasses, blue, gray, and yellow tinted glasses. During each condition, the subjects 2 ̆ 7 movement times were measured with the TUG and the Nine Hole Peg Tests. Data was analyzed using an ANOVA without replication. Results. Data from 24 subjects, primarily in Hoehn and Yahr stage two, was used for analysis. No statistically significant differences were found between movement times in the four test conditions. Conclusion and Discussion. Wearing <b>blue</b> <b>tinted</b> <b>glasses</b> did not immediately decrease the bradykinesia/akinesia associated with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease as measured by the TUG and the Nine Hole Peg Tests. Based upon exit questionnaire responses, subjects were unaware of movement time differences during testing conditions. Future research should address more severely impaired subjects with PD, as well as various shades of blue and the length of time glasses are worn...|$|E

5000|$|The Wills Building is {{featured}} in [...] "Newcastle + Gateshead Architecture And Heritage" [...] by Faulkner, Beacock and Jones (page 286, [...] ). One {{feature of the}} conversion from factory to apartments {{was the use of}} <b>blue</b> <b>tinted</b> <b>glass,</b> {{as can be seen in}} the photograph, for the windows facing south looking over the New Coast Road, helping to reduce the solar gain of the large windows. Another notable feature of the conversion was the excellence of the soundproofingbetween the flats, although with the windows open the noise from the dual carriageway below is fairly noticeable.|$|R
50|$|Designed by architects Gerard de Preu and Partners in {{association}} with Perrott Lyon Mathieson, the building was built between 1982 and 1986, opening in October 1986, and {{takes its name from}} the much older Rialto Building next door. The massive glass curtain wall façade of reinforced <b>blue</b> <b>tinted</b> mirrored <b>glass</b> is its central feature and changes colour during the day, ranging from a trademark dark blue to a brilliant gold during sunset.|$|R
5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> to <b>glass,</b> but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|R
50|$|The {{residential}} skyscraper has 20 {{floors of}} 150-residential units above 3 floors of mixed use office and retail space, the 3rd floor includes a pool, fitness centers and entertainment rooms.

The Regent was not built during the first phase of construction and was one of the last buildings to be constructed in the redevelopment.|$|R
5000|$|With a flat plate, cast-in-place {{concrete}} structural system, the Blue Condominium {{is built}} like many high-rise residential buildings in New York City. What is not {{similar to other}} high-rise residential towers is the unconventional massing that required special floor plate cantilevering and curtain wall detailing. For example, floor plates on fourth floor cantilever up to 11'-0" [...] and up to 21'-0" [...] on the twelfth floor. These cantilevered plates are {{a function of the}} angular form. The curtain wall system is a Uni-Wall Curtain Wall System by Architectural Glazing Technology. Some of the corners have up to four angled walls connecting to each other and these relationships required 3D modeling. Unlike conventional curtain wall construction, the system employed unitized components that were glazed, sealed, and assembled in the factory, shipped to the site, then assembled in the field. The curtain wall system is composed of clear <b>glass</b> pieces, <b>tinted</b> <b>blue</b> vision <b>glass</b> pieces, and opaque spandrel panels in four shades of blue.|$|R
