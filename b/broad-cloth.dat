60|$|The {{first and}} {{greatest}} shock our trade received, was from an act {{passed in the}} reign of King William, in the Parliament of England, prohibiting the exportation of wool manufactured in Ireland. An act (as the event plainly shews) fuller of greediness than good policy; an act as beneficial to France and Spain, {{as it has been}} destructive to England and Ireland.[103] At the passing of this fatal act, the condition of our trade was glorious and flourishing, though no way interfering with the English; we made no <b>broad-cloths</b> above 6s. per yard; coarse druggets, bays and shalloons, worsted damasks, strong draught works, slight half-works, and gaudy stuffs, were the only product of our looms: these were partly consumed by the meanest of our people, and partly sent to the northern nations, from which we had in exchange, timber, iron, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, and hard dollars. At the time the current money of Ireland was foreign silver, a man could hardly receive 100l., without finding the coin of all the northern powers, and every prince of the empire among it. This money was returned into England for fine cloths, silks, &c. for our own wear, for rents, for coals, for hardware, and all other English manufactures, and, in a great measure, supplied the London merchants with foreign silver for exportation.|$|R

He {{must take}} an especial care {{to have his}} shop not so much crowded with a large bulk of goods, as with a well-sorted and well-chosen {{quantity}} proper for his business, and to give credit to his beginning. In order to this, his buying part requires not only a good judgment in the wares he is to deal in, but a perfect government of his judgment by his understanding to suit and sort his quantities and proportions, as well to his shop as to the particular place where his shop is situated; for example, a particular trade is not only proper for such or such {{a part of the}} town, but a particular assortment of goods, even in the same way, suits one part of the town, or one town and not another; as he that sets up in the Strand, or near the Exchange, is likely to sell more rich silks, more fine Hollands, more fine <b>broad-cloths,</b> more fine toys and trinkets, than one of the same trade setting up in the skirts of the town, or at Ratcliff, or Wapping, or Redriff; and he that sets up in the capital city of a county, than he that is placed in a private market-town, in the same county; and he that is placed in a market-town, than he that is placed in a country village. A tradesman in a seaport town sorts himself different from one of the same trade in an inland town, though larger and more populous; and this the tradesman must weigh very maturely before he lays out his stock.|$|R
6000|$|As the {{manufactures}} of England, {{particularly those}} of wool (cotton wool included), and of silk, are the greatest, and amount to the greatest value of any single manufacture in Europe,[39] so they not only employ more people, but those people gain the most money, that is to say, have the best wages for their work of any people in the world; and yet, which is peculiar to England, the English manufactures are, allowing for their goodness, the cheapest at market of any in the world, too. Even France itself, after all the pains they are at to get our wool, and all the expense they have been at to imitate our manufactures, by getting over our workmen, and giving them even greater wages than they had here, have yet made so little proficiency in it, and are so far from outselling us in foreign markets, that they still, {{in spite of the}} strictest prohibitions, send hither, and to Holland and Germany, for English <b>broad-cloths,</b> druggets, duroys, flannels, serges, and several other sorts of our goods, to supply their own. Nor can they clothe themselves to their satisfaction with their own goods; but if any French gentleman of quality comes over hither from France, he is sure to bring no more coats with him than backs, but immediately to make him new clothes as soon as he arrives, and to carry as many new suits home with him at his return, as he can get leave to bring ashore when he comes there--a demonstration that our manufacture exceeds theirs, after all their boasts of it, both in goodness and in cheapness, even by their own confession. But I am not now to enter upon the particular manufactures, but the general trade in the manufacture; this particular being a trade of such a magnitude, it is to be observed for our purpose, that the greatness of it consists of two parts:-- ...|$|R

"You may {{read your}} father," [...] said Helen MacGregor, turning to her sons, [...] "in what this young Saxon tells us--Wise {{only when the}} bonnet is on his head, and the sword is in his hand, he never exchanges the tartan for the <b>broad-cloth,</b> but he runs himself into the miserable intrigues of the Lowlanders, and becomes again, after all he has suffered, their agent--their tool--their slave." ...|$|E
60|$|Beppin' appeared, {{a middle-aged}} man also in black <b>broad-cloth,</b> with a very scrubby chin and a bundle, running towards us on fat legs. He was perspiring, but his face was expressionless and innocent-looking. With a sardonic flicker of a grin, half of spite, half of relief, Rochester put on the brakes again, and we stopped in the street. A woman tottered up panting and holding her breast. Now for farewells.|$|E
6000|$|Not all {{the street}} scenes were ghastly or painful. She came to one crowd, ranged {{motionless}} and silent before a large, fat, dignified-looking man, in good <b>broad-cloth</b> garments, white tie, {{and wearing a}} fez; he was calmly sitting on a camp-stool, and held a small phial in one hand. Not a word did he speak for a long time. At length one of the onlookers, a tipsy working-man, becoming impatient, addressed him: ...|$|E
60|$|But in vain. Already we {{had left}} the little groups of onlookers behind. We were rolling {{downwards}} out of the piazza. <b>Broad-cloth</b> had seized the bag and was running beside us in agony. Out of the piazza we rolled, Rochester had not put on the engines {{and we were just}} simply rolling down the gentle incline by the will of God. Into the dark outlet-street we melted, towards the still invisible sea.|$|E
60|$|The post was stowed away. A native {{in black}} <b>broad-cloth</b> came running and sweating, {{carrying}} an ox-blood suit-case, {{and said we}} must wait for his brother-in-law, who was a dozen yards away. Ginger Mr. Rochester sat on his driver's throne and glared in the direction whence the brother-in-law must come. His brow knitted irritably, his long, sharp nose did not promise much patience. He made the horn roar like a sea-cow. But no brother-in-law.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} the trained faculties of the Chief Inspector ceased to {{hear the voice of}} the constable. He moved to one of the windows for better light.

6000|$|One {{of these}} was a sturdy middle-aged man--whose long white [...] "pinner" [...] was {{somewhat}} finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect--the master-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the seventh as a man in shining <b>broad-cloth</b> in his family pew at church, being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme: ...|$|E

The black <b>broad-cloth</b> and silk hose will pass, but why have you not a sword at your side?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Jane's pair were an odd contrast, {{and even}} the stern disciplinarian herself could not help smiling as she watched them. Steve was superb, and might have been married on the spot, so superfine was his <b>broad-cloth,</b> glossy his linen, and perfect the fit of his gloves. While pride and {{happiness}} so fermented in his youthful bosom, {{there would have been}} danger of spontaneous combustion if dancing had not proved a safety valve, for his strong sense of the proprieties would not permit him to vent his emotions in any other way.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{at least}} no use in saying so," [...] said Montrose, [...] "in so loud a tone. The puritan weavers of Glasgow shall provide them plenty of <b>broad-cloth,</b> when we make a descent from the Highlands; and if the ministers could {{formerly}} preach the old women of the Scottish boroughs out of their webs of napery, to make tents to the fellows on Dunse Law, [The Covenanters encamped on Dunse Law, during the troubles of 1639.] I will try whether I have not a little interest both to make these godly dames renew their patriotic gift, and the prick-eared knaves, their husbands, open their purses." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>broad-cloth</b> and druggets in Wilts, Gloucester, and Worcestershire; serges in Devon and Somersetshire; narrow-cloths in Yorkshire and Staffordshire; kerseys, cottons, half-thicks, duffields, plains, and coarser things, in Lancashire and Westmoreland; shalloons in the {{counties}} of Northampton, Berks, Oxford, Southampton, and York; women's-stuffs in Norfolk; linsey-woolseys, &c, at Kidderminster; dimmeties and cotton-wares at Manchester; flannels at Salisbury, and in Wales; tammeys at Coventry; and the like. It is the same, in some respects, with our provisions, especially for the supply {{of the city of}} London, and also of several other parts: for example, when I speak of provisions, I mean such as are not made use of in the county where they are made and produced. For example: ...|$|E
60|$|Love is {{the same}} all the world over, whether it glows beneath the <b>broad-cloth</b> and spotless linen of a civilised gentleman, or under the deerskin coat of a savage. And its expression, we suspect, is {{somewhat}} similar everywhere. The coy repulse of pretended displeasure came as naturally from our plump little arctic heroine as it could have done from the most civilised flirt, and was treated with well-simulated contrition by our arctic giant, as they walked slowly towards the huts. But the Esquimau had other matters than love in his head just then, and the girl's face assumed a grave and somewhat anxious look {{as he continued to}} whisper in her ear.|$|E
60|$|Every {{conceivable}} {{species of}} comedy and farce met the eye at every turn. Costumes the most remarkable, men the most varied and peculiar, and things the most incomprehensible and unexpected, presented themselves in endless succession. Here a canvas restaurant stood, or, rather {{leaned against a}} log-store. There a tent spread its folds in juxtaposition to a deck-cabin, which seemed to have walked ashore from a neighbouring brig, without leave, and had been let out as a grog-shop by way of punishment. Chinamen in calico jostled sailors in canvas, or diggers in scarlet flannel shirts, or dandies in <b>broad-cloth</b> and patent-leather, or red Indians in nothing! Bustle, and hurry, and uproar, and joviality prevailed. A good deal of drinking, too, unfortunately, went on, {{and the results were}} occasional melodramas, and sometimes serious rows.|$|E
60|$|This {{carriage}} is {{the medium}} of our inland trade, and, as I said, is {{a branch of the}} trade itself. This great carriage is occasioned by the situation of our produce and manufactures. For example--the Taunton and Exeter serges, perpetuanas, and duroys, come chiefly by land; the clothing, such as the <b>broad-cloth</b> and druggets from Wilts, Gloucester, Worcester, and Shropshire, comes all by land-carriage to London, and goes down again by land-carriages to all parts of England; the Yorkshire clothing trade, the Manchester and Coventry trades, all by land, not to London only, but to all parts of England, by horse-packs--the Manchester men being, saving their wealth, a kind of pedlars, who carry their goods themselves to the country shopkeepers every where, as do now the Yorkshire and Coventry manufacturers also.|$|E
60|$|He {{was a very}} generous, broad-hearted man, though (like me) he {{came from}} little at first; and though he knew not that I had the least design of giving him any thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores, {{including}} some tobacco, and three or four fine medals in gold. But I was even with him in my present, which, as I have said, consisted of fine <b>broad-cloth,</b> English stuffs, lace, and fine Hollands. Also, I delivered him {{about the value of}} 100l. sterling, in the same goods, for other uses: and I obliged him to set up the sloop which I had brought with me from England, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to send the refreshments I intended to my plantation.|$|E
60|$|The {{dress of}} Ranavalona, {{as she sat}} in her balcony under her scarlet {{umbrella}} observing the troops, was gorgeous, but {{the greater part of}} it was hidden under the voluminous folds of the scarlet lamba of finest English <b>broad-cloth,</b> with which her person was enveloped. Here and there, however, portions of a rich silk dress of European manufacture could be seen, as well as various gold and silver rings, bracelets, chains, charms, and ornaments of ivory. Scarlet being the royal colour, only the Sovereign is entitled to wear the scarlet lamba or use the scarlet umbrella. The Queen's lamba was ornamented heavily with gold-lace. Her head was not much decorated, but her hair was anointed with that hideous horror of the sick-room, castor-oil! the odour of which, however, was disguised, or rather mixed, with a leaf which smelt like nutmeg.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not look}} cruel at that time, however. She {{was dressed in a}} rich satin gown, over which she wore the royal scarlet lamba, and jewels of various kinds ornamented her person. She was seated in a chair raised two or three steps above the floor, with her ladies on one side and her gentlemen on the other. The former, among whom were some really good-looking brunettes, had all adopted the English fashion of dress, with parts of native costume retained. Some wore head-dresses of {{gorgeous}} colouring, composed of ribbons, flowers, and feathers in great profusion, but as no head-dress, however strongly marked by barbaric splendour, can excel the amazing feminine crests in present use among the civilised, we refrain from attempting description! Most of the men also wore European costume, or portions thereof, some being clad in suits of black <b>broad-cloth.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lastly, I {{wrote to}} my partner, {{acknowledging}} his {{industry in the}} improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future government of my part according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly; assuring him, {{that it was my}} intention, not only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he had; with two pieces of fine English <b>broad-cloth,</b> the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black bays, and some Flanders lace of a good value.|$|E
6000|$|The {{good company}} invited by the hospitable citizen {{assembled}} {{at his house}} in Lombard Street at the [...] "hollow and hungry hour" [...] of noon, to partake of that meal which divides the day, being about the time when modern persons of fashion, turning themselves upon their pillow, begin to think, not without a great many doubts and much hesitation, that they will by and by commence it. Thither came the young Nigel, arrayed plainly, but in a dress, nevertheless, more suitable to his age and quality than he had formerly worn, accompanied by his servant Moniplies, whose outside also was considerably improved. His solemn and stern features glared forth from under a blue velvet bonnet, fantastically placed sideways on his head--he had a sound and tough coat of English blue <b>broad-cloth,</b> which, unlike his former vestment, would have stood the tug of all the apprentices in Fleet Street. The buckler and broadsword he wore as {{the arms of his}} condition, and a neat silver badge, bearing his lord's arms, announced that he was an appendage of aristocracy. He sat down in the good citizen's buttery, not a little pleased to find his attendance upon the table in the hall was likely to be rewarded with his share of a meal such as he had seldom partaken of.|$|E
60|$|The broad open quadrangle, {{and all the}} {{numerous}} balconies and terraces which surround it, were crowded with an excited mob of students. The whole three thousand odd electors who stand upon the college rolls appeared to be present, and the noise which they were making would have reflected credit on treble their number. The dense crowd surged and seethed without pause or rest. Now and again some orator would be hoisted up {{on the shoulders of}} his fellows, when an oscillation of the crowd would remove his supporters and down he would come, only to be succeeded by another at some other part of the assembly. The name of either candidate would produce roars of applause and equally vigorous howls of execration. Those who were lucky enough to be in the balconies above hurled down missiles on the crowd beneath--peas, eggs, potatoes, and bags of flour or of sulphur; while those below, wherever they found room to swing an arm, returned the fusillade with interest. The doctor's views of academical serenity and the high converse of pallid students vanished into thin air as he gazed upon the mad tumultuous scene. Yet, in spite of his fifty years, he laughed as heartily as any boy at the wild pranks of the young politicians, and the ruin which was wrought upon <b>broad-cloth</b> coat and shooting jacket by the hail of unsavoury projectiles.|$|E
6000|$|Ten P.M.--Very sleepy. Nothing {{to be seen}} outside, but {{darkness}} made visible; nothing inside {{but every}} variety of bunch into which the human form can be twisted, rolled, or [...] "massed," [...] as Miss Prescott says of her jewels. Every man's legs sprawl drowsily, every woman's head (but mine,) nods, till it finally settles on somebody's shoulder, a new proof of {{the truth of the}} everlasting oak and vine simile; children fret; lovers whisper; old folks snore, and somebody privately imbibes brandy, when the lamps go out. The penetrating perfume rouses the multitude, causing some to start up, like war horses at the smell of powder. When the lamps are relighted, every one laughs, sniffs, and looks inquiringly at his neighbor--every one but a stout gentleman, who, with well-gloved hands folded upon his <b>broad-cloth</b> rotundity, sleeps on impressively. Had he been innocent, he would have waked up; for, to slumber in that babe-like manner, with a car full of giggling, staring, sniffing humanity, was simply preposterous. Public suspicion was down upon him at once. I doubt if the appearance of a flat black bottle with a label would have settled the matter more effectually than did the over dignified and profound repose of this short-sighted being. His moral neck-cloth, virtuous boots, and pious attitude availed him nothing, and it was well he kept his eyes shut, for [...] "Humbug!" [...] twinkled at him from every window-pane, brass nail and human eye around him.|$|E
6000|$|After a {{short delay}} we {{proceeded}} to the [...] "palace," [...] which was distinguished from afar {{by a long}} projecting gable, forming a cool verandah. Descending some three hundred feet, we passed a familiar sight in Africa, where [...] "arboribus suus horror inest." [...] A tree-trunk bore three pegged skulls somewhat white with age; eight years ago they were taken off certain wizards who had bewitched their enemies. A labyrinthine entrance of transparent cane-work served to prevent indecent haste, and presently we found ourselves in presence of the Mfumo, who of course takes the title of [...] "Le Rei." [...] Nessudikira was a [...] "blanc-bec," [...] aged twenty or twenty-one, who till lately had been a trading lad at Boma--now he must not look upon the sea. He appeared habited in the usual guy style: a gaudy fancy helmet, a white shirt with limp Byronic collar, a <b>broad-cloth</b> frock coat, a purple velvet gold-fringed loin-wrap: a theatrical dagger whose handle and sheath bore cut- glass emeralds and rubies, stuck in the waist-belt; brass anklets depended over naked feet, and the usual beadle's cloak covered the whole. Truly a change for the worse since Tuckey's day, when a [...] "savage magnificence" [...] showed itself in the display of lions' and leopards' skins; when no women were allowed to be present, and when the boys could only clap hands: now the verandah {{is surrounded by a}} squatting crowd and resounds with endless chatter and scream.|$|E
60|$|In {{what shape}} the benefit accrues {{to the two}} nations from the trade, is clear enough. Germany, before the {{commencement}} of the trade, paid six shillings per yard for <b>broad-cloth.</b> She now obtains it at a lower price. This, however, is not the whole of her advantage. As the money prices of all her other commodities have risen, the money incomes of all her producers have increased. This is no advantage to them in buying from each other; because the price of what they buy has risen in the same ratio with their means of paying for it: {{but it is an}} advantage to them in buying any thing which has not risen; and still more, any thing which has fallen. They therefore benefit as consumers of cloth, not merely {{to the extent to which}} cloth has fallen, but also to the extent to which other prices have risen. Suppose that this is one-tenth. The same proportion of their money incomes as before, will suffice to supply their other wants, and the remainder, being increased one-tenth in amount, will enable them to purchase one-tenth more cloth than before, even though cloth had not fallen. But it has fallen: so that they are doubly gainers. If they do not choose to increase their consumption of cloth, this does not prevent them from being gainers. They purchase the same quantity with less money, and have more to expend upon their other wants.|$|E

"Under arms, Lord love thee! didst thou {{ever read}} {{the history of}} Sister Margaret, which flowed from a head, that, though now old and somedele grey, has more sense and {{political}} intelligence than you find now-a-days in the whole synod?

I went to scold my agent for having sent me to advise with a madman; he had stuck into his head the plume, which in more sober days he wielded between his fingers, and figured as an artillery officer. My mercer had his spontoon in his hand, as if he measured his cloth by that implement, instead of a legitimate yard.
