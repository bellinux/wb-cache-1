To evaluate the transmission efficiency, we introduced Discrete Phase Model to simulate aerosol movement. Results from simulations show that the greater transmission efficiency aerosol sampling inlet will be, the larger <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> is. At 300 mm <b>bending</b> <b>radius,</b> aerosol transmission efficiency is almost 1 for 10 µm diameter of particular matter.

A pair of etched fibers with similar core diameters {{are attached to the}} ellipse-shaped blocks built using matching refractive index material where the blocks were built with various <b>bending</b> <b>radii.</b> The tapered fibers were lapped closely with some forces exerted upon them in order to stimulate the splitting of modes between the two fibers. This study is done by experimental set-up where each of the splitter ports is connected with optical power meter to measure the power output while pressure is exerted. Characterization is executed in order to investigate and analyse which <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> gives the most optimize splitting ratio with considerable low loss for the particular splitter prepared. As for normal force of 0. 3 lbF, the optimum splitting ratio with low loss is specified having <b>bending</b> <b>radius,</b> Rc, of 13 mm whilst for external force of 3. 0 lbF, <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> is found to be 19 mm.

50|$|The minimum <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> is of {{particular}} importance in the handling of fiber-optic cables, which are often used in telecommunications. The minimum bending radius will vary with different cable designs. The manufacturer should specify the minimum radius to which the cable may safely be bent during installation, and for the long term. The former is somewhat smaller than the latter. The minimum <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> is in general also a function of tensile stresses, e.g., during installation, while being bent around a sheave while the fiber or cable is under tension. If no minimum <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> is specified, one is usually safe in assuming a minimum long-term low-stress radius not less than 15 times the cable diameter.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} forming quality and forming {{limit of the}} {{numerical}} control (NC) bending of high-pressure titanium alloy tubes, in this study, using three-dimensional (3 D) finite element method, deformation behavior of medium-strength TA 18 high-pressure tubes during NC bending with different <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> is investigated. The {{results show that the}} cross-sectional deformation and the wall thickness variation during NC bending of TA 18 tubes using a small <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> (less than 2 times of tube outside diameter) are clearly different from that using a normal <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> (between 2 and 4 times of tube outside diameter). For bending with a normal <b>bending</b> <b>radius,</b> with or without a mandrel, the distribution of the flattening in the bending area resembles a platform and an asymmetric parabola, respectively. For bending with a small <b>bending</b> <b>radius,</b> with or without a mandrel, the flattening both distributes like a parabola, but the former has a stable peak which deflects toward the initial bending section, and the latter has a more pronounced peak with a bending angle and deflects slightly toward the bending section. The wall thickness variations with a normal <b>bending</b> <b>radius,</b> with and without a mandrel, both resemble a platform when the bending angle exceeds a certain angle. For the bending with a small radius, the distribution of the wall thickness variation without a mandrel follows an approximate parabola which increases in value as the bending angle increases. If a mandrel is used, the thickening ratio increases from the initial bending section to the bending section...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic hose is graded by pressure, temperature, {{and fluid}} compatibility. Hoses are used when pipes or tubes {{can not be}} used, usually to provide {{flexibility}} for machine operation or maintenance. The hose is built up with rubber and steel layers. A rubber interior is surrounded by multiple layers of woven wire and rubber. The exterior is designed for abrasion resistance. The <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> of hydraulic hose is carefully designed into the machine, since hose failures can be deadly, and violating the hose's minimum <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> will cause failure. Hydraulic hoses generally have steel fittings swaged on the ends. The weakest part of the high pressure hose is the connection of the hose to the fitting. Another disadvantage of hoses is the shorter life of rubber which requires periodic replacement, usually at five to seven year intervals.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{flexible}} hollow core waveguide for the terahertz spectral range is demonstrated. Its cladding {{is composed of}} a circular arrangement of dielectric tubes surrounded by a heat-shrink jacket that allows the fiber to be flexible.

Bending loss is also experimentally measured and compared to numerical results. For large <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> <b>bending</b> loss scales as R− 2 b, whereas for small <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> additional resonances between core and cladding appear. The transmission window bandwidth is also shown to shrink as the <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> is reduced. An analytical model is proposed to predict and quantify both of these bending effects...|$|R
