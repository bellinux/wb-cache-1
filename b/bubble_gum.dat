Different moves use up different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging move that does not require much energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a donut that increases speed, bowling pins that can be used as clubs, and <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> that slows players down.|$|E
5|$|According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, Look Mickey {{was based}} on the Little Golden Book series. The National Gallery of Art notes that the source is {{entitled}} Donald Duck Lost and Found, written in 1960 by Carl Buettner and published through Disney Enterprises. The image was illustrated by Bob Grant and Bob Totten. An alternative theory suggests that Look Mickey and Popeye were enlargements of <b>bubble</b> <b>gum</b> wrappers. This image marked the first of numerous works in which Lichtenstein cropped his source to bring the viewer closer to the scene.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or <b>bubble</b> <b>gum.</b> Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E

Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all.

50|$|Fleer {{originally}} developed a bubblegum formulation called Blibber-Blubber in 1906. However, while this gum {{was capable of}} being blown into bubbles, in other respects it was vastly inferior to regular chewing gum, and Blibber-Blubber was never marketed to the public. In 1928, Fleer employee Walter Diemer improved the Blibber-Blubber formulation to produce the first commercially successful bubblegum, Dubble Bubble. Its pink color set a tradition for nearly all <b>bubble</b> <b>gums</b> to follow.|$|R

25|$|Bubblegum bubbles {{are formed}} when {{the tension and}} {{elasticity}} of gum polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum bolus. <b>Bubble</b> <b>gum</b> bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the bolus acts equally {{on all of the}} interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the gum base stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble recoils and the wad of gum is ready to continue being chewed.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{can come}} in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4-6.9 grams/piece and {{products}} can be differentiated by the consumers’ intent to form bubbles or the sugar/ sugarless dichotomy. Chewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. <b>Bubble</b> <b>gum</b> typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about 5-17 sticks and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or dragée gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes to bottles to blister packs. The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers. Cube or chunk gums, which are typically intended for bubble blowing, are called cut and wrap gums as they are typically severed from continuous strands of extruded gum and packaged directly.|$|E
