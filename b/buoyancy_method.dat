5000|$|Abstract: The {{densities of}} middle ear {{ossicles}} of golden moles (family Chrysochloridae, order Afrosoricida) were measured using the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>method.</b> The internal {{structure of the}} malleus was examined by high-resolution computed tomography, and solid-state NMR {{was used to determine}} relative phosphorus content. The malleus density of the desert golden mole Eremitalpa granti (2.44 g/cm3) was found to be higher than that reported in the literature for any other terrestrial mammal, whereas the ossicles of other golden mole species are not unusually dense. The increased density in Eremitalpa mallei is apparently related both to a relative paucity of internal vascularization and to a high level of mineralization. This high density is expected to augment inertial bone conduction, used for the detection of seismic vibrations, while limiting the skull modifications needed to accommodate the disproportionately large malleus. The mallei of the two subspecies of E. granti, E. g. granti and E. g. namibensis, were found to differ considerably from one another in both size and shape.|$|E

The results showed that GDL porosity decreased as the amount of hydrophobic polymer additive was increased. In general, the observed decrease in porosity was in agreement with the theoretical pore volume reduction calculated for a given PTFE loading. A simple mass-based analysis was performed to estimate the amount of PTFE in a given sample, which revealed that materials generally do not possess the PTFE loading they are reported to have, a fact that was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis.

40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution and mean {{particle size}} {{are the most important}} characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure {{particle size distribution}}s. For solid-liquid systems, the particle size distributions have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the particle size distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then particle size is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the particle size distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the particle size distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the particle size distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of particle size distributions by the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> which is a novel method in particle size distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in particle size distribution measurement by the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method.</b> The result data obtained by the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> were comparable with the others particle size analyzer, such as sedimentation balance method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering <b>method.</b> The <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> is suitable for measuring the settling particle size distribution and the floating particle size distribution. The <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> could be used to measure the particle size distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The particle size distribution obtained by the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> could be used to estimate the smaller particle size by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean particle size was defined. Beside, the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> could be used to determine the mean particle sizes for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry. Similar to other methods to analyze particle size, the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> is accurate in an initially homogeneous suspension. Because the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> apparatus can be made by hand, it is also economical. Additionally, the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> is easier to be implemented compared to other sedimentation particle analysis methods. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} characteristics of cement quality is particle size distribution. There are several simple methods to measure the particle size distribution of cement based on the Stokes diameter, like Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. A major disadvantages of these methods are they are time consuming process and require special skills. Particle size distribution also can be analyzed by using a different principle through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering methods and Coulter counter method. Even these methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, however, the equipments are expensive. In the present study, it has developed a new method to overcome the problem. The <b>method</b> is the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method.</b> This method is a simple and cost-effective. The principle of the <b>buoyancy</b> weighing-bar <b>method</b> that the density change in a suspension due to particle migration is measured by weighing buoyancy against a weighing– bar hung in the suspension, and the particle size distribution is calculated using {{the length of the}} weighing-bar and the time–course change in the the apparent mass of the weighing–bar. This apparatus consists of an analytical balance with a hook for underfloor weighing, and a weighing–bar, which is used to detect the density change in suspension.

Supergranulation is {{a pattern}} of the {{velocity}} field at {{the surface of the}} Sun, which has been known about for more than fifty years, however, no satisfactory explanation of its origin has been proposed. Aims. New observational constraints are therefore needed to guide theoretical approaches which hesitate between scenarios that either invoke a large-scale instability of the surface turbulent convection or a direct forcing by <b>buoyancy.</b> <b>Methods.</b> Using the 14 -Mpixel CALAS camera at the Pic-du-Midi observatory, we obtained a 7. 5 h-long sequence of high resolution images with unprecedented field size. Tracking granules, we have determined the velocity field at the Sun’s surface in great detail from a scale of 2. 5 Mm up to 250 Mm. Results. The kinetic energy density spectrum shows that supergranulation peaks at 36 Mm and spans on scales ranging between 20 Mm and 75 Mm. The decrease of supergranular flows in the small scales is close to a k − 2 -power law, steeper than the equipartition Kolmogorov one.

40|$|Aims. Twisted {{magnetic}} fields are frequently seen to emerge above the visible {{surface of the}} Sun. This emergence is usually associated {{with the rise of}} buoyant magnetic flux structures. Here we ask how {{magnetic fields}} from a turbulent large-scale dynamo appear above the surface if there is no magnetic <b>buoyancy.</b> <b>Methods.</b> The computational domain is split into two parts. In the lower part, which we refer to as the turbulence zone, the flow is driven by an assumed helical forcing function leading to dynamo action. Above this region, which we refer to as the exterior, a nearly force-free magnetic field is computed at each time step using the stress-and-relax method. Results. Twisted arcade-like field structures are found to emerge in the exterior above the turbulence zone. Strong current sheets tend to form above the neutral line, where the vertical field component vanishes. Time series of the magnetic field structure show recurrent plasmoid ejections. The degree to which the exterior field is force free is estimated as the ratio of the dot product of current density and magnetic field strength to their respective rms values. This ratio reaches values of up to 95 % in the exterior. A weak outward flow is driven by the residual Lorentz force.

40|$|The {{risk for}} gap {{formation}} in composite restorations {{is determined by}} the shrink age due to polymerisation, the viscous flow and creep of the filling material and its adhesion to the cavity wall.

Probably the most important influence is given by the shrinking behaviour. Therefore, as a first step, the goal {{of this study was to}} get more information on the time dependence of the polymerisation shrinkage of several newer polymer based filling materials.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the combined effects of Earth’s rotation and stabilizing surface buoyancy flux upon the wind-induced turbulent mixing {{in the surface}} layer. Two different length scales, the Garwood scale and Zilitinkevich scale, have been proposed for the stabilized mixing layer depth under Earth’s rotation. Here, this study analyzes observed mixed layer depth plus surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes obtained from Argo floats and satellites, finding that the Zilitinkevich scale is more suited for observed mixed layer depths than the Garwood scale. Large-eddy simulations (LESs) reproduce this observed feature, except under a weak stabilizing flux where the mixed layer depth could not be identified with the <b>buoyancy</b> threshold <b>method</b> (because of insufficient buoyancy difference across the mixed layer base). LESs, however, show that the mixed layer depth if defined with buoyancy ratio relative to its surface value follows the Zilitinkevich scale even under such a weak stabilizing flux. LESs also show that the mixing layer depth is in good agreement with the Zilitinkevich scale. These findings will contribute to {{better understanding of the}} response of stabilized mixing/mixed layer depth to surface forcings and hence better estimation/prediction of several processes related to stabilized mixing/mixed layer depth such as air–sea interaction, subduction of surface mixed layer water, and spring blooming of phytoplankton biomass...|$|R
40|$|Ice Station Belgica was {{commenced}} in {{late winter}} 2007 in the Bellingshausen Sea as part of Sea Ice Mass Balance in Antarctica (SIMBA), an IPY 2007 cruise on the research vessel N. B. Palmer. A primary objective was {{to build on the}} work of previous Antarctic drift station experiments to geophysically characterize sea ice in terms of thickness, surface and ice bottom morphology, and ultimately area-unitized mass. A 24 day drift station was established at approximately 70 °S and 93 °W in mixed first-year and multi-year ice with three geophysical study sites selected on a 5 km 2 floe. A comprehensive time series assessment of elevation-surveyed transects ranging from 100 m to 300 m in length included snow surface elevation, snow depth, electromagnetic (EM) profiling, and direct drilling for ice draft and ice freeboard. Additional work included a snow surface morphology characterization of a 100 m x 300 m area between the primary time series EM transects. Correlation of EM ice thicknesses with collocated drilled ice thickness yielded equations for the correction of EM underestimation of thick deformed ice, particularly at pressure ridges. Mean ice thickness from corrected EM was compared to isostatic ice thickness calculated from surface elevation, snow depth, ice freeboard and respective snow, slush, ice, and sea water densities. Results were consistent, with mean ice thicknesses for multi-year ice of 2. 35 m, 2. 34 m, and 2. 41 m, with similar variance, for corrected EM, drilling, and <b>buoyancy</b> <b>methods</b> respectively. Additionally, a mean ice thickness of 2. 31 m was calculated from ASPeCt observations of the ice field associated with the floe, using the method incorporating mean sail heights and fractional coverage of surface deformities or ridging. Temporal series assessment of ice freeboard indicated a slightly negative mean ice freeboard (< 0. 04 m), with clear evidence of new snow-ice formation from the freezing of slush. The three distinct snow and ice regions assessed on the Belgica floe had mean corrected EM ice thickness of 0. 52 +/- 0. 04 m (+/- 1 std. deviation), 0. 92 +/- 0. 17 m, and 2. 35 +/- 1. 37 m, and mean snow depths of 0. 08 +/- 0. 03 m, 0. 36 +/- 0. 09 m, and 0. 68 +/- 0. 31 m respectively. Each ice type represented a sizable fraction of the floe's total area (similar to 20 %, 40 %, and 40 % respectively from visual estimates) reflecting a complex dynamic and thermodynamic history of formation, as well as the difficulty in characterizing even a single floe by a single class or mean value for thickness and snow depth. Implications of these results are discussed with regards to the resolution of satellite-based altimetry and snow depth products and efforts to generate and validate satellite sea ice and snow thickness products...|$|R

40|$|A good {{knowledge}} of the volume-fraction porosity is essential in any technical work on porous materials. In construction materials the porosity is commonly measured by the Archimedes <b>buoyancy</b> <b>method,</b> from which the bulk density of the test specimen is also obtained. The porosity and the bulk density together fix the solid density of the specimen, as {{only two of the}} three quantities are independent. The solid density, although rarely discussed, is determined by the mineralogy of the specimen, and therefore can provide a valuable check on the accuracy of porosity and bulk density measurements. Our analysis of published data on calcitic limestones shows that the solid density is generally close to the ideal crystallographic density of calcite. Small deviations can often be traced to variations in mineral composition. However some published porosity–density data are inconsistent with the known mineralogy. Deviations which cannot be ascribed to composition may be assumed to arise from measurement errors. We show the value of using the solid density as a quality check on the measured porosity. We recommend that the solid density should always be calculated for this purpose when the Archimedes method is used.

Round robin trials were organized involving five European laboratories, which measured the particle densities of 15 pellet and five briquette types. The test included stereometric methods, methods based on liquid displacement (hydrostatic and buoyancy) applying different procedures and one method based on solid displacement. From the results for both pellets and briquettes, {{it became clear that}} the application of a method based on either liquid or solid displacement (only tested on pellet samples) leads to an improved reproducibility compared to a stereometric method. For both, pellets and briquettes, the variability of measurements strongly depends on the fuel type itself. For briquettes, the three methods tested based on liquid displacement lead to similar results. A coating of the samples with paraffin did not improve the repeatability and the reproducibility. Determinations with pellets proved to be most reliable when the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>method</b> was applied using a wetting agent to reduce surface tensions without sample coating.

In this study, we investigated the surface runoff velocity on two types of paving blocks layers, and a smooth pavement as comparison. The paving blocks type were rectangular blocks, which have 3. 2 % openings ratio and hexagonal blocks, which have 6. 5 % openings ratio. We used a tilted plot covering area of 2 × 6 m, equipped by a rainfall simulator to accommodate the variation of surface slope and rainfall intensity.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In {{the past}} ten years, renewed {{research}} interest has shown the benefits of internal curing by incorporating saturated lightweight fine aggregate (LWFA) in high performance concrete (HPC). As a result, the technology of internal curing has steadily progressed from laboratory studies to field applications. To determine the optimum LWFA content, information about the propensity for shrinkage in the cement paste, specifically the chemical shrinkage value, is needed. However, {{there is a lack}} of information on how to determine the ultimate chemical shrinkage value for HPC with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and/or shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA). The purpose of this thesis was to identify a simple procedure to determine ultimate chemical shrinkage values for given concrete systems with SCMs and/or SRA. Modifications to the ASTM C 1608 (Standard Test Method for Chemical Shrinkage of Hydraulic Cement Paste) were investigated up to a 14 day age. Neat paste (cement only), as well as binary and ternary systems, were measured to investigate the influence of SCMs and SRA on chemical shrinkage. Based on the observed data, an experimental prediction model was adopted and verified to estimate ultimate chemical shrinkage values for portland cement systems containing SCMs and/or SRA. The model agreed well with the obtained data and simplified the existing method of determining the ultimate chemical shrinkage value. Another purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of SCMs and SRA on autogenous deformation of HPC for which a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>method</b> was used. The findings provided insight into the mechanisms behind autogenous shrinkage and effective strategies to reduce autogenous shrinkage. Calcium aluminate cements (CACs) were also investigated as part of this research project as a rapid repair material for applications, such as high performance concrete bridge decks. Chemical shrinkage and autogenous deformation of CAC binders were tested in a similar manner to the OPC systems in this study. It was observed that GCX paste cured isothermally at 38 °C exhibited expansion with a particular shape of chemical shrinkage development curve. An X-ray diffraction suggested that the expansion might be related to the conversion process indicating that chemical shrinkage may be used as a predictor of conversion processes for CAC systems in isothermal condition...|$|E
40|$|Fluid {{pressure}} {{is a crucial}} factor to tubular string strength and deformation in oil and gas wells, {{and it is the}} most difficult factor to deal with. When the string constrained by downhole tools, such as packers, action pattern of fluid on string is changed. Calculation methods of string stress and deformation given by engineering handbooks doesn’t distinguish these issues in detail. So mistakes are often made when these methods are used. Tangled concepts lead to large calculation error. In this paper, the influence of fluid pressure on string axial force and deformation, buoyancy treatment in packed condition, are discussed roundly both in vertical wells and directional wells. Practical calculating method of string axial force through the hook load is presented, and element buoyancy in different borehole trajectory is given. It is found that the traditional simplified <b>buoyancy</b> coefficient <b>method,</b> which is used to calculate string axial force and axial extension, can only be used in vertical wells with tubular string suspended freely, because in this condition buoyancy acts on the bottom of string. If the string is constrained by downhole tools, such as packer or anchor, buoyancy could not be treated as usual. In directional well the buoyancy not only changes string axial force but induces shear stress in string cross section. When calculating the influence of fluid on string, operation sequence and constraints from borehole and downhole tools should be considered comprehensively...|$|R

One of the main challenges in developing such models is to treat the buoyant rise of toroidal field and the production of poloidal field from it near the surface. The previous paper by Choudhuri, Schüssler, & Dikpati (1995) did not incorporate buoyancy. We extend this model by two contrasting methods. In one method, we incorporate the generation of the poloidal field near the solar surface by Durney’s procedure of double ring eruption. In the second method, the poloidal field generation is treated by a positive α-effect concentrated near the solar surface, coupled with an algorithm for handling <b>buoyancy.</b> The two <b>methods</b> are found to give qualitatively similar results.

OA will be a challenge to most marine calcifiers, but cold water corals are thought to be particularly affected owing to the nature of their cold and often deep habitat. The ‘Fjordo Comau’ (Chilean Patagonia) already today exhibits pCO 2 values that are predicted for the year 2100 in the IPCC scenarios, comprising pH gradients up to 0. 6 within the first? 225 m. Nevertheless, the ubiquitous cold water coral Desmophyllum dianthus thrives apparently unimpaired along these gradients. It forms dense banks along the fjord and moreover occurs as a member of a deep water emergence community as shallow as 12 m. Herein we present results of an in situ experiment cross-transplanting corals between two sites with a pH difference of ~ 0. 15 (pH of 7. 93 ± 0. 09 and 7. 78 ± 0. 11). Growth was measured with the <b>buoyancy</b> weight <b>method</b> and two weeks were sufficient to show clear weight increase, still rates were relatively variable (5. 75 ± 3. 26 [mg CaCO 3 cm- 2 d- 1] and 0. 29 ± 0. 19 [% d- 1]). No differences of short-term growth rates between the two sites could be detected. Either there are factors that outbalance the adverse effects of low pH and/or cold water corals in general or Desmophyllum dianthus in particular may have a great ability to acclimatize or even adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions including pH. Nevertheless there may be limiting boundaries that restrict distribution, especially in the future when pH values will further decline...|$|R
40|$|Syntactic foams as {{building}} materials are studied. Various manufacturing parameters contributing to syntactic foam composition in {{relation with the}} ‘pre-mould’ method were identified and inter-related. An equation based on lattice unit cell models with the minimum inter-microsphere distance concept for a relation between volume expansion rate of bulk microspheres in aqueous starch and microsphere size was derived and successfully used to predict experimental data. A simple method for estimation of syntactic foam density prior to completion of manufacture was suggested. Shrinkage of syntactic foam precursor was discussed in relation with different stages such as slurry, dough and solid. Also, the ‘post-mould’ <b>buoyancy</b> <b>method</b> involving mixing starch particles and ceramic hollow microspheres in water is discussed in relation with composition and properties. It was found starch particles tend to adhere to hollow microspheres during mixing, forming agglomerations. A transition {{in the formation of}} mixture volumes in water was found to take place at a calculated relative density value of 1 for an agglomerate consisting of multiple starch particles and one microsphere. A Simple Cubic cell model for the starch-microsphere inter-distance was adopted to quantitatively explain various effects on starch content in agglomeration such as hollow microsphere size, initial bulk volume of hollow microspheres and water volume. Further, the following were found for syntactic foams: (a) volume fraction of starch in foam is of linear relation with starch content in binder for a given experimental data range and (b) shrinkage of syntactic foam precursor is relatively high for small hollow microspheres with high starch content. Compressive failure behaviour and mechanical properties of the manufactured foams were evaluated. Not much difference in failure behaviour or in mechanical properties between the two different (pre- and post-mould) methods was found for a given binder content in syntactic foam. Compressive failure of all syntactic foams was of shear on plane inclined 45 ° to compressive loading direction. Failure surfaces of most syntactic foams were characterised by debonded microspheres. Compressive strength and modulus of syntactic foams were found to be dependant mainly on binder content but independent of microsphere size. Some conditions of relativity arising from properties of constituents leading to the rule of mixtures relationships for compressive strength and to understanding of compressive/transitional failure behaviour were developed. The developed relationships based on the rule of mixtures were partially verified. Novel sandwich composites made of syntactic foam core and paper skin were developed. Interface bonding between syntactic foam core and paper skin was controlled by varying starch content. Two different microsphere size groups were employed for syntactic foam core manufacturing. Properties of skin paper with starch adhesive on were found to be affected by drying time of starch adhesive. Skin paper contributed to increase up to 40...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The shear viscosity, density, thermal expansivity and {{specific}} heat capacity are important factors controlling the morphology, rheology, and texture of volcanic flows and deposits. These physical properties of silicate melts largely depend on chemical composition, water content, crystal content, bubble content and stress applied to the melt. Recently, it has been recognized that the applied stress {{plays an important role}} in the so called “glass transition” area of silicate melts. This kinetic boundary between brittle and ductile behavior affects the eruptive style. Thorough knowledge of the physical processes that occur at this brittle/ductile transition can affect the decision making of governments during volcanic crises and help to reduce and/or avoid loss of life and assets. Scientific knowledge from this research can be directly applied to the geomaterial industry. In addition, natural magmatic rocks are the major raw material in the production of microfibres and continuous fibres. Compared to normal glass fibres, rock fibres have a remarkable high temperature endurance, acid and alkali resistance and anti-heat impact. Rock products can be used as substitutes for metal and timber. They are likely to become more widely used in the near future. Further use for natural magmatic rocks include crushed stone, concrete aggregate, railroad ballast, production of high quality textile fibres, floor tiles, acid-resistant equipment for heavy industrial use, rockwool, basalt pipers, basalt reinforcement bars, basalt fibre roofing felt (ruberoid), basalt laminate (used as a protective coating), heat-insulating basalt fibre materials and glass wool (fibre glass). Since Bottinga and Weill (1970) first suggested that the density of melts in two or three component systems could be used to determine partial molar volumes of oxide components in silicate liquids, several models based upon this approach have been proposed in the Earth sciences literature. Considering that knowledge the densities of 8 Zn-bearing silicate melts have been determined, in equilibrium with air, in the temperature range of 1363 to 1850 K. The compositional joins investigated [sodium disilicate (NS 2) - ZnO; anorthite-diopside 1 atm eutectic (AnDi) -ZnO; and diopside-petedunnite] were chosen based on the pre-existing experimental density data set, on their petrological relevance, and in order to provide a test for significant compositionally induced variations in the structural role of ZnO. The ZnO concentrations investigated range up to 25 mol% for sodium disilicate, 20 mol% for the anorthite-diopside 1 atm eutectic, and 25 mol% for petedunnite. Molar volumes and expansivities have been derived for all melts. The molar volumes of the liquids decrease with increasing ZnO content. The partial molar volume of ZnO derived from the volumetric measurements for each binary system is the same within error. A multicomponent fit to the volumetric data for all compositions yields a value of 13. 59 (0. 55) cm 3 /mol at 1500 K. I find, no volumetric evidence for compositionally induced coordination number variations for ZnO in alkali-bearing vs. alkali-free silicate melts nor for Al-free vs. Al-bearing silicate melts. The partial molar volume of ZnO determined here may be incorporated into existing multicomponent models for the prediction of silicate melt volume. High temperature density determinations on ZnO-bearing silicate melts indicate that a single value for the partial molar volume of ZnO is sufficient to describe the volumetric properties of this component in silicate melts. The presence of alkalies and Al does not appear to influence the partial molar volume of ZnO within the temperature range investigated here. There is no volumetric evidence across this temperature range presented for composition to influence the coordination polyhedron of ZnO in silicate melts. The next physical property to be studied was thermal expansivity. Ten compositions from within the anorthite-wollastonite-gehlenite (An-Wo-Geh) compatibility triangle were investigated. Due to the lack of information about the thermal expansivities at supercooled liquid temperatures this study focused on the measurement of thermal expansivity using a combination of calorimetric and dilatometric methods. The volumes at room temperature were derived from densities measured using the Archimedean <b>buoyancy</b> <b>method.</b> For each sample density was measured at 298 K using glass that had a cooling-heating history of 10 - 10 K min- 1. The thermal expansion coefficient of the glass from 298 K to the glass transition interval was measured by a dilatometer and the heat capacity was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter from 298 to 1135 K. The thermal expansion coefficient and the heat flow were determined at a heating rate of 10 K min- 1 on glasses that were previously cooled at 10 K min- 1. Supercooled liquid density, molar volume and molar thermal expansivities were indirectly determined by combining differential scanning calorimetric and dilatometric measurements assuming that the kinetics of enthalpy and shear relaxation are equivalent. The data obtained on the supercooled liquids were compared to high-temperature predictions from the models of Lange and Carmichael (1987), Courtial and Dingwell (1995) and Lange (1997). The best linear fit combines the supercooled liquid data presented in this study and the high temperature data calculated using the Courtial and Dingwell (1995) model. This dilatometric/calorimetric method of determining supercooled liquid molar thermal expansivity greatly increases the temperature range accessible for thermal expansion. It represents a substantial increase in precision and understanding of the thermodynamics of calcium aluminosilicate melts. This enhanced precision demonstrates clearly the temperature independence of the melt expansions in the An-Wo-Geh system. This contrasts strongly with observations for neighboring system such as Anorthite-Diopside and raises the question of the compositional/structural origins of the temperature dependence of thermal expansivity in multicomponent silicate melts. In addition, the partial molar volumes and the thermal expansivities of 10 samples from within the An-Wo-Geh compatibility triangle have been determined. They have been incorporated into existing multicomponent models in order to predict silicate melt volume. The resulting supercooled liquid volumes near glass transition temperatures (1135 - 1200 K) and at superliquidus temperature were combined to yield temperature independent thermal expansivities over the entire temperature range. In light of results presented in this study, together with the published data, it seems that binary and ternary systems have temperature independent thermal expansivities from the supercooled liquid to the superliquidus temperature at 1 atmosphere. By combining the high temperature densitometry data (i. e., above liquidus) from the literature with volume and expansivity data obtained at Tsc, a wide temperature range is covered. There is no volumetric evidence across this temperature range for temperature independent thermal expansivities in the An-Wo-Geh compatibility triangle. Furthemore, the thermal expansivities of three multicomponent glasses and liquids have been obtained over a large temperature interval (298 - 1803 K) which involved combining the results of low and high temperature measurements. The sample compositions investigated were derived from three natural lavas; Vesuvius 1631 eruption, Etna 1992 eruption and an Oligocene-Miocene lava flow from Slapany in the Bohemian massif. The original rocks are tephri-phonolite, trachybasalt and basanite, respectively. This is the first time this calorimetric/dilatometric method has ever been applied to natural magmatic melts. The low temperature volumes were derived from measurements of the glass density of each sample after cooling at 5 K. min- 1 at 298 K, followed by measurements of the glass thermal expansion coefficient from 298 K to the samples´ respective glass transition interval. Supercooled liquid volumes and molar thermal expansivities were determined by combining scanning calorimetric and dilatometric measurements, assuming that the kinetics of enthalpy and shear relaxation are equivalent (Webb, 1992). High temperature densities were measured using Pt double bob Archimedean densitometry. In addition, the oxidation state of iron was analyzed using a wet chemistry method. Small amounts of samples were taken from the liquids using a “dip” technique at regular temperature steps during high temperature densitometry. The measured high temperature densities have been compared with predicted densities across the same temperature interval calculated using the multicomponent density models of Lange and Carmichael (1987) and Lange (1997). The resulting data for liquid volumes near glass transition temperatures (993 - 1010 K) and at super-liquidus temperatures (1512 - 1803 K) are combined to yield temperature dependant thermal expansivities over the entire supercooled and stable liquid range. These results confirm the observation of Knoche et al. (1992 a); Knoche et al. (1992 b); Toplis and Richet (2000); Liu and Lange (2001); Gottsmann and Dingwell (2002) of the temperature dependence of thermal expansivity. The molar volumes indicate, in general, a significant negative temperature dependence of the expansivity. The thermal molar expansivity of the glasses increase from SiO 2 -poor (basalt-basanite composition) to relatively SiO 2 -rich melts (tephri-phonolite composition). The thermal molar expansivity at supercooled liquid temperatures increases in the same manner as the glasses. In contrast, the thermal molar expansivity of the superliquidus liquid decrease from SiO 2 -poor to relatively SiO 2 -rich melts. Non-linear dependency of molar volume has been observed for all studied samples above the glass transition area. Molar volume from just above the glass transition area to about 1873 K can be predicted by a non-linear logarithmic curve. This study examined the expansivities and molar volumes of relatively basic compositions. Extending such a study to more SiO 2 -rich, but still geologically relevant, compositions remains a challenge, because the high viscosities of such melts preclude the use of immersion techniques. This problem can be solved using a high temperature densitometry where the volume is measured on levitated sample. I would like to urge studies of this sort in the future. Results from such studies should provide important information regarding a number of geological processes, which occur in such extremely high viscous liquids. A new viscosity measurement for melts spanning a wide range of anhydrous compositions including: rhyolite, trachyte, moldavite, andesite, latite, pantellerite, basalt and basanite are discussed in the last chapters. Micropenetration and concentric cylinder viscometry measurements cover a viscosity range of 10 - 1 to 1012 Pas and a temperature range from 973 to 1923 K. These new measurements, combined with other published data, provide a high-quality database comprising ~ 800 experimental data on 44 well -characterized melt compositions. This database is used to recalibrate the model proposed by Giordano and Dingwell [Giordano, D., Dingwell, D. B., 2003 a. Non-Arrhenian multicomponent melt viscosity: a model. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 208, 337 – 349] for predicting the viscosity of natural silicate melts. The recalibration shows that: a) the viscosity (η) –temperature relationship of natural silicate liquids is very well represented by the VFT equation [log η=A+B/ (T−C) ] over the full range of viscosity considered here, b) the use of a constant high-T limiting value of melt viscosity (e. g., A) is fully consistent with the experimental data. There are 3 different compositional suites (peralkaline, metaluminous and peraluminous) that exhibit different patterns in viscosity, the viscosity of metaluminous liquids is well described by a simple mathematical expression involving the compositional parameter (SM) but the compositional dependence of viscosity for peralkaline and peraluminous melts is not fully controlled by SM. For these extreme compositions we refitted the model using a temperature-dependent parameter based on the excess of alkalies relative to alumina (e. g., AE/SM). The recalibrated model reproduces the entire database to within 5 % relative error. On the basis of this extended database the T-variation of the viscous response of strong and fragile liquids within a wide range of compositions shows three clearly contrasting compositional suites (peralkaline, metaluminous and peraluminous). As a result, I present an extended model to calculate the viscosity of silicate melts over a wide range of temperatures and compositions. This model constitutes a significant improvement with respect to the Giordano and Dingwell (2003 a) study in that: 1) The number of experimental determinations over which the model is calibrated is larger. 2) The range of investigated compositions is larger. 3) The investigated temperature range is larger. 4) The assumption is made that at infinite temperature, the viscosity of silicate melts converges to a common, but unknown value of the pre-exponential factor (A=− 4. 07, Equation (7. 1)). In particular the compositional range involves a large number of viscosity determinations for peralkaline and peraluminous compositions in a temperature interval between 949 and 2653 K. Furthermore, it is shown that the assumption of a common value of the pre-exponential parameter A produces an equally good representation of the experimental data as that produced by each melt having its own specific A-value. This optimization also induces a strong coupling between data sets that stabilizes the range of solutions and allows the different rheological behaviour of extreme compositions (peralkaline and peraluminous vs. metaluminous) to be discriminated. It was demonstrated that, although the parameter SM (Giordano and Dingwell, 2003 a) can be used to model compositional controls on the viscosities of metaluminous liquids, it does not capture the viscosity of peralkaline and peraluminous liquids. The differences in the rheological behaviour of these extreme compositions reflect important differences in the structural configuration of metaluminous, peralkaline and peraluminous melts. Subsequently, a second regression of the experimental data was performed involving a second compositional parameter (AE) that accounts for the excess of alkali oxides over the alumina. Incorporating this temperature-dependent compositional parameter (i. e., AE) into the SM-based model (Equation 7. 7) appears to account for the anomalous rheological behaviour of peralkaline and peraluminous liquids. The resulting model reproduces the entire experimental database to within an average RMSE of 0. 45 log units. The model presented here is recommended for the estimation of the viscosity of anhydrous multicomponent silicate melts of volcanic interest...|$|E

In southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), fasting and foraging related fluctuations in body composition are reflected by buoyancy changes which can be monitored by changes in drift rate. Here, we present an improved knowledge-based <b>method</b> for detecting <b>buoyancy</b> changes from compressed and abstracted dive profiles received through telemetry. We applied this step-wise filtering method to the dive records of 11 southern elephant seals, which identified 0. 8 % to 2. 2 % of all dives as drift dives. At {{the beginning of the}} migration, all individuals were strongly negatively buoyant. Over the following 75 to 150 days, the buoyancy reached a peak close to or at neutral buoyancy, indicative of a seal’s foraging success. Ground-truthing confirmed that this new knowledge-based method is capable to reliably detect buoyancy changes in the dive records of drift diving species using abstracted dive profiles. This affirms that the abstraction algorithm conveys sufficient detail of the geometric shape of drift dives for them to be identified. It also suggest that using this step-wise filtering <b>method,</b> <b>buoyancy</b> changes could be detected even in old datasets with compressed dive information, for which conventional drift dive classification previously failed.

40|$|An air-ingress {{accident}} {{followed by}} a pipe break is considered as a critical event for a very high temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR). Following helium depressurization, it is anticipated that unless countermeasures are taken, air will enter the core through the break leading to oxidation of the in-core graphite structure. Thus, without mitigation features, this accident might lead to severe exothermic chemical reactions of graphite and oxygen. Under extreme circumstances, a loss of core structural integrity may occur along with excessive release of radiological inventory. Idaho National Laboratory {{under the auspices of}} the U. S. Department of Energy is performing research and development (R&D) that focuses on key phenomena important during challenging scenarios that may occur in the VHTR. Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT) studies to date have identified the air ingress event, following on the heels of a VHTR depressurization, as very important (Oh et al. 2006, Schultz et al. 2006). Consequently, the development of advanced air ingress-related models and verification and validation (V&V) requirements are part of the experimental validation plan. This paper discusses about various air-ingress mitigation concepts applicable for the VHTRs. The study begins with identifying important factors (or phenomena) associated with the air-ingress accident by using a root-cause analysis. By preventing main causes of the important events identified in the root-cause diagram, the basic air-ingress mitigation ideas can be conceptually derived. The main concepts include (1) preventing structural degradation of graphite supporters; (2) preventing local stress concentration in the supporter; (3) preventing graphite oxidation; (4) preventing air ingress; (5) preventing density gradient driven flow; (4) preventing fluid density gradient; (5) preventing fluid temperature gradient; (6) preventing high temperature. Based on the basic concepts listed above, various air-ingress mitigation methods are proposed in this study. Among them, the following two mitigation ideas are extensively investigated using computational fluid dynamic codes (CFD) : (1) helium injection in the lower plenum, and (2) reactor enclosure opened at the bottom. The main idea of the helium injection method is to replace air in the core and the lower plenum upper part by <b>buoyancy</b> force. This <b>method</b> reduces graphite oxidation damage in the severe locations of the reactor inside. To validate this method, CFD simulations are addressed here. A simple 2 -D CFD model is developed based on the GT-MHR 600 MWt design. The simulation results showed that the helium replace the air flow into the core and significantly reduce the air concentration in the core and bottom reflector potentially protecting oxidation damage. According to the simulation results, even small helium flow was sufficient to remove air in the core, mitigating the air-ingress successfully. The idea of the reactor enclosure with an opening at the bottom changes overall air-ingress mechanism from natural convection to molecular diffusion. This method can be applied to the current system by some design modification of the reactor cavity. To validate this concept, this study also uses CFD simulations based on the simplified 2 -D geometry. The simulation results showed that the enclosure open at the bottom can successfully mitigate air-ingress into the reactor even after on-set natural circulation occurs...|$|R
