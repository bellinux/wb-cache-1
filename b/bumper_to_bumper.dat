About three-thousand people were employed to repair the trains at the Spencer Shops {{in the first half}} of the twentieth-century. The Flue Shop, where all the flues for steam engines were formerly produced, has become the <b>Bumper</b> <b>To</b> <b>Bumper</b> exhibit, featuring vintage and antique cars. These include: several Model Ts, a Model A, and even a Ford Model R (the 1907 predecessor to the Model T). A Highway Patrol car from 1935, a Divco Milk Truck, a Lincoln Continental and others are also part of the museum's collection.|$|E

5000|$|Continuing northward, the {{expressway}} {{passes the}} Jamaica Hospital and intersects Jamaica Avenue at exit 6. I-678 expands to eight lanes as it crosses under Hillside Avenue (NY 25B), which is serviced by exit 6 {{in the opposite}} direction. A short distance later, the highway comes to a large interchange for NY 25 (Queens Boulevard) east at exit 8 and exit 9. After crossing under Hoover Avenue, I-678 enters the interchange with the Grand Central Parkway. In the complex interchange, the interstate crosses on overpasses over Union Turnpike, the Grand Central and different interchange ramps before returning at-grade in Flushing. There, the highway turns northwestward once again, interchanging at exit 11 with Harry Van Arsdale Junior Avenue via Park Drive East. Crossing through Flushing Meadows Corona Park, I-678 continues northward into an interchange with College Point Boulevard at exit 12A and the Long Island Expressway (I-495) at exit 12B. After the interchange with the Long Island Expressway, the Van Wyck continues northeastward. A short distance later, the expressway crosses under Roosevelt Avenue and the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. After passing Citi Field, I-678 crosses into exit 13 for NY 25A (Northern Boulevard), where {{the name of the}} freeway changes to the Whitestone Expressway. The Van Wyck is usually <b>bumpers</b> <b>to</b> <b>bumper</b> between the Belt Parkway underpass and [...] Main Street (Exit 8 Northbound).|$|R
40|$|With {{reference}} to the vehicular traffic scenario depicted in Figure 1, we define as i the vehicle whose behavior is currently under investigation. At a given time instant t, such vehicle is at a position xi(t), and travels with a speed vi(t), meaning that its instantaneous acceleration can be expressed as dvi(t) dt. Indexes i − 1 and i + 1 identify the back and front vehicles with respect to i, which are located at xi− 1 (t) and xi+ 1 (t), and travel at velocity vi− 1 (t) and vi+ 1 (t), respectively, at time t. The front <b>bumper</b> <b>to</b> back <b>bumper</b> distance between i and i + 1 is identified as ∆xi(t). Indexes j − 1 and j + 1 identify the back and front vehicles with respect to i, in a different lane, considered for lane change. These vehicles are at positions xj− 1 (t) and xj+ 1 (t) and travel with speed vj− 1 (t) and vj+ 1 (t), respectively. Also, we denote input parameters for the vehicular mobility descriptions with consistent notation in different models.

On Thursday January 9, {{it was announced that}} Richard Petty would sell his team to GEM, moving Sorenson to the No. 43 for the 2009 season in the process. The 43 ran multiple sponsorships from McDonald's, Valvoline, the United States Air Force, Super 8, Reynolds Wrap, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Charter Communications, Auto Value <b>Bumper</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bumper,</b> Liberty Medical, and Siemens, but only had one top-ten finish; a ninth at the rained-shortened Daytona 500.

25|$|In 1999, Waltrip got {{his first}} career win as an owner/driver at the All Pro <b>Bumper</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bumper</b> 300. The next year, he {{switched}} to the No. 7 as well as driving the No. 99 car with Aarons sponsorship for three races, his best finish coming at Michigan International Speedway, where he placed second. Ted Christopher drove the No. 99 at Memphis Motorsports Park with sponsorship from LesCare Kitchens, qualifying 29th and finishing 28th. MWR switched to the No. 99 full-time in 2001, as Waltrip drove twelve races, his best finish third at the Aaron's 312. Waltrip also fielded the 99 for three races for Shawna Robinson, who had a 19th at Talladega Superspeedway, and Kerry Earnhardt, whose best finish was a 20th at Kentucky Speedway.|$|E
25|$|A few Hyderabads {{fell back}} to the next {{battalion}} (Lt.Col.Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles {{in front of the}} more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column stacked up, almost <b>bumper</b> <b>to</b> <b>bumper.</b> If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called in {{at this point in the}} battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their stacked up and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This golden opportunity for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded loop road that enabled them to by-pass the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment.|$|E
25|$|The 98 car {{started as}} the 91 car in 2002. Three drivers drove the No. 91: Dick Trickle at Talladega Superspeedway (failing to qualify); Hank Parker, Jr. at Rockingham Speedway with {{sponsorship}} from USG Corporation; and Casey Atwood at Homestead-Miami Speedway with a sponsorship from Mountain Dew (after {{being released from}} the No. 7 car). The car returned in 2003 at Pocono Raceway and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, with Atwood driving the 91 Mountain Dew Live Wire-sponsored Dodge at Pocono and an unsponsored entry at Indy. In 2004, Bill Elliott relinquished his full-time duties to drive the No. 91 in a part-time deal at Las Vegas, Texas, and Indianapolis. Elliott also ran three races in a No. 98 Dodge under his own Bill Elliott Racing banner, utilizing Evernham equipment and crew members and the owners points of Mach 1 Racing, in part to avoid conflict with sponsor Coca-Cola (Evernham's No. 9 and No. 19 cars were both sponsored by Mountain Dew). He returned to drive the 91 in a part-time deal in 2005 in nine races held at Fontana, Atlanta, Texas, Charlotte, Michigan, Indianapolis, Michigan, Fontana, and Texas. Elliott had sponsorships from UAW, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Stanley Tools, Auto Value / <b>Bumper</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bumper,</b> and Visteon.|$|E

The relationship between axle weight and spacing, known as the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, is designed to protect bridges.

500|$|Shimon Avidan, the {{commander}} of the Givati Brigade, which was responsible for the southern Shephelah area (including most southern Israeli villages at the time), asked to allocate forces to stop or hinder the Egyptian advance. A number of 65mm Napoleonchik cannons were given to Givati, and units from the Palmach's Negev Brigade were poised to assist it, despite a severe shortage of manpower and munitions in the brigade. On May 28, Czech technicians at the Ekron Airbase finished assembling four Avia S-199 planes (a Messerschmitt variant) brought from Czechoslovakia, which were meant to harass the Egyptian air force base at El Arish, thus forming the IDF's first fighter squadron. Despite being untested, the Chief of Operations Yigael Yadin ordered the planes to assist Avidan's forces. According to Lou Lenart, an American pilot who flew one of the fighters, Avidan told the pilots that Givati [...] "were desperate because between the Egyptian army of ten thousand men with several hundred vehicles and Tel Aviv stood only about 250 Israeli soldiers. The Egyptians were so confident of victory that they were lined up <b>bumper</b> <b>to</b> <b>bumper</b> behind the bridge".|$|E
