50|$|With the New Holland EdgeWrap system, net {{is brought}} to the bale by a {{duckbill}} net applicator. The system penetrates in the <b>bale</b> <b>chamber</b> for positive wrapping material delivery. The duckbill net applicator is wider than the <b>bale</b> <b>chamber,</b> providing coverage of the bale edge. The use of wide net provides over the edge coverage.|$|E
50|$|To {{form the}} bale, the {{material}} to be baled, (which is often hay or straw) in the windrow is lifted by tines in the baler's reel. This material is then packed into the <b>bale</b> <b>chamber,</b> which runs the length of {{one side of the}} baler (normally the right hand side when viewed from the front). A combination plunger and knife move {{back and forth in the}} front of this chamber, with the knife closing the door into the <b>bale</b> <b>chamber</b> as it moves backwards. The plunger and knife are attached to a heavy asymmetrical flywheel to provide extra force as they pack the bales. A measuring device—normally a spiked wheel that is turned by the emerging bales—measures the amount of material that is being compressed and, at the appropriate length it triggers the knotters that wrap the twine around the bale and tie it off. As the next bale is formed the tied one is driven out of the rear of the baling chamber onto the ground or onto a special wagon or collecting sled hooked to the rear of the baler. This process continues as long as there is material to be baled, and twine to tie it with. The bales emerge with four sides. The twine runs, in two parallel loops, around the wider sides. Of the two narrower sides, there is a cut side and a dull side, and when stacked for storage or transport the bales are normally positioned with the cut side facing outwards.|$|E
40|$|This thesis for {{bachelor}} degree {{focuses on a}} comparison of pick-up round balers, one with a variable <b>bale</b> <b>chamber</b> (baler John Deere 580 with cutting) and one with a constant <b>bale</b> <b>chamber</b> (baler Krone Rond Pack 1250 MultiCut). The two balers were compared in respect {{to the quality of}} cutting, bale density and haylage quality. Other compared parameters included capacity, costs of baling, packaging, loading and transport of baled fodder, analysis of costs per 1 kg of fodder and simple analyses of investment and operating costs. The quality of haylage was better for the JD 580 baler and it was classified as excellent. The baler Round Pack 1250 produced better values of bale density: 221. 09 kg. m- 3 for hay, 428. 57 kg. m- 3 for haylage and 173. 46 kg. m- 3 for straw. Hourly baling capacities were 8. 12 t. h- 1 for hay and 11. 55 t. h- 1 for haylage. The baling costs were 104. 2 CZK. t- 1 for haylage and 210. 36 CZK. t- 1 for hay. The costs per 1 hectare were 376. 6 CZK and the costs per 1 kg of haylage and hay were 0. 539 CZK. kg- 1 and 0. 606 CZK. kg- 1 respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{comparing}} the round baler with variable <b>bale</b> <b>chamber.</b> The press Vicon RV 1601 OC 14 was compared with press Welger RP 435 Master. The evaluation was conducted from three perspectives. The first was {{the construction of the}} machine. The second was economic and the last one was the quality of work. Furthermore comparing was done per the performance, the cost of molding, packaging and simple analysis of investment and operating costs. The quality of the design was better with the press Welger. This press was measured to better results in bale density per hundred percent dry matter with straw 98. 13 kg. m- 3. Greater hourly output during molding were measured on the press Welger. From an overall perspective was evaluated press Welger better...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the crop density in a New Holland BB 960 (branch of CNH Global N. V.) large square baler as examined by crop trajectory from the precompression room to the <b>bale</b> <b>chamber.</b> This study also examined both {{the top and bottom}} plunger pressures and critical factors affecting the final top and bottom bale densities. The crop trajectories (wad of crop) were measured using a high-speed camera {{from the side of the}} baler through viewing windows. The viewing windows were divided into four regions for determining the crop displacement, velocity and acceleration. Crop strain was used to evaluate the potential change in density of the crop before being compressed by the plunger. Generally, the vertical crop strain was found to be higher in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom. Average strain values for side measurements were 12. 8 % for the top and 2. 1 % for the bottom. Plunger pressures were measured to compare peak pressures between the top and bottom halves of each compressed wad of crop, and to develop pressure profiles based on the plunger’s position. Results of comparing the mean peak plunger pressures between the top and bottom locations indicated the mean pressures were significantly higher at the top location with the exception of one particular setting. Resulting pressure profile graphs aided in qualitatively describing the compression process for both top and bottom locations. A stepwise regression model was developed to examine the difference in material quantity in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom, based on bale weights. The model indicated that flake setting, stuffer ratio and number of flakes had the greatest effect on maintaining consistent bale density by comparing top to bottom halves of each bale. The R 2 (coefficient of determination) value for the developed model was of 59. 9 %. The R 2 was low although could be accounted for due to the limited number of data points in the developed model...|$|E
40|$|This Diploma Theses {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of two pick-up balers which compress crop into compact bales. The balers are made and delivered by different manufacturers with a variable <b>bale</b> <b>chamber</b> and cutting mode {{at the moment of}} haylage, hay and straw harvesting. Specifically, the given assessment compared John Deere 960 Baler and Kuhn VB 2160 Baler while considering the following parameters: quality of cutting, bale density, haylage, capacity and performance, economic analysis and recommendation for their use in agriculture. John Deere 960 Baler achieved better results in the majority of performed tests. The values of bale density were the following: 666. 25 kg. m- 3 (haylage), 221. 39 kg. m- 3 (hay), 176. 62 kg. m- 3 (straw). The assessment of haylage quality was excellent. The given baler (JD 960) also excelled at harvesting capacities: 20. 89 t. h- 1 (haylage), 15. 61 t. h- 1 (hay) and 12. 54 t. h- 1 (straw). Baling costs per 1 kilogram of forage revealed the following figures: 0. 036 CZK (haylage), 0. 079 CZK (hay) and 0. 101 CZK (straw). Costs assessment for practical use of both balers per operating year indicates that the JD 960 Baler´s use is more cost effective by 1, 320 CZK per 100 hectares (haylage), by 2, 690 CZK (hay) and by 6, 000 CZK (straw) in comparison with Kuhn VB 2160 Baler. As a consequence, the use and operation of John Deere 960 Baler can be recommended to large-sized companies with a sufficient amount of financial resources which can be invested in purchase of the given machinery. The baler is suitable for large areas with the demanding seasonal harvesting. On the other hand, Kuhn VB 2160 Baler did not show such an impressive result as JD 960 Baler. However, its use and operation is recommended to small or medium-sized agricultural companies which can appreciate the baler´s performance especially during hay and straw harvesting...|$|E
