25|$|The general {{classes of}} table saws are <b>benchtop,</b> contractor, cabinet, and hybrid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benchtop</b> {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a <b>benchtop</b> table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). <b>Benchtop</b> saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the <b>benchtop</b> that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In {{applications}} where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the <b>benchtop</b> with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|Large {{areas of}} floors and <b>benchtops</b> in the {{laboratories}} of the Explosives and Ammunition Composite at Materials Research Laboratories {{are covered with}} an antistatic material. Electrical resistance testing of this material after laying is reported. Testing {{was carried out in}} accordance with BS 2050 : 1961 and BS 3398 : 1961. 7. Approved for Public Releas...|$|R
5000|$|The wood is {{relatively}} hard and dense, {{and is often}} used for firewood. It has very high resistance to rotting {{and can be used}} for fence posts, piers, sleepers. Heartwood dark red, sapwood pale yellow. Very dense, hard, fine grained timber, difficult to work, but polishes to a high sheen. Has been used for furniture, turnery, boat-building, <b>benchtops.</b> Popular as a craft furniture timber during the 1990s and early 2000s, Nicholas Dattner [...] famously used ironbark that had been submerged as a wharf pier for 80 years in a range of tables. At about 1130 kg/m3 {{it is one of the}} few timbers that will not float.|$|R
25|$|<b>Benchtop</b> table saws, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} job-site saws, are lightweight and {{are designed to}} be placed on a table or other support for operation. They commonly have direct drive (no v-belt or pulleys) from a universal motor. They can be lifted by one person and carried to the job location. These saws often have parts made of steel, aluminum and plastic and {{are designed to be}} compact and light.|$|E
25|$|NMR spectrometers are {{relatively}} expensive; universities usually have them, {{but they are}} less common in private companies. Modern NMR spectrometers have a very strong, large and expensive liquid helium-cooled superconducting magnet, because resolution directly depends on magnetic field strength. Less expensive machines using permanent magnets and lower resolution are also available, which still give sufficient performance for certain application such as reaction monitoring and quick checking of samples. There are even <b>benchtop</b> nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers. NMR {{can be observed in}} magnetic fields less than a millitesla. Low-resolution NMR produces broader peaks which can easily overlap one another causing issues in resolving complex structures. The use of higher strength magnetic fields result in clear resolution of the peaks and is the standard in industry.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{sequencing}} {{was done}} in sequencing centers, centralized facilities (ranging from large independent institutions such as Joint Genome Institute which sequence dozens of terabases a year, to local molecular biology core facilities) [...] which contain research laboratories with the costly instrumentation and technical support necessary. As sequencing technology continues to improve, however, {{a new generation of}} effective fast turnaround <b>benchtop</b> sequencers has come within reach of the average academic laboratory. On the whole, genome sequencing approaches fall into two broad categories, shotgun and high-throughput (or next-generation) sequencing.|$|E
50|$|The {{candy bar}} was {{located on the}} Barker Street side of the foyer. An office, which was {{previously}} part of the coffee shop, was next to the candy bar at a level between {{the upper and lower}} foyers with small sets of steps between the two. Doors to both male and female toilets were opposite the candy bar. The doors were timber panelled consistent {{with the rest of the}} interior and had the same style signage. The female toilets retained a separate powder room area with a small vinyl covered bench and large mirrors on the far wall. Toilet cubicles and <b>benchtops</b> were terrazzo of a neutral colour. The male toilets hada large vestibule with a wall mounted copper sculpture hung against a bright yellow wall. The toilet partitions were also terrazzo.|$|R
40|$|Wipe {{sampling}} of surfaces {{was carried out}} in the pharmacy compounding area and inpatient and outpatient wards of a South Australian public hospital that administered cytotoxic drugs to clients. 5 -flourouracil (5 -FU) was chosen as an indicator cytotoxic drug, as it was commonly used and administered in these areas of the hospital. Analysis of wipe samples indicated that most surfaces in the pharmacy compounding area and inpatient and outpatient wards were contaminated with 5 -FU. These surfaces included phones, keyboards, chair armrests, <b>benchtops,</b> door handles, PC mouses and fridge doors. Five different decontaminant agents were tested and only one (a 0. 5 % weight per volume sodium hypochlorite solution) was found to be effective as a cleaning agent that rapidly breaks down 5 -FU and also kills bacteria. Sampling of surfaces for 5 -FU contamination post-cleaning with 0. 5 % w/v sodium hypochlorite found that this cleaning agent was effective in decontaminating the 5 -FU contaminated surfaces. M. Tkaczuk, S. -G. Lee, G. Jankewicz and F. Ambado...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} rapidly moved from large international sequencing centres to individual laboratory <b>benchtops.</b> These changes have driven the 'data deluge' of modern biology. Submissions of nucleotide sequences to GenBank, for example, have {{doubled in size}} every year since 1982, and individual data sets now frequently reach terabytes in size. While 'big data' present exciting opportunities for scientific discovery, data analysis skills {{are not part of}} the typical wet bench biologist's experience. Knowing what to do with data, how to visualize and analyse them, make predictions, and test hypotheses are important barriers to success. Many researchers also lack adequate capacity to store and share these data, creating further bottlenecks to effective collaboration between groups and institutes. The US National Science Foundation-funded iPlant Collaborative was established in 2008 to form part of the data collection and analysis pipeline and help alleviate the bottlenecks associated with the big data challenge in plant science. Leveraging the power of high-performance computing facilities, iPlant provides free-to-use cyberinfrastructure to enable terabytes of data storage, improve analysis, and facilitate collaborations. To help train UK plant science researchers to use the iPlant platform and understand how it can be exploited to further research, GARNet organized a four-day Data mining with iPlant workshop at Warwick University in September 2013. This report provides an overview of the workshop, and highlights the power of the iPlant environment for lowering barriers to using complex bioinformatics resources, furthering discoveries in plant science research and providing a platform for education and outreach programmes...|$|R
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} can use {{many different}} test probes {{to connect to}} the circuit or device under test. Crocodile clips, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while <b>benchtop</b> meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. [...] Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.|$|E
2500|$|Fusion One Corporation is a US {{organization}} {{founded in}} 2015 by Dr. Paul Sieck, Dr. Scott Cornish and Randall Volberg. They {{are developing a}} magneto-electrostatic reactor named [...] "F1" [...] that is based in-part on the polywell. It introduces a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces that provide a new means of preserving energy and particle losses {{that would otherwise be}} lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremmstralung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis, which relied on interpolation. The new model demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. Prior to building a scale reactor, they are developing an HPC simulation and <b>benchtop</b> test device using a modified spindle cusp to validate these results. Fusion One presented their work at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benchtop</b> {{automation}} {{consists in}} the use of machines of reduced size compared to large automation units found in the most resource-rich laboratories. <b>Benchtop</b> automation are often flexible, meaning that they can deal with many different tasks. Since many laboratories do not need to employ full-scale automation, <b>benchtop</b> automation can be an attractive solution for them. Also, the low-cost devices presented in the previous subsection could easily be employed as <b>benchtop</b> solutions in many cases.|$|E
40|$|The Analytical Development Section of Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) was {{requested}} by the Facilities Disposition Projects (FDP) to determine the holdup of enriched uranium in the 321 -M facility {{as part of an}} overall deactivation project of the facility. The 321 -M facility was used to fabricate enriched uranium fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the production reactors. The results of the holdup assays are essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to meet criticality safety controls. This report covers holdup measurements on two sawbench components that were used for cutting U-Al fuel rods. The benches contained U-Al residue scattered on the bench tops and bagged up in plastic containers. It was very important to obtain an estimate of the HEU content of this residue in order to remove criticality concerns before vacuuming it into a much smaller volume. A portable high purity germanium (HPGe) detection system and a portable sodium iodide (NaI) detection system were used to determine highly enriched uranium (HEU) holdup and to determine holdup Np- 237 and Am- 241 that were observed in these components. The measured Np- 237 and Am- 241 contents were especially important in these components because their presence is unusual and unexpected in 321 -M. It was important to obtain a measured value of these two components to disposition the saw benches and to determine whether a separate waste stream was necessary for release of these contaminated components to the E-Area Solid Waste Vault. The reported values for Np- 237 are < 0. 8 mg on each of the two bench tops and < 3 {micro}g in the bag of chips. The reported values for Am- 241 are < 500 ng on the two bench tops and < 15 ng in the bag of chips. Our results demonstrate an upper limit of {sup 235 }U content of 0. 4 g on the two <b>benchtops</b> and of 0. 1 mg in the bag of chips. These reported values completely eliminated the criticality concerns. This report discusses the methodology, non-destructive assay (NDA) measurements, and results of the holdup measured {{for each of the three}} actinide species in these saw benches...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Benchtop</b> nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectrometer (<b>Benchtop</b> NMR spectrometer) refers to a Fourier transform nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (FT-NMR) spectrometer that is significantly more compact and portable than the conventional equivalents, such that it is portable and can reside on a laboratory <b>benchtop.</b> This convenience comes from using permanent magnets, which have a lower magnetic field and decreased sensitivity compared to the much larger and more expensive cryogen cooled superconducting NMR magnets. Instead of requiring dedicated infrastructure, rooms and extensive installations these <b>benchtop</b> instruments can be placed directly on the bench in a lab and moved as necessary (e.g., to the fumehood). These spectrometers offer improved workflow, even for novice users, as they are simpler and easy to use. They differ from relaxometers in {{that they can be}} used to measure high resolution NMR spectra and are not limited to the determination of relaxation or diffusion parameters (e.g., T1, T2 and D).|$|E

50|$|<b>Benchtop</b> LCR meters {{sometimes}} have selectable test frequencies {{of more than}} 100 kHz. They often include options to superimpose a DC voltage or current on the AC measuring signal. Lower end meters might offer the possibility to externally supply these DC voltages or currents while higher end devices can supply them internally. In addition <b>benchtop</b> meters typically allow the usage of special fixtures (ie, Kelvin wiring, that is to say, 4-wire connections) to measure SMD components, air-core coils or transformers.|$|E
