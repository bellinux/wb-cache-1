A dispute with the neighboring island of Sigeum was arbitrared by Periander of Corinth, who handed over political control of a swath of the mainland to Tenedos. In the first century BC this territory was eventually incorporated into Alexandria.|$|E

500|$|To prevent ethical conflicts, James Madison {{proposed}} language at the Constitutional Convention {{that was}} adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other Founding Fathers. Historically, {{a number of}} approaches {{have been taken to}} address the problem posed by restriction; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or reducing the offending emoluments to the level prior to when the nominee took office. Although Congress passed the mechanism reducing emoluments in 1909, the procedure was named [...] "Saxbe fix" [...] after Senator William Saxbe, who was confirmed as Attorney General in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level it had been before Saxbe's term commenced.

In the fourth season, Willow becomes romantically involved with fellow-student Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), an experienced witch. The Big Bad in season four {{is the result of the}} work of a covert military force called [...] "The Initiative" [...] who are capturing and performing experiments on vampires and demons in Sunnydale. Buffy and her friends discover that chief amongst these experiments is the creation of a human-cyber-demonoid hybrid known as Adam (George Hertzberg), whose programming has gone terribly wrong, leading him to wreak havoc on the town. Buffy's challenge is to find a way to disempower him, something she and the Scoobies achieve in the penultimate episode of season four, [...] "Primeval". In order to do this, the four magically join their essences together to create a single [...] "super Slayer"; while the others perform a ritual, Buffy confronts and defeats Adam while mystically empowered with Giles' mind, Xander's heart, and Willow's spirit aiding her. The ritual employs four tarot-like cards: Manus (meaning hands or strength) represents Buffy, Sophus (meaning teacher or wise) represents Giles, Animus (meaning courage, or heart) represents Xander, and Spiritus (meaning spirit and magical power) represents Willow.

2500|$|Hip hop {{has made}} a {{considerable}} social impact {{since its inception in}} the 1970s. [...] "Hip hop has also <b>become</b> <b>relevant</b> to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language, learning, identity, and curriculum." [...] Orlando Patterson, a sociology professor at Harvard University, helps describe the phenomenon of how hip hop has spread rapidly around the world. Patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy, the government, and major businesses in Third World nations and countries around the world. He also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hip hop scene. As a result, the youth are influenced by the American hip hop scene and start their own forms of hip hop. Patterson believes that revitalization of hip hop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with American hip hop music, and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hip hop.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{legacy of}} the Revolt of the Barretinas was an {{enduring}} anti-French sentiment in the Catalan leadership and intelligentsia. [...] This would <b>become</b> <b>relevant</b> a decade later in 1700, when King Charles II died without a son. [...] Charles' death triggered the War of the Spanish Succession. [...] The two claimants were the French Philip, Duke of Anjou and the Austrian Emperor Leopold I. [...] The Spanish government chose Philip; French King Louis XIV, Philip's grandfather, naturally supported his grandson as well. [...] The Catalan upper classes, still distrustful of France from its efforts to stir the peasantry against them in 1689, had no love for Philip. [...] He was [...] "a king chosen by Castilians." [...] In 1702, the cortes voted to recognize Leopold as king, and full-scale rebellion against Philip began in 1705 {{with the arrival of}} supporting Austrian troops. [...] The war would continue for nine more years, until the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the last remaining Catalan supporters of Leopold were defeated by the combined Franco-Castilian army. [...] The Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip from 17071714, ended the nominal split between Castile and Aragon and eliminated the traditional autonomy Aragon had kept.

2500|$|In {{more modern}} applications, {{microbial}} cellulose has <b>become</b> <b>relevant</b> {{in the medical}} sector. [...] It [...] has been tested and successfully used as a wound dressing, especially in burn cases. [...] Studies have shown that burns treated with microbial cellulose coverings healed faster than traditional treatments and had less scarring. [...] The microbial cellulose topical applications are effective due to the cellulose's water holding ability and water vapor permeability. [...] The high water holding ability provides a moist atmosphere at the injury site, which is critical in healing, while the wicking ability allows seepage from the wound {{to be removed from}} the site. [...] Also, the microbial cellulose molds very well {{to the surface of the}} skin, providing a conformal covering even in usually difficult places to dress wounds, such as areas on the face. [...] This technique has been so successful that commercial microbial cellulose products, such as Biofill ®, have been developed. [...] Another microbial cellulose commercial treatment product is XCell produced by the Xylos Corporation, which is mainly used to treat wounds from venous ulcers. [...] Studies have also been performed where traditional gauze dressings are treated with a microbial cellulose biopolymer to enhance the properties of the gauze. [...] In addition to increasing the drying time and water holding abilities, liquid medicines were able to be absorbed by the microbial cellulose coated gauze, allowing them to work at the injury site.|$|E

2500|$|William the Conqueror {{successfully}} invaded England in 1066 with an {{army that}} included some Bretons. William {{was able to}} attract Bretons into his expeditionary army for the upcoming campaign to claim the English crown., perhaps {{in part because the}} Breton commanders in Duke William's army were the second-sons of Breton lords, such as Alain Le Roux (son of Eudas of Penthièvre). The Bretons within the Conquest army represented at least three major groupings, two of which would <b>become</b> <b>relevant</b> to the long-term future of the duchy. One group was represented by Ralph de Gael, briefly the Earl of Suffolk. In 1075 he was among the leaders of a [...] "Breton revolt". Ralph escaped returning to Brittany where he also revolted against the Breton Duke before eventually reconciling with the duchy. To the south and west of England, William granted lands to groups of Breton nobles who were more fractious than united, whether in Brittany or in England. This group had no one singular leader who could serve a unifying role [...] Their numbers included Herve of Leon, the viscount of Leon, who was briefly the Earl of Wiltshire. The third group were those nobles associated with the Richmond-Penthièvre family. Odo of Penthièvre was a principal antagonist of Conan II. Under William I, at three of Odo of Penthièvre's sons (Alan, Stephen and Brien) were granted substantial lands in England, including the Honour of Richmond, lands in Suffolk, and the Earldoms of Richmond and Cornwall.|$|E

[...] He was critical of the graphics, writing [...] "there are a smattering of areas and effects that are cooler than the original, but for the most part the visuals look dated and uncreative [...] That isn't to say that the graphics are offensive, but compared to the original -- whose graphics were a strong point -- it's definitely a step down." [...] He concluded [...] "I was convinced that more of a great thing would be an even greater thing. I thought Black Isle would do as fine a job with the series as Snowblind did. I was wrong on both counts. While Dark Alliance II is a good game, it has barely progressed the series." [...] Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said much the same; [...] "Black Isle Studios took over the development chores on this edition, and essentially delivered the same game again.
