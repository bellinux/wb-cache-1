However, {{most of these are}} subjective methods. This thesis strives to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new device, the Dorsiflexometer {{that can be used to}} objectively assess one’s balance abilities. The Dorsiflexometer was constructed and mathematically modelled using appropriate simplifying assumptions. After its construction, the Dorsiflexometer was tested using two experimental set-ups to obtain raw data. Both these set-ups consisted of the two tiltable platforms equipped with three load cells each, the <b>bridge</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and the personal computer (PC). The only difference in the two experimental set-ups is in the type of test that was performed as well as the <b>bridge</b> <b>amplifiers</b> used. Numerous parameters, such as the radius of movement and the Lyapunov number can be extracted from the raw data. A computer program was written to analyse the raw data and present the results in a user-friendly manner.

This suggested circuit is {{making use of}} a resistance-to-time converter employing a <b>bridge</b> <b>amplifier,</b> an integrator and a comparator. The second resistive sensor (Rz) is transformed into duty cycle. Another bridge with varying resistor, (Ry) in the feedback of an OP AMP is added in series to change the amplitude of the resulting signal in a proportional relationship while keeping the same frequency and duty cycle representing proportional changes in resistors Rx and Rz already mentioned. The resultant output signal carries three types of information embedded as variations of its frequency, duty cycle and amplitude. The amplitude of the o/p voltage is linearly proportional to changes in a resistor (Ry), while changes in another resistor (Rz), are proportional to duty cycle, along with changes in a third resistor (Rx) are shown to be proportional frequency of the same signal. Hence this work is about using the same principles but deriving a signal with information from three resistive transducers such as duty cycle, frequency and amplitude.

Most ES arrays use Wheatstone <b>bridge</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to condition the sensor signals, but such an approach is only suitable for null detection and low resistance sensors.

40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} with a <b>bridge</b> <b>amplifier</b> of CA 1 pyramidal neurones {{in vitro}} {{were employed to}} study the mechanisms of action of exogenously applied adenosine in the hippocampal slice preparation of the rat. Adenosine enhanced the calcium-dependent, long-duration after-hyperpolarization (a. h. p.) {{at least in part}} by a reduction in the rate of decay of the a. h. p. Both the reduced rate of decay and that of the control can be described with a single exponential. Antagonism of the calcium-dependent potassium current (and as a result, the a. h. p.) by bath application of CdCl 2 or intracellular injection of EGTA (ethyleneglycolbis-(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid) did not reduce the adenosine-evoked hyperpolarization or decrease in input resistance. Similarly, TEA (tetraethylammonium), which antagonizes both the voltage- and calcium-sensitive, delayed, outward rectification, had no effect on the adenosine-evoked changes in resting membrane properties. Adenosine did not affect the early, transient, outward rectification. During exposure to 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) in concentrations sufficient to antagonize this early rectification, the changes in resting membrane properties evoked by adenosine were unaffected. We conclude that the enhancement of the a. h. p. and accommodation by adenosine may be mediated by a change in the regulation of intracellular calcium. However, the mechanism responsible for the hyperpolarization and decrease in input resistance evoked by adenosine is both calcium and voltage insensitive. Thus, it appears distinct from that mediating the enhancement of the a. h. p. and accommodation...|$|R

During dynamometer calibration the correlation coefficient (R 2) between force and output voltage was 0. 99. Ultimately, the laboratory tests and evaluation were performed and the correct performance of set was proved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{fabrication}} {{and experimental}} characterization of a microinjection molded piezoresistive polymer accelerometer is presented here. The simplicity and low-cost of the fabrication process {{are a major}} advantage of the proposed alternative for the fabrication of microaccelerometers. Also, the compatibility with injection molded technologies enables direct integration of the devices into complex structures. Accelerometers have been fabricated using thermoplastic material (POM). The main structure of the accelerometer consists of a proof mass connected to an external structure by four arms. At {{the end of each}} arm, a pizoresisistive material is used for transduction. A Wheatstone <b>bridge</b> and an <b>amplifier</b> are used to measure the accelerometer output. Fabricated devices show a sensitivity of 56 mV/g, a resonance frequency of 270 Hz and a dynamic range of ± 37 g...|$|R
