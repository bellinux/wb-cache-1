40|$|The {{load bearing}} {{capacity}} of aging reinforced concrete structures, such as bridges, is increasingly extended {{with the use of}} Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). Premature failure, which is attributed to the rigid behaviour of the bonding agent (epoxy resin) and the high stresses at the interface region, can occur because of the debonding of CFRP sheets from host surfaces. To overcome the debonding issue, the epoxy resin is modified by different reactive liquid polymers to improve its toughness, flexibility, adhesion, and impact resistance. This study reports the usage of two reactive liquid polymers, namely, liquid Carboxyl-Terminated <b>Butadiene-Acrylonitrile</b> (CTBN) and liquid Amine-Terminated <b>Butadiene-Acrylonitrile</b> (ATBN), to improve the mechanical properties of the commercially available MBrace saturant resin when added to a ratio of 100 : 30 by weight. The neat and modified epoxies were analysed using the Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) to determine and compare the storage modulus and glass transition temperatures of these materials. Moreover, the bonding strength of neat and modified epoxies was evaluated through single-lap shear tests on CFRP sheets bonded to concrete prisms. The results indicate that the modified resins exhibited improved ductility and toughness and became reasonably flexible compared with the neat epoxy resin. The improved properties will help delay the premature debonding failure in CFRP retrofitted concrete members...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhase {{separation}} between {{two or more}} isotropic polymers is usually studied by unpolarized or polarized light scattering (SALS).

However, these resins were somewhat brittle. This paper reports the modification of these phosphorus-containing resins by an amine-terminated <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> copolymer (ATBN) and a perfluoroalkylene diaromatic amine elastomer (3 F). An approximately two-fold increase in short beam shear strength and flexural strength was observed at 7 percent ATBN concentration.

Anaerobic char yields of the resins at 800 C and the limiting oxygen indexes of the laminates decreased with increasing ATBN concentration. The perfluorodiamine (3 F) was used with both imide resins at 6. 4 percent concentration. The shear strength was doubled {{in the case of the}} bisimide with no loss of flammability characteristics.

The seals are inspected by the thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy, the influence of 105 °C on the o-rings is also evaluated in terms of changes in tensile properties. The greatest changes in the composition and structure are observed on o-rings particularly due to temperature of 105 °C, there was a significant reduction in dilatability and an increase in stiffness and glass transition temperature. The root cause is the surface and centre additive decomposition and oxidation. The bolts have suffered from decomposition of the protective surface layer and the additives in the centre, structural change was minor. Exposure to 75 °C has resulted in a gradual loss of low molecular weight substances. Liquids at room temperature didn‘t affect the structure of the seals, at 105 °C it caused a loss of weight due to decomposition of the protective surface layer and release of additives and the products of their decomposition. Results showed that the common use of the NBR seals at 105 °C is unsuitable, at 75 °C it leads to gradual changes, loss in mechanical and sealing properties...|$|E

This effort involved the screening of ten plastic materials in four simulant mixed-waste types. These plastics were <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> copolymer rubber, cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), epichlorohydrin rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), fluorocarbon (Viton or Kel-F), polytetrafluoroethylene, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), isobutylene-isoprene copolymer rubber (butyl), polypropylene, and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). The selected simulant mixed wastes were (1) an aqueous alkaline mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite; (2) a chlorinated hydrocarbon mixture; (3) a simulant liquid scintillation fluid; and (4) a mixture of ketones. The testing protocol involved exposing the respective materials to 286, 000 rads of gamma radiation followed by 14 -day exposures to the waste types at 60 {degrees}C.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to present the results of {{research}} programme on influence of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers on plasticized polyvinylchloride compounds used as window gasket material. Design/methodology/approach: Short review concerning application of modified plasticized PVC compounds as gasket material was presented. In experimental part two types of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers were used as elastomeric plasticizers for PVC. Formulations with fifteen different levels of elastomeric modifiers content (up to 25 % by weight) were prepared and tested. As reference formulations three commercial compounds were additionally tested. Shore hardness, short-term and long-term elastic recovery, tensile strength, elongation at break and migration of plasticizers from gasket material to unplasticized PVC were searched. Findings: Incorporation of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers into PVC enhanced many properties essential for its application as window gasket material. The most important changes occurred for long-term and short term elastic recovery, tensile strength and elongation at break. At the same time addition of these <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> elastomers did not change migration of other plasticizers contained in gasket material into rigid PVC in being in contact with gasket. Obtained results showed that among tested compounds best properties as gasket material exhibited plasticized PVC with 23 % of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer Chemigum P 83. Reference commercial formulations exhibited worse performance properties than new compounds with this acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer. Practical implications: Research programme allowed to elaborate plasticized PVC compounds modified with acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer that can be industrially applied for PVC window gaskets. Originality/value: Obtained results are of scientific and practical value. Research programme allowed to investigate the influence of elastomeric modifiers on plasticized PVC properties.

The plastics evaluated in this program were <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> copolymer (Nitrile rubber), cross-linked polyethylene, epichlorohydrin, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), fluorocarbons, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), butyl rubber, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). These plastics were first screened in four simulant mixed wastes. The liner materials were screened using specific gravity measurements and seal materials by vapor transport rate (VTR) measurements. For the screening of liner materials, Kel-F, HDPE, and XLPE were found to offer the greatest resistance to the combination of radiation and chemicals. The tests also indicated that while all seal materials passed exposure to the aqueous simulant mixed waste, EPDM and SBR had the lowest VTRs. In the chlorinated hydrocarbon simulant mixed waste, only Viton passed the screening tests.

The selected simulant mixed wastes were (1) an aqueous alkaline mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite; (2) a chlorinated hydrocarbon mixture; (3) a simulant liquid scintillation fluid; and (4) a mixture of ketones. The screening testing protocol involved exposing the respective materials to approximately 3 kGy of gamma radiation followed by 14 -day exposures to the waste simulants at 60 C.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the use of rheological equations of state to describe the behaviour of vulcanised elastomers and, in particular, vulcanised elastomers loaded with carbon black. The properties of these materials are dependent upon the specific combination of elastomer and carbon black, and the effect of carbon black loading is studied by means of experiments on a <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> base polymer KRYNAC 806, unfilled and loaded with 50 phr SRF N 774 carbon black. The first part of this work concerns small ampIitude oscillatory shear experiments carried out on a Weissenberg rheogoniometer over a range of amplitudes, frequencies, and temperatures. Both materials are found to remain within the linear viscoelastic region for temperatures greater than about - 10 °c, to obey the time-temperature superposition principle, and to have identical shift factors. Dynamic moduli over a reduced frequency range of about ten decades of log frequency are characterised by the Huet model. The second part concerns finite deformation experiments consisting of prestraining samples in simple tension and applying small axial oscillations when stress relaxation is almost complete. Dependencies of the incremental dynamic moduli measured in this way are investigated with regard to frequency and extension ratio. Moduli measurements indicate that the time dependence of the materials is unaffected by deformation, although relaxation spectrum functions for the filled sample are strain dependent. A criterion is established for testing whether results can be modelled by a certain class of non-linear viscoelastic constitutive equations. A constitutive equation is proposed which represents the strain dependence of moduli for both the filled and unfilled materials. Other published data are shown not to conform to the above criterion. It is also shown that despite this fact, in some cases at least, the proposed constitutive equation provides a better represent at ion of published data than other constitutive equations which have hitherto been applied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the formulation of}} a ternary thermosetting adhesive which consists of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) epoxy resin cured with 3, 3 ’-diamino diphenyl sulphone (3, 3 ’-DDS) hardener and modified through the addition of carboxyl- terminated <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> (CTBN) rubber and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Processing implications of the novel adhesive in the film form are considered in order to manufacture bonded specimens for characterisation of the adhesive performance in structural joints. The ternary blend which represents the novel adhesive formulation is also characterised in bulk form. The cure kinetics behaviour of the novel ternary blend is investigated using differential scanning calorimetry which shows 10 % reduction in the total reactivity, and therefore reduced final crosslinking density, {{with the addition of}} the carbon nanotubes. A cure kinetics model is developed for the novel ternary thermoset. From characterisation of cast samples, a toughening effect of the phase separated rubber particles is observed, from 144 to 317 J/m 2, with a further increase to 551 J/m 2 {{in the presence of the}} carbon nanotubes. In the absence of rubber, the nanotubes alone produce a minimal effect upon the thermo-mechanical and mechanical characteristics of the resin. The morphology of the cured material is affected by the presence of the nanoparticles, resulting in the reduction of the mean rubber particle size from 3 µm to below 1 µm. The electrical conductivity of the cured resin samples is found to increase by six orders of magnitude, up to 3. 6 x 10 - 3 S/m in the ternary blend for a low carbon nanotube concentration of 0. 3 wt%. DCB and ELS tests are used to study the performance of the novel adhesive in a joint configuration. The adhesive joint strength is dependent on the substrate type as well as on the surface preparation. The novel adhesive is also examined under fatigue in a ‘bonded crack retarder’ application.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} ability of several {{different}} epoxies to be toughened with the addition with 20 nm silica nanoparticles (nanosilica). The formation of ‘hybrid’ epoxy polymers, containing both silica nanoparticles and carboxyl-terminated <b>butadiene-acrylonitrile</b> (CTBN) rubber micro-particles, is also discussed. The structure/property relationships are considered, {{with an emphasis on}} the toughness and the toughening mechanisms. Particular attention was given to an anhydride cured diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) system where the fracture energy increased from 83 to 204 J/m 2 with the addition of 20 wt. % of silica nanoparticles. Plastic shear bands followed by debonding of the matrix from the silica nanoparticles, and subsequently plastic void growth of the epoxy were found to be the operative toughening mechanisms. The largest increases in toughness observed were for the ‘hybrid’ materials where a synergistic behaviour on the fracture energy. A maximum fracture energy of 1051 J/m 2 was measured for a ‘hybrid’ epoxy polymer containing 10 wt. % silica nanoparticles and 9 wt. % rubber micro-particles. The toughening mechanisms for such systems were postulated to be rubber-particle cavitation, shear band yielding and void growth and debonding and plastic void growth of the nanosilica necklaces. Ultimately, these polymers are intended to be used as matrices in fibre-reinforced composites. Therefore, resistance to delamination as fibre-composites has been examined for such modified epoxies. The interlaminar fracture energies for the fibrecomposite materials were found to increase even further by a fibre bridging toughening mechanism. However, the fibre-matrix adhesion is shown to be an important parameter. The present work has extended an existing model to predict the toughening effect of the nanoparticles in the epoxy polymer. There was excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for epoxy containing the silica nanoparticles, and for epoxy polymers containing rubber or coreshell particles. Inferences have been made about the toughenability of the epoxy being sensitive to particle-matrix adhesion and the ability for the matrix to shear yield.
