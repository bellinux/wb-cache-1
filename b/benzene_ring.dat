25|$|Unlike most amines, indole is not basic: {{just like}} pyrrole, the {{aromatic}} {{character of the}} ring means that the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation.

Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of the portion of the molecule located outside of the <b>benzene</b> <b>ring.</b> The protonated form has an pKa of −3.6.
