40|$|Abstract—Hemodialysis is {{the most}} common {{treatment}} for pa-tients with end-stage renal disease. For hemodialysis, consistently functional vascular access must be surgically created with an anas-tomosis of artery and vein, referred to as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, AVF dysfunction may occur over time. Angiog-raphy and Doppler ultrasound are usually used to detect the flow or the diameter of the AVF. But they require well-trained opera-tors and are expensive, and even angiography is invasive. In this study, a noninvasive approach based on stethoscope auscultation for monitoring AVF stenosis was proposed. Here, a wireless blood flow sound recorder was designed to record <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sounds</b> wire-lessly. In order to effectively extract the varying feature of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sounds</b> for AVF stenosis, the 2 -D feature pattern built from S-transform was also proposed as the feature in the AVF stenosis detecting algorithm. Different from other frequency-related coef-ficients, the feature pattern can contain the information of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sounds</b> in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Pre-liminary findings showed that the proposed approach can provide high-quality estimation of AVF stenosis (positive predictive value= 87. 84 % and sensitivity = 89. 24 %).

A new set of 17 features extracted in the time, frequency and in the state space domain is suggested. The features applied for murmur classification are selected using the floating sequential forward method (SFFS). Using this approach, the original set of 17 features is reduced to 10 features.

BackgroundAn array of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents {{have the potential}} to control intrarenal circulation; however, their relative functional importance is unclear. We compared here the importance of nitric oxide and renal nerves in studies involving sequential blockade of nitric oxide synthesis and renal denervation. MethodsIn anesthetized rats, N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) was used for nonselective inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis and 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI) for inactivation of neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Acute unilateral renal denervation was performed noninvasively enabling observation of rapid changes. Renal cortical and medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was determined by laser Doppler flowmetry. ResultsL-NAME decreased medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> by 22 % to 24 %, whereas after 7 -NI, medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> decreased by 22 % and cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> about 10 % (all changes significant). In untreated rats denervation significantly increased cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (10 % to 15 %) but not medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> In rats treated with L-NAME denervation partly prevented the post-inhibitor decrease in cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> but not in medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> After 7 -NI treatment, the decrease in cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> did not occur or a partial restoration of flow was seen.

ConclusionA reduction of medullary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after 7 -NI, similar as after L-NAME, suggests that nitric oxide generated by nNOS is mainly responsible for adequate perfusion of the medulla whereas activity of nNOS and other isoform(s) is required to maintain cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Renal denervation partly restored cortical <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> reduced by nitric oxide blockade.

Qualitative comparison of tumour histology and regional <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> showed that there were areas of very low <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> associated with viable tumour regions. Less common were areas of rather high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> associated with necrotic tumour regions. A complicated relationship exists between tumour histology and <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> The quantitative autoradiography technique is suitable for investigating the most poorly perfused and the most well perfused viable fractions of animal tumours which may limit the efficacy of different types of therapy. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Relative <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{along the}} {{epididymis}} {{of the rat}} and rabbit has been measured using the isotope fractionation technique of Sapirstein (1958). In the rabbit, by simultaneously measuring cardiac output by the thermodilution technique, <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was expressed in absolute units. In both species, portions of the caput and corpus regions were nourished by capillaries with high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> whereas the cauda had the lowest <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the epididymis. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> values =+-. E. M. recorded in fourteen rabbit epididymides were: mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> 23 =. =+-=. ml/ 100 g/min; high <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> regions were: segments 2 and 3, caput epididymidis (34 =. =+-=. and 34 =. =+-=. ml/ 100 g/min), and the corpus epididymidis (36 =. =+-=. ml/ 100 g/min). Cauda epididymidis <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was 19 =. =+-=. ml/ 100 g/min. There was no bilateral variation in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the testis or epi-didymis of rat or rabbit. Removal ofone testis or unilateral ligation of the efferent ducts caused a marked reduction of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the caput region of both rat and rabbit epididymides after 7 days compared with the control epi-didymis. The effect was less striking elsewhere in the epididymis. The region of rich capillary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in the corpus epididymidis in the rabbit coincides with {{the portion of the}} duct in which spermatozoa acquire the ability to fertilize...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> in {{the brain}} is {{regulated}} by neurons and astrocytes. Knowledge of how these cells control <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is crucial for understanding how neural computation is powered, for interpreting functional imaging scans of brains, and for developing treatments for neurological disorders. It is now recognized that neurotransmitter-mediated signalling has {{a key role in}} regulating cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> that much of this control is mediated by astrocytes, that oxygen modulates <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> regulation, and that <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> may be controlled by capillaries as well as by arterioles. These conceptual shifts in our understanding of cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> control have important implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} the cutaneous <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the three-dimensional morphology of the skin by measuring various aspects of <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during cooling, minimum <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during cooling, mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after cooling, and maximum <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after cooling) of the cheeks and foreheads of 40 healthy women (aged 60 - 77 years). We also analyzed the three-dimensional morphology of the skin surface (sWa, sWp, sWt, sWq) in replicas obtained from foreheads, cheeks, and other sites {{on the faces of}} those subjects. In addition, we measured the skin elasticity and water content of the stratum comeurn on the cheeks of those women. No correlation was observed between the parameters of the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the surface morphology of the forehead. On the cheek, however, significant negative correlations were observed between those parameters. Among the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> parameters, the resting <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and the mean <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during cooling showed particularly high correlations. Concerning the surface morphology parameters, high correlations were observed in parameters related to local changes uch as sWp and sWt. None of the cutaneous properties examined (including the skin elasticity and water content of the stratum corneum) correlated with the <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> or the surface morphology parameters of the cheek. Facial wrinkles are classified into linear grooves, which develop {{at the corner of the}} eye and on the forehead, and glyphic wrinkles, which develop as deep grooves in areas such as the cheek. These results suggest hat a reduction in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is one of the putative causes of local irregularities observed in the cheek, that is, the glyphic wrinkles, of elderly women...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{regarding the}} effect of nicotine and cigarette smoke on gastric <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is conflicting. The hydrogen gas clearance technique {{was used to measure}} the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke on basal gastric mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in anesthetized rats. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> was measured before, during, and after treatment with either intravenous nicotine (4 or 40 μg/kg/min) or inhaled cigarette smoke (nicotine or nicotine free). Neither intravenous nicotine nor cigarette smoke significantly altered gastric mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> On the other hand, hypotension produced by hemorrhage significantly decreased mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (P < 0. 05). Thus the technique used could detect a decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> These findings indicate that in the anesthetized rats, hypotension but not intravenous nicotine or cigarette smoke, in the doses given, reduce gastric mucosal <b>blood</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives and Methods] Impaired <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of {{the upper}} end of the gastric tube is one of the major causes of anastomotic leak {{following}} esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer. We applied an additional microvascular anastomosis procedure-the supercharging technique-to improve <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> We investigated <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> improvement in 15 patients who underwent the supercharging technique after total excision of the thoracic esophagus and gastric tube reconstruction through the posterior mediastinal route from August 2003 to March 2005. [ResultsTissue] <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was measured with laser Doppler flowmetry during surgery and was improved after microvascular anastomosis. Patency and <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of anastomosed arteries were evaluated with computed tomography and ultrasonography, respectively. Patency and stable <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> of anastomosed arteries were confirmed more than 1 month after surgery. Therefore, microvascular anastomosis improved the tissue <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{of the upper}} end of the gastric tube. Long-term <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> improvement was confirmed, which suggests that microvascular anastomosis contributes to reducing the risk of anastomotic leak...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> in six human {{melanoma}} xenograft lines grown s. c. in BALB/ c-nu/nu mice was {{studied and}} analyzed {{in relation to}} tumor growth characteristics. Two different methods were used to measure <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> i. e., uptake of HI'RI>and clearance of> 33 Xe. The percentage of the injected SI'KI>taken up per g of tumor tissue and the '"ø clearance rate were used as parameters for <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> The results achieved with these two methods were consistent. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> differed significantly among individual tumors of the same line, even for tumors of similar size. All lines showed a decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> with increasing tumor volume. This was due {{to an increase in}} necrotic fraction as well as a decrease in blood supply per viable tumor cell. <b>Blood</b> <b>flow</b> also differed significantly among the xenograft lines. All lines showed a lower <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> than the kidney, spleen, liver, and foot. The <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was generally lower in the xenograft lines than in the EMT...|$|R
