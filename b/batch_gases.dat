40|$|The {{response}} {{of a glass}} batch to heating {{is determined by the}} batch makeup and in turn determines the rate of melting. Batches formulated for a high-alumina nuclear waste to be vitrified in an all-electric melter were heated at a constant temperature-increase rate to determine changes in melting behavior in response to the selection of batch chemicals and silica grain-size as well as the addition of heat-generating reactants. The type of batch materials and the size of silica grains determine how much, if any, primary foam occurs during melting. Small quartz grains, 5 {micro}m in size, caused extensive foaming because their major portion dissolved at temperatures 800 C when <b>batch</b> <b>gases</b> no longer evolved. The exothermal reaction of nitrates with sucrose was ignited at a temperature as low as 160 C and caused a temporary jump in temperature of several hundred degrees. Secondary foam, the source of which is oxygen from redox reactions, occurred in all batches of a limited composition variation involving five oxides, B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, CaO, Li{sub 2 }O, MgO, and Na{sub 2 }O. The foam volume at the maximum volume-increase rate was a weak function of temperature and melt basicity. Neither the batch makeup nor the change in glass composition {{had a significant impact on}} the dissolution of silica grains. The impacts of primary foam generation on glass homogeneity and the rate of melting in large-scale continuous furnaces have yet to be established via mathematical modeling and melter experiments...|$|E

The further results, performed in the same experimental apparatus with an expanded uncertainty (k 2) of 30 lK for a single cell and 50 lK for the comparison of sample pairs, were obtained using the same model of cryogenic metal sealed cell for each sample, and by measuring different samples from the same <b>gas</b> <b>batch</b> of each isotope and from different <b>gas</b> <b>batches</b> showing a different content of isotopic and chemical impurities.

In case of coke and sulfate containing <b>batches,</b> sulfur dioxide <b>gas</b> release takes place in steps and at different temperature levels. SO 2 may evolve from the batch blanket (at about 900 Â°C), but also at higher temperatures from the fresh melt starting at about 1050 Â°C up to 1250 Â°C, some SO 2 release can take place up to 1350 Â°C and then for oxidized melts a strong evolution between 1420 and 1500 Â°C. The last stage of SO 2 evolution from the melt is generally accompanied with oxygen gas formation as well.

The sludge inoculum consists of digested sludge to which a certain amount of raw sludge (raw sludge is usually a mixture of 40 % sludge from the pre-sedimentation and 60 % sludge from the final sedimentation in WWTPs) has been added in order to ‘vitalize’ it, i.e. to obtain a basic sludge gas development. The addition of raw sludge is part of the original DIN 38414, part 8. When the suitability of the method for determining the biodegradability of surfactants was evaluated, this step was retained, as the basic sludge gas development enables any possible inhibitory effects caused by the test substance to be observed.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the relationship (if any) between in vivo CH 4 production obtained using climate controlled respiration chambers and in vitro CH 4 production using the gas production technique. The in vitro techniques are routinely used to evaluate the nutritional quality of feeds and feed ingredients as they have an advantage of being less expensive, less laborious and allow maintenance of more precise experimental conditions than in vivo studies. It is well known that gas in the gas production (GP) technique is produced after the fermentation of the substrate where CO 2 and methane (CH 4) are produced as direct gas, and indirect gas is produced from the buffering of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Studies investigating the relationship between in vitro and in vivo CH 4 production by cows fed the same feed as substrate used in in vitro incubations are rare in the literature. It is important to have an accurate prediction on CH 4 production of rations to be fed in practice. Therefore, the Dutch government financed a large program to determine the actual CH 4 emission from dairy cattle in vivo, using climate respiration chambers (CRCs). This offered the unique opportunity to conduct parallel in vitro experiments with the aim to derive accurate in vitro prediction equations for CH 4 production. Such equations can subsequently be used in practice to reduce CH 4 emission. In vivo CH 4 production of dairy cows cannot be predicted by in vitro CH 4 production using the automated <b>batch</b> culture <b>gas</b> production technique, even if the cows are adapted to the substrate under investigation, The main predictors of CH 4 production by dairy cattle are related to diet composition (NDF, CP and OM), In vitro CH 4 production varies based on whether donor cows are adapted to a respective ration or not although the differences observed in thesis were minor...|$|R

Further, currently identified biomass species such as Gliricidia, Ipil, Eucalyptus and etc are not the best as far as the annual yield is concerned. Learning from the nature, has been a key scenario in invention and development. IAS itself shows the characteristics which are suitable for dedicated energy crops those of high yield, low nutrition requirement and survival in mild environmental conditions. The two IASs; Guinea grass and Arundo donax, were analyzed to be used as energy feedstock. Their perennial nature along with high yield as high as 75 tons per hectare provide evidence their suitability as energy plants. Guinea grass was further tested in an updraft gasifier and the flame was not stable for a long time but only for 6 to 7 minutes. The performances were different from batch to <b>batch</b> where <b>gas</b> analysis showed that it was composed with around 11 % combustibles. In trial 2 sample, 50 % of nitrogen suggests that the presence of oxygen is low and hence, the unaccounted 18 % could be composed with tars which were not detectable by used column in GC analysis. Further, the heterogeneous nature of feedstock along with the uneven compaction caused uneven combustion throughout the cross section and height. Hence it was suggested again that the homogeneous nature of feed material is a crucial factor in gasification...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} fines content in fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) catalyst on bubble properties was investigated by considering two catalyst batches. One contained fewer fines and had a Sauter mean diameter of 83 μm while the other had a higher fines content with a 74 μm mean diameter. The hydrodynamics were analyzed in a two-dimensional fluidized bed with superficial gas velocities in the bubbling regime. Photos of the bed were analysed by isolating bubble images, after which colour images were converted to binary images by using MATLAB® software. These binary images {{were used to determine}} properties such as equivalent bubble diameter, gas fraction, circularity and bubble hold-up in the bed as function of superficial gas velocity and fines content. The results showed that bubble diameter increases with gas velocity for both catalyst batches. A smaller bubble size was observed at all except the highest superficial velocities for the catalyst batch with the higher fines content. However, the high fines content catalyst had a higher gas fraction than the low fines content <b>batch</b> at all <b>gas</b> velocities. This average value was the same regardless of gas velocity, while an increase in superficial velocity resulted in an increase in gas fraction for the lower fines content catalyst. The bubble hold-up for the catalyst batch with the lower fines content was also higher than that of the high fines content catalyst. For both batches an increase in bubble hold-up with velocity was observed. Similar circularity values for both catalyst types were calculated at all superficial velocities. [URL]...|$|R
