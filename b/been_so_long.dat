25|$|Also, {{the report}} of the Castilian chronicler Palencia shows that Ferdinand can't have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> on the camp, after the battle, since he wrote that Ferdinand left the {{battlefield}} at 9:00p.m. –at a time when the battle, according to the timing given by Pulgar, was still undecided (his departure {{before the end of the}} battle is also supported by the Portuguese chroniclers). Indeed, if Ferdinand had remained 3 or 4 hours on the battlefield after the end of the battle and departed at 9:00p.m., this would imply that the battle (which lasted several hours) had finished between 5:00p.m. and 6.00 p.m., –but all chroniclers of both sides agree that the battle began very late, at the sunset (7:00p.m.) of that day. The battle could not have ended before it began.|$|E
25|$|On 6 December Louis {{captured}} Hertford Castle {{from the}} followers of the new king Henry. Fitzwalter naturally asked for the custody of a stronghold that had already <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> under his care. The French urged that a traitor to his own lord {{was not to be}} trusted, and Louis told him he must wait {{until the end of the}} war. Fitzwalter was too deeply pledged to Louis to join the deserters. He was sent from London on 30 April 1217 at the head of a strong French force to raise the siege of Mountsorrel in Leicestershire, now closely pressed by the Earl of Chester. On his way he rested at St Albans, where his hungry troops ate up all the supplies of the abbey, according to abbey chronicler Matthew Paris. He raised the siege of Mountsorrel and advanced to Lincoln. He was met by the regent, William Marshall, whose forces were now joined by the Earl of Chester with the army that had besieged Mountsorrel. Fitzwalter was anxious for an immediate battle.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} {{have been critical}} of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence while others take the view that the struggle had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> and savage that it was perhaps inevitable.

2500|$|However, eminent {{historian}} Fernand Braudel (d. 1985), {{a leader}} of [...] the important Annales School [...] wrote: [...] "all historians have opposed this tenuous theory [...] , although they have not managed {{to be rid of}} it once and for all. Yet it is clearly false. The northern countries took over the place that earlier had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> and brilliantly been occupied by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or business management." [...] Social scientist Rodney Stark moreover comments that [...] "during their critical period of economic development, these northern centers of capitalism were Catholic, not Protestant — the Reformation still lay well into the future," [...] while British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper (d. 2003) said, [...] "The idea that large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown did {{not accept}} Freud's theory of an innate {{biological}} dynamic leading from undifferentiated sexuality to adult genitality, and suggested instead that the explanation of how mankind abandoned the [...] "primeval happiness" [...] of polymorphous perversity was to be found through an analysis of social history. Robinson comments that Brown in fact offered no such analysis, and instead produced an [...] "exclusively ontogentic explanation", one he finds inconsistent with [...] "the prophetic intentions" [...] of Brown's larger argument. Brown explained repressive differentiation in terms of Freud's revised theory of anxiety, according to which anxiety produces repression rather than the reverse. Brown, like Róheim, saw the basic form of anxiety as separation anxiety, and also identified separation with death, {{a breakdown of the}} union of mother and child that he saw as [...] "the essence of life." [...] Robinson finds the identification of life with union and death with separation neither easy to understand nor essential to Brown's argument, seeing his crucial point as being that anxiety can be identified with separation, and that separation causes anxiety because the union between mother and child had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> and lovingly indulged.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of her essay, Clark {{considers}} the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of [...] "the classics" [...] is important to society as a whole. Clark says that [...] "teachers of English have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: [...] "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" [...] Two of the answers Clark received were [...] "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" [...] and [...] "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states [...] "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite." [...] Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says [...] "the anatomical dissection", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.|$|E
