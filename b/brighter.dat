At magnitude4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second-brightest star {{and the only}} one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, the <b>brighter</b> component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third-brightest star is 21Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with planetary systems, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and the unique deep-sky object Hanny's Voorwerp.|$|E

40|$|We studied early NK-cell {{recovery}} in 29 allografted patients undergoing different lymphoreductive regimens. Already at 2 ?wk after graft take, {{the number of}} NK cells had reached (supra) normal levels but NK-cell subsets were skewed. The number of CD 56 (dim) CD 16 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells was low and correlated strongly {{with the level of}} hematopoiesis, whereas the number of the more abundant NK cells expressing high levels of CD 56 did not. Post-transplant CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells (ptCD 56 (<b>bright))</b> differed from CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> NK cells in normal controls (CD 56 (<b>bright))</b> in being HLA-DR- and perforin-positive, CCR 7 (-), CD 27 (-), CD 127 (-) and mostly c-kit(-). CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> from normal controls stimulated by IL- 15 in vitro (NK(IL- 15)) acquired all the characteristics distinguishing CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> from ptCD 56 (<b>bright).</b> IL- 2 exerted similar effects. Moreover, when cultured without cytokines, ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> and NK(IL- 15) responded similarly by upregulating CD 127 and c-kit but not CCR 7. IL- 12 stimulated IFN-? production in ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> whereas CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> responded only to IL- 12 plus IL- 15. Hence, ptCD 56 (<b>bright)</b> have all the features of cytokine-stimulated CD 56 (<b>bright).</b> Because only patients with low numbers of T cells had high numbers of ptCD 56 (<b>bright),</b> we conclude that ptCD 56 (<b>bright)</b> are activated CD 56 (<b>bright)</b> that expand while competing with T cells for the elevated post-transplant level of IL- 15...|$|R

5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the <b>brighter</b> area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the <b>brighter</b> artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times <b>brighter</b> than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times <b>brighter</b> than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars {{visible to the naked}} eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bright</b> (B-cell {{regulator}} of immunoglobulin {{heavy chain}} transcription) binding to immunoglobulin heavy chain loci after B-cell activation {{is associated with}} increased heavy chain transcription. Our earlier reports demonstrated that <b>Bright</b> coimmunoprecipitates with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and that these proteins associate in a DNA-binding complex in primary B cells. B cells from immunodeficient mice with a mutation in Btk failed to produce stable <b>Bright</b> DNA-binding complexes. In order to determine if Btk is important for <b>Bright</b> function, a transcription activation assay was established and analyzed using real-time PCR technology. Cells lacking both <b>Bright</b> and Btk were transfected with <b>Bright</b> and/or Btk along with an immunoglobulin heavy chain reporter construct. Immunoglobulin gene transcription was enhanced when <b>Bright</b> and Btk were coexpressed. In contrast, neither <b>Bright</b> nor Btk alone led to activation of heavy chain transcription. Furthermore, <b>Bright</b> function required both Btk kinase activity and sequences within the pleckstrin homology domain of Btk. <b>Bright</b> was not appreciably phosphorylated by Btk; however, a third tyrosine-phosphorylated protein coprecipitated with <b>Bright.</b> Thus, the ability of <b>Bright</b> to enhance immunoglobulin transcription critically requires functional Btk...|$|R

5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the <b>brighter</b> cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are <b>brighter,</b> persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
