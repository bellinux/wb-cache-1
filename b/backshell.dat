25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the <b>backshell.</b> These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the <b>backshell</b> and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E

25|$|Mars Pathfinder {{directly}} entered Mars {{atmosphere in}} a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that {{was derived from}} the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370m/s (830mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68m/s (about 160mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the <b>backshell</b> on a 20m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity. This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.|$|E

C-PICA has similar density to PICA, but shows half the thermal penetration and similar recession at the same conditions, allowing for a lighter weight TPS to be flown.

50|$|Radar {{altimeter}} unit: A {{radar altimeter}} unit {{was used to}} determine the distance to the Martian surface. The radar's antenna is mounted at one of the lower corners of the lander tetrahedron. When the radar measurement showed the lander was the correct distance above the surface, the Zylon bridle was cut, releasing the lander from the parachute and <b>backshell</b> so that it was free and clear for landing. The radar data also enabled the timing sequence on airbag inflation and <b>backshell</b> RAD rocket firing.|$|E
50|$|Zylon is an {{advanced}} fiber material, similar to Kevlar, that is sewn in a webbing pattern (like shoelace material) {{to make it}} stronger. The Zylon bridle provides space for airbag deployment, distance from the solid rocket motor exhaust stream, and increased stability. The bridle incorporates an electrical harness that allows the firing of the solid rockets from the <b>backshell</b> as well as provides data from the <b>backshell</b> inertial measurement unit (which measures rate and tilt of the spacecraft) to the flight computer in the rover.|$|E

50|$|Silicone-impregnated {{reusable}} ceramic ablator (SIRCA) {{was also}} developed at NASA Ames Research Center {{and was used}} on the <b>Backshell</b> Interface Plate (BIP) of the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) aeroshells. The BIP was at the attachment points between the aeroshell's <b>backshell</b> (also called the afterbody or aft cover) and the cruise ring (also called the cruise stage). SIRCA was also the primary TPS material for the unsuccessful Deep Space 2 (DS/2) Mars impactor probes with their 0.35 m base diameter aeroshells. SIRCA is a monolithic, insulating material that can provide thermal protection through ablation. It is the only TPS material that can be machined to custom shapes and then applied directly to the spacecraft. There is no post-processing, heat treating, or additional coatings required (unlike Space Shuttle tiles). Since SIRCA can be machined to precise shapes, it can be applied as tiles, leading edge sections, full nose caps, or {{in any number of}} custom shapes or sizes. , SIRCA had been demonstrated in <b>backshell</b> interface applications, but not yet as a forebody TPS material.|$|E

It {{is not clear}} whether the difference in air drag between the probe with the parachute deployed and the back shell of the heat shield is sufficient to guarantee a safe separation distance (see Section 5.4.4 of the Inquiry Report); ...|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} space {{available}} on the spacecraft for the parachute is so small that the parachute had to be pressure-packed. Before launch, a team tightly folded the 48 suspension lines, three bridle lines, and the parachute. The parachute team loaded the parachute in a special structure that then applied a heavy weight to the parachute package several times. Before placing the parachute into the <b>backshell,</b> the parachute was heat set to sterilize it.|$|E
50|$|When the {{spacecraft}} had slowed to 80 meters per second, one minute after parachute deployment, the lander {{separated from the}} <b>backshell</b> and began a powered descent while 1.3 kilometers aloft. The powered descent was expected to have lasted approximately one minute, bringing {{the spacecraft}} 12 meters above the surface. The engines were then shut off and the spacecraft would expectedly fall {{to the surface and}} land at 20:15:00 UTC near 76°S 195°W in Planum Australe.|$|E
5000|$|Zylon Bridles: After the {{parachute}} was deployed {{at an altitude}} of about 10 km above the surface, the heatshield was released using 6 separation nuts and push-off springs. The lander then separated from the <b>backshell</b> and [...] "rappelled" [...] down a metal tape on a centrifugal braking system built into one of the lander petals. The slow descent down the metal tape placed the lander in position at the end of another bridle (tether), made of a nearly 20 m (65 ft) long braided Zylon.|$|E
50|$|The aeroshell {{consists}} of two main components: the heat shield, or forebody, which {{is located at the}} front of the aeroshell, and the back shell, which is located at the back of the aeroshell. The heat shield of the aeroshell faces flow during a spacecraft's atmospheric penetration, allowing it to absorb the high aerodynamic heat caused from the entry. The <b>backshell</b> acts as a finalizer for the encapsulation of the payload. The <b>backshell</b> contains the parachute, electronics and batteries that control pyrotechnic devices, a Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit, Rocket Assisted Descent rockets, and the Transverse Impulse Rocket System. The parachute is located at the apex of the back shell and slows the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing. The pyrotechnic control system releases devices such as nuts, rockets, and the parachute mortor. The Inertial Measurement Unit reports the orientation of the back shell while it is swaying underneath the parachute. Rocket Assisted Descent rockets provide approximately one ton of force within 2 seconds, assisting in the descent of the spacecraft vehicle. The Transverse Impulse Rocket System provides horizontal force to the back shell which helps orient it to a more vertical position during the main Rocket Assisted Descent rocket burn.|$|E
