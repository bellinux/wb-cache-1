500|$|In {{terms of}} visuals, Tanner {{stated that the}} {{graphics}} are [...] "better than a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> of PS2 games" [...] {{and that it is}} the [...] "best-looking game on the PSP thus far." [...] Pereira said that it looks as good if not better than other handheld games available. Nelson said the graphics are [...] "the best you've ever seen on a handheld." [...] He also said that it makes the first two God of War games on the PlayStation 2 look dated. GameTrailers said [...] "you'll be treated to the very best visuals the PSP has to offer". Parkin described the set-pieces as [...] "incredible" [...] for a handheld platform, however, he stated they [...] "seem tired" [...] in comparison to the opening scenes of God of War III.|$|E
500|$|Brudvig {{praised the}} {{campaign}} for avoiding the [...] "repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots" [...] of past Halo titles. GameSpot's Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non-player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for The Guardian that Reachs story made previous entries feel [...] "amateurish"; Nguyen felt that whereas previous Halo titles had become mired in inconsistencies and Star Trek-like technobabble, Reach told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time: [...] "I almost forgot that Noble Four (Emile) even existed for a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> of the campaign, as I rarely saw him." [...] Wireds Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of Aliens, writing {{that most of the}} characters were unmemorable and one-dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as [...] "minor quibbles" [...] compared to the improvements. In contrast, GamesRadar's Charlie Baratt opined that Reachs campaign was better than ODSTs, but lacked the [...] "franchise-changing potential" [...] it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, [...] " [...] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the shootings of Castile and Alton Sterling, President Barack Obama did {{not comment on the}} {{specific}} incidents, but called on the U.S. to [...] "do better" [...] and said that controversial incidents arising from the police use of force were [...] "not isolated incidents" [...] but rather were [...] "symptomatic of a broader set of racial disparities that exist in our criminal justice system". Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about." [...] Obama telephoned Castile's mother to offer his condolences.|$|E
2500|$|Brown was {{introduced}} to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank. Parade, directed by Hal Prince, and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Musical Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, [...] "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I {{had to go to}} Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?' Billy said, 'Sure.'" [...] Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, [...] "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a <b>big</b> <b>chunk,</b> around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together." [...] Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while allying for bankruptcy protection.|$|E

You know the first Spaniards down there, under a leader named Pizarro, were a gang of robbers and cut- throats.

60|$|It was giddy work, but {{not nearly}} so giddy as a rather overnourished reader sitting in a warm room might imagine. Bert found it quite {{possible}} to look down and contemplate the wild sub-arctic landscape below, now devoid of any sign of habitation, a land of rocky cliffs and cascades and broad swirling desolate rivers, and of trees and thickets that grew more stunted and scrubby as the day wore on. Here and there on the hills were patches and pockets of snow. And over all this he worked, hacking away at the tough and slippery oiled silk and clinging stoutly to the netting. Presently they cleared and dropped a tangle of bent steel rods and wires from the frame, and a <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> of silk bladder. That was trying. The airship flew up at once as this loose hamper parted. It seemed almost {{as though they were}} dropping all Canada. The stuff spread out in the air and floated down and hit and twisted up in a nasty fashion on the lip of a gorge. Bert clung like a frozen monkey to his ropes and did not move a muscle for five minutes.|$|E
