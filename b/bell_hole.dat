40|$|The 1 st part of {{the thesis}} {{consists}} of three sections. Section 1 recalls the general knowledge about medieval construction, especially the problem of plans. Arculf’s plans of the Holy Sepulchre and {{the reconstruction of the}} future temple by Richard of St. Victor were considered in more detail. Section 2 is a review of medieval knowledge in mathematics and physics. Section 3 summarizes the theories on the stability of vaults developed from the 17 th to the 20 th century, by mathematicians and engineers, then by restorers and architectural historians. The   2 nd   part   is   devoted   to   the   study   of   the   church   of   Brion   (Maine­-et­-Loire),   which   is remarkable for the quality and diversity of its vaults: barrel vault on the choir, primitive rib vault on the transept, ribbed dome on the crossing, Angevin type rib vauts on the nave, and a complex ribbed vault, {{similar to those of the}} choir of St­-Serge in Angers, at the top of the bell tower. The main originality of the thesis lies in the geometrical and mechanical study of these vaults. The analysis of numerical models carried out by a photogrammetric method made it possible to identify the shape of the severies. It has been found, in particular, that those of rib vaults are cylindrical, and that the direction of the courses does not determine their geometry. Mechanical analysis uses the elasticity theory. It has shown the importance of several points: the function of the tranverse arches which support the barrel vault, the role of the mullion of a double window, the important constraints that appear around the <b>bell</b> <b>hole,</b> the Angevin vaults working as cupolas...|$|E
40|$|The microclimatic {{effect of}} bats {{roosting}} in bell holes (blind vertical cylindrical cavities in cave roofs) in Runaway Bay Caves, Jamaica, was measured {{and the potential}} impact of their metabolism on dissolution modelled. Rock temperature measurements showed that bell holes with bats get significantly hotter than those without bats during bat roosting periods (by an average of 1. 1 °C). The relationship is clearest for bell holes with more than about 300 g aggregate bat body mass and for bell holes that are moderately wide and deep, of W:D ratio between 0. 8 and 1. 6. Measurement of temperature decay after abandonment showed that rock temperature returns to normal each day during bat foraging periods. Metabolic activity from a typical population of 400 g bat (10 individuals) yields 41 g of CO 2, 417. 6 kJ of heat, and 35. 6 g of H 2 O in each 18 hour roost period, and could produce a water film of ~ 0. 44 mm, that is saturated with CO 2 at ~ 5 %. The resultant rock dissolution is estimated at ~ 0. 005 cm 3 CaCO 3 per day. The metabolic heat ensures that the focus of dissolution remains vertical regardless of geological controls. A typical <b>bell</b> <b>hole</b> 1 m deep may be formed in some 50, 000 years by this mechanism alone. Addition of other erosional mechanisms, such as direct bacterial bio-erosion, or the formation of exfoliative organo-rock complexes, would accelerate the rate of formation. The hypothesis is developed that bell holes are initiated and formed by bat-mediated condensation corrosion and are governed by geographic distribution of clustering bats and their roosting behaviour...|$|E
5000|$|The Blue Hole is dived {{almost every}} day by {{recreational}} divers. Local dive centres take divers who are qualified to dive to 30m to do the site known as El Bells or <b>Bells</b> to Blue <b>Hole.</b> The entry is further along from the Blue Hole at an entry called The Bells. At 26m {{at the bottom of}} the Bells is a mini arch that should not be confused with the arch in the Blue Hole itself. The dive is then a wall dive that finishes crossing the Blue Hole saddle at a depth of 7m. Recreational divers do not get to see the Blue Hole arch when doing the <b>Bells</b> to Blue <b>Hole</b> dive.|$|R
50|$|Early bass oboes were {{modeled after}} bassoons, with a boot joint and bocal (such as the Triebert's'instruments, which {{still had a}} bulb <b>bell)</b> and some <b>holes</b> drilled obliquely; later an {{enlarged}} English horn design was adopted. The concept of the bass oboe as an enlarged English horn survived, and the hautbois baryton, redesigned by François Lorée, was introduced in 1889.|$|R
50|$|After a {{semester}} at Lees-McRae College, Will {{took the money}} he earned washing dishes and selling grilled-cheese sandwiches at Grateful Dead concerts and moved out west. After a while working for Taco <b>Bell</b> in Jackson <b>Hole,</b> Wyoming, {{he spent the next}} five winters snowboarding while living out of a van in Big Sky, Montana. At one point, he spent 30 days living in a snow cave near Valdez, Alaska without showering, and snowboarding the Chugach Mountains, before ending up with frostbite.|$|R
60|$|Nether-Moynton church-tower was, {{as in many}} villages, {{without a}} turret, {{and the only way}} to the top was by going up to the singers' gallery, and thence {{ascending}} by a ladder to a square trap-door in the floor of the bell-loft, above which a permanent ladder was fixed, passing through the <b>bells</b> to a <b>hole</b> in the roof. When Lizzy and Stockdale reached the gallery and looked up, nothing but the trap-door and the five holes for the bell-ropes appeared. The ladder was gone.|$|R
50|$|The clapper or {{tongue is}} {{manufactured}} {{in a similar}} process as the bell. Special care is given to cast the clapper at the proper weight, as a clapper that is too light will not bring out the true tones of the bell and a heavy clapper might cause the <b>bell</b> to crack. <b>Holes</b> are drilled {{into the top of}} the bell and the clapper is attached {{to the inside of the}} bell either by a metal link or by a leather strap. Finally the bell is installed in the tower.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describe}} how {{the authors and}} the Modalysteam (IRCAM) has collaborated {{to develop and implement}} a realtime model of a complete bass-clarinet {{to be used in the}} first authors composition "Rippled Reeds " for bassclarinet and electronics, that explore the relation between an acoustic woodwind instrument and a similar virtual one. The intend was to create a model that allowed fingerings to be specified generating predictable output, in order to overcome a number of practical shortcomings when chaining complicated forked fingerings producing multiphonics. The model should run in realtime so that it could be driven from the actual acoustical playing. After a brief introduction, the first section will reflect about the choice of synthesis method and motivate its compositional use. Second section describes how a model was created from measurements of a true bass-clarinet complete with reed, mouthpiece, tube, <b>bell</b> and <b>holes,</b> sufficiently efficient to run in realtime on one Intel processor. Third section describe the interface and how it raised questions of preset interpolation and multithreading to obtain polyphony. The conclusion draw the contours of what was achieved and outlines possible further studies. 1...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a legend}} about a {{church on the}} island of Orust in the small village of Tegneby. The legend tells a story about a hidden church bell in the mysterious hole in the creek. “During a war long time ago, people were afraid that the King Gustav Vasa would take their church bell to use as {{material}} for cannons. So the people in Tegneby hid their beloved church <b>bell</b> in a <b>hole</b> in the creek below the church and there it remained for seven years”  (main legend) The aim of this paper was to find out if this legend still is alive in the area of Tegneby. Another aim was to understand what had caused the folk legend to appear and also if there were other places in the south west of Sweden that had corresponding legends.   There was a big difference in the knowledge of the legend between the informants that I intervjued according to age. The older informants knew about the story and also had heard more versions of the legend. The younger informants were not as enlightened about the legend of the sunken/hidden church bell. Were there similar legends in the south west of Sweden? Yes, there was as many as 397 of them, they were very much alike the main legend about Tegnebys sunken church bell. What could have caused this legend? The answer is this that there is no perfect right answer. What probably caused the legend to appear was confiscation of church bells that took place during the 15 - 1600 hundreds in Sweden and in Denmark. People got afraid that their church bell was going to be taken from them...|$|R
