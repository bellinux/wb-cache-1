40|$|The masonry {{building}} aggregates are a {{typology of}} construction typical of historical town centres, where a complex structural system with longitudinal and transversal walls is arranged at different ground and roof levels. Currently, the recuperation of the masonry as a structural solution will depend, in significant part, on {{its use in}} the construction of housing blocks, which can present many of the features of a typical <b>building</b> <b>aggregate.</b> The behaviour of this construction typology should be assessed under seismic loads, since it {{has been shown to be}} vulnerable to such type of loading. In this work, the case of a modern aggregate of masonry buildings, which is constituted by adjacent buildings at different levels, is studied under simulated seismic loading through nonlinear static (pushover) analysis on a macro-element model idealized for the aggregate. A developed concrete block masonry system is adopted as the structural solution. The aggregate is evaluated regarding its seismic performance by considering three different configurations: a set of dwellings with independent behaviour, a levelled conglomeration of buildings, and an unlevelled aggregate. A comparison between the predicted performances of solutions with unreinforced and truss type horizontally reinforced masonry is made in terms of both base shear-displacement response and damage pattern. The main conclusions are that the structural irregularity in elevation implies loss of displacement capacity, and that the horizontal truss reinforcement allows only qualitatively an improvement of the structural ductility, given a more distributed damage and a higher deformation capacity...|$|E
40|$|The Lucas Island model {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} papers in the early 1970 s (see Lucas 1972, 1973, 1975). These papers became influential for several reasons; they demonstrated the “natural ” rate hypothesis and the (long run) neutrality of money in a rigorous setting, they popularized rational expectations and they changed the style of macro economics by <b>building</b> <b>aggregate</b> models on a foundation of optimizing behaviour by individuals. What is not always remembered is that business cycles in the island model stems from individuals misperceptions about relative prices, an idea that was almost dead for 20 years from the early 80 s to the early 00 ’s. Recently, there has been a revival of the idea that the dynamics of business cycle fluctuations can be influenced by information imperfections, e. g. Mankiw and Reis (2002), Woodford (2002), Mackowiack and Wiederholt (2008) and Lorenzoni (2007). The models in Lucas’s papers differ somewhat in set ups and complexity, and here we will focus on perhaps the most accessible version, that of the 1973 AER paper. The basic idea is the following. Supply (and production) is determined by expected relative prices; when producers expect a high relative price of the good produced on their island, they produce more of it. However, supply decisions are made based on partial information. The nominal price of the good produced on each island is observed only on that island, and the aggregate price level is observed only with a lag. The problem facing the producers on each island i...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to validate various HMA aggregate specifications and volumetric relationships established by Superpave. Specifically, the study addresses the effects of voids in the mineral aggregate (VMA), fine aggregate angularity (FAA), and HMA mixture gradation on rutting performance of mixtures designed using the Superpave volumetric design procedure. ^ Mixture designs were conducted using a single neat PG 64 - 22 binder, two nominal maximum aggregate sizes (19 and 9. 5 mm), two coarse aggregate types (limestone and granite), three fine aggregate types possessing FAA values of 39, 44, and 50, and three gradation types (above, through, and below the restricted zone). The rutting performance of the mixtures were evaluated using the INDOT/Purdue Accelerated Pavement Test Facility (APT) and the Purdue Laboratory Wheel Track Test Device (PURWheel). In addition, triaxial testing was utilized to identify critical VMA. ^ Test results indicate that APT, PURWheel, and Triaxial test are sensitive to material property changes. The observed critical VMA was higher than the Superpave minimum VMA requirements. VMA could not be correlated with performance when VMA resulted from deficiencies in mixture production and/or placement. Film thickness was identified as a robust mixture property that correlated better with rutting performance than traditional volumetric properties. Fine aggregate angularity was found to correlate well with performance, but incorporating very high fine aggregate angularity did not necessarily provide better performance. Gradation influences APT, PURWheel, and triaxial test results. However, the restricted zone alone may not be adequate to characterize gradation to ensure acceptable performance. The asphalt binder content corresponding to optimum triaxial strength and PURWheel rutting performance ranged from 0. 0 to 0. 5 percent less than the Superpave design asphalt binder content for most mixtures. ^ Based on all test results and analyses, it is suggested that film thickness be included in mixture design procedures with an acceptable range of 7 to 9 microns. Despite the importance of VMA in describing the HMA structure, stringent VMA criteria are not suggested because many factors could impact VMA during the construction process, such as asphalt binder content and in-place density. These factors could deceive the essence of VMA as a durability or HMA structure parameter. The use of a typical value of FAA is suggested for acceptable rutting performance. The mixture design and performance data suggest that achieving 4. 0 percent air voids, the level at which the design asphalt binder content is selected in the Superpave mixture design process, when using high FAA (50) blends can lead to excess asphalt and thus poor rutting performance. Despite the importance of gradation in <b>building</b> <b>aggregate</b> structure, the selection of gradation with respect to the Superpave restricted zone as a requirement for performance is not suggested because equally adequate performance can be achieved with gradations plotting above, through, and below the restricted zone. Finally, a range of dust proportion of 0. 9 to 1. 7 is suggested for optimum rutting performance. ...|$|E
