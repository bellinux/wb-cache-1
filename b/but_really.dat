5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, <b>but</b> <b>really,</b> if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|Next Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, the Confederate leader, warning {{him that}} the Qurayza had {{defected}} to Muhammad. He stated that the tribe intended to ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> to hand over to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man as hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} in the discussions of presidential {{candidates}} that preceded the Whig National Convention for the 1840 race. He initially supported General Winfield Scott, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> wanted to defeat Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison campaign, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E

25|$|Well, {{the racism}} wasn't there, the {{homophobia}} wasn't there—as much.

He needed the energy of the audience to feed off.|$|E
25|$|When Davies {{left school}} {{he became an}} {{apprentice}} with AJS. He gained motorcycle building experience, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> wanted to go racing. AJS were fully occupied filling orders {{at the time and}} racing had no priority. Sunbeam had a good racing team, but had a no-staff-poaching agreement with AJS, so Davies moved to Clyno as a tester, and shortly thereafter moved to Sunbeam.|$|E

25|$|In the Hall-book, marked 1393/94, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> for 1394/95, Chicheley's name {{does not}} appear. He had then left Oxford and {{gone up to}} London to {{practise}} as an advocate in the principal ecclesiastical court, the Court of Arches. His rise was rapid. Already on 8 February 1395/96 he was, on a commission with several knights and clerks to hear an appeal {{in a case of}} John Molton, Esquire v. John Shawe, citizen of London, from Sir John Cheyne kt., sitting for the constable of England in a court of chivalry.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the details}} of his {{professional}} life are widely known, Eltinge's personal life is shrouded in mystery; mystery partly due to the passage of time, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> more likely to Eltinge's own hand. Eltinge was born in Newtonville, Massachusetts to Julia Edna Baker and Joseph Dalton. It is believed that his father was a mining engineer and that early in his life he traveled out west with his father, ending up in Butte, Montana. In his early teens, Eltinge dressed in women's clothing and performed in the rugged saloons patronized by ranchers and miners. Upon discovering this in 1899, his father beat him and his mother sent him back to Boston, where the 17-year-old worked in dry goods as a salesman while studying dance.|$|E
25|$|Shuttleworth {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket debut in 1964 {{when he was}} aged nineteen, tall, raw, but genuinely a fast bowler. He took fifty wickets in 1967, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> started to burst through in 1968, when Brian Statham was fading from the scene. His best season was in 1970, when he took seventy-four wickets at 21.60 runs each, and played for England against The Rest of the World, at Lord's. He went to Australia with Ray Illingworth's Ashes-winning team and started his Test career with five for 47 at Brisbane. He played five times in all for England - four of them that winter in Australia and New Zealand, the other against Pakistan in 1971 - and took twelve wickets at 35.58 each.|$|E

25|$|In February 1648 Colonel John Poyer, the Parliamentary Governor of Pembroke Castle, {{refused to}} hand over his command to one of Fairfax's officers, and he was soon joined by some {{hundreds}} of officers and men, who mutinied, ostensibly for arrears of pay, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> with political objectives. Furthermore, many of the royalist survivors had ganged up and wanted the monarchy back in power and control. Rebels from all over Ireland, England and Scotland had joined in with this act. At the end of March, encouraged by minor successes, Poyer openly declared for the King. Disbanded soldiers continued {{to join him in}} April, all South Wales revolted, and eventually he was joined by Major-General Rowland Laugharne, his district commander, and Colonel Rice Powell. In April also news came that the Scots were arming and that Berwick and Carlisle had been seized by the English Royalists.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, <b>but</b> <b>really</b> I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
25|$|He {{tells them}} {{that a few}} weeks after their shenanigans Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to {{communicate}} with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that the Wolfpack could locate him and retrieve the gold. Marshall kidnaps Doug and gives the others three days to find Chow, or else Doug will be killed. Alan sets up a meeting with Chow in Tijuana, Mexico, where Stu and Phil will hide and attempt to drug him. However, Alan seemingly, accidentally (<b>but</b> <b>really</b> on purpose) reveals their location and Chow forces them to confess that they are working for Marshall. Chow explains his plan to retrieve the stolen gold from the basement of a Mexican villa he previously owned. Stu, Alan and Phil break into the house and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them by locking them in the basement, rearming the security system and escaping in Phil's minivan. They are arrested but mysteriously released from the police station. They are picked up by a limousine and taken back to the villa, where they meet up with Marshall.|$|E

Perry remarked that the song [...] "wasn't right", and the track was excluded from the album. The session was unproductive, {{due in part to}} Stefani's self-consciousness and writer's block, and she at one stage broke down in tears in the studio. Stefani has since admitted that writing songs without her band members felt [...] "humiliating and intimidating even if they're sweet and excited, because you're drowning in their creativity".|$|E
