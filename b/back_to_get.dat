5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E

Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E

The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

25|$|While {{there were}} no {{external}} witnesses of the capsizing of Finn-Baltic, it was noticed by several people on the shore shortly afterwards and the rescue operation began within minutes of the accident even though the ship had not sent a distress signal. Around 12:30 the harbour bailiff of the Port of Hanko saw something odd amid the waves while standing at {{the window of his}} office. At first he thought it was just a barge being towed by a tug, but after spotting first the red bottom of the vessel and then its propeller and rudder, he realized that a ship had capsized in the storm and immediately contacted the captain of the rescue vessel Russarö, who alerted the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) of Hanko at 12:40. At the same time a harbour worker standing on one of the easternmost quays saw something that resembled a new island {{in the middle of the}} storm. At first he, too, thought that it was just a towing, but was bothered by several strange details in the barge, such as the bow thruster, and decided to go get binoculars. When he came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a better view, he saw Russarö heading out. Finn-Baltic was also photographed only minutes before the combination capsized by a harbour worker, who remembered hearing a rumbling sound, like a freight train, shortly after taking the picture of the ship.|$|E
25|$|On the pitch, things {{continued}} fairly brightly for the team, which {{finished the}} month atop both the Eastern Conference and overall MLS standings based on most points per game. Despite squandering second-half leads {{at home against}} both the New York Red Bulls and the Houston Dynamo, United did not lose in April. Against New York, DC, took a 2–0 lead {{on a pair of}} goals by Perry Kitchen. The Red Bulls came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a point, culminating the comeback as Lloyd Sam knocked in a rebound when Hamid could not control a Sacha Kljestan free kick. In the next match, against the Dynamo, United's Chris Rolfe scored on a free kick from almost the same spot that the Red Bulls took their game-tying free-kick in the previous match. Once again, though, the defense failed to prevent a late goal on a tap-in following a rebound allowed by the DC goalie, This time it was Andrew Dykstra who was in the net, unable to prevent the tying goal. After the successive disappointing home draws, DC United finished the month with a surprising win in Vancouver, a first ever for the franchise. The Whitecaps opened the scoring in that match with a goal on their first foray forward, but DC responded with a goal by Bobby Boswell to knot the score. Just before halftime, Fabian Espindola, drew a foul along with a second yellow card for Whitecaps player, Matias Laba. Espindola was making his MLS season debut after serving a 6-game suspension. Playing with a man-advantage, United took the lead in the second half on a goal by Chris Rolfe. Defending the lead was made more challenging when goalie Andrew Dykstra injured his ankle and had to be subbed off. Dykstra was playing because Bill Hamid was back in Washington, missing his second straight match, nursing a thigh injury. Rookie Travis Worra came on to make his MLS debut, manning the goal as United held on for a 2–1 win.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} season Shero led the Flyers to a 50–16–12 record, {{first place}} in the Western Division. The 112 point total also placed the Flyers just one point behind the Boston Bruins for first overall in the NHL. It also marked the first time in franchise history that the Flyers posted a winning percentage over 0.700. The division title and high winning percentage accompanied by a 27-point increase from the previous season led to Shero winning the inaugural Jack Adams Award for coach of the year. In the 1974 playoffs the Flyers' first round match-up was against the Atlanta Flames. Following a game three win in which the Flyers went up 3-0, Shero was involved in an infamous incident. Known for taking late night walks and stopping at local bars and pubs for a drink, Shero decided to go for one of those walks following the game three victory. Though {{no one knows for sure}} what happened, Shero was allegedly mugged. Shero didn't divulge any information about what really happened but police responded to a disturbance call at 2 a.m. outside the Flyers hotel. Shero was found with a broken thumb and cuts and bruises to his face. Flyers' management sent him home to recuperate and assistant coach Nykoluk coached the team in the series winning game. In the Semi-final round the Flyers were considered underdogs to the New York Rangers. However, the Flyers had home ice advantage. In the seven game series the home team won every game, giving the Flyers a 4-3 series win. It marked the first time an expansion team defeated an Original Six team in a playoff series. The Flyers advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they played the Boston Bruins. Prior to game one Shero devised an unconventional game plan. The Flyers were to dump the puck to Bobby Orr's side of the rink. Orr was considered to be one of the league's best players, and the plan was to make him skate hard <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the puck. In addition the team was to be physically hard on him. Any player who had the opportunity was to check, bump or put a stick on Orr, in an attempt to wear him down. Bobby Clarke later recalled that the strategy did work although it did take some time. Clarke stated that Orr was the best player on the ice in game five, but in game six Orr wasn't the factor he had been in other games. Going into game six, the Flyers had a chance to win the Stanley Cup. Prior to the game Shero wrote his famous quote [...] "Win today, and we walk together forever" [...] on the dressing room blackboard for inspiration to the players. The quote is still used today. The Flyers went on to win game six and the series, thus becoming the first expansion team to win the Stanley Cup. Following the series Flyers' goaltender Bernie Parent was named Conn Smythe as playoff MVP. During the official presentation Parent was given a new car, which he promptly gave to Shero.|$|E
