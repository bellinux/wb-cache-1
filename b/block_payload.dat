40|$|Abstract – The Steganography is {{used for}} secure {{communication}} of information by embedding information in a cover object. In this paper we propose Wavelet based Secure Steganography with Scrambled Payload (WSSSP). The Daubechies Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT) is applied on cover image. The XD band is decomposed into upper and lower bands for payload embedding. The payload is segmented into four equal blocks. The Harr LWT is applied on alternate <b>blocks</b> of <b>payload</b> to generate F 1 and F 2 wavelet transform bands. The remaining <b>blocks</b> of <b>payload</b> are retained in spatial domain say S 1 and S 2. The bit reversal is applied on each coefficient of <b>payload</b> <b>blocks</b> to scramble <b>payload.</b> The cube root is applied on scrambled values to scale down the number of coefficient bits. The payload the embedded into XD band of cover image to generate step object. The decision Factor Based Manipulation (DFBM) is used to scrambled stego object. The Daubechies ILWT 2 is applied on stego object to obtain stego image in spatial domain. It is observed that PSNR and capacity of the proposed algorithm is better compared to existing algorithm...|$|R

50|$|This encoder {{implementation}} sends three sub-blocks of bits. The first sub-block is the m-bit <b>block</b> of <b>payload</b> data. The second sub-block is n/2 parity bits for the payload data, computed using a recursive systematic {{convolutional code}} (RSC code). The third sub-block is n/2 parity bits for a known permutation of the payload data, again computed using an RSC code. Thus, two redundant but different sub-blocks of parity bits are sent with the <b>payload.</b> The complete <b>block</b> has m + n bits of data with a code rate of m/(m + n). The permutation of the payload data {{is carried out}} by a device called an interleaver.|$|R

50|$|While {{security}} software {{is designed to}} detect such threats, it might not detect CryptoLocker at all, or only after encryption is underway or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would limit its damage to data. Experts suggested precautionary measures, such as using software or other security policies to <b>block</b> the CryptoLocker <b>payload</b> from launching.|$|R

Due to a database error affecting the {{attitude control system}} of the Centaur upper stage of its carrier rocket, it was placed into a lower orbit than had been planned, and damaged by deployment at excessive rates. It could not be raised into its operational orbit due to fuel limitations. Its orbit was raised {{as much as possible}} to increase the expected lifetime and then it was permanently turned off after 10 days. It was the third consecutive, and last, failure of a Titan IV rocket. The remaining three satellites (DFS-4, -5, and -6) were launched on 27 February 2001, 15 January 2002, and 8 April 2003.|$|R

40|$|Deploying {{low power}} eNodeBs inside macro-cells is an {{effective}} way to enhance indoor coverage. By reusing frequency between macro-cells and indoor femto-cells, the efficiency of expensive licensed spectrum can be further increased. This thesis measured Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) performance in such a heterogeneous LTE-TDD network. Four USRP software radio terminals and connected Linux workstations were deployed to build a test environment. They acted as eNodeB and UE respectively. During the test, the femto-cell was configured to coordinate its radio frame with the macro-cell. Several criteria including received <b>block</b> error rate, <b>payload</b> bit error rate and symbols signal to interference and noise ratio were used to evaluate the PDCCH performance in macro-cell under heterogeneous environment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} high {{capacity}} reversible image watermarking {{scheme based on}} integer-to-integer wavelet transforms. The proposed scheme divides an input image into non-overlapping blocks and embeds a watermark into the highfrequency wavelet coefficients of each block. The conditions to avoid both underflow and overflow in the spatial domain are derived for an arbitrary wavelet and <b>block</b> size. The <b>payload</b> to be embedded includes not only messages but also side information used to reconstruct the exact original image. To minimize the mean-squared distortion between the original and the watermarked images given a payload, the watermark is adaptively embedded into the image. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed scheme achieves higher embedding capacity while maintaining distortion at a lower level than the existing reversible watermarking schemes.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{analysis was}} made to investigate the relationship between current cargo airplanes and possible future designs that may differ greatly in both size and configuration. The method makes use of empirical scaling laws developed from statistical studies of data from current and advanced airplanes and, in addition, accounts for payload density, effects of span distributed load, and variations in tail area ratio. The method {{is believed to be}} particularly useful for exploratory studies of design and technology options for large airplanes. The analysis predicts somewhat more favorable variations of the ratios of payload to gross weight and <b>block</b> fuel to <b>payload</b> as the airplane size is increased than has been generally understood from interpretations of the cube-square law. In terms of these same ratios, large all wing (spanloader) designs show an advantage over wing-fuselage designs...|$|R
40|$|Steganography {{is used in}} covert {{communication}} {{for transportation}} of secrete information. In this paper we propose LWT based Encrypted Payload Steganography (LEPS). The payload is segmented into two parts say block 1 and block 2. The LWT is applied on block 2 to generate four sub bands. <b>Payload</b> <b>block</b> 1 is retained in the spatial domain itself. The values of approximation band coefficients of block 2 and spatial domain intensity values of block 1 are compressed. The LWT is applied on cover image to generate wavelet sub bands and considered only diagonal sub bands (XD). The XD band is decomposed into three parts. The key values are embedded into first part of XD band. The compressed payload is embedded in second and third blocks of XD adaptively. The payload can be retrieved at the destination by adapting reverse process of embedding. It is observed that the values of PSNR and capacity are better {{in the case of}} proposed algorithm compared to existing algorithm...|$|R

In 2012, it was {{determined}} that if the dual-engined Pyrios booster was selected for the SLS <b>Block</b> II, the <b>payload</b> could be 150 metric tons (t) to Low Earth Orbit, 20 t more than the congressional minimum requirement of 130 t to LEO for SLS Block II. In 2013, it was reported that in comparison to the F-1 engine, the F-1B engine was to have improved efficiency, be more cost effective and have fewer engine parts. Each F-1B was to produce 1800000 lbf MN of thrust at sea level, an increase over the 1550000 lbf MN of thrust of the initial F-1 engine.|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{accurate}} flight vehicle unsteady aerodynamics {{is critical}} for component and secondary structure vibroacoustic design. The Aerosciences Branch at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space Flight Center has conducted a test at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Unitary Plan Wind Tunnels (UPWT) to determine such ascent aeroacoustic environments for the Space Launch System (SLS). Surface static pressure measurements were also collected to aid in determination of local environments for venting, CFD substantiation, and calibration of the flush air data system located on the launch abort system. Additionally, this test supported a NASA Engineering and Safety Center study of alternate booster nose caps. Testing occurred during two test campaigns: August - September 2013 and December 2013 - January 2014. Four primary model configurations were tested for ascent aeroacoustic environment definition. The SLS Block 1 vehicle was represented by a 2. 5 % full stack model and a 4 % truncated model. Preliminary <b>Block</b> 1 B <b>payload</b> and manned configurations were also tested, using 2. 5 % full stack and 4 % truncated models respectively. This test utilized the 11 x 11 foot transonic and 9 x 7 foot supersonic tunnel sections at the ARC UPWT to collect data from Mach 0. 7 through 2. 5 at various total angles of attack. SLS Block 1 design environments were developed primarily using these data. SLS Block 1 B preliminary environments have also been prepared using these data.
