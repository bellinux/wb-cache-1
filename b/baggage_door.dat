25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the accident had been caused by the <b>baggage</b> <b>door</b> becoming lodged {{on the leading edge}} of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in overstressing of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis-rigged state of the door operating mechanism, which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the door warning indicators to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.|$|E

There are only two other ways {{to get out of}} here: through the <b>baggage</b> <b>door</b> and by the servants' {{entrance}} at the rear, which lets into an alley. The head porter will know whether Alora went out the <b>baggage</b> <b>door,</b> but as it's usually very high--on a level with the platform of a baggage-wagon--I don't believe she jumped it. That leaves the servants' entrance as the probable exit for our missing one, and as she was a perfect stranger to the arrangements of this hotel, she couldn't have gone that way unless someone guided her. So our course is clear, Mary Louise. Find out who enticed Alora from the hotel and it won't be difficult to trace her and discover what has become of her." ...|$|E

50|$|Introduced for {{the model}} year 1969, the larger, more {{powerful}} Baron 58 was developed from the Baron 55, introducing club seating, double aft <b>baggage</b> <b>doors,</b> and new gross weight of 5,400 lbs. Depending on the variant, the Baron 58 is fitted with either the Continental IO-520 or IO-550 300-hp engine. The Baron 58 can cruise at 200 knots (370 km/h) at 7000 ft (2100 m). The lengthening of the fuselage increased rear baggage space, {{as well as providing}} more comfortable six-place seating over the Baron 55 and 56TC.|$|R
5000|$|AE&C #1 {{probably}} was an express car wrecked in December, 1903, {{just four months}} after service started. In 1913 the AE&C had 5 express motors and one trailer. American(#5), Jewett(#7), Niles(#9), Brill(#11), and McGuire-Cumming(#15) each built one, McGuire-Cummings also built the trailer(#67). The first #5 was wrecked and replaced by a Cincinnati car using the same number. All were similar, with 4 GE66 [...] motors. All had control cabs on both ends and two <b>baggage</b> <b>doors</b> on each side, but had different bodies. Until locomotive 2001 arrived in 1921 most freight traffic was handled with express cars.

50|$|One {{such was}} a single {{locomotive}} built for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, delivered in August 1940, numbered #7100. MP 7100 was built for service with the Delta Eagle passenger train, which ran between Memphis, Tennessee and Tallulah, Louisiana. Note: Missouri Pacific ordered all their 'E' units with portals instead of square windows {{like most of the}} E series from the EA to E7's. This was the only MoPac unit with square windows (on the <b>baggage</b> <b>door).</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1970, design {{improvements}} {{came with}} the updated versions, PD-4108 (35 ft) and PD-4905 (40 ft) both with a 24-volt electrical system. The driver's controls were updated for both. The biggest complaint about the 4905 and 4903, from the drivers’ point of view, was that the extra 5 ft of length was all between {{the front and rear}} axles. It was very easy to scrape the <b>baggage</b> compartment <b>doors</b> on tight turns. The 4905s looked just like 4108s but with three baggage compartments. Some 4905s had a tag axle, with a single extra wheel on each side, located in the third baggage compartment, but it was forward of the drive axle, so turning radius was not affected.|$|R
5000|$|On December 22, 1984, a Cessna 402B {{operated}} by Falcon Air, N8064Q, was destroyed while returning to land after a cargo door had opened during takeoff. The pilot was killed, no passengers were aboard. The NTSB listed {{the cause of}} the accident as pilot error including inadequate pre-flight planning, failure to maintain airspeed, pilot attentiveness, and inability to recognize and avoid stall. [...] Contributing factors included high wind shear conditions and the <b>baggage</b> <b>door</b> opening upon takeoff.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Panther began in 1997 with {{construction}} of the prototype starting in Jun 1998, this prototype registered N202KT first flew on 29 March 2003. The Panther is a high-wing cantilever monoplane with an all-metal wing and a steel-tube fuselage covered with aluminum sheet. The prototype {{is powered by a}} [...] Continental IO-550-L engine driving a three-bladed constant-speed tractor propeller. The Panther has a tricycle landing gear and an enclosed cabin for a pilot and three passengers, side-by-side in two rows, access by split doors {{on each side of the}} fuselage and a small <b>baggage</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

40|$|Given {{here are}} {{evaluations}} of six different European aircraft {{from the point}} of view of a passenger. The aircraft discussed are the DH 34, the Handley-Page W 8 B, the Farman Goliath, the Potez IX, the Spad 33 (Berline), and the Fokker F. III. The airplanes were evaluated with regard to seating comfort, ventilation, noise, seating arrangements, cabin <b>doors,</b> <b>baggage</b> accommodation, interior arrangement of cabins, pilot's position and communication with the pilot, pilot accommodations, view from the cabin, safety, and lavatory accommodations...|$|R
50|$|On July 12, 1993, {{when the}} airline was still known as Air Nevada, a Cessna 402C with {{registration}} N818AN crashed after takeoff from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. The flight was {{destined for the}} Grand Canyon, but after liftoff the pilot advised the air traffic controller that the <b>baggage</b> <b>door</b> was open and requested {{to return to the}} airport for landing. The pilot and both passengers on board were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of the accident to be the pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering in the traffic pattern, with the pilot's failure to assure that the nose baggage compartment door was secured as an additional factor.|$|E
5000|$|Designed as {{a larger}} four-seat {{version of the}} Rebel, the Super Rebel is an {{all-metal}} high-wing braced monoplane with two rows of side-by-side seats for four. The prototype first flew in November 1995 and was powered by a [...] Lycoming O-540-4A5 driving a two-bladed constant-speed propeller. The prototype had a tricycle landing gear but the standard model (SR2500TD) has a tailwheel landing gear. The rear bench seat can be removed to hold luggage and the Super Rebel has a separate <b>baggage</b> <b>door</b> {{on the port side}} behind the passenger door. The aircraft is designed for any engine between 134 and 186 kW (180 to 250 hp) and also has larger fuel tanks as an option (increasing range to 1350 km (839 miles).|$|E
50|$|When {{the route}} opened on January 12, 1952 for {{passenger}} service, the locomotives would haul several yellow vintage closed-vestibule wooden passenger coaches {{led by a}} No. 103 parlor car Chama which was converted at Knott's in 1954 to combination baggage/coach Calico with arrows simulating an Indian attack embedded near the <b>baggage</b> <b>door.</b> Now the arrows are removed and the cars have been painted in heritage period Pullman-green livery of D&RGW. A gondola (converted from a flat car for open-air passenger seating), and a stock car which was converted from a gondola and now fitted with side benches and a wheelchair lift complete the consist filled with delighted guests on round trip excursions. At one time the only caboose at the railroad Rio Grande Southern 0402 was used but {{has been out of}} service lately.|$|E
50|$|Pierce smuggles Agar {{into the}} baggage car {{disguised}} as a corpse in a coffin. Pierce plans to reach the car across the coach roofs while the train is under way, but he and Miriam encounter Fowler, who is riding the train to Folkestone to watch over the shipment. After arranging for Miriam to travel in the same compartment as Fowler to divert his attention, Pierce crosses {{the roof of the}} train and unlocks the <b>baggage</b> van's <b>door</b> from the outside. He and Agar replace the gold with lead bars and toss the bags of gold off the train at a prearranged point. However, soot from the engine's smoke has stained Pierce's clothes and he is forced to borrow Agar's suit, which is much too small for him. The jacket splits across the back when he disembarks at Folkstone. The police quickly become suspicious and arrest him before he can re-join his accomplices.|$|R
60|$|Finally {{everything}} was settled {{to the satisfaction}} of the two male parties to the bargain,--although the old lady thought of a hundred things she would yet like to do,--and one fine frosty afternoon a cart-load of furniture and <b>baggage</b> left the <b>door,</b> the old lady and her son took leave of the old place, and Mr. Tolman was left sitting behind the little counter, the sole manager and proprietor of a circulating library and a stationery and notion shop. He laughed when he thought of it, but he rubbed his hands and felt very well satisfied.|$|R
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external <b>baggage</b> access <b>door</b> mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|R
