25|$|Although lead is {{the least}} {{expensive}} dense (SG=11.34) material available, it is a toxic substance causing <b>biological</b> <b>damage</b> to wildlife and humans. The Centers for Disease Control has stated that no safe level of lead exposure in children has been determined, and that once lead has been absorbed into the body, its effects cannot be corrected. Even a very small amount of exposure causes a permanent reduction in intelligence, ability to focus attention, and academic ability. Lead can be inhaled or ingested as either a metal powder or powdered corrosion products, however most lead salts have very low solubility in water, and pure lead corrodes very slowly in seawater. Absorption through skin is not likely for metallic lead and inorganic corrosion products.|$|E

30|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} are molecular-scale one-dimensional manufactured materials which display several potential {{applications in}} engineering and materials science. Burgeoning evidence demonstrates that carbon nanotubes and asbestos share comparable physical properties. Therefore carbon nanotubes might display toxic effects {{and the extent}} of the toxicity is more specifically directed to lung and pleura. These effects are related to properties of carbon nanotubes, such as their structure, length, aspects ratio, surface area, degree of aggregation, extent of oxidation, bound functional group, method of manufacturing, concentration and dose. At the present there is no global agreement about the risk of carbon nanotubes on human health and in particular on their transformation capacity. Safety concerns regarding carbon nanotubes can be ameliorated. In this context, it is important to put the known hazards of carbon nanotubes into perspective. Here is presented an overview about toxicity issues in the application of carbon nanotubes to biological systems, taking into consideration the already known asbestos-induced mechanisms of <b>biological</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|R

The determination and quantification of PAHs in sediment samples were performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with the aid of deuterated PAH internal standards and surrogate standards. The total concentrations of the 16 PAHs varied from 4, 425 to 51, 261 ng/g dw, with a mean concentration of 13, 196 ng/g dw. The PAHs concentration is relatively high in the river mouth region, and gradually diminishes toward the harbor region.
