For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent {{to live with their}} father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.|$|E

25|$|Strafing Luftwaffe airbases became commonplace as 1944 wore on, until {{nowhere in}} Europe could the Jagdwaffe remain outside of Allied range. If the fuel crisis was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> the {{casualties}} {{suffered by the}} now largely defunct Kampfgruppen were starting to become serious. Most bomber units were now ferrying and transporting personnel across Germany. In April/May 1944 the Luftwaffe lost 67 aircraft of this type, as far east as Dresden.|$|E
25|$|Catcher Dioner Navarro {{injured his}} left leg on March 20 during {{a game against the}} Minnesota Twins, after Twins outfielder Jacque Jones {{collided}} with him at the plate. Navarro was reported to be in serious pain and had to be carted off the field. Later that day it was announced that Navarro suffered a bruised nerve. The Rays said that the injury was not <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> that it would cause Navarro to miss opening day.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's {{car into the}} inside wall. Hamlin's car then slid right back {{up in front of}} the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.|$|E

25|$|Possible causes {{supported}} by strong evidence appear {{to describe a}} sequence of catastrophes, each worse than the last: the Siberian Traps eruptions were <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> alone, but because they occurred near coal beds and the continental shelf, they also triggered very large releases {{of carbon dioxide and}} methane. The resultant global warming may have caused perhaps the most severe anoxic event in the oceans' history: according to this theory, the oceans became so anoxic, anaerobic sulfur-reducing organisms dominated the chemistry of the oceans and caused massive emissions of toxic hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
25|$|W+K {{contracted}} {{production company}} Gorgeous Enterprises to handle {{production of the}} four television spots. Direction would be split between Frank Budgen (Tag, Racing, and Shaderunner) and Tom Carty (Tailgating). Budgen, known for his previous work on spots such as Bet on Black for Guinness and Hero's Return for Stella Artois, immediately began assembling a crew and scouting potential locations for the shoot. When the team arrived at the final location, several blocked-off streets of the Canadian city of Toronto, the weather was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> to force the team to rewrite the script in order to finish on schedule.|$|E
25|$|Newland toured England in 1905 as {{a reserve}} wicket-keeper and {{understudy}} to Jim Kelly. While in the United Kingdom {{he played in}} 10 first-class matches with the Australian team, but could only score 67 runs at 9.57 and effect 13 dismissals. His disappointing performances may have been {{as a result of}} an eye injury he received during the trip over, which was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> that he had to see an oculist in London. He had earlier, in 1904/05, toured New Zealand and played two matches against the national team. At that stage, New Zealand weren't a Test playing country so the matches had only first-class status.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, the bus lines (some {{of which}} still trace former horse-drawn buggy paths) were shifted to a {{partially}} publicly funded operation {{overseen by the}} Metropolitan Council. All regional transportation for the metropolitan area was soon overseen by the Met Council's transit agency which would take on the name Metro Transit. Twenty years after rails disappeared from Twin Cities streets, politicians and planners began proposing new light rail systems. Congestion was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> in 1972 that there were proposals to build new subways or people movers, but excessively high costs prevented any of the projects from getting anywhere {{until the end of}} the century. The University of Minnesota did a fair amount of research on personal rapid transit (PRT) systems and has held a number of patents on the idea.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the P-51 Mustang had escorted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers from {{bases in}} England and Southern Italy to targets {{throughout}} Nazi-occupied Europe. However, the Cold War brought {{on the challenge}} of possible B-29, Boeing B-50 or Convair B-36 bomber missions into the Soviet Union. The sheer size of the Soviet Union dictated that a bombing mission would be a 12-hour affair there and back from bases in Europe or Alaska, most of it over Soviet territory. Also the weather, which was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> in Western Europe, would make bombing missions impossible over the Soviet Union between October and May. With no long-range jet fighters yet available to perform escort missions for the strategic bomber force, {{the mission of the}} 27th FEW was to fly these long-range missions with their F-82Es.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Dr Alfred Steinschneider, two decades and tens of {{millions}} of research dollars were lost trying to find the elusive link between infant sleep apnea, which Steinschneider said he had observed and recorded in his laboratory, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), of which he stated it was a precursor. The cover was blown in 1994, 22 years after Steinschneider's 1972 Pediatrics paper claiming such an association, when Waneta Hoyt, the mother of the patients in the paper, was arrested, indicted and convicted on 5 counts of second-degree murder for the smothering deaths of her five children. While that in itself was <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> the paper, presumably written as an attempt to save infants' lives, ironically was ultimately used as a defense by parents suspected in multiple deaths of their own children in cases of Münchausen syndrome by proxy. The 1972 Pediatrics paper was cited in 404 papers in the interim and is still listed on Pubmed without comment.|$|E

25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of the Japanese forces was greatly weakened, as their naval supply lines had been cut and they had lost most of their existing supplies at Driniumor River. While the usual size of a Japanese Army division in wartime was 20,000 troops, {{at the start of}} May, 1945, this had been reduced to only around 1000. Takenaga's unit was no exception: while it was a battalion in name, in terms of numbers it was on the scale of a platoon, and at that one with only around half the usual number of infantry. The rest of the unit was made up of former mountain artillery from the 41st Division, whose squads were disbanded when all of their guns were destroyed at Driniumor River, and marines, among others. Takenaga himself was an artillery specialist, and had been moved to the 239th Infantry Regiment from his post as commander of the 3rd Battalion, 41st Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 18th Army had predicted that their food and medicine would run out by September, 1945, and that their weapons would become unusable {{by the end of the}} year. The situation was <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> that in July the 18th Army gave the order (18th Army Order No. 371) that the entirety of its forces should adhere to gyokusai, or honourable death without surrender, a move unprecedented even among the Imperial Army. One second lieutenant reflected that in the final stages of the campaign, the army had stopped being an army and had become a band of beggars.|$|E
25|$|With three {{separate}} {{organizations in the}} confined waters of the lower Mississippi, the fleet command situation was already <b>bad</b> <b>enough,</b> but it began to deteriorate further when the buildup of Farragut's fleet in the lower river became apparent. Flag Officer Hollins was at this time near Memphis, which represented the then-northernmost holdings of the Confederacy on the river, and the Confederate War Department insisted that no effort should be spared to maintain possession. Hollins was sure that the threat from the Gulf was much more severe than Richmond thought, so {{he was prepared to}} listen when General Lovell pleaded for him to come down to New Orleans to help in its defense. When there, he sent a telegram to Richmond seeking permission to attack Farragut's ships while they were still lightened to be brought in across the bar. His pleas were so insistent that they virtually amounted to insubordination. Hollins was called to Richmond, ostensibly to serve on an examination board, but in effect to be removed from active service. By default, command of the Confederate Navy vessels in the vicinity of New Orleans fell on the shoulders of Commander William C. Whittle, up to that time commandant of the navy yard there. Whittle did not consider himself able to handle all of his new duties, so on April 18 he passed command of CSS McRae, Jackson, and Manassas, together with their support vessels, to his executive officer, Commander John K. Mitchell. These were all the Confederate Naval vessels afloat at the time; Louisiana and Mississippi had not yet been launched, and were explicitly not controlled by Whittle or Mitchell. Later, when Louisiana was launched but before she was completed, she joined the others in Mitchell's domain.|$|E

Susan Linn, {{the director of the}} Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood said [...] "It's <b>bad</b> <b>enough</b> when companies use a beloved media character like SpongeBob to promote junk food to children, but it's utterly reprehensible when that character simultaneously promotes objectified, sexualized images of women."

[...] As stated in the introduction to The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the primary attribute of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement.
