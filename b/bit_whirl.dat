50|$|After the merger, Hughes Christensen {{introduced}} the AR Series, the newest antiwhirl technology capable of penetrating {{a much wider}} variety of tough formations without the catastrophic cutter fracture experienced by conventional PDC bits. AR Series bits were designed to resist <b>bit</b> <b>whirl</b> by directing load forces through low-friction gauge pads.By 1995, Hughes Christensen's Gold Series PDC line increased drilling efficiency by reducing the frictional forces that can accumulate {{in front of the}} cutting edge, reducing the energy required to remove the rock. A year later patented ChipMaster PDCs, known for their efficiency and durability, were built on the success of the Eggbeater product line.Hughes Christensen next {{introduced the}} Genesis HCM bits for steerable motors with patented EZSteer depth-of-cut control technology. This same technology was adapted to Genesis HCR bits for rotary steerable systems, such as the Baker Hughes AutoTrak rotary closed loop system. Genesis ZX PDCs followed with new Zenith cutters.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The objective {{of this research is}} to analyze and develop controller to minimize vibrations of the drill string in rotary drilling rigs. The rotary drilling process is affected by many vibrations which adversely affect the drilling efficiency. The vibrations are mainly classified into three: lateral, tosional and axial. Among the vibrations, lateral vibrations are the most destructive. The research conducted a detailed analysis on lateral vibrations. Bent drill string and unbalanced drill bit was found to be its major causes; and the resultant phenomenon was known as drill <b>bit</b> <b>whirl.</b> Practical demonstration and analysis of the <b>bit</b> <b>whirl</b> phenomenon was done by conducting experiments using an unbalanced drill bit model. Their controllability issues were also discussed and practical solutions suggested. Black box identification methods were applied to develop mathematical models for the system. Box Jenkins structure model was identified and validated by a twofold procedure. Accurate simulations results were obtained with a mere 0. 05...|$|E

60|$|It is {{the first}} of April--a white spring day of gleams and driving showers. The street door of WELLWYN's studio stands wide open, and, past it, in the street, the wind is <b>whirling</b> <b>bits</b> of straw and paper bags. Through the door can be seen the butt end of a {{stationary}} furniture van with its flap let down. To this van three humble-men in shirt sleeves and aprons, are carrying out the contents of the studio. The hissing samovar, the tea-pot, the sugar, and the nearly empty decanter of rum stand on the low round table in the fast-being-gutted room. WELLWYN in his ulster and soft hat, is squatting on the little stool in front of the blazing fire, staring into it, and smoking a hand-made cigarette. He has a moulting air. Behind him the humble-men pass, embracing busts and other articles of vertu.|$|R
40|$|A new, highly adaptable, {{framework}} for the simulation of bit dynamics is introduced. The new software, dubbed Three Dimensional Bit Dynamics (TDBD), is implemented as object- orientated code and designed to meet current and future research needs. The software uses a triangulated mesh to represent the bit and rock surface geometry. A novel method for updating the rock surface as the bit drills is presented. This method uses information from both the bit and rock surface to allow for general motion of the <b>bit</b> (including <b>whirl).</b> It also limits the number of operations required to maintain the shape quality of the elements in the rock surface mesh. This method avoids the costly operation of removing elements and remeshing the resulting hole. A derivation of the equations of motion of a roller cone bit is presented {{as an example of}} coupled rotating rigid bodies. The equations are derived using the virtual power method which naturally handles the constraint between the bit body and the cones. A state-of-the-art numerical integrator is applied to the equations to produce an algorithm suitable for use in a bit dynamics software application. The integrator is a composition of adjoint first order integrators (reminiscent of the approach used earlier in Reference [47] to derive an explicit midpoint Lie method). It maintains the properties of the original three degree-of-freedom integrator: second order convergence, symplecticness, remarkable accuracy, and momentum conservation. This algorithm can be applied to other applications where rotating rigid bodies are coupled through an axis that allows rotation. The force model from Reference [33], used for calculating the forces on a bit resulting from rock removal, is implemented within the framework and used to evaluate the software. The weight-on-bit and torque-on-bit are compared to laboratory data. Two polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits are used to calibrate the force model and a third is run in the software to "predict" the laboratory dat...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of bottom-hole assembly (BHA) conditions and drill-bit dynamic behavior {{is a critical}} factor in improving drilling efficiency. In fact, during rotary perforation, bit and drill-string dynamics can produce anomalous drilling conditions such as <b>bit</b> <b>whirl,</b> stick slip and bit bounce, just to name a few. These dangerous drilling conditions reduce the bit penetration rate and the safety of the operations. Measurement-while-drilling (MWD) may be employed to monitor BHA conditions and prevent unsafe operations, by detecting anomalous drilling conditions directly from the acquired signals, and to support real-time decisions. This paper presents a neural network system for real-time detection of the bit bounce phenomenon. The design of the neural network and its validation test are performed exploiting drill-bit data recorded downhole...|$|E
40|$|The {{advanced}} drilling laboratory (ADL) {{has been}} developing a Vibration Assisted Rotary Drilling (VARD) System for several years, which is used for seeking the advantages brought by combining drilling bit vibration and rotation together in drilling operation. In order to achieve the laboratory and field data acquisition and processing several integrated data acquisition systems are necessary. These systems {{are based on the}} most suitable sensors, acquisition parameters, and software to monitor different bit operating conditions and drill string motions in different experiments. The laboratory and field measurement systems include i) the control system of a Small Drilling Simulator (SDS), ii) a Mobile Data Acquisition system for field experiments, and iii) a Down Hole Measurement Tool, or Sensor Sub for drilling field trials. The system for the SDS is based on the LabVIEW programming language and includes the data acquisition, processing and system control ability. In this system, the LabVIEW user interface allows the operator to perform data acquisition, processing and logging. The Mobile data acquisition (DAQ) system is an extension of the SDS system based on the Signal Express Program and includes data acquisition and processing. It was designed {{to be able to be}} carried and operated in tough environments and has numerous data acquisition configurations for a range of different experimental requirements. The Down Hole Measurement Tool (Sensor Sub) is based on the use of accelerometers and magnetometers, along with onboard data acquisition and battery power systems; it is designed to operate in the down-hole environment with high temperature, high pressure and severe vibration to supply raw data for each drilling experiment. The field trial results show that the Sensor Sub can provide compatible and accurate data to identify drill string motions (including rotary speed and bit orientation), and bit vibrations (including axial lateral torsional and <b>bit</b> <b>whirl)</b> ...|$|E
