5|$|All <b>berkelium</b> {{isotopes}} have a half-life far {{too short}} to be primordial. Therefore, any primordial <b>berkelium,</b> that is, <b>berkelium</b> present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.|$|E
5|$|<b>Berkelium</b> forms {{a number}} of {{chemical}} compounds, where it normally exists in an oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, terbium. Like all actinides, <b>berkelium</b> easily dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent <b>berkelium</b> compounds are also known. The existence of divalent <b>berkelium</b> salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. <b>Berkelium</b> does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds. <b>Berkelium</b> can also form several organometallic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) sulfide, Bk2S3, is {{prepared}} by either treating <b>berkelium</b> oxide {{with a mixture}} of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at 1130°C, or by directly reacting metallic <b>berkelium</b> with elemental sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, {{which had}} {{oversight}} over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific {{use of the}} extracted <b>berkelium.</b> The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22milligrams of <b>berkelium,</b> enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the <b>berkelium</b> was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the <b>berkelium</b> material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330days: after that time, half the <b>berkelium</b> produced would have decayed. Because of this, the <b>berkelium</b> target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, {{it had to be}} completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Like all actinides, <b>berkelium</b> dissolves {{in various}} aqueous {{inorganic}} acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This trivalent oxidation state (+3) {{is the most}} stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent (+4) and possibly divalent (+2) <b>berkelium</b> compounds are also known. The existence of divalent <b>berkelium</b> salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of <b>berkelium,</b> terbium. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. <b>Berkelium</b> does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds.|$|E
5|$|Most {{available}} <b>berkelium</b> toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% <b>berkelium</b> {{ends in the}} blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where <b>berkelium</b> stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs <b>berkelium</b> might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) sulfide, Bk2S3, {{has been}} {{prepared}} by either treating <b>berkelium</b> oxide {{with a mixture}} of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfidevapors at 1130 °C, or by directly reacting metallic <b>berkelium</b> with sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals with a cubic symmetry and lattice constant a = 844 pm.|$|E
5|$|Between 70K {{and room}} temperature, <b>berkelium</b> behaves as a Curie–Weiss {{paramagnetic}} material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (µB) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost {{equal to the}} theoretical value of 9.72µB calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, <b>berkelium</b> undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization potential of a neutral <b>berkelium</b> atom is 6.23eV.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} chemical and physical properties of solid <b>berkelium</b> and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target {{and in the}} first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of <b>berkelium</b> by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years. This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of <b>berkelium</b> have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.|$|E
5|$|Two oxides of <b>berkelium</b> are known, with <b>berkelium</b> in the +3 (Bk2O3) and +4 (BkO2) {{oxidation}} states. Berkelium(IV) oxide is a brown solid that crystallizes in a cubic (fluorite) {{crystal structure}} {{with the space}} group Fmm and the coordination numbers of Bk and O. The lattice parameter is 533.4 ± 0.5 pm.|$|E
5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of <b>berkelium,</b> its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of <b>berkelium,</b> which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Although {{very small}} amounts of <b>berkelium</b> were {{possibly}} produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr.. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and curium (element 96) in 1944, the new elements <b>berkelium</b> and californium (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.|$|E
5|$|<b>Berkelium</b> is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental <b>berkelium</b> and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Berkelium</b> is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbolBk and atomic number 97. It {{is a member}} of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. <b>Berkelium</b> was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp {{fluorescence}} peaks at 652nanometers (red light) and 742nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due {{to internal}} transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks {{depends on the}} excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing <b>berkelium</b> ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of <b>berkelium</b> oxide or halide.|$|E
5|$|In halides, <b>berkelium</b> {{assumes the}} {{oxidation}} states +3 and +4. The +3 state is most stable, especially in solutions, and the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only {{known in the}} solid phase. The coordination of the <b>berkelium</b> atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with a coordination number of 9. In the trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic (coordination 8) or octahedral (coordination 6), and in the iodide it is octahedral.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{results are}} {{obtained}} with berkelium(IV) fluoride. <b>Berkelium</b> metal {{can also be}} produced by the reduction of berkelium(IV) oxide with thorium or lanthanum.|$|E
5|$|The {{transuranic}} elements from americium to fermium, including <b>berkelium,</b> occurred naturally {{in the natural}} nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the <b>berkelium</b> phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). <b>Berkelium</b> and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of <b>berkelium</b> have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important <b>berkelium</b> isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} for research isotope 245Cm {{can be obtained}} from the α-decay of 249Cf, and the latter isotope is produced in minute quantities from the β−-decay of the <b>berkelium</b> isotope 249Bk.|$|E
5|$|<b>Berkelium</b> forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of <b>berkelium</b> gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|<b>Berkelium</b> is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). <b>Berkelium</b> is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) iodide forms {{hexagonal}} crystals {{with the}} lattice constants a = 758.4 pm and c = 2087 pm. The known oxyhalides of <b>berkelium</b> include BkOCl, BkOBr and BkOI; they all crystallize in a tetragonal lattice.|$|E
5|$|In December 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, {{proposed}} a joint {{experiment with the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States, to synthesize element 117—so-called for the 117 protons in its nucleus. Their proposal involved fusing a <b>berkelium</b> (element 97) target and a calcium (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the <b>berkelium</b> target with calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements 113–116 and 118. The ORNL—then the world's only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating {{it would be too}} costly. Plans to synthesize element 117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element 118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a californium target with calcium.Cf+48Ca experiment|url=http://www.jinr.ru/publish/Preprints/2002/287(D7-2002-287)e.pdf|journal=JINR Communication|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu. Ts.|accessdate=2015-09-23}} The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of <b>berkelium</b> was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium, as well as costly: it would cost around 3.5 million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production, from which <b>berkelium</b> could be extracted.|$|E
5|$|Just {{over one}} gram of <b>berkelium</b> has been {{produced}} in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of <b>berkelium</b> outside scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element tennessine {{for the first time}} in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of <b>berkelium</b> on human body, and analogies with other {{elements}} may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for <b>berkelium</b> and alpha particles, neutrons, or both for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, <b>berkelium</b> {{is mostly}} {{concentrated}} in certain areas, which {{were used for}} the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, {{as well as at the}} sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including <b>berkelium.</b> For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The JINR team {{sought to}} use <b>berkelium</b> because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium {{used in the}} beam, has 20 protons and 28 neutrons, making a neutron–proton ratio of 1.4; {{and it is the}} lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. The second-lightest such nucleus, palladium-110 (46 protons, 64 neutrons, neutron–proton ratio of 1.391), is much heavier. Thanks to the neutron excess, the {{resulting}} nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117 protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use <b>berkelium,</b> which has 97 protons in its nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} berkelium(III) bromide are known: one with <b>berkelium</b> having {{coordination}} 6, {{and one with}} coordination 8. The latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350°C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied on these two crystal forms: the structure of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples was probed by X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of berkelium-249 had beta decayed to californium-249. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3—249CfBr3 transformation. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to 249CfBr2, but the former could not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in <b>berkelium</b> occurs {{at a rate of}} 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying <b>berkelium</b> properties. Beside a chemical contamination, 249Cf, being an alpha emitter, brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice and the resulting self-heating. The chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, <b>berkelium</b> assumes {{its most}} stable α form {{which has a}} {{hexagonal}} symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25GPa, <b>berkelium</b> transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure {{similar to that of}} α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Berkelium</b> forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene Be(C5H5)2 at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and orthorhombic symmetry, with the lattice constants of a = 1411 pm, b = 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of <b>berkelium</b> gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks. One C5H5 ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound {{are very similar to}} those of (η5–C5H5)3Bk.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) {{hydroxides}} {{are both}} stable in 1 M sodium hydroxide solutions. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under argon laser (514.5nm line) excitation. <b>Berkelium</b> hydrides {{are produced by}} reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1). Whereas the trihydride has a hexagonal symmetry, the dihydride crystallizes in an fcc structure with the lattice constant a = 523 pm. Several other salts of <b>berkelium</b> are known, including Bk2O2S, (BkNO3)3·4H2O, BkCl3·6H2O, Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O and Bk2(C2O4)3·4H2O. Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to Bk2O) of Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O yields the body-centered orthorhombic crystals of berkelium(IV) oxysulfate (Bk2O2SO4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} produce mostly, {{among the}} <b>berkelium</b> isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage {{and before the}} fuel disposal, most of it beta decays to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long {{when compared to the}} other isotopes produced in the reactor, and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>berkelium</b> metal sample {{weighing}} 1.7micrograms {{was prepared}} in 1971 by {{the reduction of}} berkelium(III) fluoride with lithium vapor at 1000°C; the fluoride was suspended on a tungsten wire above a tantalum crucible containing molten lithium. Later, metal samples weighing up to 0.5milligrams were obtained with this method.|$|E
5|$|The major isotope of <b>berkelium,</b> 249Bk, is {{synthesized}} in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, {{and at the}} Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. The {{production of}} the second-most important isotope 247Bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope 244Cm with high-energy alpha particles.|$|E
