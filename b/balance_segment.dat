40|$|Purpose – For {{agricultural}} bankers, agribusiness managers, and salespeople, understanding {{customers and}} their preferences and behaviors {{is crucial to}} success. The two goals of this paper are first to identify today's distinct market segments for financial products for US crop and livestock commercial producers, and second to predict segment membership based on observable characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – Cluster {{analysis was used to}} identify four distinct buyer segments for the purchase of financial products and services by US crop and livestock commercial producers. A multinomial logit model was used to predict segment membership based on demographic, behavioral, and business management factors. Findings – Although, traditionally, the financial services industry has segmented the market for commercial producers based primarily on sales/size categories; this research shows that this factor is not a significant predictor of behavior. Instead, this paper proposes a segmentation based on buying behaviors and identify four distinct market segments for financial products and services for US crop and livestock commercial producers: balance, price, convenience, and service. The <b>balance</b> <b>segment</b> being by far the largest segment. Research limitations/implications – Although the sample size means is representative of the US ag population, {{it may or may not}} be representative of the customers of a regional lender. Readers who are lenders are therefore advised to apply this methodology to their customer database and use the results of the paper as a quality check or benchmarking exercise. The findings also raise a number of issues, which require further research, such as how to implement a targeted marketing plan when there is one dominant segment and two other distinct segments. Practical implications – Lenders need to reconsider their market segmentation methodology. Originality/value – While there has been some research on market segments for retail financial markets, apparently there has been no work on market segments for agricultural financial products. This study exploits a unique dataset of 2, 575 responses to Purdue's Large Commercial Producer Survey and the 2008 survey is the first time the survey included a series of detailed questions on how producers choose a financial service provider. This paper's findings will benefit agricultural bankers and agribusinesses that offer financing to their customers.

25|$|The {{credit card}} may simply {{serve as a}} form of {{revolving}} credit, or it may become a complicated financial instrument with multiple <b>balance</b> <b>segments</b> each at a different interest rate, possibly with a single umbrella credit limit, or with separate credit limits applicable to the various <b>balance</b> <b>segments.</b> Usually this compartmentalization is the result of special incentive offers from the issuing bank, to encourage balance transfers from cards of other issuers. In the event that several interest rates apply to various <b>balance</b> <b>segments,</b> payment allocation is generally at the discretion of the issuing bank, and payments will therefore usually be allocated towards the lowest rate balances until paid in full before any money is paid towards higher rate balances. Interest rates can vary considerably from card to card, and the interest rate on a particular card may jump dramatically if the card user is late with a payment on that card or any other credit instrument, or even if the issuing bank decides to raise its revenue.|$|R

The spacecraft, a major axis spinner, appeared to function nominally throughout the early mission phase, which included several deployments, and orbit and attitude maneuvers. Of particular {{interest is the}} fact that the spacecraft was launched with a deliberate dynamic imbalance. During a segment of early orbit operations, a pair of Lanyard Deployed Booms (LDB) were extended. These booms were not identical; the intent was that the spacecraft would be nearly dynamically balanced after they were deployed. The spacecraft contained two dynamic balance mechanisms intended to fine tune the balance on orbit. However, subsequent images taken by the science instruments on the Despun Platform during the dynamic <b>balancing</b> <b>segment</b> indicated an offset of the principal spin axis from the geometric axis. This offset produced a sinusoidal blurring of the science images sufficiently large to degrade science data below mission requirement specifications. In the end, the imbalance encountered in flight was significantly outside the correction capability of the balances. The purpose of this paper is to examine the flight data during the various deployment and maneuver stages of the early orbit operations coupled with analytical simulations to discuss some of the potential causes of the resultant imbalance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Modern mobile {{devices are}} {{equipped}} with multiple network interfaces, including 3 G/LTE and WiFi. Bandwidth aggregation over LTE and WiFi links offers an attractive opportunity of supporting bandwidth-intensive services, such as high-quality video streaming, on mobile devices. However, achieving effective bandwidth aggregation in mobile environments raises several challenges related to deployment, link heterogeneity, network fluctuation, and energy consumption. We present GreenBag, an energy-efficient bandwidth aggregation middleware that supports real-time data-streaming services over asymmetric wireless links, requiring no modifications to the existing Internet infrastructure and servers. GreenBag employs several techniques, including medium load <b>balancing,</b> efficient <b>segment</b> management, and energy-aware mode control, to resolve such challenges. We implement a prototype of GreenBag on Android-based mobile devices which hosts, to the best knowledge of the authors, the first LTE-enabled bandwidth aggregation prototype for energyefficient real-time video streaming. Our experiment results in both emulated and real-world environments show that GreenBag not only achieves good bandwidth aggregation to provide QoS in bandwidth-scarce environments but also efficiently saves energy on mobile devices. Moreover, energy-aware GreenBag can minimize video interruption while consuming 14 - 25 % less energy than the non-energy-aware counterpart in real-world experiments. I...|$|R

In this paper, we revisit optimal disclosure of proprietary information when firms compete in multiple markets. The analysis demonstrates that {{in the presence of}} multiple segments, the unraveling result applies at the firmwide level but not necessarily segment by segment. Instead, when the firm has an ex ante desire to withhold information and segments are sufficiently similar, the ex post disclosure equilibrium entails aggregation of segment details. Aggregation arises because any ex post temptation to disaggregate and reveal particularly favorable news in one segment entails revealing unfavorable news in another segment.

40|$|Abstract—Providing range query {{as basic}} network {{services}} has received much research attention recently. Range query can exhibit all items located {{within a certain}} range. Previous approaches to represent and query items, such as Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) or R-tree structures, use too much storage space to store and maintain items to achieve exact query results. Corresponding structures cannot effectively support operations on items that have multi-dimensional attributes. In this paper, we propose a simple and space-efficient structure, i. e., Multi-Dimensional Segment Bloom Filter (MDSBF), to support range query for data management. Our approach logically divides the range of multi-dimensional attributes into several segments to support fast and accurate lookups. We also develop a simple algorithm to achieve load <b>balance</b> among multiple <b>segments</b> and improve query accuracy. Through theoretical analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that the MDSBF structure can efficiently support range query service for items with multidimensional attributes. I...|$|R

This calibration process requires detailed data types, such as crash frequencies, traffic volumes, geometrics, and land-use. The HSM does not document in detail techniques for gathering such data, since data systems vary significantly across states. The calibration process also requires certain decisions, such as the correct sampling approach, determination of the minimum segment length, the treatment of left-turn phasing, and the inclusion or exclusion of speed-change lane crashes. This report describes the challenges, practical solutions, and results from a statewide HSM calibration in Missouri, including lessons learned from other states such as Kansas, Illinois, and New Hampshire. The models calibrated included eight segment and eight intersection site types, as well as three freeway segment types that {{will be part of the}} next edition of the HSM. The applied random sampling technique ensured geographic representativeness across the state. A variety of data processing techniques were utilized, including CAD, which was used to obtain geometric data. Some of the challenges encountered during calibration included data availability, obtaining a sufficient sample size for certain site types, maintaining a <b>balance</b> between <b>segment</b> homogeneity and minimum segment length, and excluding inconsistent crash data.

Our model shows how actors are able to dynamically balance coexisting logics, maintaining the distinction between them, whilst also exploiting the benefits of their interdependence.

Under certain conditions proximal tubular function can dictate salt and water balance in the body, for example, during strong inhibition of proximal tubular transport when the distal nephron is overloaded [5].

40|$|The winding pack of the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coils is {{composed}} of 134 turns of Nb 3 Sn Cable in Conduit Conductor (CICCs) wound in 7 double pancakes and cooled by supercritical helium (He) at cryogenic temperature. The cooling of the Stainless Steel (SS) case supporting the winding pack is guaranteed by He circulation in 74 parallel channels. A 2 D approach to compute the temperature distribution in the ITER TF winding pack is here proposed. The TF is divided in 32 poloidal segments, for each segment the corresponding 2 D model is built and a thermal analysis is performed applying the corresponding nuclear heating computed with MCNP code considering the latest design updates, such as thickness increase of the blanket shield module. The Heat Transfer coefficient (HTC) of the He flowing in the CICC and in the cooling channels of the SS case is computed with Dittus Boelter correlation at the nominal inlet pressure of 6 bar. The He is assumed to enter the coil at 4. 5 K in the lower terminal junction, and then the bulk temperature in all the CICCs {{in each of the}} 32 segments is calculated by means of enthalpy <b>balance</b> between <b>segments,</b> considering the actual direction of He circulation, i. e. clockwise or counter-clockwise in neighboring pancakes. The He properties needed to compute the HTC, such as viscosity, specific heat and thermal conductivity, are also varied using the same strategy. With these assumptions, He temperatures close to 5. 7 K are computed, due to the high values of nuclear heating (which is estimated as high as 21. 58 kW in the 18 TF). In the paper, the methodology is presented and the results are discussed in detail. Further parametric analyses are also presented to show the impact of the inlet temperature and of the nuclear heating on the temperature distribution...|$|R

We develop efficient polynomial time algorithms for the resulting problems in the rectilinear and the Euclidean planes where the bounded region is either a rectangle or a constant size polygon, respectively. Based on these solutions, we develop algorithms for evaluating efficiently the objective function at any possible location of the consumer inside the bounded region.

In this paper, we propose the segmented hash table architecture, which ensures constant time hash operations at high loads with high probability. To achieve this, the hash memory {{is divided into}} N logical segments so that each incoming key has N potential storage locations; the destination segment is chosen so as to minimize collisions. In this way, collisions, and the associated probe sequences, are dramatically reduced. In order to keep memory utilization minimized, probabilistic filters are kept on-chip to allow the N segments to be accessed without in-creasing the number of off-chip memory operations.

METHODS: A self-navigated three-dimensional radial <b>segmented</b> <b>balanced</b> steady-state free precession pulse sequence with an isotropic 1. 7 -mm {{spatial resolution}} was implemented at 3 T with a variable T 2 preparation module. Bloch equation and Monte Carlo simulations {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} the heart rate, B 1 inhomogeneity and noise on the T 2 fitting accuracy. In a phantom study, the accuracy of the pulse sequence was studied through comparison with a gold-standard spin-echo T 2 mapping method. The robustness and homogeneity of the technique were ascertained in a study of 10 healthy adult human volunteers, while first results obtained in patients are reported. RESULTS: The numerical simulations demonstrated that the heart rate and B 1 inhomogeneity cause only minor deviations in the T 2 fitting, whereas the phantom study showed good agreement of the technique with the gold standard. The volunteer study demonstrated an average myocardial T 2 of 40. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 3 ms and a < 15 % T 2 gradient in the base-apex and anterior-inferior direction. In three patients, elevated T 2 values were measured in regions with expected edema.

In this paper we compare four criteria for the estimation of the 'optimum' model order for an autoregressive (AR) process applied to short segments of tachograms used for HRV analysis. The criteria used were Akaike's final prediction error, Akaike's information criterion, Parzen's criterion of autoregressive transfer function and Rissanen's minimum description length method, and they were first applied to tachograms to verify (i) the range and distribution of model orders obtained and (ii) if the different techniques suggest the same model order for the same frames. The four techniques were then tested using a true AR process of known order p = 6; this verified the ability of the criteria to estimate the correct order of a true AR process and the effect, on the spectrum, of choosing a wrong model order was also investigated. It was found that all the four criteria underestimate the true AR order; specifying a fixed model order was then looked at and it is recommended that an AR order not less than p = 16, should be used for spectral analysis of short segments of tachograms...|$|R

Although GSGS recommended that states include literacy, language, and pre-reading skills in ELGs, many states developed more comprehensive documents that included broader ranges of skills and activities consistent with each state's conceptualization of what constitutes quality learning environments for this age group. Consequently, music content, if included in ELGs, may vary from state to state. Three national standards documents may have informed music standards included in ELGs, such as The National Music Standards for Prekindergarten, Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) All-Criteria Document. I conducted a content analysis of state ELGs: 1) to determine what musical behaviors and activities states have codified as official knowledge within quality learning environments for young children, and 2) to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} musical content reflects music standards included in national prekindergarten standards documents. Findings indicated that the broadly-framed Head Start and NAEYC music indicators were well-represented in state ELGs. The majority of ELGs have addressed two of the Content Standards of The National Music Standards for Prekindergarten, "Singing and Playing Instruments" (88 %) and "Responding to Music" (74 %).

Additionally, 14. 33 % of all music-related indictors included in state ELGs did not reflect the music content of any of the national standards and guidelines; rather, the indicators represented additional music content (for example, audience skills), music activities that promote social and emotional development, and facilitating learning in other curriculum areas.

The precision for measuring fat and fat-free mass can be as low as 0 · 5 kg when certain reference techniques are used (hydrodensitometry, air-displacement plethysmography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and approximately 0 · 7 kg for changes between two time points. Techniques associated with a measurement error of 0 · 7 kg for changes in fat and fat-free mass (approximately 18 MJ) are of little or no value for calculating energy balance over short periods of time, but they may be of some value {{over long periods of time}} (18 MJ over 1 year corresponds to an average daily energy balance of 70 kJ, which is 5 – 10 kg. The same principles can be applied to the assessment of energy <b>balance</b> in body <b>segments</b> using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Energy balance can be obtained over periods as short as a few minutes, e. g. during measurements of BMR. The variability in BMR between individuals of similar age, weight and height and gender is about 7 – 9 %, most of which is of biological origin rather than measurement error, which is about 2 %. Measurement of total energy expenditure during starvation (no energy intake) can also be used to estimate energy balance in a whole-body calorimeter, in patients in intensive care units being artificially ventilated and by tracer techniques. The precision of these techniques varies from 1 to 10 %. Establishing energy balance by measuring the discrepancy between energy intake and expenditure has to take into consideration the combined validity and reliability of both components. The measurement error for dietary intake may be as low as 2 – 3 % in carefully controlled environments, in which subjects are provided only with certain food items and bomb calorimetry can be undertaken on duplicate samples of the diet. Reliable results can also be obtained in hospitalised patients receiving enteral tube feeding or parenteral nutrition as the only source of nutrition. Unreliability increases to an unknown extent in free-living subjects eating a mixed and varied diet; thus, improved methodology is needed for the study of energy balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the value of optimized 3 -dimensional alternating repetition time balanced steady-state free precession (ATR-SSFP), as an alternative to conventional <b>segmented</b> <b>balanced</b> steady-state free precession (bSSFP) with fat suppression prepulse (FS-bSSFP), in single breath-hold abdominal magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Bloch simulations were performed to determine the optimal flip angle (FA = 1 - 90 degrees) and τ (1 - 3) with respect to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between abdominal organs for ATR-SSFP. These were corroborated by phantom measurements for different T 1 /T 2 values (5 - 47) as well as in a healthy volunteer. In addition, fat suppression efficiency was studied using phantom and volunteer measurements. The effect of resolution on image quality was studied in a healthy volunteer. Using the optimal settings, ATR-SSFP images as well as FS-bSSFP images were obtained in 15 pancreatic cancer patients. For 10 structures of interest, the signal ratio with respect to the pancreas was computed and compared between both sequences. Finally, 10 items on image quality (fat suppression, artifacts, and sharpness) and tissue conspicuity (ducts, vessels, and duodenum) were scored by 2 abdominal radiologists for both image sequences. The results of simulations, phantom measurements, and volunteer measurements showed that, considering scan time, fat suppression, and clinical relevance, the ideal settings for ATR-SSFP were as follows: τ = 3; TR 1 = 3. 46 milliseconds; radiofrequency phase cycling 0, 180, 180, 0 degrees; and FA = 13 - 16 degrees (highest SNR) and 24 - 26 degrees (highest CNR). The optimized feasible additional settings implemented for patient scans were FA = 18 degrees and resolution = 1. 4 × 1. 4 × 1. 4 mm. In patients, the signal ratios of both ATR-SSFP and FS-bSSFP were comparable and had a T 2 -like contrast behavior, although more accentuated in ATR-SSFP. The ATR-SSFP scored significantly higher than FS-bSSFP for 9 of 10 items scored. For single breath-hold abdominal imaging at 3 T, ATR-SSFP performs best with τ = 3 and an FA between 13 degrees (highest SNR) and 26 degrees (highest CNR). The scoring of both abdominal radiologists indicated that, at τ = 3, FA = 18 degrees, and 1. 4 × 1. 4 × 1. 4 mm resolution, ATR-SSFP was preferred over conventional FS-bSSFP with similar setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} whether the signal intensity (SI) of myocardial infarction (MI) on contrast enhanced (CE) -cine MRI is useful for differentiating recently infarcted myocardium from chronic scar. This study included 24 patients with acute MI (36 - 84 years, mean age: 57) and 19 patients with chronic MI (44 - 80 years, mean age: 64). The diagnosis of acute MI was based on the presence of typical symptoms, i. e. elevation of the cardiac enzymes and the absence of any remote infarction history. The diagnosis of chronic MI was based on a history of MI or coronary artery disease of more than one month duration and on the absence of any recent MI within the previous six months. Retrospectively, the ECG-gated breath-hold cine imaging was performed in the short axis plane using a <b>segmented,</b> <b>balanced,</b> turbo-field, echo-pulse sequence two minutes after the administration of Gd-DTPA at a dose of 0. 2 mmol/kg body weight. Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) in the same plane was performed 10 to 15 minutes after contrast administration, and this was served as the gold standard of reference. The SI of the infarcted myocardium on the CE-cine MRI was compared with that of the normal myocardium on the same image. The area of abnormal SI on the CE-cine MRI was compared with the area of hyperenhancement on the DCE MRI. The area of high SI on the CE-cine MRI was detected in 23 of 24 patients with acute MI (10 with homogenous high SI, 13 high SI with subendocardial low SI, and one with iso SI). The area of high SI on the CE-cine MRI was larger than that seen on the DCE MRI (p < 0. 05). In contrast, the areas of chronic MI were seen as iso-SI with thin subendocardial low SI on the CE-cine MR in all the chronic MI patients. The presence of high SI on both the CE-cine MRI and the DCE MRI is more sensitive (95. 8 %) for determining the age of a MI than the presence of myocardial thinning (66. 7 %). This study showed the different SI patterns between recently infarcted myocardium and chronic scar on the CE-cine MRI. CE-cine MRI is thought to be quite useful for determining the age of myocardial infarction, in addition to its utility for assessing myocardial contractility...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} five decades, Texla has been {{providing}} a laminated product {{with a wide range}} of variety for its clients ever since the first product was developed in a hen house on September 12 th, 1962. At that time Nils Bengtsson, father of Bengt Bengtsson the current CEO of Texla, had a vision of something great for the future. A lot has happened since that day both in terms of organization and products. Because of the dedication and creativity Texla has been fuelled with innovation and curiosity for new possibilities over the years. A company such as Texla with more than 50 years of practice and experience shows us stability but the road leading up to today's business has not always been straightforward(Johansson, 2014). In 1970, Texla managed to establish contracts with the automotive industry in order to start laminating textiles for this sector. Volvo became Texla's biggest client and more fabrics became mass-produced. Prospects were looking good for the future and in 1987 the company Tentex was founded. Tentex has today merged with the Texla Group but because of Tentex working as a separate company at that time, Texla had the opportunity to offer a wider range of alternative lamination techniques of fabrics and finished modules for its clients. This decision led to an increasing turnover for Texla and in the same year Texla decided to establish a new production facility in Belgium. Between 1989 and 1998 a joint-venture agreement concerning this facility was concluded between Texla and Guilford and in 2002 Texla decided to buy an additional production facility in Portugal. Texla decided to establish a facility in Portugal due to the fact that they got a really good price on the factory itself mainly but also in order to be able to market their product further in west-Europe and north of Africa (Johansson, 2014). In order to reach a wider market and more efficiently manage the company, Texla had to develop a new strategic plan. The costs for transports were now of the essence since the clients had started to develop a more cost-oriented mind-set over the years. So in order not to lose these vital customers, Texla had to establish another production facility in either Slovakia or Czech Republic. The declarations for this would be so that Texla could get a better proximity to the sewing industry connected to Texla's automotive clients. So in 2006 Texla decides to establish a fourth production facility in Czech Republic due to the proximity to their clients and their businesses but also since the overall costs were much lower in Czech Republic than in the rest of Europe. Czech Republic was also known to be quite advance in terms of industrialization and the infrastructure made the communication in the country much better than the alternative. Moreover, in 2008 Texla started to move more of their projects to their facility in Czech Republic due to a very successful collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce in Prague. This reallocation was very successful and Texla now managed to cover the whole European market more efficiently (Johansson, 2014). When the economic crisis came to affect Europe during this time, Texla Sweden had to start looking for new markets to adopt. By 2010 Texla Sweden had managed to <b>balance</b> its customer <b>segment</b> from being 95...|$|R
