60|$|Go {{down to the}} end of that wooden <b>bridge,</b> <b>seat</b> {{yourself}} on the rail, and there sit till all the outer world is lost to you. There is no grander spot about Niagara than this. The waters are absolutely around you. If you have that power of eye-contrio which is so necessary to the full enjoyment of scenery, you will see nothing but the water. You will certainly hear nothing else; and the sound, I beg you to remember, is not an ear-cracking, agonizing crash and clang of noises, but is melodious and soft withal, though loud as thunder. It fills your ears, and, as it were, envelops them, {{but at the same time}} you can speak to your neighbor without an effort. But at this place, and in these moments, the less of speaking, I should say, the better. There is no grander spot than this. Here, seated on the rail of the bridge, you will not see the whole depth of the fall. In looking at the grandest works of nature, and of art too, I fancy it is never well to see all. There should be something left to the imagination, and much should be half concealed in mystery. The greatest charm of a mountain range is the wild feeling that there must be strange, unknown, desolate worlds in those far-off valleys beyond. And so here, at Niagara, that converging rush of waters may fall down, down at once into a hell of rivers, for what the eye can see. It is glorious to watch them in their first curve over the rocks. They come green as a bank of emeralds, but with a fitful, flying color, as though conscious that in one moment more they would be dashed into spray and rise into air, pale as driven snow. The vapor rises high into the air, and is gathered there, visible always as a permanent white cloud over the cataract; but the bulk of the spray which fills the lower hollow of that horseshoe is like a tumult of snow. This you will not fully see from your seat on the rail. The head of it rises ever and anon out of that caldron below, but the caldron itself will be invisible. It is ever so far down--far as your own imagination can sink it. But your eyes will rest full upon the curve of the waters. The shape you will be looking at is that of a horseshoe, but of a horseshoe miraculously deep from toe to heel; and this depth becomes greater as you sit there. That which at first was only great and beautiful becomes gigantic and sublime, till the mind is at loss to find an epithet for its own use. To realize Niagara, you must sit there till you see nothing else than that which you have come to see. You will hear nothing else, and think of nothing else. At length you will be at one with the tumbling river before you. You will find yourself among the waters as though you belonged to them. The cool, liquid green will run through your veins, and the voice of the cataract will be the expression of your own heart. You will fall as the bright waters fall, rushing down into your new world with no hesitation and with no dismay; and you will rise again as the spray rises, bright, beautiful, and pure. Then you will flow away in your course to the uncompassed, distant, and eternal ocean.|$|E
40|$|Geosynthetic {{reinforced}} soil (GRS) bridge abutments {{are becoming}} {{widely used in}} transportation infrastructure and provide many advantages over traditional pile-supported designs, including lower cost, faster and easier construction, and smoother transition between the bridge and approach roadway. Seismic events represent a severe loading condition and experimental testing and evaluation are needed to understand the potential issues and performance characteristics. This study involves a comprehensive evaluation {{of the performance of}} GRS bridge abutments for the service limit state, the strength limit state, and an extreme event limit state (i. e., seismic loading conditions) using both numerical simulations and physical modeling experiments. A numerical model was developed for GRS bridge abutments under service loading conditions and was validated using field measurements. Simulation results indicate that the horizontal restraining forces generated from the bridge structure can have an important effect on reducing lateral facing displacements and <b>bridge</b> <b>seat</b> settlements of GRS bridge abutments. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effects of various design parameters on the performance of GRS bridge abutments for service loading conditions, and the results indicate that reinforcement spacing, reinforcement stiffness, bridge load, and abutment height have the most significant effects on the lateral facing displacements and <b>bridge</b> <b>seat</b> settlements. The numerical model was enhanced by incorporating the strain softening behavior for backfill soil and the rate-dependent behavior for geosynthetic reinforcement to simulate the load-deformation behavior of GRS bridge abutments up to failure condition. A linearly elastic reinforcement model can capture the deformation behavior of GRS bridge abutments for service loads, but not for larger applied loads approaching failure. The geometry parameters for GRS bridge abutments have important effects on the internal failure surface of the GRS bridge abutments, and the internal failure surface manifests as a bilinear surface that starts at the heel of the bridge footing, moves vertically downward to mid-height of the GRS bridge abutment, and then linearly to the toe of the GRS bridge abutment. The seismic response of GRS bridge abutments was evaluated using an experimental testing program. Shaking table tests were conducted on six half-scale GRS bridge abutments by application of a series of shaking events in the directions longitudinal and transverse to the bridge beam. Experimental design of the model specimen followed established similitude relationships for shaking table testing of reduced-scale models in a 1 g gravitational field, including scaling of model geometry, geosynthetic reinforcement stiffness, backfill soil modulus, bridge load, and characteristics of the earthquake motions. Experimental results indicate that the seismic facing displacements and <b>bridge</b> <b>seat</b> settlements for GRS bridge abutments are small and will likely not have a major effect on the bridge performance. Reinforcement spacing and stiffness have the most important effects on the seismic performance of GRS bridge abutments...|$|E

The focus of this paper is placed on the settlement behaviour of a continuous 3 -span R. C. viaduct bridge supported on piles adjacent to highway embankment. Monitoring data accumulated over the last 12 years indicate that the observed pace of the settlement of the viaduct structure in other sections matches that of the ground. However, the bridge piers adjacent to the embankment have been suffering an additional approximately 1 cm settlement every year since the completion of the embankment construction. It was believed that the piers may suffer from enormous negative skin friction owing to the surcharge from the embankment and groundwater depression. This paper first summarizes the settlement analysis results to quantify the settlement of pile due to regional ground subsidence and the combined effects from ground water fluctuation and embankment surcharge loading.
