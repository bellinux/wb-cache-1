50|$|G.91 target tug: A target tug variant was {{developed}} with an under-wing pylon mounted winch and target drogue. The drogue being attached to {{an extension of}} the winch around the trailing edge, above the wing. Other modifications included a large <b>blade</b> <b>aerial</b> above the centre fuselage and an anti-collision light at the forward end of the dorsal fin.|$|E
40|$|Power {{transmission}} pipes {{are widely}} present in industrial applications. Moreover, {{the physical and}} mathematical model describing the dynamics of a pipe {{is similar to that}} of many mechanical systems such as heat exchangers high-speed magnetic tapes, band saw <b>blades,</b> <b>aerial</b> cable threadlines, and sheet production processes. All previous systems are axially moving systems. The dynamic behaviour of an axially moving system is greatly influenced from the presence of the internal flowing fluid, which affects the pipes dynamics and stability. When a critical value of the axial speed is reached, the first linear natural frequency vanishes; the straight equilibrium position loses stability and bifurcates into new equilibrium states. In the sub-critical speed range, all natural frequencies decrease as the axial speed increases and the vibration modes are complex. In actual operating conditions, pipe lines are subjected to many external disturbances, such as external excitations or dynamic disturbances exerted by the flow fluctuations induced by a volumetric pump. Some example of pump-pipes interactions can be found in literature, that highlight the great influence of pump irregularity on lines stability and system noising. When an oscillating external excitation causes a resonance, very dangerous conditions can be met and the axially moving continuum can undergo to catastrophic failures. The presence of an internal flow can cause divergence and flutter type instabilities. The fluid structures interaction analysis requires a deep investigation of the internal velocity fiel...|$|R
40|$|Since {{writing the}} article "New pasture legumes for clay soils in dry environments" {{for the last}} issue of the Northern Muster some 10, 000 ha of Progardes (www. progardes. com. au) has been sown across North, North West and Central Queensland on various land types including: Mitchell Grass Downs; cleared Gidgee/Boree; cleared Blackwood and Brigalow; and Barkly and Gulf land types. Agrimix Pty Ltd and various graziers {{undertook}} the planting of Progardes using numerous methods including: aerial seeding into dry native grass (Mitchell grass); aerial seeding into freshly pulled and/or old pulled Gidgee/Boree country; aerial seeding onto a fully cultivated seedbed; <b>aerial</b> seeded onto <b>blade</b> ploughed country,; <b>aerial</b> seeded into burnt country; fully disc cultivated and airseeded; and partially tyne cultivated and airseeded. The results of these various planting methods are pending...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{advances}} in simulation, optimization, structural health monitoring, and high-performance computing create {{a unique opportunity}} to combine the developments in these fields to formulate a Dynamics Data Driven Application System (DDDAS) framework. In this paper we propose such a framework, which consists of the following items and features: a structural health monitoring (SHM) system, an advanced fluid—structure interaction (FSI) simulation module, and a sensitivity analysis, optimization and control software module. High-performance computing (HPC) is employed for the various parts of the framework and is viewed as its essential element. The intended application of the developed framework is the analysis of medium-to-large-scale composite structures. These include aerospace structures, such as military aircraft fuselage and wings, helicopter <b>blades,</b> and unmanned <b>aerial</b> vehicles, and civil structures, such as wind turbine blades and towers. The proposed framework will continuously and dynamically integrate the SHM data into the FSI analysis of these structures. This capability allows one to: 1. Shelter the structures from excessive stress levels during operation; 2. Make informed decisions to perform structural maintenance and repair; and 3. Predict the remaining fatigue life of the structure...|$|R
30|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between depth and fish assemblage in these seagrass beds, we established three study stations characterized by different water depths. The stations were set from the shallow inner lagoon to the outer subtidal zone. First, the lagoon shore station (‘L’, Figure  1 B) was located at the shallow (0.1 to 0.3  m at low tide) shoreline of the inner lagoon. Seagrass beds here cover about 0.4  km 2. At this station, most seagrass blades are exposed to the air during ebb tides. Second, the west tidal flat station (‘W’, Figure  1 B) was located at the intertidal flat region (about 0.5  km 2) around the inlet. Water depth here is also shallow (0.2 to 0.5  m at low tide), though some tidal creeks in the meadows prevent the majority of the seagrass <b>blades</b> from experiencing <b>aerial</b> exposure during low tides. Finally, the north coast subtidal station (‘N’, Figure  1 B) was located at the northern region of the Dongsha Island (about 10 to 50  m from shore) and served as the deepest station. Seagrass beds here cover about 0.5  km 2. The average water depth is more than 1  m, and seagrass are never exposed to the air during ebb tides.|$|R
