50|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are {{the primary}} output of stock {{assessments}} and fishing regulations are set to meet these biological benchmarks. There are several types of benchmarks are used depending on the preference of the regulating agency. The benchmarks are used to control {{different aspects of the}} fishery or population. Benchmarks that regulate fishing mortality include Fcurr, Fmsy, Emsy, and MFMT. Fcurr is the current level of fishing mortality, Fmsy is the fishing mortality that produces the maximum sustainable yield, and Emsy is the expected level of fishing that will produce the maximum sustainable yield. SSBcurr, SSBmsy, and MSST are used in the regulation of biomass levels. SSBcurr stands for the current spawning stock biomass, SSBmsy is the amount of spawning stock biomass needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield, and MSST is the minimum standing stock threshold. The amount that is available to be harvested is controlled by the benchmarks MSY and OY. MSY is the maximum sustainable yield and OY is the optimum yield of a stock. The main difference between MSY and OY is that MSY considers only the biology of the fish while the OY considers the economic aspect of the harvest.|$|E

When discards occur and it is not accounted for in the assessment, the total mortality from the stock is underestimated. Thus, it will cause bias in the VPA estimates and in analysis based on these estimates. In the present work, discards in the commercial trawl fishery for Northeast Arctic cod, during the years 1946 - 1998, were estimated from two points of view. The first was to assume that the USSR did not have any discards and adjust the other countries' catch at age distributions according to the USSR landings. The second was to use selectivity properties and abundance estimates to estimate age distributions in the catches and adjust the catches according to these. The differences between the estimated and reported catch numbers were then regarded as discards. New VPA numbers at age were estimated and the <b>biological</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> Fmed was calculated. The results from the first approach were considered not to be any reliable. The results from the second approach were as expected, high in the 1950 s and 1960 s with a decreasing trend towards the 1980 s. The results indicate also that the USSR had discards or that they had errors in the reported catches. Discards were shown to have a large influence on the VPA estimates, especially stock numbers at age three, which resulted in a small increase in the value of Fmed.

Reproductive aspects were assessed whereby female E. affinis was reported to reach maturity earlier than males which is an indication of phenotypic response toward a decline in population. Two peaks was revealed by the use of Gonad-Somatic Index (GSI), however an extended spawning period was noticed in a period between November to February following an increased water temperature. Although, these findings presents a snapshot concerning population structure and reproduction of E. affinis, further studies covering the entire coastal waters of Tanzania are recommended to aid the management and conservation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary This {{report is}} {{a review of}} the 2010 blue crab {{benchmark}} assessment in Chesapeake Bay. This assessment is based on a new sex and two-stage structured model. The demographic model follows the dynamics of abundance of year 0 and year 1 + crabs and has a modified Ricker stock recruitment model as a renewal function. It allows for adult males and females to contribute to compensatory mechanisms affecting recruitment at larger population sizes and primarily adult females to affect recruitment at low population levels. The model is fitted to four main sources of information, including overall catch of Chesapeake Bay blue crab, Baywide winter dredge survey, Maryland DNR trawl survey and Virginia juvenile finfish and blue crab trawl survey. A sensitivity analysis to model assumptions is presented in the assessment document. <b>Biological</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are defined for stock abundance and exploitation rates. The 2010 assessment model is a major improvement to its predecessors (2005 and 1997) and is a valid approach. <b>Biological</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are calculated internally and correctly implemented in the model and are consistent with underlying mode...|$|E
40|$|The Cape Cod-Gulf of Maine {{yellowtail}} flounder stock was most recently assessed at the Groundfish Assessment Review Meeting (GARM) in 2005 (Cadrin et al. 2005). That assessment {{was based on}} a virtual population analysis (VPA) with a 5 + age group formulation. At the time it was recognized that this formulation was sub-optimal because the age 3 partial recruitment had to be 1. 0 even though this age was thought to be less than fully selected. The stock exhibited high fishing mortality rates and low abundance. Reference point estimation was derived from spawning stock biomass per recruit and yield per recruit analyses, with the assumption of constant recruitment. The value for F 40 % (i. e. the proxy for FMSY) was 0. 17 and the corresponding SSBMSY and MSY were 12, 600 mt and 2, 300 mt, respectively. The estimate of SSB 2004 (1, 111 mt) was 9 % of SSBMSY and the estimate of F 2004 (0. 75) was four times FMSY, indicating that the stock was severely overfished and overfishing was occurring. The current benchmark assessment revises and updates the 1994 - 2007 fishery catch estimates to reflect recommendations at the GARM III Data meeting (GARM 2007), and updates research survey abundance indices and analytical models (VPA) though 2007 / 2008 as recommended at both the GARM III Methods meeting (GARM 2008 a) and the GARM III <b>Biological</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Points</b> meeting (GARM 2008 b). The VPA analysis now uses a 6 + formulation which allows appropriate estimation of age 3 partial recruitment. <b>Biological</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for this stock were reevaluated based on recommendations at the GARM III <b>Biological</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Points</b> meeting (GARM 2008 b) to determine the status of the stock...|$|E

40|$|The {{spawning}} potential ratio (SPR) is {{a well-established}} <b>biological</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point,</b> and estimates of SPR {{could be used}} to inform management decisions for data-poor fisheries. Simulations were used to investigate the utility of the length-based model (LB-SPR) developed in Hordyk et al. (this issue. Some explorations of the life history ratios to describe length composition, spawning-per-recruit, and the spawning potential ratio. ICES Journal of Marine Science) to estimate the SPR of a stock directly from the size composition of the catch. This was done by (i) testing some of the main assumptions of the LB-SPR model, including recruitment variability and dome-shaped selectivity, (ii) examining the sensitivity of the model to error in the input parameters, and (iii) completing an initial empirical test for the LB-SPR model by applying it to data from a well-studied species. The method uses maximum likelihood methods to find the values of relative fishing mortality (F/M) and selectivity-at-length that minimize the difference between the observed and the expected length composition of the catch, and calculates the resulting SPR. When parameterized with the correct input parameters, the LB-SPR model returned accurate estimates of F/M and SPR. With high variability in annual recruitment, the estimates of SPR became increasingly unreliable. The usefulness of the LB-SPR method was tested empirically by comparing the results predicted by the method with those for a well-described species with known length and age composition data. The results from this comparison suggest that the LB-SPR method has potential to provide a tool for the cost-effective assessment of data-poor fisheries. However, the model is sensitive to non-equilibrium dynamics, and requires accurate estimates of the three parameters (M/k, L∞, and CVL∞). Care must be taken to evaluate the validity of the assumptions and the biological parameters when the model is applied to data-poor fisheries...|$|R
40|$|<b>Biological</b> limit <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> (LRPs) for {{fisheries}} catch represent upper bounds that avoid undesirable population states. LRPs {{can support}} consistent management evaluation among species and regions, and can advance ecosystem-based fisheries management. For transboundary species, LRPs prorated by local abundance can inform local manage-ment decisions when international coordination is lacking. We estimated LRPs for western Pacific leatherbacks in the U. S. West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (WCEEZ) using three approaches with {{different types of}} information on local abundance. For the current application, the best-informed LRP used a local abundance estimate derived from nest counts, vital rate information, satellite tag data, and fishery observer data, and was calcu-lated with a Potential Biological Removal estimator. Management strategy evaluation was used to set tuning parameters of the LRP estimators to satisfy risk tolerances for falling below population thresholds, and to evaluate sensitivity of population outcomes to bias in key inputs. We estimated local LRPs consistent with three hypothetical management objec-tives: allowing the population to rebuild to its maximum net productivity level (4. 7 turtles pe...|$|R
