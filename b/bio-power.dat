40|$|In many Western countries, {{physiotherapy}} in {{a private}} context is practiced and managed within a neoliberal ideology. Little is known about how private physiotherapeutic practice functions, which is why this study aims to explore how physiotherapy is practiced {{from the perspective of}} physiotherapists in Danish private practice, within a Foucauldian perspective. This study consisted of 21 interviews with physiotherapists employed in private practice and observation notes of the clinic. Interviews and observation notes were analyzed through the lens of Foucault’s concepts of discipline, self-discipline, power and resistance. Three categories were constructed: (1) the tacit transition from person to patient; (2) the art of producing docile bodies; and (3) the inhibition of freedom of action by practicing in private homes. From a Foucauldian perspective, private physiotherapeutic practices have a disciplinary function in modern society as the physiotherapists produce docile bodies through disciplinary technologies, whereby their business becomes profitable. Most patients support the physiotherapists’ ‘‘regime of truth’’ but if they resist, they are either excluded or accepted as ‘‘abnormal’’ but as a necessary source of income. The physiotherapists appear to be unconscious of the <b>bio-powers</b> working ‘‘behind their backs’’ as they are subject to the Western medical logic, and the neoliberal framework that rules their businesses...|$|R

5000|$|Foucault then {{discusses}} {{what lies}} behind the “academic chestnut” which couldn't be deciphered by his historical predecessors: namely the disjointed and discontinuous movement {{of history and}} power (<b>bio-power).</b> What is meant by this? For Foucault's predecessors, history was concerned by deeds of monarchs and a full list of their accomplishments in which the sovereign {{is presented in the}} text as doing all things ‘great,’ added to this 'greatness' of deeds this 'greatness' of the sovereign was accomplished all by the sovereign himself without any help; monument building, allegedly built by the monarch, without any help from skilled and trained professionals serves as a perfectly good example of the sovereign [...] "greatness". However, for Foucault, this is not the case. Foucault’s genealogy comes into play here where Foucault tries to build a bridge between two theoretical notions: disciplinary power (Disciplinary institutions) and biopower. He investigates the constant shift throughout history between these two ‘paradigms,’ and what developments-from these two ‘paradigms’ became new subjects. The previous historical dimensions so often portrayed by historians (according to Foucault) was sovereign history, which acts as a ceremonial tool for sovereign power “It glorifies and adds lustre to power. History performs this function in two modes: (1) in a “genealogical” mode (understood in the simple sense of that term) that traces the lineage of the sovereign. By the time of the 17th century with the development of Mercantilism, Statistics (mathematical statistics) and political economy this reaches a most vitriolic and vicious form later to be called Nation states where whole populations were involved(in the guise of armies both industrial and military), in which a continuous war is enacted out not amongst ourselves(the population) but in a struggle for the state's very existence which ultimately leads to a [...] "Thantapolitics"(a philosophical term that discusses the politics of organizing who should live and who should die (and how) in a given form of society) of the population on a large industrial scale.|$|E
40|$|Foucauldian {{concepts}} of <b>bio-power</b> and biopolitics are widely utilized in contemporary political philosophy. However, Foucault’s account of <b>bio-power</b> includes some ambivalence which has rendered these {{concepts of}} <b>bio-power</b> and biopolitics rather equivocal. Foucault elaborates these concepts and themes related {{to them in}} his books Discipline and Punish (1975) and History of Sexuality: An Introduction (1976), and also in his Collège de France-lectures held from 1975 to 1979. Through {{a detailed analysis of}} these works this research suggests that there are differences in Foucault’s account of <b>bio-power.</b> The aim of this thesis is to shed light to these differences, and consequently, clarify Foucault’s account of <b>bio-power</b> and biopolitics. This research is divided into two main sections. The first analyzes Foucault’s works of 1975 - 76. In those works Foucault investigates relations of power and knowledge through a framework of what he called the normalizing society. Foucault identifies two essential forms of power operating in the normalizing society: individualizing discipline and population targeting <b>bio-power.</b> Together they form a network of power relations that Foucault calls power over life. By this concept Foucault designates the process by which human life in its totality became an object of power and knowledge. In this framework <b>bio-power</b> and biopolitics are essentially connected to particular system of norms which creates its power effects through medicine, human sciences and laws and regulations. The two pivotal reference points for normalizing techniques are race and sexuality. The second section focuses on Foucault’s lectures of 1977 - 79 and his other works published approximately until 1982. In these works Foucault elaborates the subject of governing population from different angle and with novel concepts. He abandons the view according to which one could locate a uniform architecture of power operating in society. Rather, he begins to analyze society as being constituted by multiple different forms of power and political rationalities. The crucial research question is what kinds of modifications take place in techniques of government when relations of power and knowledge are changed. In these investigations <b>bio-power</b> and biopolitics are identified with liberal apparatuses of security and pastoral power. The conclusions deduced in this thesis are that Foucault’s preliminary analysis of <b>bio-power</b> in the context of normalizing society is not sufficient to produce a firm analytical ground for concepts of <b>bio-power</b> and biopolitics. However, in his later elaborations of these concepts Foucault manages to demonstrate how political rationalities and different forms of power are related {{to the ways in which}} human life is governed and modified. Thus Foucault succeeds in creating analytical tools by which to have better understanding through what kinds of rationalities human life is managed in contemporary societies...|$|E

It begins by making some general {{comments about the}} theoretical approach to <b>bio-power</b> taken in this paper. It then outlines the distinctive features of <b>bio-power</b> in Australia and how these intersected {{with the emergence of}} penal welfarism to govern the unruly, unchaste, unlawful, and the primitive. The paper draws on three examples to illustrate the argument[*]–[*]the gargantuan criminalisation rates of Aboriginal youth, the history of incarcerating state wards in state institutions, and the mandatory detention of unlawful non-citizens and their children. The construction of Indigenous people as a dangerous presence, alongside the construction of the unruly neglected children of the colony — the larrikin descendants of convicts as necessitating special regimes of internal controls and institutions, found a counterpart in the racial and other exclusionary criteria operating through immigration controls for much of the twentieth century. In each case the problem child or population was expelled from the social body through forms of <b>bio-power,</b> rationalised as strengthening, protecting or purifying the Australian population...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} about the social {{construction}} of health education in the Brazilian national health system. Health education is examined as a social policy and as a health practice. The theoretical framework is {{based on the work of}} Michel Foucault, with special attention to the concepts of <b>bio-power,</b> bio-politics of the population and anatomo-politics of the human body. The thesis pursued is that health education represents a singular contribution to the exercise of <b>bio-power</b> through the health system. Its involvement with prevention and promotion of health, as well as its educational character, enhance the set of power techniques employed in the management of the individual and social body. The data presented are created by analysis of documents and surveys covering federal, state, and municipal levels of government in Brazil and also health centres. Interviews with policy-makers, health professionals, and users of the health system and the observation of two health centres as case studies are also sources of information. Health education policy contributes to expand the surveillance that the work of health professionals represents over any aspect of individual and community life. As a practice, health education can make use of prescriptive or participatory approaches to promote healthy life-styles. However, both of them discipline and normalize individuals and communities. This study also suggests in its conclusion that Foucault's concept of <b>bio-power</b> as power over life centred on the control of sex should be re-thought, focusing on health as the key element in the exercise of <b>bio-power...</b>|$|E
40|$|Another {{consequence}} of this development of <b>bio-power</b> was the growing importance assumed {{by the action of}} the norm {{at the expense of the}} juridical system of the law [...] . I do not mean to say that the law fades into the back-ground or that the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather that the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a continuum of apparatuses (medical, adminis-trative, and so on) whose functions are for the most part regulatory. A nor-malizing society is the historical outcome of a technology of power centred on life. (Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality Vol. 1, 1979 : 144) Foucault’s analysis leaves open two questions: first, if the juridical is an inappropriate category to use in interpreting <b>bio-power,</b> how do we make sense of all those ’instruments of the law ’ (codes, constitutions, laws, regulations) that have developed and expanded during the era of <b>bio-power?</b> Second, if the actions of norms replaces the juridical system of law as the code and language of power, what role remains for law?

40|$|International audienceThis article draws {{attention}} to the paradigmatic shift {{in the use of the}} concept of ‘life', which can be observed at the end of the nineteenth century. With Michel Foucault's notion of <b>bio-power</b> as a foil, the article aims firstly to discuss how influential aesthetic, biological and political concepts such as vitalism (Hans Driesch) and degeneration (Max Nordau) can be conceived as different reactions to Charles Darwin's in the light of <b>bio-power.</b> Even though both Driesch and Nordau use Darwin's theories to produce positive ideas about respectively the strong and healthy body and the strong and healthy society, it is important to note that they do not converge. Secondly, the article aims to discuss how a controversy between these concepts is given literary form in the Danish author Herman Bang's novel (1880), perceived as one of the first ‘decadent' works in Scandinavia. The reading demonstrates that Bang makes use of a rhetorical strategy of ambivalence in order to bring the concepts into productive play...|$|E
40|$|To address climate change, {{decreasing}} CO 2 emissions during electricity production, a {{major source}} of greenhouse gases, is necessary. One option is the co-utilization of nearly carbon-neutral biomass with fossil fuels at power plants, which has the added advantage of potentially achieving negative emissions if CO 2 capture is applied. The techno-economic feasibility of biomass usage along with fossil fuel or as a dedicated fuel for combustion and gasification-based power generation, with and without CO 2 capture in Australia is investigated. Sensitivity analyses are undertaken to evaluate jurisdictional variations in economic parameters on power plant economic viability. Simple analytical or graphical tools are also developed to evaluate the economic incentives required to make each <b>bio-power</b> technology viable. The results show that for biomass-coal co-firing, higher quality biomass is preferred as plant performance is not significantly affected. For biogas-natural gas co-firing, higher heating value biogas is preferred as it requires minimal modifications to plant equipment. The breakeven carbon price required to make each <b>bio-power</b> technology cost competitive with the same technology without biomass and/or capture ranges between 37 – 97 $/t CO 2. Including other incentives such as Renewable Energy Certificates, and low biomass to fossil fuel price can make <b>bio-power</b> technologies economically viable at low carbon prices. A multi-criteria analysis compares deployment opportunities for <b>bio-power</b> technologies based on the CO 2 emission reduction potential, cost of electricity, biomass consumption rate, electricity output, and technology maturity. Using biomass in auxiliary units to provide the energy for capture at existing coal plants and supplementary biomass firing in existing NGCC plants (with and without capture) are the highest-rank options. These options provide relatively low cost emission reduction, are technically mature, and can alleviate electricity output loss due to capture. Dedicated biomass plants (with and without capture) are the lowest-rank option due to the high cost of electricity, high biomass requirement, and significant output loss for capture. Currently, using low to medium levels of biomass in combustion-based plants is a feasible method to reduce CO 2 emissions. Deeper reductions could be achieved by increasing the R&D commitment for biomass conversion and CO 2 capture technologies, introducing policy incentives, and increasing biomass supply...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{develops}} a remark Foucault made in passing {{at the end}} of the first volume of The History of Sexuality (1976), linking the emergence of <b>bio-power</b> and the nineteenth-century sociological fascination with suicide. Foucault traced the origins of <b>bio-power</b> in his Collège de France courses of 1977 – 1978 and 1978 – 1979, but never returned to the relationship between the sociological appropriation of suicide and this uniquely modern form of power. Using the recently published lectures from these courses, this essay interprets two nineteenth-century sociological treatises on suicide as historical examples of the development of ‘governmentality. ’ The first text is a commentary on suicide from the Mémoires (1838) of Parisian police administrator Jacques Peuchet, which the young Marx translated and published in 1846. This proto-sociological text is interpreted as an early manifestation of governmentality, while the second text, Durkheim’s Le Suicide (1897), is presented as a classic of sociology and governmental rationality. Aside from the light it sheds on the historical relationship between sociology, governmentality, and suicide, this essay also illuminates some often-overlooked implications of the current ‘right to die ’ movement...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I am concernced with a Foucauldian {{analysis}} of neoliberal government {{and application of}} this concept in the Petr Nečas's government. The Foucauldian analysis of power is a constant critical process {{that is supposed to}} modify according to changing terms. Foucault argues that the core of the art of government is a conflict. He doesn't understand the modern history as a history of law and peace. From the Foucauldian point of view the modern history has always been the history of conflict of two races. The winnig race determines law and rules of the whole society. It means that law and freedom are tools of governance. The basis of Foucault's concept is a relationship between power, knowledge and subject. This relationship constitutes technologies of governance. Foucault talks about three techniques - pastoral power, disciplinary power and <b>bio-power.</b> The <b>bio-power</b> is especially in the modern age. The modern art of government uses knowledge of experts (statistics, analyses, reports) for conduct of conduct. The inidividuals are not only the recepients of effects of power, but also they are distributors of power. The identity of subjects is formed by family, teachers and co- workers and they are also formed by their milieu. The consequence of this process is mentality of a modern person. The [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} two goals. First this paper {{examines}} {{the historical and}} theoretical relationship between <b>bio-power</b> and drugs as a modern form of political power. Secondly, it describes how people in modern society are subjected to bio-political mechanisms {{in terms of public}} health. Three dominant types of drug discourses result from the analysis: crime, health, and commerce. As the modern bio-politics has taken hold and increased in its reach, the frequency of drug discourses in Presidential speeches has also increased. The data set includes 220 speeches from 1790 to 2007 collected from “The American Presidency Project. ” They were indexed using a text retrieval program called Word Cruncher 6. 0. Results conclude that drugs and crime discourse is the most prevalent followed by health and commodity. The modern era of drug use in 1968 split presented these discourses before and after. The use of bio politics as a mechanism is displayed through its connection of different discourses mentioned earlier in a table which I have completed and displays the year of the first presidential speech to the present. Different examples from the actual state of the union addresses are utilized to reflect the analysis. To also highlight the conclusion section of this analysis, it seems to be that the regulation of drug policies, concerning crime as well as utilizing the health sector, <b>bio-power</b> seems to be a force in the care, management, regulation and maintenance of the nation state’s population...|$|E

40|$|A process {{economic}} analysis of co-producing bioethanol and electricity (value prior to combustion) from mixed southern hardwood and southern yellow pine is presented. Bioethanol {{is produced by}} extracting carbohydrates from wood via autohydrolysis, membrane separation of byproducts, enzymatic hydrolysis of extracted oligomers and fermentation to ethanol. The residual solids after autohydrolysis are pressed and burned in a power boiler to generate steam and electricity. A base case scenario of biomass combustion to produce electricity {{is presented as a}} reference to understand the basics of <b>bio-power</b> generation economics. For the base case, minimum electricity revenue of $ 70 –$ 96 /MWh must be realized to achieve a 6 – 12 % internal rate of return. In the alternative co-production cases, the ethanol facility is treated as a separate business entity that purchases power and steam from the biomass power plant. Minimum ethanol revenue required to achieve a 12 % internal rate of return was estimated to be $ 0. 84 –$ 1. 05 /l for hardwood and $ 0. 74 –$ 0. 85 /l for softwood. Based on current market conditions and an assumed future ethanol selling price of $ 0. 65 /l, the co-production of cellulosic bioethanol and power does not produce financeable returns. A risk analysis indicates that there is a probability of 26. 6 % to achieve an internal rate of return equal or higher than 12 %. It is suggested that focus be placed on improving yield and reducing CAPEX before this technology can be applied commercially. This modeling approach is a robust method to evaluate economic feasibility of integrated production of <b>bio-power</b> and other products based on extracted hemicellulose...|$|E

It does this by contrasting it with an account that locates modern positive power in a set of early modern limiting mechanisms, mechanisms that actually produced the modern limited domain of the social, the principal object of sociology, initially only as a domain of respite from raging religious violence. On the back of this argument, the article also seeks to show that Foucault's account is politically problematic, in two ways: one, that it is rooted in a tradition of unengaged 'critique' and, two, that it is tied, albeit inadvertently, to totalitarianism...|$|E

The paper also suggests that field theory could be usefully deployed in future research to explore how wider global trends or social forces, such as neo-liberalism or <b>bio-power,</b> are refracted through the crime control field in different national jurisdictions.

40|$|Drawing on Michel Foucault’s <b>bio-power</b> lens, {{this paper}} argues that {{supervised}} injection sites are political and governmental spaces {{that have emerged}} from the harm reduction movement {{as an alternative to}} prohibitionist approaches to drug use. Within this movement, harm reduction as a “health” policy has emerged as the new truth discourse in which to justify supervised injection sites as the most appropriate technique to address urban drug problems. However, supervised injection sites do not actually function as a form of health care in the traditional sense of optimizing life and wellbeing. Drawing upon secondary and primary textual sources and using the creation of The Toronto Drug Strategy (2005) as my analytical focus I show how supervised injection sites operate new governmental and political spaces that naturalize drug use and the various modes of disadvantage that often go hand-in-hand with it. Rather than promoting health, such undertakings normalize the dying body outside the health promotion frame...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative account of two conceptualisations of pleasure. The first draws on Foucault's analysis of <b>bio-power.</b> The second {{provides a}} phenomenological account where pleasure {{is viewed as}} an aspect of our immediate consciousness. These conceptualizations are illuminated through an analysis of employees’ accounts of learning at work. Overall, the paper demonstrates how, in a Foucauldian analysis, pleasure disappears as it becomes a cipher for power whereas within the phenomenological account pleasure is foregrounded but power disappears. The concluding section focuses {{on the problems of}} both conceptualizations and explores whether we should simply accept that different analytical frameworks do different work for us or whether we should be more concerned at the losses, and gains, associated with theoretical choices. The conclusion further asks whether a concern to foreground pleasure in accounts of learning represents an antidote to the pessimism of much critical analysis or whether we should treat pleasure as a morally duplicitous category that encourages political apathy...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{why and how}} issues {{around the}} {{diffusion}} of GM technologies and products to developing countries have become so central to a debate which has shifted away from technical issues of cost-benefit optimisation {{in a context of}} uniform mass production and consumption in the North, to the moral case for GM crops to feed the hungry and aid ‘development’ in the South. Using comparison between agricultural biotechnology and the ‘Green Revolution’ as a cross cutting theme, the contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, by analysing biotechnology as a set of overlapping frames within a discursive formation, four frames are identified which summarise key challenges presented by biotechnology era. Secondly, the use of Foucault's concept of <b>bio-power</b> to synthesise key themes from the frame analysis illuminates the ‘revolutionary’ nature of the biotech revolution. Thirdly, the potential of actor-network theory to provide a tools for the empirical study of processes of (re) negotiation of nature/society relations in the context of agricultural biotechnology controversies is explored...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that genealogy (as it is elaborated and practised {{in the work}} of Foucault) is an exemplary form of critique. The stakes of this argument are established in the course of on intial response to critics of genealogy such as Habermas and Fraser (who claim that it involoves a performative contradiction) throght the distinguishing of legislative and exemplary forms or critique. The essay then goes on to to show how Foucault's central concern, namely, the relation of humanism and <b>bio-power,</b> leads him to articulate an ethics of creativity which exhibits an ethods of ironic heroization and discloses a conception of the political as agon. Reflecting on these features of genealogy's saying, it is argued that the form of genealogical reflection manifests these features. This emphasis on the showing of genealogy leads to the claim that Foucault's anti-humanism, mode of historical consciousness and perspectivism reproduce the substantive commitment of genealogy to the value of autonomy within the structure of genealogical reflection...|$|E
