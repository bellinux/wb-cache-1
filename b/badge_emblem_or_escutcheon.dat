50|$|The term {{originated}} with {{the practice of}} replacing an automobile's emblems to create an ostensibly new model sold by a different maker. Changes may be confined to swapping <b>badges</b> and <b>emblems,</b> <b>or</b> may encompass minor styling differences, as with cosmetic differences to headlights, tail lights, front and rear fascias and outer body skins. More extreme examples involve differing engines and drivetrains. The term badge engineered {{does not apply to}} vehicles that share a common platform architecture but are uniquely designed so that they may look completely different from each other. This is achieved by not sharing visible parts, and maintaining a host of underlying parts specific to their respective applications.|$|R

2500|$|The {{change in}} policy also {{resulted}} in the reorganisation of the FRN as the Party of the Nation (June 21–2), {{under the leadership of}} Ion Gigurtu. The PN's character was significantly more fascist and totalitarian than the FRN had been, {{to the point where it}} has been described as a newly founded grouping. [...] Indeed, the decree announcing the PN's creation depicted it as a [...] "sole and totalitarian party", placed under the leadership of Carol (the party restated its goal as [...] "lead the moral and material life of the Romanian nation and state"). [...] A law passed during the same interval criminalized [...] "activities against the interests of the Party of the Nation", [...] "propaganda against the interests of the Party of the Nation", as well as [...] "publicly removing, destroying, deteriorating, out of contempt or derision, the Party of the Nation's <b>badges,</b> <b>emblems,</b> uniforms, manifestos <b>or</b> publications". [...] However, the FRN had been taking on a more fascist character for a time before then; as early as 1939, ministers greeted Carol with a fascist-style salute.|$|R
5000|$|A clan badge, {{sometimes}} called a plant badge, is a <b>badge</b> <b>or</b> <b>emblem,</b> usually a sprig {{of a specific}} plant, {{that is used to}} identify a member of a particular Scottish clan. They are usually worn in a bonnet behind the Scottish crest badge, or attached at the shoulder of a lady's tartan sash. According to popular lore clan badges were used by Scottish clans as a means of identification in battle. An authentic example of plants being used in this way (though not by a clan) were the sprigs of oats used by troops under the command of Montrose during the sack of Aberdeen. Similar items are known to have been used by military forces in Scotland, like paper, or the [...] "White Cockade" [...] (a bunch of white ribbon) of the Jacobites.|$|R
