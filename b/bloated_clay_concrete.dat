So, not the primary problem of reinforcement corrosion in heavy-weight concrete under the normal conditions and the correct protective layer, becomes in the major problem in expanded <b>clay</b> <b>concrete.</b> The issue of reinforcement corrosion in expanded <b>clay</b> <b>concrete</b> is considered in this article. The studies on the effect of different compositions on the corrosiveness were conducted. Researchers have proposed various options for expanded <b>clay</b> <b>concrete</b> reinforcement protection from the environmental impact, including those through a variety of chemically active additives. According to the data obtained by experimenting, the diagrams of corroded area size dependence on various factors were presented. The results of the studies conducted are the recommended design and technological measures for the reinforcement protection against corrosion in various fine aggregate-based (natural sand, ash and dry hydroremoval) light-weight expanded <b>clay</b> <b>concrete.</b> Thus, the minimum concrete protective cover for main and distribution reinforcement of external walls must be at least 25 mm. It is necessary to inject additives – reinforcement corrosion inhibitors (sodium nitrite, sodium tetraborate) to the concrete composition. The consumption of cement, and hence, the cement paste content of concrete mixture must be not lower than 220 kg/m 3, and under the application of the active dry fly ash removal − 200 kg/m 3...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{two methods}} {{consisting}} of triaxial water permeability and water penetration {{were used to}} evaluate changes occurring in the pores of <b>clay</b> <b>concretes,</b> during the tests. Triaxial permeability is generally used for concrete with higher permeability while concrete with very low permeability are suited for the penetration method. <b>Clay</b> <b>concrete</b> specimens of 0 to 40 % clay content {{were used in the}} study. The concrete mixes had water-to-cementitious ratios (w/cc) of 0. 70, 0. 75, 0. 80, 0. 85, and the cementitious content 380 and 450 Kg/m 3. Results show that concrete gains moisture during wetting at a much faster rate than it loses during subsequent drying. This could be explained by the contribution of suction pressure created upon drying. When water penetration pressure is applied, more water is driven into pore space than could be responsible for changing the network of the voids. Pore structure during drying may certainly be different in size and shape than its form during wetting, leading to a consequent effect on the permeability of the <b>clay</b> <b>concretes.</b> The modification could be one reason that the moisture gain percentage in <b>clay</b> <b>concretes</b> was higher than in normal concretes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} using a formwork {{system based}} on cement bonded particle boards (CBPB) filled with coarse pore expanded <b>clay</b> <b>concrete</b> {{in order to improve}} the technical efficiency of the building envelope.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the soil-structure interface {{is crucial}} to the design of a pile foundation. Radial unloading occurs during the process of hole boring and concrete curing, which will affect the load transfer rule of the pile-soil interface. Through large shear tests on the interface between <b>clay</b> and <b>concrete,</b> it can be concluded that the normal stress history significantly influences the shear behaviour of the interface. The numerical simulation of the bored shaft-soil interaction problem requires proper modelling of the interface. By taking the energy accumulated on the interface as a hardening parameter and viewing the shearing process of the interface as the process of the energy dissipated to do work, considering the influence of the normal stress history on the shearing rigidity, a mechanical model of the interface between <b>clay</b> and <b>concrete</b> is proposed. The methods to define the model parameters are also introduced. The model is based on a legible mathematical theory, and all its parameters have definite physical meaning.

The present report documents the large-scale plans for an approved plant located in Marbach am Neckar designed for the economical and environmentally-sound disposal of 45. 000 m" 3 of dredged material per year from the River Neckar. The dredged sediment from the Neckar will be taken to the plant by ship, temporarily stored in large basins, fractionated, mechanically dewatered and then processed into a light-weight aggregate according to DIN 4226 by being heated to over 1100 C in a rotary cylindrical kiln. The bulk density of the aggregate is approx. 500 kg/m" 3. A multi-level flue gas purification system is connected to the kiln ensuring that the emissions remain considerably below the legally required limits. In this way the process guarantees the optimal disposal of the harmful organic substances in the sediment and mud, and the highly stable bonding of the non-volatile heavy metals. (orig.)
