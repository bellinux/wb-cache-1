25|$|A <b>buffer</b> <b>strip</b> {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation that helps to control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. Buffer strips trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of wind erosion and stabilize stream banks providing protection against substantial erosion and landslides. Farmers can also use buffer strips to square up existing crop fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.|$|E

2500|$|Contour {{buffer strips}} are strips of {{perennial}} vegetation alternated with wider cultivated strips of cropland. This type of <b>buffer</b> <b>strip</b> {{is most effective}} when runoff water enters uniformly as sheetflow. They are very adapted to trapping pesticides and reducing rill erosion.

40|$|Water {{pollution}} from nonpoint sources is increasingly {{a focal point}} for efforts to reduce water quality impairments. These efforts often require or subsidize riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>strips.</b> However, the costs of these <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> are not always well understood. This article estimates the annualized costs of establishing and maintaining 45. 7 -meter (150 -feet) ri-parian <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> on all agricultural land adjoining a waterway in Tennessee’s Harpeth River watershed. A mandatory requirement for <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> of this width would result in 4, 955 hectares (12, 245 acres) of <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> at an annualized cost of $ 1. 3 million. A supply curve for <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> is also constructed. Since the passage of the Clean Water Act (CWA), largely unregulated non-point sources (NPS) of pollution have contributed to an increasing share of the nation’s water quality problems (Copeland). While the amount of agricul-tural land in the United States has remained relatively constant over the past thirty years, agricultural production has increased because of technological ad-vances and increasingly fertilizer-intensive agricultural practices. These fertilizer-intensive practices have been a major contributor to a threefold increase in the nitrate load in the Mississippi River entering the Gulf of Mexico (Greenhalgh and Sauer). When the states and territories surveyed the nation’s rivers and streams, they found 39 % of the segments surveyed impaired for one or more uses. Agri-culture was listed as a contributor to 48 % of these impairments—more than twice as much as any other source (USEPA 2002) ...|$|R
40|$|Grassed <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> (vegetated filter strips, filter strips, and grassed filters) are vegetated {{surfaces}} {{that are}} designed to treat sheet flow from adjacent surfaces. Filter strips function by slowing runoff velocities and allowing sediment and other pollutants to settle and by providing some infiltration into underlying soils. Filter strips were originally used as an agricultural treatment practice and have more recently evolved into an urban practice. With proper design and maintenance, filter strips can provide relatively high pollutant removal. In addition, the public views them as landscaped amenities and not as stormwater infrastructure. Consequently, there is little resistance to their use. Inspection/Maintenance Considerations Vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> require frequent landscape maintenance. In many cases, vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> initially require intense maintenance, but less maintenance is needed over time. In many cases, maintenance tasks can be completed by a landscaping contractor.

40|$|<b>Buffer</b> <b>strips</b> have {{recently}} become the main management practice for reducing logging impact on stream habitats in boreal and temperate regions. The habitat value of <b>buffer</b> <b>strips,</b> however, {{has not received}} much attention, although riparian forests belong to the systems with the highest biodiversity in these regions. We used plants as indicators of the ability of <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> to maintain an environment similar to intact riparian forests in a boreal forest landscape in northern Sweden. We measured the growth of three common bryophyte species (Hylocomiastrum umbratum, Calypogeia integristipula, and Tritomaria quinquedentata) transplanted to riparian habitat close to a stream in clear-cut logged sites 10 - 15 m wide <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> {{on each side of}} the stream, and intact (reference) sites. Each of the three site categories included six wet and six tnoist-mesic sites and the experiment was followed over three months in 1999. The species remained vital in the reference sites and grew substantially during the 3 -mo-long experiment, but in the logged sites almost no growth was registered, and many shoots died (except for T. qninquedentata). The pattern was consistent irrespective of the ground moisture class. The performance of bryophytes in the moist-mesic <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> was almost as bad as in the logged sites, whereas in the wet <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> it was either intermediate between that in logged and reference sites (H. umbratum) or very similar to that in reference sites (C. integristipula and T. quinquedentata). The edge effect has previously been shown to vary depending on edge orientation, edge physiognomy, and weather conditions. We found that ground moisture can be of major importance as well. Although many <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> function better than no strips, 20 - 30 m wide strips (with a stream in the middle) through a logged area consist entirely of edge habitat. Increasing the buffer width and avoiding clear-cut logging on both sides of a watercourse would be the first steps to take for improving biodiversity conservation in riparian habitats. Our results also show that bryophytes are good indicators of habitat quality and efficient tools for assessing the ecological function of <b>buffer</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R
40|$|Vegetative <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> {{are widely}} {{employed}} as a conservation measure to reduce fluxes of sediments and associated pollutants from overland flow in catchments. <b>Buffer</b> <b>strips</b> generally reduce sediment and pollutant loads {{through a combination of}} deposition and infiltration processes. A model has been developed by Griffith University researchers to predict sediment deposition in and around vegetative <b>buffer</b> <b>strips.</b> Unlike other models, the Griffith model is able to interactively measure the bed slope in every time step, calculate the new water profile and compute the sediment concentration dependent to the new profile in each time step. This linkage between hydrology and sedimentation parts of the model makes it unique in predicting the effectiveness of vegetated <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> on sediment retention and pollutant transport control. A series of runoff experiments were carried out in the flume of Griffith University rainfall simulator to quantify reduction in sediment and sorbed nutrients as a result of runoff passing through grass <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> and the collected data were used to test the model.

40|$|Effectiveness of {{vegetative}} <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> for herbicide retention from agricultural runoff {{was evaluated}} in a two-year natural rainfall study. A source area of 0. 41 ha (mainly Canisteo {{silty clay loam}} soil), having an average slope of 3 %, was fall chisel-plowed, spring disked, and planted to corn. Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine) were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative <b>buffer</b> <b>strips,</b> 1. 52 m wide ¥ 20. 12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15 : 1 and 30 : 1. Herbicide retention was dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions of the strips. These retentions ranged from 11 to 100 % for atrazine, 16 to 100 % for metolachlor, and 8 to 100 % for cyanazine. Herbicide retention by the <b>buffer</b> <b>strips</b> for the two treatments {{were not significantly different}} for the observed storm events.
