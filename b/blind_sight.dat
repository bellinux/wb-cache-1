50|$|He {{was born}} Giuseppe Pivato in Tezze sul Brenta, a town about 40 km north of Venice, Italy. His mother, Meri Sabucco, was from Udine in the Friuli region east of Venice. This Italian origin {{was to have}} a {{profound}} influence on his whole life and career as a writer, researcher and academic. The family emigrated to Toronto, Canada, in 1952 where the Catholic nuns changed his name to Joseph. He attended St. Michael's College School, an academic high school for boys, where he studied languages and literature. He enrolled at York University where he studied with modernist scholar, D.E.S. Maxwell, feminist and medievalist, Beryl Rowland, Canadian writer, Irving Layton, met French poet Hedi Bouraoui and poet-critic, Eli Mandel. With D.E.S. Maxwell he enrolled in the first course in African Literature (1969). In the summers he worked with Italian bricklayers to help pay for his university fees. In 1968 he founded and edited the first literary magazine at York, Voodoo Poetry at Vanier College. In 1970 he earned a B.A. (Combined Honours, English and French) from York and moved to Edmonton to study Comparative Literature at the University of Alberta. His 1971 M.A. thesis was on Dante and Baudelaire. Writer and academic E.D. Blodgett was his advisor for his Ph.D. thesis on hermetic poetry. He also met Canadian writers Henry Kreisel and Sheila Watson and began to work on Canadian authors publishing his first critical essay in Canadian Literature (1973, editor George Woodcock) while he was still a graduate student. At the end of his doctoral program (1977) he began to work at Athabasca University, a distance education institution modeled after the British Open University. At Athabasca he helped to develop the first courses in English literature, Canadian Literature, Comparative Literature and theory. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1986. He was founding president of the Association of Italian-Canadian Writers(1986) which advances the work of these ethnic minority authors through critical publications, biennial conferences, book launches and literary readings across Canada and in Italy. At Athabasca Pivato was Chair of the Centre for Language and Literature on three separate occasions and developed the first courses in creative writing. In 2010 he was founding professor of the new M.A. in Literary Studies {{which is part of the}} MA-IS program. He is married to Alberta psychologist, writer, academic and disabilities advocate Dr. Emma Pivato. Their children include Dr. Marcus J. Pivato, Prof. of Economics, University of Cergy-Potoise (Paris, France), and Juliana Pivato, Artist and Academic in Toronto. Emma Pivato's novels include <b>Blind</b> <b>Sight</b> Solution (Chicago: Cozy Cat Press, 2013) The Crooked Knife (2014) Roscoe's Revenge (2014) Jessie Knows (2015) Murder on Highway 2 (2016) and Deadly Care (2016). Since July, 2015, he has been Professor Emeritus at Athabasca University.|$|E

40|$|Although blind {{individuals}} {{must often}} rely on others to navigate their physical environment, recent studies concerning differences between <b>blind</b> and <b>sighted</b> persons in attributing social traits to others based on nonvisual cues remain inconclusive.

One hundred and twenty-four healthy men and women participated in the study, including 32 congenitally blind, 27 late <b>blind,</b> and 65 <b>sighted</b> adult controls. We measured levels of social trust represented by two independent convictions, that people are exploitative, or dishonest. Linear mixed models showed {{no significant differences between}} <b>sighted,</b> late <b>blind</b> and congenitally blind individuals, indicating that visual deprivation does not predict level of trust in others.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the production and perception of French vowels by <b>blind</b> and <b>sighted</b> speakers. 12 <b>blind</b> adults and 12 sighted adults served as subjects. The auditory-perceptual abilities of each subject were evaluated by discrimination tests (AXB). At the production level, ten repetitions of the ten French oral vowels were recorded. Formant values and fundamental frequency values were extracted from the acoustic signal. Measures of contrasts between vowel categories were computed and compared for each feature (height, place of articulation, roundedness) and group (<b>blind,</b> <b>sighted).</b> The results reveal a significant effect of group (<b>blind</b> vs <b>sighted)</b> on production, with sighted speakers producing vowels that are spaced further apart in the vowel space than those of blind speakers. A group effect emerged for a subset of the perceptual contrasts examined, with blind speakers having higher peak discrimination scores than sighted speakers. Results suggest an important role of visual input in determining speech goals...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time the {{equivalent}} of <b>Blind</b> <b>sight</b> has been demonstrated in the deaf This phenomenon of ' deaf hearing ' was observed in a proportion of profoundly deaf 18 - 22 year oIds. The implications for deaf education are discussed. Appreciating a confluence of factors including biology, the cultural construction of knowledge, and relations of power facilitates an understanding of how hearing society's impressions of the deaf affect their education. Deaf culture, although believed to be constructed by the deaf, may be sub served by hearing society's misconceptions of deaf capabilities. Deaf acceptance of their disability (possibly a form of complacency) {{in the form of a}} distinct culture, is justified in the literature as appropriate adaptation to illness. The present research suggests that those deaf educated with some oraVaural instruction, contra mainstream society's and Deaf culture's beliefs, are better adapted to meet their expressed needs, reaching higher educational standards in reading/comprehension versus those educated with sign language only. Anatomical considerations of subcortical processing in some deaf individuals may aid in providing insight concerning deaf capability. It is suggested that Deaf cultural postulates should come to include other 'natural ' communication and educational modalities, other than American Sign Language (ASL) alone. Multi-disciplinary considerations counter the position that anthropologists should be wary of causal analysis, and concentrate only on meaning and interpretation. il...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the influence of visual experience on word meaning representation in blind adults.

Results confirmed the literature about substantial similarity of the formal language features between <b>blind</b> and <b>sighted</b> subjects, whereas they evidenced significant differences in word meaning representation with respect to both the kind of sensorial experience and visual impairment degree. In particular, lower performances in colour name definition by <b>blind</b> vs <b>sighted</b> adults emerged and, among blind individuals, by congenitally blind and hypovisual subjects vs acquired blind; the latter performed in a way more similar to sighted subjects...|$|R

While the <b>blind</b> and <b>sighted</b> were equally capable of recalling an object's colour, the blind were more capable than the sighted at recalling its surface texture. The superior recall of surface texture by the blind emerged very gradually as an increasing percentage of their lifetime was spent without sight.
