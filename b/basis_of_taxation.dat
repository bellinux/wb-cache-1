In other words, the State in future will increasingly ask the taxpayer not only [...] "What have you got?" [...] but [...] "How did you get it?" [...] No one contends that such an analysis can be perfect; but, on the other hand, can a community desirous of realising what Goethe calls [...] "practical Christianity," [...] ignore it? And if in this process it enters the sphere of morals, as Ruskin long ago urged it to do, as well as the path of economic justice, is the step a wrong one? Has it not already been taken not only in this Budget, but in its predecessor, in which the Prime Minister made the memorable distinction between earned and unearned income? Those who answer these questions in the Liberal sense will find in these speeches a body of vigorous and persuasive reasoning on their side.|$|E
