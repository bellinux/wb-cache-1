2500|$|In 1655 Dutch diplomat William de Boreel {{tried to}} solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local {{magistrate}} in Middelburg follow up on Boreel's childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle maker named [...] "Hans" [...] who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father, Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered. Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, was adopted by Pierre Borel in his 1656 book De vero telescopii inventore. Discrepancies in Boreel's investigation and Zachariassen's testimony (including Zachariassen misrepresenting his date of birth and role in the invention) has led some historians to consider this claim dubious. The [...] "Janssen" [...] claim would continue over the years and be added on to with Zacharias Snijder in 1841 presenting 4 iron tubes with lenses in them claimed to be 1590 examples of Janssen's telescope and historian Cornelius De Waard's 1906 claim that the man who tried to sell a <b>broken</b> <b>telescope</b> to astronomer Simon Marius at the 1608 Frankfurt Book Fair must have been Janssen.|$|E
