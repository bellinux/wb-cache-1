40|$|This {{paper is}} related to other {{previous}} investigations carried out {{by one of the}} authors, on internal body image and on how anatomical knowledge is acquired during childhood and early adolescence (Amann Gainotti, 1988; Nenci, Di Prospero, Amann Gainotti, 1989). Those studies allowed the description of an approximate sequence of stages through which the internal body image is progressively build up. This process involves a steady increase of the representation of internal organs and genitalia or sex-related organs such as the penis,the uterus,the ovaries. During adulthood,contrary to previous periods,metaphorical/symbolical images of the <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> appear, and when an anatomical drawing is made,a schematic very simplified and partial image is the result. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the graphical behavior with relation to <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> in a group of adults, students of SSIS-Lazio (section Human Sciences). The group consisted of 30 students,divided into 14 males and 16 females. 80 % of the subjects have a degree in Philosophy,some of them have a degree in either Psychology or History,or a teachers'college training. Results show that the drawings are divided into two main categories :A) Anatomical type drawings N= 10 / 30 B) Metaphorical/symbolic drawings N= 20 / 30 Almost all males made <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> drawings of type B (13 / 14), while more females (9 / 16) interpreted <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> from an anatomical point of view.

40|$|Natural {{selection}} {{shapes the}} evolution of anti-predator defences, such as camouflage. It is currently contentious whether crypsis and disruptive coloration are alternative mechanisms of camouflage or whether they are interrelated anti-predator defences. Disruptively coloured prey is characterized by highly contrasting patterns to conceal the body shape, whereas cryptic prey minimizes the contrasts to background. Determining bird predation of artificial moths, we found that moths which were dissimilar from the background but sported disruptive patterns {{on the edge of}} their wings survived better in heterogeneous habitats than did moths with the same patterns inside of the wings and better than cryptic moths. Despite lower contrasts to background, crypsis did not provide fitness benefits over disruptive coloration on the body outline. We conclude that disruptive coloration on the edge camouflages its bearer independent of background matching. We suggest that this result is explainable because disruptive coloration is effective by exploiting predators' cognitive mechanisms of prey recognition and not their sensory mechanisms of signal detection. Relative to disruptive patterns on the body outline, disruptive markings on the <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> are less effective. Camouflage owing to disruptive coloration on the <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> is background-specific and is as effective as crypsis in heterogeneous habitats. Hence, we hypothesize that two proximate mechanisms explain the diversity of visual anti-predator defences. First, disruptive coloration on the body outline provides camouflage independent of the background. Second, background matching and disruptive coloration on the <b>body</b> <b>interior</b> provide camouflage, but their protection is background-specific...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Wisén met Assa and {{convinced}} him of transferring the <b>interior</b> <b>covering</b> division of Sommer-Allibert to Tarkett AG. In exchange, Wisén would secure Sommer-Allibert {{taking control of}} at least 50% of Tarkett AG shares from the stockholders. The two parts agreed on the deal and it was announced by June 1997. Sommer-Allibert secured over 60% of Tarkett AG (owned since then by Tarkett Sommer AG) in October of that year. The combined operation was listed on both the Paris (through Sommer-Allibert S.A.) and Frankfurt (through Tarkett AG) stock exchanges. Wisén continued managing Tarkett Sommer AG-Sommer-Allibert <b>interior</b> <b>coverings</b> business from Germany, but he was fired in 1998 and the control was passed to the French headquarters. In 2000, Sommer-Allibert divested its automotive division, selling it to Faurecia. Faurecia also acquired the remaining listed shares of Sommer-Allibert, which was delisted. In 2003, all company operations started to use the trading name Tarkett. In 2004, the company's Tarkett Sports division formed an alliance with the Canada-based synthetic turf manufacturer FieldTurf before taking control of it in 2005. In 2006, Tarkett AG was wholly acquired by Sommer-Allibert and also delisted from the stock exchange. In 2007, the investment firm KKR became co-owner together with the Deconinck family. In 2008, Sommer-Allibert renamed itself as Tarkett S.A.. In 2013, the company was relisted through an IPO, with KKR selling a 25% of its stake while the Deconincks kept over a half of the shares. In 2015, the headquarters were moved from Nanterre to the Tour Initiale in La Défense.|$|R
