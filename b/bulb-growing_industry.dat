40|$|As {{a part of}} the Dutch {{study on}} {{occupational}} exposure to pesticides in the <b>bulb-growing</b> <b>industry,</b> two subgroups consisting of 76 bulb-growers and 34 controls were examined neurologically and neurophysiologically for disorders of the central nervous system. Some minor clinical abnormalities were found in both groups but these were probably not related to the exposure. The frequency and severity of the clinical abnormalities found were similar in both groups. The visual evoked potential studies revealed also no differences between the groups. The EEGs of the bulbgrowers contained more fast cerebral activity (beta-activity) than those of the reference group. This difference was also slight but could be the result of chronic exposure to pesticides. As such it should be considered as an adverse effect until proven otherwise...|$|E
