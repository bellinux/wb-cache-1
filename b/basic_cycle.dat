The <b>basic</b> <b>cycle</b> time was 2.11ns, or 474MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP.

5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the <b>basic</b> <b>cycle</b> of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
25|$|As {{the form}} of fixed-hour prayer {{developed}} in the Christian monastic communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the <b>basic</b> <b>cycle</b> of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in monasteries.

For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, {{the form of}} the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as 'cathedral' and 'monastic' models).|$|E

25|$|The first {{commercial}} computer was the Ferranti Mark 1, built by Ferranti and {{delivered to the}} University of Manchester in February 1951. It {{was based on the}} Manchester Mark 1. The main improvements over the Manchester Mark 1 were {{in the size of the}} primary storage (using random access Williams tubes), secondary storage (using a magnetic drum), a faster multiplier, and additional instructions. The <b>basic</b> <b>cycle</b> time was 1.2 milliseconds, and a multiplication could be completed in about 2.16 milliseconds. The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine's 4,050 vacuum tubes (valves). A second machine was purchased by the University of Toronto, before the design was revised into the Mark 1 Star. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} to this <b>basic</b> <b>cycle</b> occur. In North America, the females of some species store sperm in their oviducts {{for at least}} eight months, and the males (all species of which undergo spermatogenesis during the summer) store sperm in the vas deferens {{for at least a}} year. Thus, species that store sperm for a shorter duration mate in the spring and store sperm in the vas deferens, while those that do so for a longer duration mate in the fall and store sperm in the oviduct over the winter, after which fertilization occurs the following spring. In addition, species that occur further north, where it is colder during much of the year and the feeding and growing season is short, may reproduce only every other year or less. Those found in central and southern Mexico or the tropics have reproductive cycles that correspond mostly with the rainy season.|$|E
25|$|The Brazilian {{medical schools}} follow the European {{model of a}} six-year curriculum, divided into three cycles of two years each. The first two years are called <b>basic</b> <b>cycle</b> (ciclo básico). During this time {{students}} are instructed in the basic sciences (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, immunology etc.) with activities integrated with the medical specialties, allowing the student {{an overview of the}} practical application of such content. After its completion, the students advance to the clinical cycle (ciclo clinico). At this stage contacts with patients intensify and work with tests and diagnostics, putting into practice what was learned in the first two years. The last two are called cycle internship (ciclo do internato). In this last step the students focus on clinical practice, through training in teaching hospitals and clinics. The teaching of this last step respecting an axis of increasing complexity, enabling students to make decisions and participate effectively in form and operative care under the direct supervision of faculty and qualified to act as teaching aids physicians. The performance of the internal develops redemption of ethical and humanistic dimensions of care, causing the student to recognize the values and principles that guide the physician-patient relationship.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to transferring isochronous data during each <b>basic</b> <b>cycle,</b> some nodes are {{also able to}} share transfer slots for better bandwidth utilization.

Therefore, less important yet still time-critical data can be transferred in longer cycles than the <b>basic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Assigning the slots during each cycle is at the discretion of the Managing Node.|$|E
