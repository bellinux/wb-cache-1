5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b> Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, the Commodore 64 {{was used}} to run {{bulletin}} board systems using software packages such as Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought by America Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b> Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994.

500|$|While, by contract, Richard Donner {{had major}} {{editorial}} {{control over what}} was theatrically released, the Salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters. [...] This {{was the result of}} deals that had been made between the producers and the ABC television network prior to the film's release. [...] Financially, the more footage that was restored for television, the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast (the producers charged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> for every bit of footage added back in). [...] During production of the film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind had been relegated to having to sell more and more of their rights back to Warner Bros. in exchange for financial help, which is why Warner Bros. would have theatrical and home video distribution rights. [...] So by 1981 when the television rights reverted to the Salkinds, the producers prepared a 3-hour and 8-minute version for worldwide television reincorporating some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut, and specially prepared so that networks and stations can re-edit their own version at their discretion. This edit is commonly known as the [...] "Salkind International Television Cut". [...] All subsequent network television cuts were derived from this version.|$|E

2500|$|Wood heat {{continues}} {{to be used in}} areas where firewood is abundant. [...] For serious attempts at heating, rather than mere ambience (open fireplaces), stoves, fireplace inserts, and furnaces are most commonly used today. [...] In rural, forested parts of the U.S., freestanding boilers are increasingly common. [...] They are installed outdoors, some distance from the house, and connected to a heat exchanger in the house using underground piping. [...] The mess of wood, bark, smoke, and ashes is kept outside and the risk of fire is reduced. [...] The boilers are large enough to hold a fire all night, and can burn larger pieces of wood, so that less cutting and splitting is required. [...] There is no need to retrofit a chimney in the house. [...] However, outdoor wood boilers emit more wood smoke and associated pollutants than other wood-burning appliances. [...] This is due to design characteristics such as the water-filled jacket surrounding the firebox, which acts to cool the fire and leads to incomplete combustion. [...] Outdoor wood boilers also typically have short stack heights in comparison to other wood-burning appliances, contributing to ambient levels of particulates at ground level. [...] An alternative that is increasing in popularity are wood gasification boilers, which burn wood at very high efficiencies (85-91%) and can be placed indoors or in an outbuilding. There are plenty of ways to process wood fuel and the inventions today are maximizing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E

Admitting, then, that their fragments are proved, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> correspondences of their arrangement, to be still in their original positions, they indicate to us a form, whether of palace or dwelling-house, in which there were, universally, central galleries, or loggias, opening into apartments on each wing, the amount of light admitted being immense; and the general proportions of the building, slender, light, and graceful in the utmost degree, it being in fact little more than an aggregate of shafts and arches. Of the interior disposition of these palaces there is in no instance the slightest trace left, nor am I well enough acquainted with the existing architecture of the East to risk any conjecture on this subject.

Examples are given to show how the outlining is performed, and others in which the outlines alone are taken into consideration. The cores of the patterns are also characteristic, and are described separately. It is they alone that have attracted the notice of previous inquirers. The outlines fall for the most part into nine distinct genera, defined by the relative directions of the divergent ridges that enclose them. The upper pair (those that run towards the finger-tip) may unite, or one or other of them may surmount the other, thus making three possibilities. There are three similar possibilities in respect to the lower pair; so, as any one of the first group may be combined with any one of the second, there are 3 × 3, or nine possibilities in all. The practice of somewhat rolling the finger when printing from it, is necessary in order to impress enough of its surface to ensure that the points at which the boundaries of the pattern begin to diverge, shall be always included.|$|E
