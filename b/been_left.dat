5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|A Sinclair Executive {{purchased}} by a Russian diplomat exploded in his breast pocket, allegedly {{leading to an}} official Soviet investigation.

5|$|A large Tesco {{supermarket}} {{was constructed}} {{on the outskirts}} of Chatteris at a cost of £22 million. It was due to be opened in November 2014, but has <b>been</b> <b>left</b> unopened and empty following the company's decision to halt the opening of 49 out-of-town supermarkets following poor financial results. As of April 2016, Tesco are looking for another retailer to take over the store, which remains mothballed.|$|E
40|$|Let G be a {{group and}} H be a {{subgroup}} of G. We say that H <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in G if the left G-set G/H {{has at least one}} G-invariant order; when G <b>is</b> <b>left</b> orderable, this holds if and only if H is convex in G under some left ordering of G. We give a criterion for H to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in G that generalizes a famous theorem of Burns and Hale and has essentially the same proof. We show that all maximal cyclic subgroups <b>are</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in free groups, in right-angled Artin groups, and in surface groups that are not the Klein-bottle group. The free-group case extends a result of Duncan and Howie. We show that if G <b>is</b> <b>left</b> orderable, then each free factor of G <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in G. More generally, for any graph of groups, if each edge group <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in each of its vertex groups, then each vertex group <b>is</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex in the fundamental group; this generalizes a result of Chiswell. We show that all maximal cyclic subgroups in locally residually torsion-free nilpotent groups <b>are</b> <b>left</b> relatively convex...|$|R

5|$|Almost all the shrines are nondescript small {{rectangular}} buildings {{without any}} ornamentation. There is no representative of deities adorning {{the outside of}} the buildings. This is in contrast to any other Hindu temple in Sri Lanka or India. Almost all shrines are built of stone except that one dedicated to Valli which shows timber construction. They have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany.

5|$|In 1912 a hoard of 24 late Bronze Age {{weapons and}} tools was {{discovered}} during construction {{work at the}} Llyn Fawr reservoir, at {{the source of the}} Rhondda Fawr. The items did not originate from the Rhondda and are thought to have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> at the site as a votive offering. Of particular interest were fragments of an iron sword which is the earliest iron object to be found in Wales and the only 'C-type' Hallstatt sword recorded in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> where they can eat them.|$|E

An {{additional}} three Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF, the first to operate this aircraft, joined them the following day. The Beauforts were tasked with providing additional support against further landings and undertaking anti-shipping missions. On 6 September, the Allied offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force, fighting a number of minor actions against small groups that had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> behind after the evacuation.|$|E
