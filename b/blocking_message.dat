In this paper, we showhowtouseageneric static total and causal ordering multicast protocol to design a VSC service that guarantees totally and causally ordered message delivery without the need for <b>blocking</b> <b>message</b> delivery during view change operations.

40|$|Abstract. Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANET) comprise mobile hosts in {{a network}} bereft of base stations and characterized by a highly dynamic network topology. The MANET environment contains unpredictable obstacles, such as mountains, lakes, buildings, or regions without any hosts, impeding or <b>blocking</b> <b>message</b> relay. This study proposes geocasting protocols for sending short message from a source host to single or multiple geocasting regions in ad hoc networks. The proposed protocols keep messages away from unpredictable obstacles and create a small flooding region. Experimental results show that a source host can send a short message to all hosts located in single or multiple geographical areas with a high success rate and low flooding overhead...|$|E
30|$|The {{functionality}} of {{the above}} message exchange mechanism resembles the functionality of a UNIX pipe: Message receiving is blocking for the receiver end, whereas the sender module posts something to the channel and proceeds instantly. In some cases, though, <b>blocking</b> <b>message</b> transmissions may be desired. For example, {{take the case of}} two modules negotiating about a value, e.g., a randomly generated password assigned to the root account of the Database Server. Assume that module (1) (the Application Server) decides on the value and sends it to module (2) (the Database Server). Module (1) must ensure that the password is set, prior to trying to connect to the database. To this end, (2) can send an acknowledgment as depicted between points B and B′. In this context, the message exchange protocol can also function as a synchronization mechanism. This scheme represents a dependency graph between the application’s modules, since each incoming horizontal edge (e.g., the one entering at point A’) declares that the execution of a configuration script depends on the correct execution of another.|$|E

30|$|If the SAV {{collecting}} module of all-in-one device 5 is failed, as a result, the Bus 2 {{differential protection}} {{will not be}} able to continue to play a proper role. Meanwhile, the adjacent devices (devices 4 and 6) cannot form a closed loop without device 5, as shown in Fig.  3. Under this circumstance, the strategy to overwriting superior breaker b 8 by VLAN network would be a proper choice. It should be noted that the more sensitive overcurrent protection of b 9 and b 10 is used to overwrite b 8. Moreover, the cooperation of b 8, b 11, b 12, and b 13 should be synthetically considered. Firstly, the corresponding device sends a <b>blocking</b> <b>message</b> to the b 8 as long as an overcurrent is detected by b 11, b 12, or b 13, delaying 0.5 s. Secondly, if b 11, b 12 or b 13 did not detect an overcurrent and zone I protection of b 8 act, it should remove all the breakers that connected to the bus immediately; if zone I overcurrent protection of b 8 did not act and zone II, III act, b 9 and b 10 should be disconnected.|$|E

40|$|A formal {{definition}} of strong virtual synchrony, capturing the semantics of virtual synchrony as implemented in Horus, is presented. This definition has the nice property that every message is delivered within the view {{in which it}} was sent. However, it is shown that in order to implement strong virtual synchrony, the application program has to <b>block</b> <b>messages</b> during view changes. An alternative definition, called weak virtual synchrony, which can be implemented without <b>blocking</b> <b>messages,</b> is then presented. This de nition still guarantees that messages will be delivered within the view in which they were sent, only that it uses a slightly weaker notion of what the view in which a message was sent is. An implementation of weak virtual synchrony that does not <b>block</b> <b>messages</b> during view changes is developed, and it is shown how to use a system that provides weak virtual synchrony even when strong virtual synchrony is actually needed. To capture additional ordering requirements, the {{definition of}} ordered virtual synchrony is presented. Finally, it is discussed how to extend the definitions in order to cope with the fact that a process can become a member of more than one group...|$|R
30|$|The basic {{framework}} of proposed IDS is introduced as follow. In the beginning, the IDS nodes execute the ABM {{function in a}} sniff mode. According to the irregular difference between the routing information transmitted from a dubious node, a value of the suspicious node can be estimated by ABM. If the value exceeds the predefined threshold value, it {{can be regarded as}} a black hole. When a normal node receives a <b>Block</b> <b>message</b> broadcasted by the IDS node, this node adds the malicious node which stored in the <b>Block</b> <b>message</b> into the <b>Block</b> table. After that, the normal node forwards RREP packet to establish the routing. If the RREP packet is acquired from its neighbor node which noted in the Block table, the normal node drops this RREP packet to prevent the malicious attack.|$|R
