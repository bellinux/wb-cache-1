5|$|White's Natural History {{was at once}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics and the public, and continued to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> by a diverse range of nineteenth and twentieth century literary figures including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, Charles Darwin, John Ruskin, Virginia Woolf, and W. H. Auden. His work {{has been seen as}} an early contribution to ecology and in particular to phenology. The book has been enjoyed for its charm and apparent simplicity, and the way that it creates a vision of pre-industrial England.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of England private castles were being built by newly emerging, wealthy families; like the work at Windsor, these castles drew on the {{architectural}} themes of earlier martial designs, but were not intended to form a serious defence against attack. These new castles were heavily influenced by French designs, involving a rectangular or semi-rectangular castle with corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls effectively enclosing a comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor. Bodiam Castle built in the 1380s possessed a moat, towers and gunports but, rather than being a genuine military fortification, the castle was primarily intended to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> by visitors and used as a luxurious dwelling – the chivalric architecture implicitly invoking comparisons with Edward I's great castle at Beaumaris.|$|E

An imitator is or strives to <b>be</b> what he <b>admires,</b> and an admirer keeps himself personally detached, consciously or unconsciously does not discover that what <b>is</b> <b>admired</b> involves a claim upon him, to be or at least to strive to <b>be</b> what <b>is</b> <b>admired.</b> Søren Kierkegaard ...|$|R

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the castle's north-, east- and south-wing had to be demolished due to their state of disrepair.

25|$|The Spanish city of Seville {{became the}} major {{centre of the}} Hispano-Moresque tile industry. The {{earliest}} azulejos in the 13th century were alicatados (panels of tile-mosaic). Tiles were glazed in a single colour, cut into geometric shapes, and assembled to form geometric patterns. Many examples can <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> in the Alhambra of Granada. The old techniques of cuerda seca ('dry string') and cuenca developed in Seville in the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|Potters from Italy {{came into}} Seville {{in the early}} 16th century and {{established}} workshops there. They brought with them the maiolica techniques which allowed the artists to represent a much larger number of figurative themes in their compositions. The first Italian potter to move into Spain was Francisco Niculoso who settled in Seville in 1498. Examples of his work can still <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> in situ in the Alcazar of Seville. Under {{the influence of the}} Renaissance style introduced by Italians artists, most azulejos were polychrome tile panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes, scenes from the lives of saints or the Bible, or hunting scenes. Mannerism and the grotesque style, with its bizarre representations, had much influence on azulejos.|$|E

25|$|Bland had {{established}} the League of the Empire, devoted to bringing all the units of Overseas Great Britain into touch, mainly by the observance of Empire day in schools, at Malacca. Upon its inauguration there a Chinese Malaccan Ong Kim Wee founded a fund {{to provide an}} annual prize on Empire Day, to be competed for by the English-speaking boys of Malacca. The $600 he gave to this, would produce about $40 a year {{to be used for}} the purchase of prizes that the elder boys could compete for. A newspaper reporting on that in September 19006, also noted that Bland, unlike the heads of government at the other two Settlements was not someone to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> from a distance but had personal relationships with many of the local community who view him as their head.|$|E
25|$|The Polish {{nobility of}} the Commonwealth had become {{excessively}} dominant, and its primary {{aim was to}} remain in power. The lower and middle classes were often exploited and heavily taxed by wealthy or influential families of that era. This created a sense of fear among citizens of towns and villages that were privately owned by nobles. Sigismund, as the Head of State, always sought to restrict the privileges of the upper classes and decrease the nobility's influence over the parliament in order to personally gain control. This caused disdain for the monarch and many rebellions occurred during his reign. These revolts, however, were all crushed by Sigismund and the nobles eventually surrendered, having achieved little. Furthermore, one of Sigismund's desires was to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> and idolized by his subjects; the unsuccessful rebellions were significant in strengthening his influence over {{the people and the}} country's politics. The Sejm (parliament), however, still was directly responsible {{for the majority of the}} Commonwealth's affairs, most notably declaring wars and suing for peace.|$|E
25|$|Fulgentius’s work {{is said to}} {{mark the}} {{transition}} from late-antique to Medieval literary study. After a period of decreased interest in the literature, the practice of mythography was picked up again in what {{is thought to be}} the 7th century by the so-called Vatican Mythographers. All three writers borrow Fulgentius’s methods in order to search the classical myths for obscured meaning. However, it was during the Carolingian period, from the 8th through to the 10th centuries, that Fulgentius’s work reached the height of its popularity. He came to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> as one of the founding fathers of mythographic writing, and he was praised for uniting classical pagan literature and Christian teachings. This admiration led to the emergence of Fulgentian scholarship. The practice of differentiating between the author’s intention and the deeper meaning of a piece of literature -- carried to the extreme by Fulgentius -- provided the framework for the commentaries of this period. The Mythologies in particular proved to be an essential storehouse of resources for the Medieval commentators who carried on his tradition of discussing classical poetry in moral terms. Further, his exotic language and use of rare words seemed to influence the writing style of a number of poets throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule in 1970 dismissed complaints made at {{the time}} of issuance that the Indian was too thin: [...] "the Indian is far from emaciated, and the coins show more imagination and daring of design than almost any other issue in American history. [...] Pratt deserves to <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> for his medals and coins." [...] Vermeule suggests that Pratt's design [...] "marked a transition, in the 'emaciated' Indian at least, to naturalism".|$|E
500|$|A poem...which, like Sigurd, reflects, with hard, uncompromising realism, an {{obsolete}} code of ethics, and a barbarous {{condition of}} society, finds itself irreconcilably at discord {{with the key}} of nineteenth-century feeling. [...] Deprived of its strongest claim to interest, a sympathetic response in the moral and religious sentiment of its readers, it can only appeal to the intellect {{as a work of}} art, or as a more or less successful attempt at antiquarian restoration. [...] It may <b>be</b> <b>admired</b> and applauded by the lettered few; but it will not be taken to the nation's heart.|$|E
500|$|During Late Antiquity, a pseudonymous {{document}} {{known as}} the Decretum Gelasianumwhich {{for a long time}} was believed to have been issued by Pope Gelasius I (who held the papacy from AD 492–496)declared De laudibus Christi to be apocryphal and a [...] "reprehensible work of poetry". However, almost a century later, Archbishop Isidore of Seville (AD 560–636) called Proba the [...] "only woman to be ranked among the men of the church" [...] (Proba ... femina inter viros ecclesiasticos ... posita sola). In regards to Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi, Isidore wrote that [...] "it is not the work which should <b>be</b> <b>admired,</b> but [...] ingenuity" [...] in compiling the poem (Cuius quidem non miramur studium sed laudamus ingenium).|$|E
