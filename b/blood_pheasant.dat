5000|$|The name Tetraophasis is a {{combination}} of the genus name Tetrao (the name Carl Linnaeus gave grouse in 1758), and the modern Latin word phasis, meaning [...] "pheasant". Monal-partridge are close relatives of monals and more distantly related to tragopan. They are boreal adapted species of high altitudes. Like monals they dig in alpine biomes for tubers, rhizomes and invertebrates as well as rodent pups and voles. Monal-partridges are important prey species for raptors, owls and yellow-throated martens. Like monals, monal-partridges are strictly monogamous. The female incubates the eggs until the last 48 hours when the male may take over night time nest brooding. This is a habit documented in <b>blood</b> <b>pheasants,</b> tragopans and monals. Both sexes rear the chicks, which are not fully mature until their second year. Unlike monals the sexes do not separate during winter. Monal-partridges are strong fliers. They evidently compete with koklass as the two are rarely to be heard or seen in the same valleys.|$|R

50|$|This {{partridge}} appears grey {{above and}} chestnut below with bright red bill {{and legs and}} the upperparts finely barred in black and white. In flight the pattern of dark brown primaries and secondaries with a narrow trailing white margin make them somewhat like the much larger Tibetan snowcock. The 14-feathered tail is dark and barred in white. There is variation in the shade and some birds have a nearly black crown. The primaries and secondaries are brown and the breast is deep chestnut. The abdomen has more white and the lower flanks and feathers around the vent are barred brown and white. The under-tail coverts are chestnut with black shaft streaks and white tips. Young birds have the lower parts mottled and the barring less distinct. The tarsus is feathered {{on the front of}} the leg half-way to the toes. It measures 38-40 cm in length. Females weigh 450-580 g; males, 550-700 g. Sexes are similar in plumage, female lacks spurs on the tarsus while the male has a blunt spur and sometimes a second incipient spur. Downy chicks have a resemblance to the chicks of the <b>blood</b> <b>pheasant.</b> Chicks are born with the tarsi feathered and the nostril opening is covered by feathers.|$|E
