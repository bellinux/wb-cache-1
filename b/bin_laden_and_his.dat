5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E

25|$|According {{to one of}} his wives, Bin Laden was {{reunited with}} his family for first time after the 9/11 attacks {{in the second half of}} 2002 in Peshawar, the capital city of the Tribal Areas, where they lived for five months in another safe house. After this, in September 2002, Bin Laden took his family into the rural {{mountain}} areas of northwest Pakistan (and very notably, not in the tribal belt where main US attention was focused.) First they stayed in the Shangla district in the Swat valley, where they stayed in two safe houses for eight to nine months. In May 2003, <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family moved to Haripur, a small town close to Islamabad, where they stayed in a rented house for two years. In June 2005, <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family moved to Abbottabad.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2001, President Bush told a {{televised}} {{joint session of}} Congress and the American people that Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> al Qaeda network {{were responsible for the}} recent terrorist attacks on the United States. The refusal of the Taliban to comply resulted in the United States taking military action to achieve the president's demands, the action given the name Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the attacks, the US government responded militarily, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the US attacked, it offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).|$|E

500|$|In a September 20 speech, Bush {{condemned}} Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> organization Al-Qaeda, {{and issued}} an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to [...] "hand over the terrorists, or ... share in their fate".|$|E
500|$|In late 1998 {{or early}} 1999, bin Laden gave {{approval}} for Mohammed {{to go forward}} with organizing the plot. A series of meetings occurred in early 1999, involving Mohammed, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> deputy Mohammed Atef. Atef provided operational support for the plot, including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers. Bin Laden overruled Mohammed, rejecting some potential targets such as the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles because, [...] "there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation".|$|E

500|$|The {{material}} {{seized from}} the compound contained al-Qaeda's strategy for Afghanistan after America's {{withdrawal from the}} country in 2014 as well as thousands of electronic memos and missives that captured conversations between <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> deputies around the world. It showed that bin Laden stayed in touch with al-Qaeda's established affiliates and sought new alliances with groups such as Boko Haram from Nigeria. According to the material, he sought to reassert control over factions of loosely affiliated jihadists from Yemen to Somalia, as well as independent actors whom he believed had sullied al-Qaeda's reputation and muddied its central message. Bin Laden was worried at times about his personal security and was annoyed that his organization had not utilized the Arab Spring to improve its image. He acted, according to the Washington Post, {{on the one hand}} as [...] "chief executive fully engaged in the group's myriad crises, grappling with financial problems, recruitment, rebellious field managers and sudden staff vacancies resulting from the unrelenting U.S. drone campaign", {{and on the other hand}} as [...] "a hands-on manager who participated in the terrorist group's operational planning and strategic thinking while also giving orders and advice to field operatives scattered worldwide." [...] The material also described Osama bin Laden's relation with Ayman al-Zawahiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
500|$|ISI {{director}} Hamid Gul reportedly {{notified the}} Taliban {{of the missile}} strikes in advance; bin Laden, who survived the strikes, later claimed {{that he had been}} informed of them by Pakistanis. A bin Laden spokesman claimed that bin Laden and the Taliban had anticipated the strike and [...] "took precautionary measures" [...] after hearing of the evacuation of Americans from Pakistan. Other U.S. officials reject the tip-off theory, citing a lack of evidence and ISI casualties in the strike; Tenet later wrote in his memoirs that the CIA could not ascertain whether Bin Laden had been warned in advance. Steve Coll reports that the CIA heard after the attack that bin Laden had been at Zhawar Kili Al-Badr but had left some hours before the missiles hit. Bill Gertz writes that the earlier arrest of Mohammed Odeh on August 7, while he was traveling to meet with bin Laden, alerted bin Laden, who canceled the meeting; this meant the camps targeted by the cruise missiles were mainly empty the day of the U.S. strike. Lawrence Wright says the CIA intercepted a phone call indicating that bin Laden would be in Khost, but the al-Qaeda chief instead decided to go to Kabul. Other media reports indicate that the strike was delayed to maximize secrecy, thus missing bin Laden. Scheuer charges that while the U.S. had planned to target the complex's mosque during evening prayers to kill <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> associates, the White House allegedly delayed the strikes [...] "to avoid offending the Muslim world". Simon Reeve states that Pakistani intelligence had informed bin Laden that the U.S. was using his phone to track him, so he turned it off and cancelled the meeting at Khost.|$|E

To which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz responded, [...] "Well, I just don't understand why we are beginning by talking about this one man bin Laden." [...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz turned to him and said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not do all these things like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor.

2500|$|Now there's a {{weird thing}} going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens.

At that time, the United States also used massive military force against members of the armed forces of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
