25|$|The largest {{advantage}} for males in a polygynous mating {{system is the}} increased fitness and reproductive success of the lone male because he will father all the offspring. Being the sole male of a harem is highly advantageous for the male <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> much higher chance of his progeny surviving, which means he is passing on his genes to more individuals.|$|E

25|$|Much of Hitchcock's {{supposed}} {{dislike of}} actors has been exaggerated. Hitchcock {{simply did not}} tolerate the method approach, as he believed that actors should only concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. In a Sight & Sound interview, he stated that, 'the method actor is OK in the theatre <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> free space to move about. But {{when it comes to}} cutting the face and what he sees and so forth, there must be some discipline'. He often used the same actors in many of his films.|$|E

He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him {{to wake up and}} eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> long journey ahead of him.|$|E

25|$|From an {{evolutionary}} standpoint, the most predominant characteristic {{that is often}} found in polygynous mating systems is extreme sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism, or the difference in size or appearance between males and females, gives males an advantage in fights against each other to demonstrate dominance and win over harems. Sexual dimorphism can present in larger body size and canine size. Polygyny is beneficial in particular to the male <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> greater increase in fitness and reproductive success. This increase consequently reduces the genetic diversity of the community, often leading to increased inbreeding. However, polygyny is not a particularly beneficial mating system for females because their mate choice is limited to one male. Extra-pair copulations are a strategy used by females to avoid the sexual conflict caused by polygyny, allowing them access to better mate choice.|$|E
25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

500|$|Kogen {{commented that}} Lisa and Marge episodes [...] "tend {{to be the}} better episodes", {{because they are more}} {{thought-out}} and have more emotional depth to them. However, they are harder to write than other episodes because they are [...] "less jokey." [...] The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge's role with Homer, who tends to be funnier than Marge. Jean commented that <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> daughter, Homer–Lisa episodes are easier for him to write and he [...] "always want to work on them." [...] Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct, because [...] "the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [...] That was always interesting."

500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to let me do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> great sense of humor." ...|$|E
