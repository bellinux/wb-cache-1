500|$|The next day, Mulder visits Barry in the hospital. Agent Kazdin appears, {{revealing}} that metal implants {{were found in}} Barry's body and that tiny holes were found in his teeth, {{in the same manner}} he had described. Mulder gives one of the implants to Scully, who has it reviewed by a ballistics expert; they find a microscopic barcode imprinted on it. Later, at a supermarket, Scully swipes the implant across a checkout scanner, causing the machine to malfunction while displaying a strange serial number. At her house, Scully leaves a message on Mulder's voicemail, suggesting that Barry had been [...] "catalogued" [...] by the implant. <b>But</b> <b>just</b> <b>then,</b> Barry—having just escaped from the hospital—breaks in through Scully's window and kidnaps her.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{explained}} that when Jews recite the Shema, they recite the words, [...] "blessed be {{the name of}} God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever," [...] quietly between the words, [...] "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one," [...] from [...] and the words, [...] "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might," [...] from [...] {{for the reason that}} Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish expounded when he explained what happened in [...] That verse reports, [...] "And Jacob called to his sons, and said: ‘Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what will befall you in the end of days.'" [...] According to Rabbi Simeon, Jacob wished to reveal to his sons what would happen in the end of the days, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>then,</b> the Shechinah departed from him. So Jacob said that perhaps, Heaven forefend, he had fathered a son who was unworthy to hear the prophecy, just as Abraham had fathered Ishmael or Isaac had fathered Esau. But his sons answered him (in the words of [...] ), [...] "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One," [...] explaining that just as there was only One in Jacob's heart, so there was only One in their hearts. And Jacob replied, [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever." [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might recite [...] "Blessed be the name of God's glorious Kingdom for ever and ever" [...] aloud, but rejected that option, as Moses did not say those words in [...] The Rabbis considered that Jews might not recite those words at all, but rejected that option, as Jacob did say the words. So the Rabbis ruled that Jews should recite the words quietly. Rabbi Isaac taught that the School of Rabbi Ammi said that one can compare this practice to that of a princess who smelled a spicy pudding. If she revealed her desire for the pudding, she would suffer disgrace; but if she concealed her desire, she would suffer deprivation. So her servants brought her pudding secretly. Rabbi Abbahu taught that the Sages ruled that Jews should recite the words aloud, so as not to allow heretics to claim that Jews were adding improper words to the Shema. But in Nehardea, where there were no heretics so far, they recited the words quietly.|$|E
