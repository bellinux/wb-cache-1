5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these <b>beneficial</b> <b>bacteria</b> are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E

40|$|The root-to-root travel of the <b>beneficial</b> <b>bacterium</b> Azospirillum brasilense on {{wheat and}} soybean roots in agar, sand, and light-textured soil was monitored. We used a motile {{wild-type}} (Mot +) strain and a motility-deficient (Mot-) strain which {{was derived from}} the wild-type strain. The colonization levels of inoculated roots were similar for the two strains. Mot + cells moved from inoculated roots (either natural or artificial roots in agar, sand, or light-textured soil) to noninoculated roots, where they formed a band-type colonization composed of bacterial aggregates encircling a limited part of the root, regardless of the plant species. The Mot- strain did not move toward noninoculated roots of either plant species and usually stayed at the inoculation site and root tips. The effect of attractants and repellents was the primary factor governing the motility of Mot + cells in the presence of adequate water. We propose that interroot travel of A. brasilense is an essential preliminary step in the root-bacterium recognition mechanism. Bacterial motility might have a general role in getting Azospirillum cells to the site where firmer attachment favors colonization of the root system. Azospirillum travel toward plants is a nonspecific active process which is not directly dependent on nutrient deficiency but is a consequence of a nonspecific bacterial chemotaxis, influenced by the balance between attractants and possibly repellents leaked by the root. <b>Beneficial</b> rhizosphere <b>bacteria</b> of the genus Azospirillu...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Beneficial</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{also can}} {{contribute}} to the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal immune system.

[...] Basically, the butyrate induces the differentiation of Treg cells by enhancing histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the FOXP3 locus, thus regulating the T cells, resulting in the reduction of the inflammatory response and allergies.|$|E
2500|$|Most “fresh” cheeses, unlike aged cheeses {{held for}} weeks or months, are aged for only days. This is {{not enough time to}} change the pH of the cheese to kill any harmful {{bacteria}} that may have been in the (unpasteurized) milk {{at the beginning of the}} process. The use of raw milk has led to a number of instances of food-borne disease linked to cheese, especially unaged, “fresh” cheeses. Cases of tuberculosis, listeriosis, and other diseases linked to cheese made in Mexico have led to strong restrictions against bringing the same across the US border or along with air travelers entering US airports. The most problematic cheeses have been panela, asadero, queso blanco, and ranchero, as these are not aged and are often made with unpasteurized milk. In 2008, the Diario [...] de la Federacion published the Norma [...] Mexicana project, with one of its purposes being the better sanitary control of the cheeses produced in the country. One of its major provisions is the prohibition against cheeses made with raw milk. However, critics state pasteurization is not the only way to guard against food-borne illnesses, and the process kills <b>beneficial</b> <b>bacteria</b> that affect the cheeses’ taste and health benefits of the cheese with the loss of live culture and enzymes. This is especially true of aged cheeses.|$|E
2500|$|Pulque is a milky, foamy, {{alcoholic}} beverage native to central Mexico and made from fermented maguey sap, similar to tequila and mescal {{but with a}} much lower alcohol content, between 3 and 4%. The maguey plant flourishes in hot climates with little to no water, as the plant stores water very well, much like a cactus. The maguey grows slowly and the sap must be removed shortly before the plant flowers. Once the tapping begins, the plant produces [...] "about a half gallon [...] a day for three months." [...] With a tool {{that looks like a}} spoon and is called a tlaquiche, a worker known as a tlachiquero [...] "scrapes off the center of the plant to extract the liquid previously mentioned. He then collects it in a hollow bowl called an acocote, to then be placed in a container called an odre." [...] The containers used for the fermentation process are usually made from animal skins, often cow leather. Leather is popular because of its ability to thermoregulate; leather also provides the sap with necessary <b>beneficial</b> <b>bacteria</b> cultures that improve taste and consistency. Pulque naturally ferments in less than twenty-four hours. Because it will spoil quickly after this period, every step in the process must be taken in close sequence and physical proximity. The maguey plants, the production and distribution facilities, and the places to which the pulque is distributed must all be relatively close together geographically. The taste has been described as slightly sour. Pure pulque is often mixed with fruit juices and other foods to create different flavors.|$|E

Plants of white clover (Trifolium repens L. cultivar Huia) were grown from seeds with or without soil inoculation of the <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus subtilis GB 03 supplemented with 0, 50, 100 or 150 mM NaCl water into soil. Growth parameters, chlorophyll content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and osmotic potential were monitored during the growth cycle. Endogenous Na+ and K+ contents were determined at the time of harvest. White clover plants grown in GB 03 -inoculated soil were significantly larger than non-inoculated controls with respect to shoot height, root length, plant biomass, leaf area and chlorophyll content; leaf MDA content under saline condition and leaf osmotic potential under severe salinity condition (150 mM NaCl) were significantly decreased. Furthermore, GB 03 significantly decreased shoot and root Na+ accumulation and thereby improved K+/Na+ ratio when GB 03 -inoculated plants were grown under elevated salt conditions. The results indicate that soil inoculation with GB 03 promotes white clover growth under both non-saline and saline conditions by directly or indirectly regulating plant chlorophyll content, leaf osmotic potential, cell membrane integrity and ion accumulation...|$|R

We investigated such proteins in the <b>beneficial</b> <b>bacterium</b> Propionibacterium freudenreichii, consumed both in Swiss-type cheeses and probiotic preparations. P. freudenreichii genome was sequenced and annotated, the localization of the encoded proteins was predicted using SurfG+. A combination of 3 biochemical methods confirmed surface exposure of P. freudenreichii proteins: shedding, shaving and labelling. Shedding consisted in the extraction of cell-wall associated proteins using guanidine, followed by trypsinolysis of the extracted proteins. Shaving consisted in enzymatic hydrolysis of surface protruding proteins which were accessible to trypsin in situ on live bacteria. For labeling, an NHS-ester-cyanine was added to live bacteria in order to label surface proteins, prior to 2 -D electrophoresis and detection of fluorescent protein spots. For the 3 methods, the resulting tryptic peptides were identified by NanoLC-MS/MS on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer This combination of methods allowed identification of surface layer type-proteins, lipoproteins, proteins associated to the cell wall, to the membrane, or predicted to be secreted, as well as moonlighting proteins predicted to be cytoplasmic.
