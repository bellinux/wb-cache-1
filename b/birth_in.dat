40|$|Abstract Background The {{dramatic}} increase <b>in</b> multiple <b>births</b> {{is an important}} public health issue, since such births have elevated risks for adverse perinatal outcomes. Our objective was to explore the most recent temporal trends in rates of multiple <b>births</b> <b>in</b> Canada and the United States. Methods Live birth data from Canada (excluding Ontario) and the United States from 1991 - 2009 were used to calculate rates of twins, and triplet and higher-order multiples (triplet+). Temporal trends were assessed using tests for linear trend and absolute and relative changes in rates. Results Twin live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> the United States increased from 23. 1 in 1991 to 32. 2 per 1, 000 live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> 2004, remained stable between 2004 and 2007, and then increased slightly to an all-time high of 33. 2 per 1, 000 live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> 2009. In Canada, rates also increased from 20. 0 in 1991 to 28. 3 per 1, 000 live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> 2004, continued to increase modestly between 2004 and 2007, and rose {{to a high of}} 31. 4 per 1, 000 in 2009. Rates of triplet+ live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> the United States increased dramatically from 81. 4 in 1991 to 193. 5 per 100, 000 live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> 1998, remained stable between 1998 and 2003 and then decreased to 148. 9 per 100, 000 in 2007. The rate declined marginally in 2008, but then rose again in 2009 to 153. 5 per 100, 000. Rates of triplet+ live births were much lower in Canada, although the temporal pattern of change was similar. Conclusion The rate of twin live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> the United States and Canada continues to increase, though more modestly than during the 1990 s. Recent declines in rates of triplet+ live <b>births</b> <b>in</b> both countries have been followed by unstable trends. </p...|$|R

5|$|Knockout mice {{have been}} created for a kidney-cancer causing {{mutation}} of BHD; heterozygotes develop kidney cysts and tumors that lead to renal failure within three weeks of <b>birth.</b> <b>In</b> these mice, the mTOR pathway was inappropriately activated, indicating that the mouse homolog of FLCN plays a regulatory role in this pathway.

One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of <b>birth</b> <b>in</b> the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of <b>birth</b> <b>in</b> the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
