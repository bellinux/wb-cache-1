The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their <b>basic</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{insights}} from self-determination theory, we explored the dynamic relationship between intrinsic motivation and {{innovative work behaviour}} (IWB) over time. Specifically, we investigated how <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction influences IWB through its effect on intrinsic motivation and how IWB in turn affects <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction as measured the next day (i. e., a reciprocal relationship). The current study used a longitudinal design comprising a 6 -day period and relied on multi-source data from 76 students in industrial product design and electronic engineering who participated in an innovation boot camp. In general, results provided support for the mediating role of intrinsic motivation {{in the relationship between}} <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction and IWB, as well as the reciprocal relationship between <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction and IWB...|$|R

His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other <b>basic</b> <b>needs.</b> Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E

Data were obtained from a total of 203 academics who are employed in various universities of Turkey. In this research Work-Related <b>Basic</b> <b>Need</b> Satisfaction Scale and The Turkish Form of Utrecht Work Engagement Scale were utilized. The data were analysed through multiple regression and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient analysis methods. The findings revealed that the sub-dimensions of work-related <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction significantly predicted work engagement. Upper management should improve work conditions of their personnel, which are related with competency, autonomy, and relatedness needs of academics. This way, academic staff will have better efficiency in terms of work engagement, which will also result in higher work adaptation and participation...|$|R

The Special Transcaucasian Committee (known as OZAKOM) {{was set up in}} the South Caucasus by the Russian Provisional Government. In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper Hayastan (Armenia) in Tiflis. Vahan Totovents became the editor of this non-partisan, Ottoman Armenian-orientated newspaper. Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for <b>basic</b> <b>needs.</b> The provisional government decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil administration, with Armenians holding key positions. About 150,000 local Armenians began to rebuild devastated Turkish Armenia; however the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia.|$|E

While the forest has long provided for their <b>basic</b> <b>needs,</b> deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} potential {{risk factors of}} recurrent overeating by investigating relationships between <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction, emotional eating, dietary restraint, body mass index and recurrent overeating. University students and women who accessed overeating related websites (N = 321) completed the <b>Basic</b> <b>Need</b> Satisfaction Inventory, the emotional and restraint subscales of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, the oversnacking and binging subscales of the Yale Eating Patterns Questionnaire; and provided demographic information. The study supported Modeling and Role-Modeling theory, as <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction negatively correlated with emotional eating, and self-esteem and self-actualisation significantly predicted emotional eating. Analysis of an adaptation of the cognitive-behavioural model of bulimia nervosa showed that emotional eating mediated the relationship between both self-esteem and self-actualisation and recurrent overeating, and interestingly, dietary restraint {{was not related to}} other variables. It was concluded that intervention for binge eating should reflect the importance of psychological triggers rather than only behavioural cues...|$|R

Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to express <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition. Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information.|$|E
5|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} were finished during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed {{during the course of}} the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their <b>basic</b> <b>needs,</b> the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test a model drawn from the Modeling and Role- Modeling theory {{depicting}} relationships among psychosocial resources, perceived stress, and health for undereducated adults. A purposive sample of 171 adults enrolled at an urban adult education center completed several self-report measures: Modified Erikson Psychological Stage Inventory, <b>Basic</b> <b>Need</b> Satisfaction Inventory, Perceived Stress, and Positive Health Index. Based on a structural equation modeling analysis, psychosocial development and <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction had significant direct effects on health, with the expected positive signs. Psychosocial development had the strongest direct effect on health and also had a strong direct effect on <b>basic</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction and an indirect effect on health.

5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E
5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and each has a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to <b>basic</b> <b>needs,</b> and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary to subsidize <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E
