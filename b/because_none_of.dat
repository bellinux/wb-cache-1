5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> Gediminas' {{siblings}} {{had strong}} heirs, Gediminas {{and his children}} were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.|$|E
5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. <b>Because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E

5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies would look like a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale {{his choice}} of any {{property}} the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> Universal's other properties particularly interested him {{and he wanted to}} make something other than a war picture. While the novel itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to an unknown actor named Boris Karloff. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

Therefore, there are now 175 different room configurations in the historic tower.|$|R

25|$|In 1948 Penn State, in a {{bowl game}} {{for the first time}} in 25 years, played Dallas' SMU to a 13–13 tie. <b>Because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the Dallas hotels would provide {{accommodations}} for the two African-American members of the Penn State team, the Penn State team ended up staying at a Naval Air Station 14 miles from Dallas.

25|$|Although many {{personal}} computers accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device through a built-in slot or a USB adaptor, SD cards {{cannot be used}} as the primary hard disk through the onboard ATA controller <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the SD card variants support ATA signalling. This use requires a separate SD controller chip or an SD-to-CompactFlash converter. However, on computers that support bootstrapping from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adaptor can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.|$|E
25|$|Xiang Yu {{retreated to}} {{the bank of the}} Wu River (near present-day He County, Chaohu City, Anhui) and the ferryman at the ford {{prepared}} a boat for him to cross the river, strongly encouraging him to do so because Xiang Yu still had the support of the people from his homeland in the south. Xiang Yu said that he was too ashamed to return home and face his people <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the first 8,000 men from Jiangdong who followed him on his conquests survived. He refused to cross and ordered his remaining men to dismount, asking the ferryman to take his warhorse, Zhui (騅), back home.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other underachieving {{baseball}} teams, a curse is believed to lurk over the Tigers. After their 1985 Japan Series win, fans celebrated by having people who looked like Tigers players jump into the Dotonbori Canal. According to legend, <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the fans resembled first baseman Randy Bass, fans grabbed a life-sized statue of Kentucky Fried Chicken mascot Colonel Sanders and threw it into the river (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese). After many series without a series win, the Tigers {{were said to be}} doomed never to win the season again until the Colonel was rescued from the river.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, the SAOCGA {{prohibited}} mixed-race competitions {{within its}} member bodies. In 1959, IOC delegates questioned whether SAOCGA's operation violated the Olympic Charter's ban on discrimination. South Africa's IOC delegate contended that nonwhite competitors {{had not been}} selected <b>because</b> <b>none</b> were <b>of</b> Olympic standard. Brundage felt the discrimination rule only applied at the Olympics itself, not at domestic competition, and so South Africa was allowed to compete at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. The same year, it competed at the Winter Olympics for the first time.|$|R
25|$|When V. crabro sexual {{behaviors}} were first studied, the colony {{seemed to be}} under pheromone control by the queen <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the workers reproduced. However, new evidence has shown that though each of the workers has the machinery to reproduce, they only do so after weighing {{the costs and benefits}} of laying eggs versus the queen laying eggs. In a colony with a queen, the workers are more related to the queen’s larvae than their own. Contrary to previous assumptions, the workers were actually enforcing sterility in one another. Worker policing is the behavior exhibited to prevent other workers within the colony from producing males. This can be completed by either physically destroying worker-laid eggs or by discriminating against those workers that wish to reproduce.|$|E
25|$|The {{molecule}} ClO2 has an {{odd number}} of valence electrons, and therefore, it is a paramagnetic radical. Its electronic structure has long baffled chemists <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the possible Lewis structures is very satisfactory. In 1933, L. O. Brockway proposed {{a structure that}} involved a three-electron bond. Chemist Linus Pauling further developed this idea and arrived at two resonance structures involving a double bond {{on one side and}} a single bond plus three-electron bond on the other. In Pauling's view the latter combination should represent a bond that is slightly weaker than the double bond. In molecular orbital theory this idea is commonplace if the third electron is placed in an anti-bonding orbital. Later work has confirmed that the highest occupied molecular orbital is indeed an incompletely-filled antibonding orbital.|$|E
25|$|Since 2002, the ESPY Awards {{ceremony}} {{has been}} conducted on the Wednesday in July following the game. <b>Because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the major North American professional leagues have games scheduled for that day the National Basketball Association, National Football League, and National Hockey League are not in-season, MLB does not have games that day, and likewise college sports are on summer vacation major sports figures are available to attend. The show used to air on the subsequent Sunday five days later, with the results announced on ESPN.com and thereafter across media outlets immediately after taping was complete. Since 2010, the ESPY Awards are shown live (the first time was 2003); this helps the network fill airtime that would go unfilled {{because of the lack}} of any major league or high-level college sporting events.|$|E
50|$|The Adirondack {{service is}} {{financed by the}} New York State Department of Transportation. The Adirondack service suffers from {{numerous}} delays along the route <b>because</b> almost <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the trackage is owned by Amtrak, and also because the route crosses an international boundary. The on-time performance of the route averaged 64.8% for the year ending June 2016. According to Amtrak, 28.8% of the train delay was due to track- and signal-related problems, especially along the Delaware & Hudson (CP Rail) segment.|$|R

25|$|Laver's eleven Grand Slam singles titles {{currently}} {{place him}} tied with Borg for sixth {{place on the}} all-time list. Only Sampras, Emerson, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have won more Grand Slam singles titles. Laver also won eight Major doubles titles. Laver is the only player to have twice won all four Grand Slam singles tournaments during the same calendar year although {{three of the four}} Grand Slams were played on grass at the time – the Australian Open, US Open, and Wimbledon. <b>Because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the Majors were played on hardcourts in Laver's era, he never won a Grand Slam tournament on that surface. The tennis landscape today is different as half of the year's Majors are played on hardcourts. Only six players have won Major titles on clay, grass and hardcourts: Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are the only players in history to have simultaneously held Grand Slam tournament titles on the three surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The first {{articulated}} skeleton {{referred to}} P. kirkpatricki (CM 73372) was recovered by David S. Berman of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Coelophysis Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, between 1988 and 1989. This specimen {{was composed of}} a well-preserved skeleton without skull and was described by Long and Murry in 1995, Weinbaum in 2002 and Novak in 2004. The specimen represents a skeletally immature individual <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the neural sutures are closed. It was referred to P. kirkpatricki by Long and Murry (1995) without specific justification, and more recent studies accepted this referral. Nevertheless, Nesbitt (2011) noted that these studies failed to note any synapomorphies unique to P. kirkpatricki and CM 73372. Weinbaum (2002) and Novak (2004) even noted that the preacetabular process of the ilium in CM 73372 was much longer than that of P. kirkpatricki. Nesbitt (2011) also noted that CM 73372 differs from P. kirkpatricki and Rauisuchus in possessing a concave ventral margin of the ilium, and from P. alisonae in processing an asymmetrical distal end of the fourth metatarsal. Nesbitt (2011) couldn't differentiate CM 73372 and Polonosuchus as they overlap only in the caudal vertebrae. A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Nesbitt (2011), {{one of the most}} extensive on archosaurs, found CM 73372 to be the most basal crocodylomorph, thus referable neither to P. kirkpatricki nor to Rauisuchidae.|$|E

The exclusion caused d'Elci much embarrassment, and he became sick and quickly died after the French veto was announced. Following d'Elci's exclusion, there was confusion amongst the cardinals about who they should elect, <b>because</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the existing candidates had {{the possibility of being}} elected pope.|$|E
