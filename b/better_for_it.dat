5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> Raskolnikov commits murder {{with the idea that}} he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E

25|$|A new Pikmin {{game was}} {{eventually}} confirmed at E3 2008 during Nintendo's developer roundtable, in which Miyamoto stated {{that his team}} were {{working on a new}} entry in the series. However, details concerning gameplay and development were left unmentioned. At Miyamoto's roundtable discussion at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011, Miyamoto stated that Pikmin 3 development was moved to Wii U, the Wii successor. He felt that the HD graphics for the next system and its special screen-based controller would work <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Now well-monetarily supplied, Spark felt {{confident}} that he could start a business of his own, and be the <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> He also {{decided that he would}} go from Europe and try his luck as a free settler of Australia, which had been founded less than fifty years before. After being granted a letter of recommendation as a free settler, Spark voyaged on the Princess Charlotte to arrive in Sydney in April 1823. After arriving, Alexander set up a shop in George Street, where he sold sugar, wines and alcohol and various drapery. Spark also supplied salted meat to the commissariat at Sydney and Parramatta at the time.|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E

500|$|Gateshead {{qualified}} for the Conference Premier play-offs {{for the first time}} in their history after finishing third in the table in 2013–14, which represented the club's highest league placing since being voted out of the Football League in 1960. With a 4–2 aggregate win over Grimsby Town in the semi-final, Gateshead played at Wembley Stadium {{for the first time in}} the play-off final; despite entering the match on the back of a 14-match unbeaten run they were beaten 2–1 by Cambridge United.

He was named the Non-League Manager of the Year for 2013–14 at the National Game Awards, ahead of John Still, who led Luton to the Conference Premier title.|$|E
2500|$|With {{regard to}} the content, the concept that the {{motorcycle}} {{could serve as a}} metaphor for the 20th century was received with interest, but some wondered whether the claim was fulfilled by the appearance of the motorcycles chosen and the way they were presented. [...] The motorcycles shown did, at least, [...] "illustrate technology and taste as they have evolved together in the 20th century, which is an issue basic to modern art." [...] While there were many who lauded Frank Gehry's spare design, with only the reflective stainless steel and a terse string of words [...] on the walls behind the bikes to evoke the decade they came from, The walls are stark white, and bare, with the exception of a historic-placement blurb at the start of each section, and there is plenty of light on the subjects.Mr. Gehry and his colleagues could have slathered the walls with film stills, advertising and poster art, but they didn't, and the exhibition is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> These are elsewhere, mounted in display cases along the rails of the walkways." [...] others saw this as shallow or a failure to offer as much insight as the show could have.|$|E

A lot of people don't have computers, and they can't afford them. Without education, you get far behind. As long as they have a chance, you know, I think that's important. I want every kid to have a chance." [...] In 2013, Clarkson teamed up with State Farm Insurance to support teen safe driving as a part of Celebrate My Drive program. In 2013, Clarkson supported Feeding America, The Ad Council and their Child Hunger PSA Campaign, which provides food for children facing hunger.
