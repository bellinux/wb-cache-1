3000|$|The example {{presented}} above {{involved an}} easy choice because Procedure A yielded both a higher HR {{and a lower}} FAR than <b>Procedure</b> <b>B.</b> However, the issue becomes more complicated when the HR and FAR are both higher for one procedure than the other. For example, which procedure would be diagnostically superior if Procedure A yielded a HR of [...]. 80 and a FAR of [...]. 05, whereas <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> yielded a HR of [...]. 60 and a FAR of [...]. 02 ? The DR for <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> (. 60 /. 02 = 30) is higher than that for Procedure A (. 80 /. 05 = 16), so by that measure <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> would be preferred. However, this outcome would not actually identify <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> as being diagnostically superior. Why not? In brief, {{the reason is that}} {{it would be easy to}} selectively induce more conservative responding for Procedure A (e.g., using instructions that encourage a high degree of certainty before making an ID from the lineup), thereby lowering both the HR and the FAR for that procedure. Imagine that when conservative responding was encouraged for Procedure A, the HR dropped from [...]. 80 to [...]. 65 (still higher than <b>Procedure</b> <b>B,</b> with a HR of [...]. 60) and the FAR dropped from [...]. 05 to [...]. 02 (now equal to <b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> Under these conditions, Procedure A would clearly be the diagnostically superior procedure. Instead of switching from Procedure A to <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> to achieve a FAR as low as [...]. 02, it would make more sense to stick with Procedure A and to induce more conservative responding. In essence, that kind of comparison is what ROC analysis is all about, and it illustrates why ROC analysis is needed to unambiguously determine the diagnostically superior procedure.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} three cooking methods on the chemical, physical, and sensory prop-erties of hard-cooked eggs were investigated. Freshly laid eggs were stored at 23 C for 48 hr and then hard cooked {{by one of}} three methods: {{steaming}} (S) for 20 min; severe boiling (<b>B)</b> <b>procedure</b> (water brought to a full boil and maintained for 20 min); and a standard hard cook (SHC) pro-cedure (water brought to a slow boil followed by 20 min simmer). The eggs were peeled, separated into yolk and white, and evaluated for pH, moisture, color, texture by an Instron Texturometer and texture profile panel, and flavor by a trained profile panel, experienced panel, and headspace gas chromatography. Eggs subjected to the <b>B</b> <b>procedure</b> had the highest endpoint temperature (98. 7 C) followed by SHC (95. 6 C) and S eggs (89. 4 C). The cooking rate for S eggs was approximately three times faster than SHC or B eggs. Both egg white moisture and pH values were significantly influenced by cooking method. Severely boiled egg whites had significantly lower pH moisture values than SHC or S eggs. Small but perceivable texture differences due to cooking were found by the texture profile panel in addition to significant egg white and yolk texture differences as measured using the Instron. Severely boiled egg whites had the firmest texture followed by SHC and S egg whites. All treatments had a typical egg aroma and flavor, yet several detectable sensory {{differences were found between}} the treatments. There were little qualitative differences in headspace volatiles between treatments, although significant quantitative differences were noted between treatments for eggs yolks and whites.

30|$|Admission {{took place}} on the day of surgery. A Foley {{catheter}} and a Pelosi uterine manipulator were inserted {{at the start of the}} operation. Pneumoperitoneum was attained via intraumbilical Verres insufflation. A four-port technique was used. A 10 -mm trochar was inserted intraumbilically, and 5 -mm trochars were inserted suprapubically in the midline as well as lateral to each rectus muscle. The course of the ureters was identified laparoscopically prior to surgery, and special attention was paid throughout the surgery. For laparoscopic dissection, bipolar unmodulated current at 40  W was used. Dissection followed the same steps as for an LAVH procedure to the level of the uterine arteries, which were identified, ligated using bipolar diathermy, and divided prior to subtotal hysterectomy. The uterine body was separated from the cervix with unipolar scissors. A scissor tip for cautery with monopolar diathermy was used for additional haemostasis and treatment to the endocervical canal, making this a type ST III <b>B</b> <b>procedure</b> following the Munro and Parker classification system for laparoscopically directed subtotal hysterectomy [10].|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} residual-based bootstrap methods à la GonÇalves and Perron (2014) {{to construct the}} confidence interval for structural impulse response functions in factor-augmented vector autoregressions. In particular, we compare the bootstrap with factor estimation (Procedure A) with the bootstrap without factor estimation (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> In theory, both procedures are asymptotically valid under a condition √T/N → 0, where N and T are the cross-sectional dimension and the time dimension, respectively. Even when √T/N → 0 is irrelevant, Procedure A still accounts for {{the effect of the}} factor estimation errors on the impulse response function estimate and it achieves good coverage rates in most cases. On the contrary, <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> is invalid in such cases and tends to undercover if N is much smaller than T. However, <b>Procedure</b> <b>B</b> is implemented more straightforwardly from the standard structural VARs and the length of the confidence interval is shorter than that of Procedure A in finite samples.

40|$|ABSTRACT The nuclear-centrosome complex was {{isolated}} from interphase Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and, with exogenous brain tubulin {{as a source}} of subunits, the centrosome, while attached to the nucleus, was demonstrated to nucleate microtubule formation in vitro. We attempted to quantitate the nucleating activity in order to compare the activity of mitotic and interphase centrosomes. However, the proximity of the nucleus hindered these attempts, and efforts to chemically or mechanically remove the centrosome led to diminished nucleating activity. Therefore, the nuclear-centrosome complex was dissociated biologically through use of the cytochalasin <b>B</b> <b>procedure</b> for enucleation of cells. Cytoplasts were prepared that retained the centrosome. Lysis of the cytoplasts released free centrosomes that could nucleate microtubules in vitro. The nucleating activities of interphase and mitotic centrosomes were compared. In addition, through the use of whole-mount electron microscopy, the configuration of the centrioles was analyzed and the number of microtubules nucleated was determined {{as a function of the}} centriole cycle.

40|$|AbstractA new {{object-oriented}} {{approach is}} developed to classify glaciovolcanic landforms (Procedure A) and their landform elements boundaries (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> It utilizes the principle that glaciovolcanic edifices are geomorphometrically distinct from lava shields and plains (Pedersen and Grosse, 2014), and the approach is tested on data from Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland. The outlined procedures utilize slope and profile curvature attribute maps (20 m/pixel) and the classified results are evaluated quantitatively through error matrix maps (Procedure A) and visual inspection (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B).</b> In <b>procedure</b> A, the highest obtained accuracy is 94. 1 %, but even simple mapping procedures provide good results (> 90 % accuracy). Successful classification of glaciovolcanic landform element boundaries (<b>Procedure</b> <b>B)</b> is also achieved and this technique {{has the potential to}} delineate the transition from intraglacial to subaerial volcanic activity in orthographic view. This object-oriented approach based on geomorphometry overcomes issues with vegetation cover, which has been typically problematic for classification schemes utilizing spectral data. Furthermore, it handles complex edifice outlines well and is easily incorporated into a GIS environment, where results can be edited or fused with other mapping results. The approach outlined here is designed to map glaciovolcanic edifices within the Icelandic neovolcanic zone but may also be applied to similar subaerial or submarine volcanic settings, where steep volcanic edifices are surrounded by flat plains...|$|R

This research compares variance components estimations with using ANOVA and bootstrap procedures in non-normal disturbitions in one facet design G studies. Data were gathered with using two seperate procedures (a) data simulation and (b) sampling simulation. In data simulation part, it’s been simulated a non-normal dichotomous data set which fits to unidimensional personitem matrix 60 x 5 which fits to b x m design. All the simulations replicated 25 times. In sampling simulation sections datas, gathered from data simulation sections has been bootstrapped 1000 times according to the each facet.
