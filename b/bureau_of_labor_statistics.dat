5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics</b> (after 1948).

[...] Redd decided to try to form a national movement, hoping for strength from numbers. In early 1934 Claude Barnett, head of the Associated Negro Press, was asked for help by the ACRT attorney. Barnett brought in Robert L. Mays to organize a publicity campaign for the planned Association of Railway Employees. Dozens of delegates from local organizations answered Redd's call and met in Chicago in September 1934 to found the association.|$|R

5|$|Willamette’s {{library was}} {{designated}} as a Federal Depository Library in 1969. It serves as the library for the 5th Congressional District population. The library selects around 20% of the documents available with areas of concentration in earth sciences, education, history, politics, economics, health, accounting, business, government, public policy, human resources, and others. Additionally, the university selects major items from the Census Bureau, <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics,</b> {{the office of the}} President, and Congress.

5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics.</b> Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E

5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics,</b> to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem and said no attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E

The US <b>Bureau</b> <b>of</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Statistics</b> projects a 26 percent increase in demand for these kinds of health workers by 2024 - and with rising demand comes new need for proper medical education. This study presents case studies of six state-based training models for new home care aides and discusses the recruitment process, curriculum design and delivery methods of all six methods. The data researches collected to perform this case study came from state-level demonstration project reports, demographic data compiled by national evaluators and collaborative topic-based analysis conducted by individual teams. By comparing this information from state to state, they were able to identify methods they deemed successful for training in home care aides. Researchers concluded government funded, evidence-based and person-centered home care aide training programs like the ones they studied could produce well equipped home care workers that were prepared to work with the elderly and individuals with disabilities. However, further research is still needed nationally and internationally to analyze the actual effects these new workers have on patients...|$|R
