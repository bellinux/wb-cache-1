40|$|Retributive {{responses}} do {{play a role}} {{in human}} behavior. Whether they are primarily triggered by supposed intentions or <b>by</b> <b>observed</b> consequences of actions is an important question. It can be addressed by experimental studies of retributive responses in situations in which the individual actor may inflict harmful conse-quences without intending and intend harmful consequences without inflicting them. Our experimental results indicate that retributive responses are more strongly influenced <b>by</b> <b>observed</b> consequences than <b>by</b> ascribed intentions. However, individual retributive motivations seem to be overshadowed by concerns that are non-retributive altogether in that they focus on end state distributions independently of who brought them about. * We thank two anonymous referees for very helpful comments...|$|R
