After it had promised to lower taxes during the election campaign of 2011, Rajoy's government announced a first austerity package ten days into office—including new tax rises and a spending cut worth €9 billion—as {{a result of a}} larger-than-expected public deficit of 8% (instead of the projected 6%). This was followed by a harsh labour reform, criticised as paving the way to cheapen dismissals and which was met with widespread protests and two general strikes in March and November 2012, and an austere state budget for 2012. The crash of Bankia, one <b>of</b> the largest <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain,</b> in May 2012 resulted in a dramatic rise of the Spanish risk premium, and in June the country's banking system needed a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

50|$|The {{decline of}} the Genoese colonies in Crimea coincided with the Ottoman {{expansion}} in the late 15th century. Aside from the Crimean cities, Genoa also lost its lands in the Taman Peninsula, which had belonged to the noble Ghisolfi family. Other losses included the commercial bases of Licostomo in Moldavia and Moncastro near Odessa. Some Italian descendants still existed in Crimea in the early 20th century, and were among the ethnic groups suppressed by Joseph Stalin. The fall of the eastern colonies caused a deep economical crisis which eventually turned in an unstoppable decline for the Republic of Genoa as a major European power. While its longtime rival, the Republic of Venice, was able to maintain some continuity between the capital and its eastern possessions, Genoa could not. It thus moved its interests in the western Mediterranean, establishing flourishing communities in Cadiz and Lisbon.

Another significant Soviet involvement was the activity of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) inside the Republican rearguard.
