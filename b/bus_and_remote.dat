40|$|System performance, system {{interface}} compatibility, and system management and operations are analyzed for {{external and internal}} communications provided by the modular space station. Mathematical models are utilized to evaluate performances of the various communication links between the MSS and the tracking and data relay satellites, the shuttle, and the ground stations. Communication control design requirements are determined from overall MSS control design and checkout requirements are developed in a related systems study. Parallel design efforts consider equipment configurations for the external communication assembly baseband and the internal communication assembly to accommodate signal transfer and control. The recommended baseline design considers also interfaces between equipment groups and the critical functional and signal characteristics of these interfaces. The data processing assembly has direct communication circuits to the external communication assembly and the control interface is provided via a digital data <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> a <b>remote</b> acquisition <b>and</b> control unit...|$|R

The control system {{consists of a}} PC based server with a FNN-based control module, data sampling device, CAN <b>bus</b> communication network <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> irrigation units with sensors and controller. It can estimate irrigation water compensation according to the irrigation environments. By using Fuzzy Logic function and Fuzzy Neural Network, the controller module can fuse multi-source information that from Internet, sensors and other sources to make decision of irrigation water compensation on the control spot.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. A {{model for the}} specification and analysis of communication protocols called Systems of Communicating Machines is used to describe and analyze a simplified version of the Mil- Standard 1553 bus protocol. The protocol {{is used in the}} EA- 6 B aircraft for digital communication between aircraft subsystems. The model uses a combination of finite state machines, variables and predicate action tables in the specification of the <b>Bus</b> Controller <b>and</b> <b>Remote</b> Terminals. The enabling predicates determine when a transition may be taken on the finite state machine and actions alter variable values as transitions occur. Normal, error-free 1553 bus command/ response information transfers are modeled. The 1553 Mil- Standard does not contain an equivalent specification using a formally-defined model. Practical application to the EA- 6 B Prowler is focused upon the requirements for transparent integration of the AN/ASQ- 191 Radio Countermeasures Set into the existing aircraft bus architecture. Transparent integration into the tactical jamming system of the aircraft would make the ASQ- 191 receiver and jamming operations an integral part of aircraft operation and employment, and permit integrated pre-mission planning with TEAMS.

40|$|While {{the growing}} number of cores per chip allows {{researchers}} to solve larger scientific and engineering problems, the par-allel efficiency of the deployed parallel software starts to de-crease. This unscalability problem happens to both vendor-provided and open-source software and wastes CPU cycles and energy. By expecting CPUs with hundreds of cores to be imminent, we have designed a new framework to perform matrix computations for massively many cores. Our perfor-mance analysis on manycore systems shows that the unscal-ability bottleneck is related to Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) : memory <b>bus</b> contention <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> memory ac-cess latency. To overcome the bottleneck, we have designed NUMA-aware tile algorithms {{with the help of a}} dynamic scheduling runtime system to minimize NUMA memory ac-cesses. The main idea is to identify the data that is, either read a number of times or written once by a thread res-ident on a remote NUMA node, then utilize the runtime system to conduct data caching and movement between dif-ferent NUMA nodes. Based on the experiments with QR factorizations, we demonstrate that our framework is able to achieve great scalability on a 48 -core AMD Opteron sys-tem (e. g., parallel efficiency drops only 3 % from one core to 48 cores). We also deploy our framework to an extreme-scale shared-memory SGI machine which has 1024 CPU cores and runs a single Linux operating system image. Our frame-work continues to scale well, and can outperform the vendor-optimized Intel MKL library by up to 750 %...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{an initial}} set of power conditioning models created to generate 'ballpark' power management and distribution (PMAD) component mass and size estimates. It contains converter, rectifier, inverter, transformer, <b>remote</b> <b>bus</b> isolator (RBI), <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> power controller (RPC) models. These models allow certain studies to be performed; however, additional models {{are required to}} assess {{a full range of}} PMAD alternatives. The intent is to eventually form a library of PMAD models that will allow system designers to evaluate various power system architectures and distribution techniques quickly and consistently. The models in this report are designed primarily for space exploration initiative (SEI) missions requiring continuous power and supporting manned operations. The mass estimates were developed by identifying the stages in a component and obtaining mass breakdowns for these stages from near term electronic hardware elements. Technology advances were then incorporated to generate hardware masses consistent with the 2000 to 2010 time period. The mass of a complete component is computed by algorithms that calculate the masses of the component stages, control and monitoring, enclosure, and thermal management subsystem...|$|R
40|$|Description of a {{breadboard}} configuration of an advanced {{information management system}} based on requirements for high data rates and local and centralized computation for subsystems and experiments to be housed on a space station. The system is to contain a 10 -megabit-per-second digital data bus, remote terminals with preprocessor capabilities, and a central multiprocessor. A concept definition is presented for the data acquisition and control system breadboard, and a detailed account is given of {{the operation of the}} bus control unit, the <b>bus</b> itself, <b>and</b> the <b>remote</b> acquisition <b>and</b> control unit. The data bus control unit is capable of operating under control of both its own test panel and the test processor.

40|$|In this {{research}} {{the use of}} geographic information systems (GIS) <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> sensing in two specific aspects of transportation planning in Birkenhead Region, Auckland, New Zealand is discussed. These two aspects are <b>bus</b> routes <b>and</b> <b>bus</b> stops facilities. A 1994 SPOT image and a 1999 aerial photograph of Birkenhead were utilised for mapping land-use types of the region. The study contains two assumptions related to {{the adequacy of the}} above-mentioned facilities. The assumptions state that the adequacy of bus routes/bus stops can be achieved if 80 {{percent or more of the}} residential area as well as the commercial area in the region are located within a buffer zone of 300 metres from all routes/bus stops. The assumptions were examined by using three GIS tools namely buffering, shapearc, and identity. These tools proved to be very useful. It is concluded that GIS <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> sensing can be effectively used in urban roads mapping and in urban transportation planning...|$|R

40|$|A {{multiprocessor}} system with uniform memory access {{is difficult to}} scale due to the increasing contention on the memory <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> {{the complexity of the}} connections between CPUs and memory modules. Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) offers a solution for these problems by introducing so called nodes. Each node consists of a set of processors and local memory. Even though every processor can access memory on all nodes, the access delay differs for local <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> memory. Applications spanning over multiple cores might suffer from a high access delay for ill-placed memory. In this thesis, we introduce an extension for the Barrelfish operating system capable of detecting local <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> memory access <b>and</b> migrating memory between nodes. To achieve automatic NUMA optimization, we implement a migration policy which analyzes the access pattern and tries to find an optimal memory placement. Furthermore, we present a benchmark for measuring the impact of NUMA optimization on memory access performance. Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Timothy Roscoe and Kornilios Kourtis for providing me with the opportunity to explore Barrelfish and contribute to it.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health {{research}} has highlighted the many problems {{experienced in the}} bush. While attention to problems has raised awareness {{of the needs of}} rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health, embedding a deficit perspective in research has stereotyped rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health as poor environments to work in and as inherently problematic. The objectives of this paper are to challenge this thinking and suggest that a more balanced approach, acknowledging strengths, is beneficial. DESIGN: This discussion identifies why the deficit approach is problematic, proposes a strengths-based approach and identifies some key strengths of rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health. RESULTS: This study suggests alternative ways of thinking about rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> practice, including the rewards of rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> practice, that rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> communities can act as change agents, that these disciplines actively address the social determinants of health, that rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> areas have many innovative primary health care services and activities and that rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> contexts provide opportunities for evaluation and research. It is proposed that rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health can be viewed as problem-solving, thus dynamic and improving rather than as inherently problematic. CONCLUSION: Critical of a deficit approach to rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health, this paper provides alternatives ways of thinking about these disciplines and recommends a problem-solving perspective of rural <b>and</b> <b>remote</b> health...|$|R
