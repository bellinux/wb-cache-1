25|$|The United States {{had been}} running a trade deficit, {{draining}} gold out of the country. Because of the tariff revenues, the U.S. Treasury held {{a considerable amount of}} gold, which kept it out of circulation.

In that year, he {{convened a}} meeting in New York City of 23 major {{national}} and international Jewish organizations to address the task of negotiating {{an agreement with the}} West German government for the reparations to Jews for losses caused by Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (also known as the Claims Conference) was the organization that emerged from this meeting. On September 10, 1952, after six months of negotiations, a reparations agreement between the Claims Conference and Konrad Adenauer's government of West Germany was reached. Noting the historic import of the agreement, David Ben-Gurion said in a 1952 Dr. Goldmann, “For {{the first time in the}} history of the Jewish people, oppressed and plundered for hundreds of years...the oppressor and plunderer has had to hand <b>back</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spoil and pay collective compensation for part of the material losses.” In 1954 a similar treaty was signed between Austria and Israel.|$|E
25|$|In September 1979, {{before the}} Olympics, the American team started {{exhibition}} play. They played {{a total of}} 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and America. Through these games, Herb Brooks instilled a European style of play in the American team, emphasizing wide open play with sufficient body contact. He believed {{it would be the}} only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets. From the start of the exhibitions, he conducted the team through skating windsprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and <b>back.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players took to calling these Herbies. On September 17, 1979, the team played to a 3-3 tie in Norway. Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game, and after a while, the lights were turned off by custodians and the practice continued in the dark. Near the end of the exhibition season, although he had supported them throughout, Brooks threatened because of subpar play to cut Eruzione (the captain) and replace Craig as the starting goalie with Steve Janaszak.|$|E

25|$|Introduction of {{predatory fish}} {{species such as}} {{bluegill}} and various types of bass that prey on salmon smolt are also {{a major contributor to}} the decline. The San Joaquin's point of divergence with the distributary Old River has historically created a sort of bottleneck for out migrating salmon because the Old River in turn branches into many side-channels and sloughs of the delta as well as various canal intakes. Recent years have seen work by the California Department of Water Resources and the California Department of Fish and Game to construct and manage temporary rock barriers {{at the head of the}} Old River in order to keep fish in the main channel of the San Joaquin River. In the fall of 2009, just 2,236 salmon returned to the entire river system to spawn; this has led to a government ban on salmon fishing off the coasts of northern California and Oregon. Recent years have seen efforts to bring <b>back</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salmon population to the San Joaquin and some of its tributaries; these include the establishment of fish hatcheries. , plans had been finalized for a $14.5 million hatchery near Friant Dam as part of a $20 million federal restoration project for the fish.|$|E

500|$|According to Higson, Fleming {{spent the}} first four novels {{changing}} the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in From Russia, with Love the author [...] "finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase". The literary analyst LeRoy L.

The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven. Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a [...] "cleverly presented" [...] beginning, similar {{to the opening of}} a film.
