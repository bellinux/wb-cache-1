This spike results in a trisynaptic EPSP being recorded in a postsynaptic pyramidal cell (cell 4, event A). At the same time, cell 3 drives both a <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> (5) and chandelier cell (6) to threshold. The <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> evokes a hyperpolarizing IPSP on the postsynaptically recorded pyramidal cell (cell 4, event B), four synapses removed from the original spike. The spiking chandelier cell (6) triggers yet another pyramidal neuron to fire (7), which produces an EPSP on the recorded neuron (cell 4, event C), five synapses away from the original spike. The result seen in the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron (cell 4) is a delayed EPSP-IPSP-EPSP sequence (events A, B, and C), traveling through three, four, and five synapses respectively.

Various excitatory and inhibitory afferent and efferent synapses of the hippocampal CCK <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> express serotoninergic, cholinergic, cannabinoid, and benzodiazepine sensitive receptors, all contributing to their functional plasticity. We explored whether CCK <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> are modulated by neuropeptide Y (NPY), {{one of the major}} local neuropeptides that strongly inhibits hippocampal excitability and has significant effect on its memory function. Here, using GAD 65 -GFP transgenic mice for prospective identification of CCK <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we show {{for the first time that}} excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto CCK <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are modulated by NPY through activation of NPY Y 2 receptors. The frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs, as well as the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked EPSCs were decreased. Similarly, the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature IPSCs, and the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked IPSCs were decreased after NPY application. Most of the effects of NPY could be attributed to a presynaptic site of action. Our data provide the first evidence that the excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto the CCK <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> could be modulated by local levels of NPY, and may change the way these cells process extrahippocampal afferent information, influencing hippocampal function and its network excitability during normal and pathological oscillatory activities.

5000|$|In a {{framework}} first developed by Hasselmo and colleagues, theta phase separation {{implies that the}} theta rhythm of the hippocampus occurs in cycles and various phases of the rhythm entail encoding and retrieval as separate processes. An extra-hippocampal structure, the septum, initiates and regulates the theta rhythm and its associated memory processes. GABAergic activity within the septum inhibits certain classes of CA3 cells (a region of the hippocampus), the divide often drawn between basket cells, pyramidal cells, and interneurons, to distinguish encoding from retrieval mechanisms. The study emphasizes and models the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus as a primary inducement towards encoding and retrieval. Encoding as a procedure begins when septal GABAergic inhibition is at minimum, freeing basket cells to act within CA3;, and during brief dis-inhibition periods, other cells receive input: a proximal entorhinal input toward pyramidal cells and a coincident dentate gyrus input toward interneurons. On the other hand, retrieval as a procedure begins when septal GABAergic inhibition is at maximum, occluding <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> activity and enabling pyramidal cells to signal. During this period, Oriens- Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) cells disambiguate memory for retrieval.|$|E
40|$|Information {{processing}} in {{neural networks}} {{depends on the}} connectivity among excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The presence of parallel, distinctly controlled local circuits within a cortical network may ensure an effective and dynamic regulation of microcircuit function. By applying a combination of optogenetics, electrophysiological recordings, and high resolution microscopic techniques, we uncovered the organizing principles of synaptic communication between principal neurons and basket cells in the basal nucleus of the amygdala. In this cortical structure, known to be critical for emotional memory formation, we revealed the presence of 2 parallel <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> networks expressing either parvalbumin or cholecystokinin. While the 2 <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> types are mutually interconnected within their own category via synapses and gap junctions, they avoid innervating each other, but form synaptic contacts with axo-axonic cells. Importantly, both <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> types have the similar potency to control principal neuron spiking, but they receive excitatory input from principal neurons with entirely diverse features.

Whole-cell recordings of Purkinje cell IPSCs were used to screen K+ channel subtypes which could contribute to axonal repolarization. α-Dendrotoxin, 4 -aminopyridine, charybdotoxin and tetraethylammonium chloride increased IPSC rate and/or amplitude, whereas iberiotoxin and apamin failed to affect the IPSCs. The effects of those K+ channel blockers that enhanced transmitter release on the [Ca 2 +]i rises elicited in <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> axons by action potentials fell into three groups: 4 -aminopyridine strongly increased action potential-evoked [Ca 2 +]i; tetraethylammonium and charybdotoxin were ineffective alone but augmented the effects of 4 -aminopyridine; α-dendrotoxin had no effect. We conclude that cerebellar basket cells contain at least three pharmacologically distinct K+ channels, which regulate transmitter release through different mechanisms. 4 -Aminopyridine-sensitive, α-dendrotoxin-insensitive K+ channels are mainly responsible for repolarization in <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> presynaptic terminals.

Paired intracellular recordings in which the presynaptic cell was an interneuron and the postsynaptic cell a CA 1 pyramid were performed in slices of adult rat hippocampus. Resultant IPSPs were challenged with Zolpidem, cells filled with biocytin and identified morphologically. IPSPs elicited by fast spiking (FS) basket cells (n = 9) were enhanced more than IPSPs elicited by regular spiking (RS) basket cells (n = 10). At FS <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> synapses the efficacy of Zolpidem was equivalent to that of Diazepam, while RS <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> IPSPs are enhanced 50 % less by Zolpidem than by Diazepam. Thus, while α 1 subunits may dominate at synapses supplied by FS basket cells, RS <b>basket</b> <b>cell</b> synapses also involve α 2 / 3 subunits.

There were substantial differences in the firing behavior among interneuron groups; parvalbumin-expressing <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> were one of the most active GABAergic cells during SWRs, whereas ivy cells were silent. Analysis of the synaptic currents during SWRs uncovered that the dominant synaptic input to the pyramidal cell was inhibitory, whereas spiking interneurons received larger synaptic excitation than inhibition.

I present here a detailed analysis of the spike timing of parvalbumin-positive (PV) basket and physiologically identified pyramidal cells in area CA 3, relative to various network states recorded in area CA 3 and CA 1 simultaneously.

In CA 3, PV <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> fired phase locked to theta and gamma oscillations recorded in CA 1 as well as in CA 3, and increased their firing rates during CA 1 sharp-waves.

It is generally assumed that <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> provide perisomatic inhibition t...|$|R
40|$|Large interneurons of {{cerebellar}} cortex are described. Golgi Cells lie mostly in vestibulocerebellum. Their dendrites contact with parallel fibers and mossy fibers, axons terminate in glomerules. Golgi Cells inhibit granule cells and induce their synchronic rhythmic activity. Lugaro Cells lie in horizontal plane under ganglionic layer, form clasters and more frequent in paleocerebellum. Dendrites contact with collaterals Purkinje and <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> axones; axones terminate on <b>basket</b> and stellate <b>cell.</b> Lugaro Cells stimulate Purkinje Cells by inhibiting of inhibitory stellate and <b>basket</b> <b>cells.</b> Candelabrum Cells are inhibitory interneurons which lie between Purkinje cells bodies. Axon forms horizontal branches in parasagittal plane in molecular layer, and vertical ones which resemble candelabrum. Unipolar brush cells – excitatory interneuron of the cerebel-lum, form system of intrinsic mossy fibers. Single axon forms numerous brush-like branches – dendrioles, which end in one common glomerules, axon collaterals terminate in another one. Synamortic neurons contact with neurons of cerebellar nuclei and another {{region of the}} cortex. Perivascular neurons regulate local blood flow...|$|R
40|$|The medial {{prefrontal cortex}} is {{involved}} in working memory and executive control. However, the collective spatiotemporal organization of the cellular network has not been possible to explain during different brain states. Weshow that pyramidal cells in the prelimbic cortex fire synchronized to hippocampal theta and local spindle oscillations in anesthetized rats. To identify which types of interneurons contribute to the synchronized activity, we recorded and juxtacellularly labeled parvalbumin- and calbindin-expressing (PV+/CB+) <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> and CB-expressing, PV-negative (CB+/PV-) dendrite-targeting interneurons during both network oscillations. All CB+/PV- dendrite-targeting cells strongly decreased their firing rate during hippocampal theta oscillations. Most PV+/CB+ <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> fired {{at the peak of}} dorsalCA 1 theta cycles, similar to prefrontal pyramidal cells. Weshow that pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus also fire around the peak of dorsal CA 1 theta cycles, in contrast to previously reported dorsal hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, prefrontal neurons might be driven by monosynaptic connections from the ventral hippocampus during theta oscillations. During prefrontal spindle oscillations, the majority of pyramidal <b>cells</b> and PV+/CB+ <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> fired preferentially at the trough and early ascending phase, but CB+/PV- dendrite-targeting cells fired uniformly at all phases. Weconclude thatPV+/CB+ <b>basket</b> <b>cells</b> contribute to rhythmic responses of prefrontal pyramidal cells in relation to hippocampal and thalamic inputs and CB+/PV-dendrite-targeting cells modulate the excitability of dendrites and spines regardless of these field rhythms. Distinct classes of GABAergic interneuron in the prefrontal cortex contribute differentially to the synchronization of pyramidal cells during network oscillations.
