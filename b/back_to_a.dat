5|$|After peak intensity, {{the forward}} speed of Dean {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Josephine was a {{long-lived}} Atlantic hurricane {{that threatened}} the East Coast of the United States {{for several days}} in October 1984. The fifteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm, and third hurricane of the season, Josephine developed from an area of disturbed weather near the Bahamas on October7, forming with subtropical characteristics. It quickly organized, and gained tropical characteristics as it strengthened into a tropical storm on October8. Gradual intensification occurred thereafter, reaching hurricane status on October10. The storm headed northward, remaining well offshore of the eastern United States. Josephine strengthened further and peaked as a moderately strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on October12. On the following day, Josephine weakened <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Category1 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary. It later headed northeastward and paralleled the coast well offshore of Nova Scotia. By October17, Josephine weakened <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm, shortly before beginning to execute a cyclonic loop {{to the south of}} Newfoundland. While executing the cyclonic loop, Josephine became extratropical on October18.|$|E

5|$|On August 31, Jimena {{encountered}} strong southerly wind shear, {{causing it}} to quickly weaken <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm by September 1.

Jimena continued to weaken as wind shear increased and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 3. After weakening <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> depression, Jimena crossed the International Date Line on September 5 at 0600 UTC, where it became the first storm to exist in all three Pacific basins since 1999's Hurricane Dora. However, Jimena was only tracked briefly by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, since strong wind shear resulted in the low level circulation to be exposed from the center and at 1727 UTC, the low level had nearly dissipated. At 1800 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued their final advisory on Jimena as the storm dissipated 715miles (1151km) southeast of Wake Island.|$|E
