40|$|BACKGROUND As the {{population}} ages, sicker patients often with multiple comorbidities are presenting in renal clinics. Some are {{deciding not to}} embark on dialysis. The objective {{of this study was}} to gain an understanding of the decision that some patients make not to embark on dialysis. METHODS Naturally occurring qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 patients and 17 caregivers managed within a Renal <b>Supportive</b> <b>Care</b> Service in an acute NHS Trust in London. RESULTS Several patients believed they had made an informed and autonomous decision, either on or against the advice of their doctor (n 5 17); some felt that they had no option but to refuse dialysis treatment, as it would not have been of benefit and might ultimately cause their death (n 5 7); some stated they had decided to opt for medication rather than dialysis 3 times a week and seemed to believe that either option would lead to the same outcome (n 5 2), and some felt there had been no decision to be made (n 5 4). CONCLUSIONS Prior to this study, little was known about those who decide not to embark on dialysis and how they make this decision. It cannot be presumed that decisions made by patients are fully understood and free from inappropriate professional or family influence, and the decision needs to be regularly revisited to check patients' and caregivers' understanding and to allow for reversal of the decision if fitting. There is a need to understand how service providers can help to ensure that such decisions are informed and supported by the <b>best</b> available <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> thereafter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMelioidosis, {{infection}} with Burkholderia pseudomallei, is being recognised {{with increasing frequency}} and is probably more common than currently appreciated. Treatment recommendations {{are based on a}} series of clinical trials conducted in Thailand over the past 25 years. Treatment is usually divided into two phases: in the first, or acute phase, parenteral drugs are given for ≥ 10 days with the aim of preventing death from overwhelming sepsis; in the second, or eradication phase, oral drugs are given, usually to complete a total of 20 weeks, with the aim of preventing relapse. Specific treatment for individual patients needs to be tailored according to clinical manifestations and response, and there remain many unanswered questions. Some patients with very mild infections can probably be cured by oral agents alone. Ceftazidime is the mainstay of acute-phase treatment, with carbapenems reserved for severe infections or treatment failures and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) as second-line therapy. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) is preferred for the eradication phase, with the alternative of co-amoxiclav. In addition, the <b>best</b> available <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> is needed, along with drainage of abscesses whenever possible. Treatment for melioidosis is unaffordable for many in endemic areas of the developing world, but the relative costs have reduced over the past decade.

40|$|Background: An {{understanding}} of the nature and magnitude of the impact of cancer is critical to planning how <b>best</b> to deliver <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> to the growing population of cancer survivors whose need for care may span many years. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of and factors associated with moderate to high level unmet <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs among adult cancer survivors six months after diagnosis. Methods: A population-based sample of adult cancer survivors diagnosed with one of the eight most incident cancers in Australia was recruited from two state-based cancer registries. Data for 1323 survivors were obtained by self-report questionnaire and linkage with cancer registry data. Unmet needs were assessed by the 34 -item <b>Supportive</b> <b>Care</b> Needs Survey (SCNS-SF 34). The data were examined using chi-square and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 444 (37 %) survivors reported at least one ‘moderate to high’ level unmet need and 496 (42 %) reported ‘no need’ for help. Moderate to high level unmet needs were most commonly reported in the psychological (25 %) and physical aspects of daily living (20 %) domains. The five most frequently endorsed items of moderate to high unmet need were concerns about the worries of those close to them (15 %), fears about the cancer spreading (14 %), not being able to do the things they used to do (13 %), uncertainty about the future (13 %) and lack of energy/tiredness (12 %). Survivors’ psychological characteristics were the strongest indicators of unmet need, particularly caseness for anxious preoccupation coping which was associated (OR= 2. 2 - 5. 9) with unmet need for help across all domains. Conclusions: Unmet <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs are prevalent among a subgroup of survivors transitioning from active treatment to survivorship, although lower than previously reported. In addition to coping support, valuable insight about how to prevent or address survivors’ unmet needs could be gained by examining the substantial proportion of survivors who report no unmet needs...|$|R

Patients and methods: There weretwo arms to this phenomenological descriptive study: A. Interviews with hospice patients and their carers; B. Interviews with hospice staff. The results from arm A are reported in this article. This involved interviews with ten families (available patient and carer) who had hospice experience with questionnaires and ten families who were cared for without questionnaires. The interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Main results: The research presented in this article is seminal work in the area which affirms significant concerns about the use of questionnaires in hospice practice. The evidence indicates the majority of clients dislike the use of questionnaires and points to questionnaire use being a practice built around staff, rather than client, needs. The findings also provide insight into the process of collusion by which hospice workers who are enthusiastic about the use of questionnaires can be led to believe, because of client gratitude, that the process is positive. Conclusions: Questionnaires should not be seen as an unqualified good, and thus should not be automatically accepted as best practice within hospice or palliative care service provision...|$|R

The cost-effectiveness of first-line maintenance erlotinib in the overall SATURN population has been assessed and published recently, but analyses according to EGFR mutation status have not been performed yet, which was the rationale for assessing the cost-effectiveness of first-line maintenance erlotinib specifically in EGFR wild-type metastatic NSCLC. Methods: The incremental cost per life-year gained of first-line maintenance erlotinib compared with <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> {{in patients with}} EGFR wild-type stable metastatic NSCLC was assessed for five European countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy) with an area-under-the-curve model consisting of three health states (progression-free survival, progressive disease, death).

The first-line maintenance erlotinib therapy cost (modeled for time to treatment cessation), medication cost in later lines, and cost {{for the treatment of}} adverse events were included. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations) were performed. Results: According to the model simulations, first-line maintenance erlotinib compared with <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> in EGFR wild-type stable metastatic NSCLC resulted in 4. 57 months of life gained (17. 82 months for erlotinib versus 13. 24 months for <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care)</b> and 1. 14 months of life without progression gained (erlotinib 4. 29 versus <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> 3. 15), and incremental total costs of erlotinib from &euro; 7897 (UK) to &euro; 9580 (Germany).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the cost effectiveness of gemcitabine {{in the treatment}} of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Gemcitabine was compared with <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> and gemcitabine/cisplatin was compared with three standard chemotherapies and four other novel chemotherapy combinations. Costs and effectiveness measures were based on resource and outcome data from previously reported clinical trials. All direct costs associated with NSCLC treatment were included and adjusted to year 2000 values. Perspective: UK National Health Service. Results: Gemcitabine plus <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> was associated with an incremental cost per progression-free life year gained of Lstg 5228 compared with <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> alone. In comparison with standard chemotherapies, gemcitabine/cisplatin was associated with an incremental cost per progression-free life year gained of Lstg 1751 versus etoposide/cisplatin and cost per 1 -year survival gain of Lstg 5681 versus mitomycin/vinblastine/platinum. Incremental cost per tumour response was Lstg 2032 relative to etoposide/cisplatin, Lstg 5169 relative to mitomycin/ifosfamide/cisplatin and Lstg 6240 relative to mitomycin/vinblastine/platinum. Compared with four novel (newer) combination chemotherapies gemcitabine/ cisplatin showed cost savings in each case, with the same or better outcome. Thus, gemcitabine/cisplatin showed improved cost effectiveness and dominance. Sensitivity analyses showed the results were robust to variations to the values of key parameters.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy {{improves}} {{outcomes in}} various tumour types, but cumulative toxic effects limit {{the choice of}} drugs. We investigated whether maintenance therapy with vinflunine would delay disease progression in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who had achieved disease control with first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: We did a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 trial in 21 Spanish hospitals. Eligible patients had locally advanced, surgically unresectable, or metastatic transitional-cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract, adequate organ function, and disease control after four to six cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine (carboplatin allowed after cycle four). Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive vinflunine or <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> until disease progression. We initially used block randomisation with a block size of six. Four lists were created for the two stratification factors of starting dose of vinflunine and presence of liver metastases. After a protocol amendment, number of cisplatin and gemcitabine cycles was added as a stratification factor, and eight lists were created, still with a block size of six. Finally, we changed to a minimisation procedure {{to reduce the risk}} of imbalance between groups. Vinflunine was given every 21 days as a 20 min intravenous infusion at 320 mg/m 2 or at 280 mg/m 2 in patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 1, age 75 years or older, previous pelvic radiotherapy, or creatinine clearance lower than 60 mL/min. The primary endpoint was median progression-free survival longer than 5 · 3 months in the vinflunine group, assessed by modified intention to treat. Comparison of progression-free survival between treatment groups was a secondary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01529411. FINDINGS: Between April 12, 2012, and Jan 29, 2015, we enrolled 88 patients, of whom 45 were assigned to receive vinflunine and 43 to receive <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care.</b> One patient from the vinflunine group was lost to follow-up immediately after randomisation and was excluded from the analyses. One patient in the <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> group became ineligible for the study and did not receive treatment due to a delay in enrolment, but was included in the intention-to-treat efficacy analysis. After a median follow-up of 15 · 6 months (IQR 8 · 5 - 26 · 0), 29 (66 %) of 44 patients in the vinflunine group had disease progression and 24 (55 %) had died, compared with 36 (84 %) of 43 patients with disease progression and 32 (74 %) deaths in the <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> group. Median progression-free survival was 6 · 5 months (95 % CI 2 · 0 - 11 · 1) in the vinflunine group and 4 · 2 months (2 · 1 - 6 · 3) in the <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> group (hazard ratio 0 · 59, 95 % CI 0 · 37 - 0 · 96, p= 0 · 031). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (eight [18 %] of 44 in the vinflunine group vs none of 42 in the <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> group), asthenia or fatigue (seven [16 %] vs one [2 %]), and constipation (six [14 %] vs none). 18 serious adverse events were reported in the vinflunine group and 14 in the <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> group. One patient in the vinflunine group died from pneumonia that was deemed to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: In patients with disease control after first-line chemotherapy, progression-free survival exceeded the acceptable threshold with vinflunine maintenance therapy.

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic {{cancer is}} an {{extremely}} aggressive malignancy. Subjects are afflicted {{with a variety of}} disconcerting symptoms, including profound cachexia. Recent data indicate that the outcome of oncological patients suffering from cancer cachexia could be improved by parenteral nutrition and that parenteral nutrition results in an improvement of quality of life and in prolonged survival. Currently, there is no recommendation of routine use of parenteral nutrition. Furthermore, there is no clear recommendation for 2 nd line therapy (or higher) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma but often asked for. Methods/Design PANUSCO is an open label, controlled, prospective, randomized, multicentre phase IIIb trial with two parallel arms. All patients will be treated with 5 -fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin on an outpatient basis at the study sites. Additionally, all patients will receive <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> nutritional <b>care</b> (BSNC). In the experimental group BSNC will be expanded with parenteral nutrition (PN). In contrast, patients in the control group obtain solely BSNC. Parenteral nutrition will be applied overnight and at home by experienced medical staff. A total of 120 patients are planned to be enrolled. Primary endpoint is the comparison of the treatment groups with respect to event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from randomization till time to development of an event defined as either an impairment (change from baseline of at least ten points in EORTC QLQ-C 30, functional domain total score) or withdrawal due to fulfilling the special defined stopping criteria for chemotherapy as well as for nutritional intervention (NI) or death from any cause (whichever occurs first).

Twenty-five patients (45 %) given octreotide showed stable disease vs only eight (15 %) in the control group (P < 0. 001). In conclusion, octreotide therapy seems to confer a survival benefit in advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients refractory to chemotherapy. Additional studies will be needed to confirm these results and to clarify other questions about dose and schedule of octreotide...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Importance: REACH is {{the first}} phase 3 trial to provide {{information}} on hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in the second-line (postsorafenib) setting categorized by Child-Pugh score, a scoring system {{used to measure the}} severity of chronic liver disease. This exploratory analysis demonstrates the relationship between a potential ramucirumab survival benefit, severity of liver disease, and baseline α-fetoprotein (αFP). Objective: To assess treatment effects and tolerability of ramucirumab by Child-Pugh score in patients with HCC enrolled in the REACH trial. Design, Settings, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial of ramucirumab and <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> vs placebo and <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> as second-line treatment in patients with HCC enrolled between November 4, 2010 and April 18, 2013, from 154 global sites. Overall, 643 patients were randomized and included in this analysis; 565 patients considered Child-Pugh class A (Child-Pugh scores 5 and 6) and 78 patients considered class B (Child-Pugh scores 7 and 8). Interventions: Ramucirumab (8 mg/kg) or placebo intravenously plus <b>best</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> every 2 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), defined as time from randomization to death from any cause. Results: In the randomized population of 643 patients (mean [SD] age, 62. 8 [11. 1] years) in this analysis, a potential ramucirumab OS benefit was observed for patients with a Child-Pugh score of 5 (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 80; 95...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Supportive</b> <b>care</b> is {{currently}} the only 'therapy' that can be offered to women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM). What these women themselves prefer as <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> in their next pregnancy has never been substantiated. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to explore what women with unexplained RM prefer as <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> during their next pregnancy. METHODS: We performed explorative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The interviews were performed with 15 women with unexplained RM who were actively seeking conception. All interviews were conducted by telephone. The interviews were fully transcribed and two researchers independently identified text segments from the transcribed interviews and categorized them in the appropriate domain. RESULTS: Women identified 20 different <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> options; 16 of these options were preferred for their next pregnancy. Examples of the preferred <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> were early and frequently repeated ultrasounds, beta HCG monitoring, practical advice concerning life style and diet, emotional support in the form of counselling, a clear policy for the upcoming 12 weeks and medication. The four <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> options that were not preferred by the women were admittance to a hospital ward at the same gestational age as previous miscarriages, Complementary Alternative Medicine, ultrasound every other day and receiving <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> from their general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified several relevant preferences for <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> in women with unexplained RM. Many of these can be offered by the gynaecologist and will help in guaranteeing high-quality patient-centred car...|$|R
40|$|Oral presentationConference Theme: Innovation in Psycho-Oncology: Clinical Care, Research and AdvocacyBACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the changes in <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs among women with {{advanced}} breast cancer (ABC). Understanding how patients’ <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs change during their cancer journey enable us to develop tailored interventions to meet their needs and help control health care costs. The aim {{of this study was to}} (1) examine patterns of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs over the first year following the diagnosis of advanced breast cancer and (2) identify related determinants. METHOD: 228 / 276 Chinese women newly diagnosed with ABC were recruited from six public oncology units and completed an interview before their first course of chemotherapy, and follow-up interviews at 6 -, 12 -, 18 -weeks, and 12 months subsequently. At baseline, participants were assessed for <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs (SCNS- 34), psychological distress (HADS), symptom distress (MSAS), and optimism (C-LOT-R), and patient satisfaction (PSEQ- 9). At follow-up, participants completed the measure of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify discreet <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs trajectories. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of trajectory patterns patterns adjusted for demographic and medical characteristics. RESULTS: Two distinct trajectories were identified within Health system & information need (HSI) and Sexuality need domains and three distinct trajectories within Psychological and Physical daily living (PDL) need domains. Most women showed stable low levels of HIS (79 %), Psychological (82 %), PDL (84 %), and Sexuality (97 %) <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs. One in five and one in eight women showed high initial needs in HIS, Psychological, and PDL domains, respectively. With the exception of Sexuality needs, trajectory patterns were predicted by physical symptom distress. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, most Chinese women with advanced breast cancer showed low stable levels of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs. Physical symptom distress predicted high <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: This report is the first describing trajectories of different <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> need domains in advanced breast cancer, thereby offering new insights into patterns of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs not previously addressed. The findings challenge assumptions that <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs inevitably increase with advancing disease and raise important questions about the influences on adaptation in advanced breast cancer. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Effective physical symptom management plays an important role in fulfilling women’s <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs, highlighting the importance of the implementation of comprehensive symptom assessment and management in cancer care. This is particularly important as progressive disease generates more impacts.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This is {{a thesis}} by publication, {{comprising}} an introduction, one published literature review, five data-based papers (four published and one under review) and a concluding discussion. Guided by the theoretical underpinnings of the <b>Supportive</b> <b>Care</b> Framework, the overall {{objective of this}} thesis was to rigorously assess the unmet <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs of adult haematological cancer survivors. In this body of work, unmet <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs were assessed in adult haematological cancer survivors recruited from population-based cancer registries, using a cross-sectional questionnaire which included the Survivor Unmet Needs Survey (SUNS). Findings from this body of work suggest that <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> addressing cancer-related tiredness and emotional and informational concerns may be needed by a minority of haematological cancer survivors. In particular, younger survivors, survivors experiencing increased financial burden {{as a result of}} their cancers, those who have had to relocate for cancer treatment, females, those with a vocational level education, survivors who have recently visited a health care professional for their cancer and/or are experiencing elevated levels of depression and stress may require additional and perhaps intensive <b>supportive</b> <b>care.</b> These findings could be used to inform future research into the <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs of haematological cancer survivors, as well as improve the <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> provided to haematological cancer survivors. Future research should strive for further improvement of the methodological rigour of research investigating the <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> of haematological cancer survivors, by identifying potential strategies that may increase the response rates of survivors from population-based cancer registries and by refining the psychometric properties of the SUNS for use with haematological cancer survivors. Health care providers and researchers should attempt to effectively address the most prevalent unmet needs of haematological cancer survivors, particularly with regard to cancer-related tiredness, and emotional and informational concerns. Health care providers should also be aware that subgroups of haematological cancer survivors with a higher risk of experiencing multiple and elevated levels of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs may require additional and tailored <b>supportive</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
40|$|Prostate cancer (PCA) has {{the highest}} {{prevalence}} for men in the western world. Besides general symptoms, these patients experience specific problems like erectyle dysfunction and urinary incontinence, which occur after treatment and may result in feelings of distress. PCA patients express a need for <b>supportive</b> <b>care,</b> although they are often not participating in the offered <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> interventions. To study determinants of care seeking behavior, the influence of patient’s <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> needs was assessed with the SCNS. With the ASE-model, we studied whether their attitude about <b>supportive</b> <b>care,</b> perceived social support and self-efficacy influence care seeking. Furthermore also the influence of external factors, e. g. distress, biographical and medical factors, previous experience with and evaluation of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> was studied. Methods A quantitative, cross-sectional study with {{a convenience sample of}} patients who completed a questionnaire was conducted. The SCNS measured care needs. Patient’s attitude towards care seeking, perceived social support and self-efficacy were assessed as well as several external factors. Results We included 87 patients, who returned a questionnaire by email or post. Pearson’s correlation coefficients showed significant associations between the future <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> use and attitude, needs, and external factors depression, anxiety, previous experience with and evaluation of <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> and age. Results of multiple regression analysis pointed out that psychological, physical needs and depression are the main determinants for future <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> use. Conclusion The results show psychological, physical needs and depression are more important determinants of future <b>supportive</b> <b>care</b> use than ASE-factor attitude towards care seeking, anxiety, previous psychosocial care use, satisfaction with care and age. Results indicated that men look for expert information in more than one third of all cases.

Treatment options have vastly improved for elderly myeloma patients but still require the clinician to personalize therapy. In this paper, we offer evidence-based, pragmatic {{advice on how to}} overcome six of the main challenges likely to arise: 1) diagnosis of myeloma in this age group, 2) assessment of the need for treatment, and the fitness for combination chemotherapy, 3) provision of the <b>best</b> quality of <b>supportive</b> <b>care,</b> 4) choice of combination chemotherapy in those fit enough for it, 5) treatment of relapsed myeloma, and 6) provision of end of life care. With an increased burden of comorbidities and a reduced resilience to treatment and its associated toxicities, the management of myeloma in this age group requires a different approach to that in younger patients to maximize both quality and length of life.
