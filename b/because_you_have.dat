500|$|All {{the things}} that {{happened}} were really inspiring, because it was frustrating ... But for me at least, every time we get really frustrated and you're hitting a wall and everything is chaos, it just makes the music that much better, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> passion—even if it's negative. That's sometimes better, actually.|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{considered}} varying {{styles and}} influences {{a key factor}} in the band's music. He explained to The Sun that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence. Goddard and Doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to [...] "unpleasant" [...] periods of silence, but ultimately thought the clashes created [...] "something more interesting <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> these different voices and not one person dictating".|$|E

500|$|Napoleon breakfasted off {{silver plate}} at Le Caillou, {{the house where}} {{he had spent the}} night. When Soult {{suggested}} that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, [...] "Just <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast".|$|E
500|$|Lu said of {{his role}} as {{legislative}} director, [...] "It's {{one of the most}} fun jobs in the Senate (but) it's also an incredibly difficult job <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to know something about any given thing going on in the Senate at the time ... It takes a couple years off your life." [...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E
500|$|Hetrick {{thought that}} if she {{returned}} to DS9 as Vash, then something could be built around the Vash-Quark relationship: [...] "That would be a really nice pairing, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> these two different backgrounds but they're both after the same thing." [...] Towards {{the end of the}} , the producers inquired about Hetrick's availability. The actress was ready to appear on another DS9 episode, but the writers changed direction and there were no further plans for the Vash character. [...] "Q-Less" [...] was the final Star Trek appearance for Hetrick, and the only appearance in DS9 for John de Lancie.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been a {{surveyor}} originally, {{and that}} you fell back on the chain <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> no taste for figures. I think I have heard as much from yourself." ...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indiewire in 2014, Laurent admitted that she loves writing: [...] " [...] especially super exciting <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> everything to do and most of your ideas come from that first part… you just imagine things, and you imagine actors." [...] She described the shooting process as [...] "the fun part" [...] because of: [...] "working with people I love—it’s always a great human moment because we’re sharing things and it’s good to see people who are here {{for you and your}} story, to tell your story. It’s really beautiful, it’s why I love making movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{declared}} {{in his autobiography}} that he specialised in what he called [...] "the art of tackling", emphasising {{that it is an}} art. He claimed that he was never sent off or booked by a referee. In his view, the art of tackling is in the timing and the sole object is to win the ball. He wrote that even if the opponent is injured in the tackle, [...] "it's not a foul <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> timed everything right and you've won it". His philosophy, therefore, was to play [...] "hard but fair" [...] with no cheating.|$|E
500|$|Colin Salmon plays James Middleton, a {{civil servant}} who sits between the British {{government}} and the Ministry of Defence. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on Hex. He was attracted to the role in Strike Back due to the script being [...] "a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading something and then {{not be able to}} stop <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to know what's going to happen next," [...] as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of The Prince's Trust charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in Soweto while the series was filmed.|$|E

500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to care about these people {{in order to be}} worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E
500|$|That's {{really hard}} <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to gauge the}} weather each time {{you have to make}} a decision. As for what {{happened}} last night, I can't comment. I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making decisions based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so {{glad you}} say No." [...] He spoke passionately, and yet there was banter in his voice, {{or so it seemed}} to her. [...] "It is <b>because</b> <b>you</b> fear to be told; it is <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> hoped that I did not know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was laboring {{under the}} idea, my wench, {{that you were}} doing all that <b>because</b> <b>you</b> cared for me," [...] he {{retorted}} with almost brutal curtness, [...] "and <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the desire to become the Princess d'Orléans; that desire is now gratified and ..." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Revival" [...] {{initially}} {{took shape}} as an instrumental, with lyrics as an afterthought. [...] "An instrumental {{has to be}} real catchy and when you succeed it's very satisfying <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> transcended words and communicated with emotion," [...] said Betts. The song takes on a decidedly gospel flair midway through, accentuated by [...] "old-fashioned church-like hand clapping." [...] The Gregg Allman-penned [...] "Don't Keep Me Wonderin'" [...] follows, featuring Duane on slide guitar and Oakley's friend Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "Midnight Rider" [...] developed quickly and featured lyrics contributed by roadie Robert Payne, who threw out a suggestion to Gregg Allman while together at their equipment warehouse. Unable to gain {{a key to the}} nearby Capricorn Sound Studios, the duo broke in and recorded a quick demo with Twiggs Lyndon on bass and Johanson on congas. Duane eventually laid down acoustic guitar tracks for both [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Midnight Rider", as he was quicker to record and more technically savvy due to his session work in Muscle Shoals.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Nhu's agents soon {{reported}} Có's {{activities to}} the palace. When the Ngô brothers confronted Đính with what occurred in Mỹ Tho, Đính feigned astonishment at his deputy's behaviour. He began crying and said [...] "This is my fault, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> suspected me. I {{have not really}} gone {{to work for the}} last 15 days but have stayed at home because I was sad. But I am not against you. I was sad because I thought I was discredited with you. So Nguyễn Hữu Có profited from my absence to make trouble." [...] Đính claimed to know nothing of Có's activities and vowed to have his deputy killed. Nhu opposed this and stated that he wanted keep Có alive to catch the plotters, and tried to use Đính to this end. Nhu ordered Đính and Tung, both of whom took their orders directly from the palace instead of the ARVN command, to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim of the public relations stunt was to give a false impression of the strength of the regime.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not only Mr. Jenney, but--I {{have heard}} {{other people say}} that. And Humphrey Crewe said that you hadn't a chance politically, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> opposed the {{railroad}} and had gone against your own interests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "I {{understand}} that by some means <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got the instrument itself in your possession, but if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> got it <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> paid the amount due, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> received and had recorded a release from Mr. Massie. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> got that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Densher seemed for {{a little}} to look at Lord Mark's {{conviction}} {{as if it were}} a blot on the face of nature. [...] "Do <b>you</b> mean <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> appeared to him to have encouraged him?" ...|$|R
500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the song, and everything you do is in order to help the song shine... You want to make that song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E
500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Lady-mother; <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{to speak}} whole mouthfuls of grave Castillian words. Now, good English can be run {{off in a}} breath. Reyna del Rocio--that's more majestic, but not so like fairyland as Queen of the Dew-drops!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>you</b> forbade me <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not proved me enough, {{and she had}} not proved herself enough; because, moreover, {{she would}} be very wealthy, and with her beauty might look high in marriage, {{although}} but a merchant's daughter." ...|$|R
