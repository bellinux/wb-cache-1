5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{seems to}} have been on good terms with the West Saxons: he stood as sponsor to the baptism of their king, Cynegils, and married Cynegils' daughter. Her name is {{reported}} by only one source, Reginald of Durham's 12th century Vita S. Oswaldi, which says that it was Kyneburga. Although Oswald had one known son, Æthelwald, it is uncertain whether this was a son from his marriage to Cynegils' daughter or from an earlier relationshipsince Æthelwald began ruling in Deira in 651, {{it has been argued that}} a son from this marriage would have been too young at the time to <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> this position, and therefore may have been older, the product of a relationship Oswald had during his exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} {{of the second}} and third Dukes of Norfolk as Lord High Treasurers from 1501 to 1546 led to a gradual reduction in the Exchequer's power. The Dukes were seen by the government as too independent to <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> any real power, but too useful to be removed; as a result, to indirectly reduce their power, the Exchequer was deliberately weakened. When William Paulet was appointed Treasurer in 1546 the Exchequer again increased in power, absorbing the Court of Augmentations and Court of First Fruits and Tenths by 1554. The Exchequer was also assisted in this period by Thomas Fanshawe, the Queen's Remembrancer; a capable man, Fanshawe was often consulted by the Barons of the Exchequer as to the best way to administer the court, and helped standardise pleadings, allowing the Exchequer to cope during a period of increased business. Fanshawe's administrative reforms were considered excellent, and his work continued to be used as the standard until the 1830s.|$|E

Two days later Van Dorn halted the retreat at Grenada. Following the defeat at Corinth, Van Dorn was sent before a court of inquiry to answer for his performance there.

25|$|Wehrmacht officer Heinrich Gimpel astonishes his 10-year-old daughter, Alicia, with {{a secret}} that has been hidden from her all her life: the family is Jewish. He {{explains}} that the Gimpels, friends Walther and Esther Stutzman, and their extended families all belong to those remnants of Jews who now survive by hiding in plain sight within the very society that wants them dead. Now old enough, by family tradition, to <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> this life-or-death deception, Alicia is obliged to hide the truth from her friends, her classmates, and even her younger sisters even as she is forced to regard her school's racist curriculum from a new perspective that leaves her sick and angry over all the anti-Semitic propaganda that she always learned and parroted without question.|$|E

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Steph was {{diagnosed}} with cervical cancer and underwent a hysterectomy. The plot was said to echo {{the true story of}} former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, who died of cervical cancer in 2009. It was devised prior to the appointment of Paul Marquess as executive producer. He chose to continue with it, deciding that {{it would be interesting to}} give Steph another serious storyline, and have a character that viewers [...] "know and love [...] going through a really hard time." [...] In preparation for the storyline, Stenson studied the illness to give her a time-line of the experiences Steph would undergo. She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer, believing that everyone handles it in their own personal way. Additionally, she aimed to make Steph's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible, explaining that: [...] "Steph wouldn't have any prior knowledge about what to expect, and I wanted to see it fresh through her eyes". She was flattered to <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> the storyline, and found it particularly important to get her portrayal right as, during the previous year, she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign.|$|E
500|$|Many {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected {{in some way to}} salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife. The Greek conception of the afterlife included the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul, but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death. In both Greek and Roman traditional religion, no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers. The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions, but evidence about those cults' afterlife beliefs is vague. Apuleius's account, if it is accurate, provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults. The book says Isis's power over fate, which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned, gives her control over life and death. According to the priest who initiates Lucius, devotees of Isis [...] "who had finished their life's span and were already standing on the threshold of light’s end, if only they could safely <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> the great unspoken mysteries of the cult, were frequently drawn forth by the goddess' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life." [...] In another passage, Isis herself says that when Lucius dies {{he will be able to}} see her shining in the darkness of the underworld and worship her there.|$|E

500|$|Other known works {{exist in}} {{fragments}} alone, including the four eschatological {{works in the}} secret tradition: Hypotyposes, Excerpta ex Theodoto, Eclogae Propheticae and the Adumbraetiones. These cover Clement's celestial hierarchy, a complex schema in which the universe is headed by the Face of God, below which lie seven protoctists, followed by archangels, angels and humans. According to Jean Daniélou, this schema is inherited from a Judaeo-Christian esotericism, followed by the Apostles, which was only imparted orally to those Christians who could <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> such mysteries. The proctocists are the first beings created by God, and act as priests to the archangels. Clement identifies them both as the [...] "Eyes of the Lord" [...] and with the Thrones. Clement characterizes the celestial forms as entirely different from anything earthly, although he argues that members of each order only seem incorporeal to those of lower orders. According to the Eclogae Propheticae, every thousand years every member of each order moves up a degree, and thus men can become angels. Even the protoctists can be elevated, although their new position in the hierarchy is not clearly defined. The apparent contradiction between {{the fact that there}} can be only seven protoctists but also a vast number of archangels to be promoted to their order is problematical. The commonest modern explanation is that the number seven is not meant to be taken literally, but has a principally numerological significance.|$|E

2500|$|Still, Hume {{takes care}} to warn that historians are {{generally}} to <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> <b>with</b> confidence, {{so long as}} their reports on facts are extensive and uniform.

But if every historian were to assert that Queen Elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral, and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead, then we'd have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation.
