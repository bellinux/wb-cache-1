This {{exhibition}} placed {{much emphasis on}} highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated {{that the purpose of}} this laboratory was to “show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.” The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order. First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured. One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets. The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.|$|E
500|$|Whitman died on March 26, 1892. An autopsy {{revealed}} his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{a result of}} bronchial pneumonia, and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The {{cause of death was}} officially listed as [...] "pleurisy of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general miliary tuberculosis and parenchymatous nephritis." [...] A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; over 1,000 people visited in three hours. Whitman's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden. Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments. Whitman's friend, the orator Robert Ingersoll, delivered the eulogy. Later, the remains of Whitman's parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{described}} the initial development of Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum, {{as well as}} changes in growth patterns. Morphometric and meristic variables were analyzed during embryonic, larval and juvenile periods, even as allometric growth coefficients for larvae and juveniles. Eggs showed an average diameter of 1. 79 mm and broad perivitelline space (23. 41 %). The total length (TL) of the larvae ranged from 3. 05 to 25. 72 mm, and {{the total number of}} myomeres ranged from 45 to 50 (preanal = 13 - 16 and postanal = 30 - 35). Initial pigmentation is poor, concentrated at the extremities of the yolk sac. In the flexion stage, the pigmentation intensifies and forms a longitudinal stripe extending from the snout to the operculum and two longitudinal stripes on the body, one dorsal and the other ventral, that unite at the caudal peduncle. At first, there is a differential growth of the head and tail, {{and then there is the}} growth of the body, which shows changes in the ontogenetic priorities of feeding, swimming, and <b>breathing</b> <b>capacities.</b> Our results are very important for ecology, systematics, and hatchering, especially in terms of ontogenetic variation in morphology, growth, feeding, behavior, and mortality of P. reticulatum...|$|R

40|$|Background: Following diaphragmatic {{plication}} for unilateral paralysis, {{the effect}} on global chest wall function are unknown. Our hypothesis was that chest wall function would improve in {{both sides of the}} chest after plication of the paralysed side.

Volumes were recorded at quiet <b>breathing.</b> Respiratory <b>capacity</b> improved during quiet breathing when measured before and 6 months after surgery. These improvements occur at the abdominal-rib cage level in both operated and contralateral. Prior to surgery the abdominal rib cage motion was out of phase to the upper rib cage and abdominal compartment in both sides of the chest.

50|$|Cooper himself defines aerobic {{exercise}} {{as the ability}} to utilise the maximum amount of oxygen during exhaustive work. Cooper describes some of the major health benefits of {{aerobic exercise}}, such as gaining more efficient lungs by maximising <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity,</b> thereby increasing ability to ventilate more air in a shorter period of time. As <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> increases, one is able to extract oxygen more quickly into the blood stream, increasing elimination of carbon dioxide. With aerobic exercise the heart becomes more efficient at functioning, and blood volume, hemoglobin and red blood cells increase, enhancing the ability of the body to transport oxygen from the lungs into the blood and muscles. Metabolism will change and enable consumption of more calories without putting on weight. Aerobic exercise can delay osteoporosis as there is an increase in muscle mass, a loss of fat and an increase in bone density. With these variables increasing, there is a decrease in likelihood of diabetes as muscles use sugars better than fat. One of the major benefits of aerobic exercise is that body weight may decrease slowly; it will only decrease at a rapid pace if there is a calorie restriction, therefore reducing obesity rates.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (Respitrace) for estimation of lung volume changes during quiet <b>breathing</b> and vital <b>capacity</b> (VC) manoeuvres was evaluated using {{a variant of the}} multiple linear regression (MLR) technique. We applied this technique successively on quiet breathing, on the whole VC, and on each of the four quarters of the VC separately. This was carried out in six body positions. The best estimation of tidal volumes was obtained when calibration factors calculated during quiet breathing were used. The best estimation of VC was obtained when the calibration factors were adapted to the level of lung inflation. These results indicate that, using a single position MLR calibration method, the Respitrace measures tidal and VC mouth volumes very accurately. The {{accuracy of}} this MLR method for estimation of the rib cage and abdominal contributions was validated by comparison with isovolume calibration factors. Both techniques gave very similar results during tidal breathing.

50|$|Specific {{changes in}} lung volumes also occur during pregnancy. Functional {{residual}} capacity drops 18-20%, typically falling from 1.7 to 1.35 litres, {{due to the}} compression of the diaphragm by the uterus. The compression also causes a decreased total lung capacity (TLC) by 5% and decreased expiratory reserve volume by 20%. Tidal volume increases by 30-40%, from 0.5 to 0.7 litres, and minute ventilation by 30-40% giving an increase in pulmonary ventilation. This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50 mL/min, 20 mL of which goes to reproductive tissues. Overall, the net change in maximum <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> is zero.|$|E

30|$|When {{targeting}} a lesion in image-guided interventions, it is {{not really}} a reliable, consistent lung volume that is important. For a radiologist, it is about the target being in the same position to when the image was acquired. However, to analyse whether the system presented here results in a reproducible target position would require using a CT scanner, resulting in a radiation dose in healthy volunteers. Therefore, this was not an option for this study. Using CT, Chen et al. [1] investigated the motion of lung nodules from full inspiration to end-expiration during tidal volume <b>breathing</b> (i.e. inspiratory <b>capacity).</b> The average motion of all 85 included nodules was 17.6  mm; in the left and right lower lobes, this was 23.8  mm and 25.3  mm, respectively. The average inspiratory capacity of men and women was 3.5  L and 2.4  L, so considering a linear relation, a lung volume change of 100  mL would result in a nodule motion of 1.1  mm and 0.7  mm in the lower lobes, for men and women, respectively [12]. Translating these numbers to the results of this study, one can conclude that even in the lower lung lobes, the biofeedback system can potentially enable men and women to have a predictable consistent nodule position of well below 0.5  mm. Even when considering nodules with extreme respiratory motion from the study by Chen et al. [1] (up to 60  mm), this would result in a reproducibility of the nodule position of within 1  mm.|$|R

Response was assessed quantitatively through health status questionnaires, measures of <b>breathing</b> control, exercise <b>capacity</b> and physical activity and qualitatively, through structured interviews with a clinical psychologist. Results The singing group (n= 13 mean(SD) FEV 1 44. 4 (14. 4) % predicted) and film group (n= 11 FEV 1 63. 5 (25. 5) %predicted) did not differ significantly at baseline.

ObjectivesEight patients performed two maximal incremental cycle-ergometry tests on separate days with inhaled placebo or salbutamol (600 μg) administered before each test in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Primary outcomes were exercise duration (Exdur) in seconds (s) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) in litres/minute (L/min). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) was measured immediately pre-inhaler, post-inhaler and post-exercise. Dyspnoea and leg-discomfort were assessed post-exercise. ResultsWithin-day FEV 1 comparisons demonstrated that the placebo test day FEV 1 improved significantly post-exercise (0. 11 L, p< 0. 05) and the salbutamol test day FEV 1 improved significantly post-inhaler (0. 22 L, p< 0. 001) and post-exercise (0. 07 L, p< 0. 01). Between-day FEV 1 comparisons demonstrated significant improvements in post-inhaler (0. 17 L, p< 0. 05) and post-exercise (0. 13 L, p< 0. 05) FEV 1 following salbutamol.

At low resistance levels, the combined resistances lowered the MBC little more than the inspiratory resistance alone. At higher resistance levels the effect of inspiratory and expiratory resistances were more nearly additive. The breathing rate at which the highest MBC occurred was lowered by increasing the resistance. Thus it was about 100 breaths per minute at the lowest resistance level and about 40 breaths per minute at the highest resistance level. The relationship was such that the tidal volume was the same at the highest MBC at eac...|$|E
40|$|Background: The normal inspiratory to expiratory {{ratio is}} 1 : 2. However, the {{duration}} of inspiration can be increased voluntarily till the ratio becomes 2 : 1. This is called as inverse ratio breathing. The effects of inverse ratio ventilation have been studied on patients with respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. No studies {{have been carried out}} to study the effects of inverse ratio breathing in voluntarily breathing individuals. Hence this study was carried out to find the immediate effects of inverse ratio breathing versus diaphragmatic breathing on inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion. Methods: 30 healthy adult females in the age group 20 - 25 years were included in the study. Inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion at 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostal space was measured using a digital spirometer and an inelastic inch tape respectively. Diaphragmatic breathing was administered for one minute and the same parameters were measured again. A washout period of one day was given and same outcome measures were measured before and after individuals performed inverse ratio breathing {{with the help of a}} visual feedback video for one minute. Results: Data was analysed using Wilcoxon test. There was extremely significant difference between the mean increase in the inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion at the 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostals space after inverse ratio breathing as compared to diaphragmatic breathing (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Inspiratory vital capacity and thoracic expansion increase significantly after inverse ratio breathing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess normal values of thoracoabdominal motions (TAM) during {{spontaneous}} <b>breathing</b> and vital <b>capacity</b> (VC) maneuvers in relation to sex, age, and body position. For this, 120 healthy subjects from 10 to > 60 yr old were studied using the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (Respitrace). The volume-motion coefficients obtained during quiet breathing for the rib cage (RC) were almost twice those for the abdomen (ABD) and were not influenced by sex or age and also not by posture, except for the increased ABD coefficients in the supine posture (p < 0. 05). Under most conditions RC motion predominated over ABD motion, except quiet breathing in the supine position. Sex-related differences in TAM were not found during quiet breathing, yet during VC maneuvers the women were slightly more RC breathing (p < 0. 01). Age-related differences were also only significant during VC maneuvers: men of more than 50 yr old especially became less RC breathing. Posture had a very significant effect (p < 0. 001) during quiet breathing as well as during VC maneuvers: the RC predominance was greatest in the standing posture and least in the supine posture. During VC maneuvers the subjects became more RC breathers than during quiet breathing (p < 0. 001). The X-Y coordinates of RC motion (on the Y axis) versus ABD motion (on the X axis) showed under all conditions a counterclockwise looping during the breathing cycle: the looping was elliptic during quiet breathing but was more irregular and variable during VC maneuvers, and this also depended on body position.

40|$|CPAP is {{the most}} common {{treatment}} for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults. Despite its efficacy, patients’ safety, comfort and compliance are issues to be considered and improved in CPAP design. The issues include condensation, carbon dioxide in inhaled air, humidity and temperature of inhaled air. When a CPAP user breaths deeply, there will be some air not fully expelled and may be driven back into the heated air delivery tube (HADT). An interest has existed in what impacts this so called reverse flow may bring about to the CPAP use. The main objectives of this research are to quantify the reverse flow and its influence on carbon dioxide re-breathing, delivered humidity to the patient and condensation in the HADT. Within this thesis, two computer models of the CPAP system have been constructed on Simulink™ in the Matlab™ environment. One is about the CPAP fluid dynamic performance and carbon dioxide re-breathing and the other is on thermodynamic performance. The models can predict the dynamic behaviour of the CPAP machine. They are able to mimic the breath induced airflow fluctuation, and flow direction changes over wide real working ranges of ambient conditions, settings and coefficients. These models can be used for future analysis, development, improvement and design of the machine. The fluid dynamic and thermodynamic models were experimentally validated and they have proved to be valuable tool in the work. The main conclusions drawn from this study are: •	Reverse flow increases when breaths load increases and pressure setting decreases. •	Reverse flow does not definitely add exhaled air to the next inhalation unless the reverse flow is relatively too much. •	Mask capacity does not influence the reverse flow. •	The exhaled air re-breathed is mainly due to that stays in the mask, therefore larger mask capacity increases the exhaled air re-breath and the percentage of exhaled air in next inhalation drops when the breath load increases. •	Deep breathing does not significantly change the total evaporation in chamber. •	When deep breathing induced reverse flow occurs, condensation occurs or worsens in the HADT near the mask. This happens only when the humidity of the airflow from the CPAP is much lower than that of the exhaled air and the tube wall temperature is low enough for condensation to occur. •	The deep breathing and reverse flow do not significantly influence the average inhaled air temperature. •	The overall specific humidity in inhaled air is lower under deep <b>breathing.</b> •	Mask <b>capacity</b> does not influence the thermal conditions in the HADT and the inhaled air specific humidity. Also the mask capacity does not significantly influences the inhaled air temperature...|$|R
