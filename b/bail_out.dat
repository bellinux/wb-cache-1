5|$|From November 1 to 26, he flew 17 {{missions}} in the Sinanju and Uiju areas, most resulting in no combat. On November 27, Davis was leading a formation of eight F-86s on a patrol near Sinanju, when they spotted and attacked six MiG-15s. He immediately downed {{one of the}} MiGs, striking its fuselage and forcing the pilot to <b>bail</b> <b>out.</b> He pursued a second MiG-15 to Koch'ong-ni and damaged it, forcing its pilot to <b>bail</b> <b>out,</b> as well. In all, four of the MiG-15s were destroyed by Davis' patrol.|$|E
5|$|On 4/5 May the Luftwaffe hit Exeter severely. That night MacLachlan claimed {{destroyed}} two He 111s of Küstenfliegergruppe 506. He trailed the German bombers back to France {{and attacked}} {{them where they}} believed they were safe. In fact both of his victims were Ju 88s which crashed near Dinard. From Feldwebel Robert Bogel's Wrk Nr. 1528, only the gunner was able to <b>bail</b> <b>out,</b> while observer Leutnant zur See (naval rank) Roman Wallner and Obergefreiter Johan Beibl were killed. There was only one survivor from Unteroffizier Josef Palmer's Ju 88D-4 Wrk Nr. 1154; Unteroffizier Karl Schorn managed to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> but Leutnant zur See Ernst Tramp and Richard Staub were killed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Lamason was {{a regular}} speaker at KLB (initials for Konzentrationslager Buchenwald) Club reunions, a club formed by the allied airmen while {{detained}} in Buchenwald. Lamason was {{also a member of}} the Caterpillar Club, an informal association of people who have successfully used a parachute to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> of a disabled aircraft.|$|E

25|$|On 17 December 1944 I./JG 11 {{was heavily}} engaged by P-47s over Munstereifel {{and later by}} P-38 Lightnings. Four German pilots were wounded with Unteroffizier Liebeck <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> successfully. Unteroffizier Heyer, flying Black 1 shot down one P-38 before being seriously wounded and <b>bailing</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the 358th Fighter Squadron of the 355th Fighter Wing. The claim is based on gun camera footage and recollections of Mayer's wingman, who was forced to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> during the action. Mayer was buried at the cemetery of Beaumont-le-Roger, France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de Lisieux.|$|E
5|$|Separate {{provisions}} allow {{a covered}} jurisdiction {{that has been}} certified to receive federal observers to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> of its certification alone. Under Section 13, the Attorney General may terminate the certification of a jurisdiction if 1) more than 50% of the jurisdiction's minority voting age population is registered to vote, and 2) {{there is no longer}} reasonable cause to believe that residents may experience voting discrimination. Alternatively, the District Court for D.C. may order the certification terminated.|$|E

5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} basic design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to <b>bail</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The eurozone crisis {{resulted}} {{from a combination of}} complex factors, including the globalisation of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the financial crisis of 2007–08; international trade imbalances; real estate bubbles that have since burst; the Great Recession of 2008–2012; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by states to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.|$|E

He {{was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 October 1943 and was killed in action a week later on 8 October during an attack on Bremen. It is believed that he was shot down by the P-47 Thunderbolt pilot Robert S. Johnson. Philipp managed to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> but his parachute failed to open.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E

50|$|In April 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and {{his crew}} <b>bailed</b> <b>out</b> in China after the Tokyo raid.

5|$|To counter this threat, the Admiralty {{developed}} the fighter catapult ship a converted freighter, manned by a naval crew, carrying a single Hawker Hurricane fighter. When an enemy bomber was sighted, the fighter would be launched {{into the air}} with rockets, and fly up to destroy or drive away the bomber. Being large and slow, the Fw 200 became a rather vulnerable target. After the combat, the fighter pilot would <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> or ditch in the ocean near the convoy, and be picked up if all went well.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic tension {{continued}} to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah for the UMNO Presidency in 1987. Around this time, several deposit-taking co-operatives (DTCs), some associated with the MCA, collapsed. To save Chinese investors, the MCA asked the government to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> the DTCs, citing a previous bailout of Bumiputra financial institutions. UMNO's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai to warn that the MCA might quit the government. Later that year, the government posted several non-Chinese-educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools. Anwar Ibrahim, then Education Minister, refused to yield to protests from the MCA, and stated that the decision was final, despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities.|$|E

5|$|He {{claimed his}} {{first of two}} aerial {{victories}} in the Battle of France on 20May 1940. Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte, an element of two aircraft, with Unteroffizier (non-commissioned officer) Fritz Marcks as his wingman. The Schwarm (flight) led by Oberleutnant (Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann, Marcks and Scholz claiming one each. His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk-75 on 26May 1940. In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells tore off {{large parts of the}} aircraft's tail fin, which then collided with Osterrmann's starboard wing. The French pilot was observed to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg {{was killed}} in action in his Bf109G-2 (Werknummer 16 381) on 23 March 1943 over Tunisia when his 135th victim, a USAAF 52nd Fighter Group Spitfire {{exploded}} {{in front of him}} after a close burst of cannon fire. The Spitfire was piloted by Captain Theodore Sweetman. Müncheberg managed to <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> and landed severely wounded. Although the search team quickly recovered him, Müncheberg died {{on the way to a}} field hospital. Captain Hugh L. Williamson, who was also shot down in the engagement, later stated that Sweetmann had deliberately rammed Müncheberg with his burning Spitfire. Müncheberg was buried originally at El Aouina; his remains were moved to the Heroes Cemetery at Tunis and later reinterred in the 1950s at the German Military Cemetery at Bordj-Cedria. The Wehrmachtbericht announced his death on 25 March 1943.|$|E
