25|$|The cars, as built, {{featured}} an old {{style of}} WABCO passenger <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule {{was known as}} AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore {{for the purposes of}} this notation, the P has been included in parentheses – as in Braking Schedule AM(P) – to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a braking effort took a few seconds to apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his braking effort so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the brakes). The AM(P) setup required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to.|$|E
25|$|L11 - Built in 1964 {{from two}} 1931 Standard Stock {{vehicles}} (numbers 3080 and 3109), this vehicle {{followed the same}} concept as L10, as both donor vehicles had some of their passenger compartments cut off and the two cabs and control sections were joined back to back. The resulting locomotive was a single vehicle Bo-Bo. A small section of the passenger compartment remained, {{and most of the}} air system and <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> was moved into it from beneath the frames, so that it could be more easily maintained. The vehicle had four WT54A motors, which were wired so that each pair remained permanently in series. Thus they worked at half voltage, but the slow-speed characteristics were better-suited for shunting. Dual couplings for tube and sub-surface stock were fitted at the Acton end only. The front door was blocked off, but had a low-level screen, to enable the driver to see the couplings more easily. When first built, it carried a maroon livery, but was painted yellow in 1983. It saw use until the early 1990s and since preservation in 2004, has been on display outside Epping tube station.|$|E
500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a reduced capacity tender {{based upon the}} Merchant Navy version. [...] It could carry [...] water and [...] of coal on a six-wheel underframe. It retained the BFB wheels and streamlining panels, or [...] "raves", that gave {{the top of the}} tender a similar cross-sectional outline to carriages. As with the Merchant Navy class, the water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> of a clasp-type similar to that on the locomotive. Four train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space.|$|E

5000|$|An initial inquiry put {{the blame}} for the {{accident}} on a faulty train-stop trip <b>brake</b> <b>equipment,</b> but this was misleading.|$|R
500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a new [...] tender which could carry 5 tons (5.1 t) of coal on a six-wheel chassis. [...] It featured BFB wheels and streamlined panels, or [...] "raves", {{that gave the}} top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to the carriages hauled by the locomotive. [...] The water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> of a clasp-type similar to that used on the locomotive. [...] Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. [...] Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water filler caps were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. [...] The original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when water surges caused the welded joints to split. [...] The problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted.|$|E
2500|$|Fitted with 6,800 litre {{fuel tanks}} the class {{were capable of}} running from Melbourne to Adelaide without refuelling. Electrical and {{electronic}} components are modular to minimise delays after failures, and a reactive muffler system reduces the exhaust noise level. While {{most of them have}} only been used on broad gauge, three of them have been converted to [...] by exchanging the wheelsets and repositioning the <b>braking</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The SR Z {{class was}} {{considered}} at first, {{but due to}} the specialist characteristics of the design as a yard engine for marshalling freight, they were not deemed fit {{for the purpose of}} hauling loads under the tight timings of London's railway system. The solution was a smaller wheeled version of the ill-fated K1 class with three cylinders to allow for better acceleration, with three sets Walschaerts valve gear. The resultant W class, was designed in 1929. As a result of the rebuilding of the 'River' K1 class 2-6-4 tank engines following the Sevenoaks railway accident, the surplus bogies and leading wheels were earmarked for the new design. The 2-6-4 wheel arrangement was settled upon as being ideal for intensive suburban routes, and the use of parts from the K Class and the same boiler as used on the N, N1 and U1 classes enabled the standardization of Southern locomotives to continue. The locomotives were provided with [...] heavy <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> to cater for freight wagons with or without continuous brakes that were in circulation at the time. With this in mind, the class were unusually provided with extra braking on the bogies and trailing wheels.|$|E
50|$|The 36/42 stock had one coach-mounted brake {{cylinder}} only; 46 stock had Westinghouse electro-pneumatic air brakes and automatic <b>brake</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R

50|$|These include offices, a {{workshop}} and reasonably large stores. The workshop contains high quality facilities for pantograph overhaul, tap-changer overhaul and <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> test and servicing.|$|R
50|$|Look for hot {{and cold}} wheels which are {{generally}} caused by <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> failures.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} did {{not have}} their own <b>braking</b> <b>equipment.</b> Braking could only be achieved using a hand-operated screw brake on the tender.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, a Westinghouse system {{replaced}} the existing <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> so enabling {{the rolling stock}} to travel on the Chemin de fer Aigle-Ollon-Monthey-Champéry line.|$|E

5000|$|In VGA, {{the train}} is pulled through the [...] "adjuster" [...] at about 10 km/h (2.77 m/s) without any need to {{uncouple}} the wagons or disconnect (and test) the <b>brake</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Davies and Metcalfe had an {{arrangement}} with Oerlikon and sold railway air <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> {{under the name}} Metcalfe-Oerlikon. This was fitted to some British Railways diesel locomotives, e.g., Classes 45 and 46.|$|R
50|$|G wagons {{were often}} {{attached}} to passenger trains {{in order to}} transport express goods and post. Special variants were sometimes used that, for example, were fitted with suitable <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> or heating pipes.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009 QR National ordered twelve 6000 class {{units for}} use on coal and {{intermodal}} haulage. The first was delivered in October 2009. These units were to be fitted with electronically controlled pneumatic <b>braking</b> <b>equipment,</b> for operation with similarly fitted container wagons.|$|E

5000|$|Five of the Board's {{combination}} trams were {{fitted with}} extra brakes {{for use on}} the Hills section. Later, ten [...] "Hills" [...] trams were ordered especially for use on the Hills line and also had the extra <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> fitted. Eventually there were 13 Hills cars in service. These were the only trams used on this section.|$|E
5000|$|The Class 33-200 {{locomotives}} {{spent their}} entire SAR working lives {{operating out of}} East London. After some of the locomotives were sold by the SAR, their dynamic <b>braking</b> <b>equipment,</b> located in the high short hood, was removed {{by some of the}} new owners and the short hoods were rebuilt to low noses.

50|$|The {{locomotives}} use a 2.7MW German-built MTU 20V 4000R43 engine, {{expected to}} have 5-10% increased fuel efficiency over other locomotives, Wabtec <b>braking</b> <b>equipment,</b> and ZD126C traction motors. The cab layout incorporates design elements from British Rail Class 60 with a near-central pedestal controller. They also have the same Co-Co wheel arrangement as the DF and DX classes, {{as opposed to the}} Bo-Bo-Bo layout of the EF’s.|$|E
50|$|Siemens is {{the main}} {{contractor}} for the vehicles and markets the coach design as Viaggio Comfort. <b>Brake</b> <b>equipment</b> is supplied by Knorr-Bremse, air-conditioning by Liebherr, and doors, carriage connections, toilets and seats are manufactured by other subcontractors.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1900 {{the company}} had 210 engines fitted with {{continuous}} <b>brake</b> <b>equipment,</b> and 97% of passenger mileage was under such conditions. 2,021,266 train miles were run with the automatic vacuum brake, and 69,160 with Westinghouse.|$|R
50|$|The PRR was {{the first}} American {{railroad}} to adopt the Westinghouse air brake, the first tests of which were made in September 1869; Class A locomotives were among those fitted with air <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> for those earliest tests.|$|R

5000|$|Equipment {{as built}} {{included}} load sensing [...] "Metacone" [...] air suspension, rheostatic braking, hydraulic parking brake, pneumatic camshaft control by GEC and Brush DC motors of type LT117, with each Dm car having four motors. Air supply was by Reavell reciprocating compressors and <b>braking</b> <b>equipment</b> was by Westinghouse. The guard's door controls {{were in the}} driver's cab; this eased conversion to one-man operation in 1983-4, the first LU line to do so.|$|E
50|$|A third tender {{closed on}} 20 February 1974, for an {{additional}} eight or ten locomotives, this time rated for 2,200hp. The specifications were similar to the as-delivered X37-X44, but with upgraded <b>braking</b> <b>equipment.</b> The reasoning for the order was that, as well as traffic increases (now up to 13.5 million train miles per year), the earlier diesel-electric locomotives were coming due for major overhauls, with no spare motive power to fill the gaps in the rosters (with all steam long-since gone).|$|E
50|$|The former BVZ {{vehicles}} {{are used to}} power both push-pull trains and locomotive hauled passenger and goods trains between Zermatt and Brig. Since 2006, they have also been in service on the Oberalp Pass, but they lack the <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> required for the Schöllenenbahn.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} is {{fitted with}} both rheostatic and regenerative braking, {{in addition to}} standard westinghouse air <b>brake</b> <b>equipment.</b> An electrical train bus is fitted to enable two locomotives to work in multiple formation, either double-heading or push-pull train with a Driving Van Trailer or DBSO.|$|R
5000|$|... 316-321 were wood body 52 seat coaches {{built by}} Jewett in 1913-1914. These {{were the last}} wood body cars bought. #319-321 {{received}} new model [...] motors, control <b>equipment,</b> and <b>brake</b> <b>equipment</b> around 1922. These three cars were usually assigned together and/or with control trailers.|$|R
