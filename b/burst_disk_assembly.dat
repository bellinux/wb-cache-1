40|$|Bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{are very}} {{important}} parts in auto engine and gas turbine, and is widely used in practical engineering. The mistuning existing commonly in the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> can destroy the vibration characteristics of the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies,</b> {{which is one of}} the reasons for the high cycle fatigue failure of bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies,</b> so it is necessary to research how to reduce the vibration of the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies.</b> On the basis of the review of relevant research at home and abroad, the mistuning vibration mechanism of the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> is introduced, and the main technical methods of the vibration damping of bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> are reviewed, such as artificially active mistuning, collision damping, friction damping and optimization of the blade position. Some future research directions are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Alternate designs {{have also}} been used which use a sharp {{projectile}} to puncture the <b>burst</b> <b>disk,</b> like a mortar [...] or using a manual puncturing device to trigger failure of the disk. These allow total control over <b>burst</b> <b>disk</b> cannons {{without the need for}} hybrid technology and materials as simple as plastic tape can be used for the disk.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum bazooka uses a {{straight}} tube which is sealed with {{a type of}} <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> at the launch end and by the projectile at the other. A tee-piece at the launch end allows application of vacuum. When the projectile is released the air pressure behind the projectile causes it to accelerate towards the vacuum port. When the projectile reaches the vacuum port its momentum causes it to continue past and break through the <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> towards the target. A lightweight <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> such {{as a piece of}} paper can be secured simply by the vacuum action when it is held against the barrel.|$|R

5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} cylinder valve includes a <b>bursting</b> <b>disk,</b> a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|R

The model incorporates a generalized method for describing the mistuning of the assembly through the introduction of specific mistuning modes. The model is used to develop a computational bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> model {{for a series of}} parametric studies. Results are presented demonstrating that the response amplitudes of bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> depend both on the excitation mode and on the mistune mode...|$|R

50|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>Disk</b> Valve: Used {{in a few}} {{pneumatics}} but {{primarily in}} hybrid cannons, burst valves are considered the ideal pressure release mechanism as they allow an unobstructed flow of high pressure air. <b>Burst</b> <b>disks</b> have no moving parts, making them very reliable. They are very appealing for hybrid cannons because they can withstand the low pressure gas mix in the chamber before ignition, yet fail as planned upon successful ignition. The high pressure combustion gases are released into the barrel at a rate which generates greater velocities than a mechanical valve could allow. Pneumatic cannon burst discs work similarly. The disc and projectile are loaded, and the chamber is pressurised until the disc ruptures. Unfortunately, this usually does not give the operators {{much in the way}} of control over timing, although a puncturing mechanism can be used. <b>Burst</b> <b>disks</b> are of no specific material and may consist of plastic or thin sheet metal or foil.|$|R

40|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>disks,</b> {{commonly}} used in pressure relief applications, were studied as single-use valves. A dual-burst disk design was chosen for primary investigation for systems involving separation of gases of two significantly different pressures. The two disks are used to seal either end of a piston cavity that has a different cross-sectional area on each side. Different piston surface areas are used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, P{sub 1 }A{sub 1 } = P{sub 2 }A{sub 2 }. The single-use valve functions when the downstream pressure is reduced to approximately atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure differential that causes the <b>burst</b> <b>disks</b> to fail. Several parameters were studied to determine the optimum design of the <b>burst</b> <b>disk.</b> These parameters include thickness, diameter, area/pressure ratio, scoring, and disk geometry. The disk material was limited to 304 L stainless steel. Factors that were considered essential to the optimization of the design were robustness, manufacturability, and burst pressure variability. The thicknesses of the disks that were studied range from 0. 003 in. to 0. 010 in. A model for predicting burst pressures of the <b>burst</b> <b>disks</b> was derived. The model combines membrane stress theory with force/displacement data to predict the burst pressure of various designs to within {+-} 10 %. This model results from studies that characterize the behavior of individual small and large disks. Welding techniques used to join the dual-disk assembly are discussed. Laser welds are used to join and seal the disks to the bulkhead. These welds were optimized for repeatability and robustness. Resistance upset welding is suggested for joining the dual-disk assembly to the pressure vessel body. Resistance upset weld parameters were developed for this particular design so as to minimize the side effects on the burst-disk performance and to provide high-quality welds...|$|R

Following development of the weld, a set of about eight vessels will be fabricated for tritium storage tests. These tests will demonstrate functioning of the dual-burst <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> in addition to demonstrating long-term compatibility of the plug weld for tritium service...|$|R

40|$|Although a bladed disk is {{typically}} designed to have identical blades, manufacturing tolerances, wear, and other causes may cause random deviations among the blades. The blade-to-blade discrepancies, denoted as mistuning, lead to vibratory responses mostly concentrated in small {{regions of the}} bladed-disk assembly, according to a phenomenon called localization. The resulting spatial confinement of the vibration energy causes the responses of some blades to become dangerously high and increases the amplitude of the bladed-disk assembly's overall response. The attendant increase in stresses can lead to premature high cycle fatigue (HCF) of the blades. In this study we investigate whether vibration localization in a perfectly symmetric bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> may occur {{in the presence of}} nonlinearity. To this end, the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of a simplified model of a bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> are computed.

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that a bolt-nut {{assembly}} system properly tightened can be loosened under vibrating load or impact. This paper experimentally investigates the loosening response of an assembly when a stress wave is transmitted from a gross area of a bolt, a face of a circular disk, or a screw thread of the thick circular <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> fastened by the bolt-nut unit. When a falling bar strikes {{the opposite side of}} a threaded rod fastened to the circular disk, or a falling circular pipe collides with the circular disk or with the anvil attached {{to the end of a}} screw, a stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a hexagonal nut in conjunction with a plain washer is measured, while a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly. The shift of axial stress due to the stress wave transmitted from the portion of the screw thread is the largest. The cause of the loosening is investigated by observing the stress waves transmitted into the circular <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> system...|$|R

50|$|The hybrid {{electrothermal}} light-gas gun {{works on}} similar {{principles of the}} standard light-gas gun, but adds an electric arc to heat the light gas to a higher temperature and pressure than the piston alone. The arc is applied in the chamber containing the light gas, raising the temperature and pressure {{to the point where}} the gas both breaks the <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> and ignites the propellant behind the piston, which is perforated to allow ignition. The resulting combination of electrical heating and piston compression provide higher pressures and temperatures, resulting in more power and a higher potential speed than a standard light-gas gun.|$|R
