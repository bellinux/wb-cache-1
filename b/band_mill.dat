50|$|Today, head saws {{are mostly}} used for cutting logs 16 to 72 inches in {{diameter}} depending upon the type of <b>band</b> <b>mill</b> the saws are mounted on. More optimized machines now cut the smaller diameters since they are far more efficient and can provide greater production.|$|E
50|$|The Gaelic punk <b>band</b> <b>Mill</b> a h-Uile Rud were {{featured}} in the BBC arts documentary series Ealtainn, which followed them {{on a tour of}} Europe and filmed them at concerts in the Gaelic-speaking heartland of the Isle of Lewis.

50|$|The {{successor}} to Mr. Bachman was Mr. Severn P. Ker, who had {{many years of}} experience in the commercial side of the steel industry. Under Mr. Ker's direction, the company continued to increase its capacity and to extend its operations. In 1910, a sixth open hearth furnace was built, and a 14” <b>band</b> <b>mill</b> was added to the production line. In 1913, another open hearth furnace and certain auxiliary equipment were added, which raised the annual capacity of the company to 180,000 tons of open hearth ingots.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} built in 1907 as the Black Mountain Railway, an 8 mi standard-gauge line running from Kona, where it {{connected}} with the South and Western Railroad (a predecessor of the Clinchfield), to Bowditch, where a <b>band</b> <b>mill</b> was built to process lumber. The Black Mountain Ry. was extended from Micaville to Burnsville by 1912 and on to Pensacola, Murchison, and Eskota, with a short 2 mi logging spur built from near Burnsville to Athlone in 1913 to tap the area's lumber reserves. The Micaville-Eskota line was envisioned {{as part of a}} longer through route to Asheville, North Carolina, 40 mi south of Eskota, which would allow the Black Mountain Railway to break the monopoly held by the Southern Railway in that area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed by Kathryn NicAoidh (drums), Tomaidh MacAilpein (bass), Greg MacThòmais (guitar) and Tim Armstrong (voice and keyboard).

5000|$|Ceàrr was {{the first}} album by the Celtic rock <b>band</b> <b>Mill</b> a h-Uile Rud. Ceàrr {{was the first}} CD of all-new Gaelic songs ever {{released}} and {{was also the first}} CD produced with exclusively Gaelic liner notes. Runrig's album Play Gaelic was the first album of all-Gaelic music in a modern, rock and roll style, but along with new compositions, featured rock re-workings of several traditional songs, and Oi Polloi's EP, Carson?, was the first vinyl album of all-new rock compositions in Gaelic. Ceàrr is also notable for its sexual themes and strong obscenity; a rarity in the ultra-conservative modern Gaelic music scene. [...] The name of the album means wrong in Gaelic, and the band chose this name as a statement of their belief that you should use Gaelic, even if you don't feel entirely confident in the language.|$|E
5000|$|Graf Brothers' {{headquarters}} and main sales {{office is a}} site of 70 acre in South Shore, Kentucky. This area houses a log yard of 5 acre that can hold up to [...] of logs under water, an ultra high-tech <b>band</b> <b>mill,</b> 18 kilns capable of drying 2 MMBF of lumber per month, a Walnut steamer, several warehouses, and two state-of-the-art computerized rip lines for manufacturing ripped-to-width lumber and flooring blanks. All of these facilities have been built since the site was acquired in 2003. Graf Brothers also operates satellite log yards in Vanceburg, Kentucky, and Chillicothe, Ohio. In addition to its own mill, Graf Brothers is supplied by two dedicated contract sawmills, Brown Brothers Lumber in Otway, Ohio, and Redoutey Lumber in Henley, Ohio. Appalachian Wood Floors (AWF), owned by the Grafs' brother Jim, molds the flooring exclusively for Graf Brothers at its plant in nearby Portsmouth, Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|Number 110, 2-6-2, {{built by}} the Vulcan Iron Works in 1927 as McRae Lumber & Manufacturing Gulf number 1. Later went to the Beechwood <b>Band</b> <b>Mill</b> in Cordele, Georgia, and was {{acquired}} by the Cliffside in 1933. The engine made its final run on July 23, 1962, after which the railroad switched entirely to diesel powered operations and the 110 was placed in reserve until it was sold to the Swamp Rabbit Railroad in Cleveland, South Carolina, a year later. Swamp Rabbit eventually sold the engine to the Stone Mountain Scenic Railroad, where it was given the name [...] "Yonah II" [...] and operated around Stone Mountain Park until it encountered running gear issues and was withdrawn in 1982. In 1984, the 110 was placed on display outside the Stone Mountain's Memorial Depot. In late 2012, Stone Mountain has sold the 110 to the New Hope Valley Railway in Bonsal, NC. Current plans are to bring her home to NC and eventually restore the locomotive to operation on their 4.5 mile tourist railroad.|$|E

The engine went to the Beechwood <b>Band</b> <b>Mill</b> in Cordele, Georgia, in 1930 before being sold in 1933 to the Cliffside Railroad. The Cliffside retired the engine when the road dieselized in 1962, and sold it the following year to the Swamp Rabbit Railroad in Cleveland, South Carolina, who sold the engine to Stone Mountain in 1969. [...] First steam locomotive to be withdrawn from active service, having encountered running gear issues in 1982. Placed {{on display at the}} Memorial Depot in 1984. The Stone Mountain Memorial Association donated the engine to the New Hope Valley Railway in Bonsal, North Carolina in 2012, and the engine was moved to the railway in early February 2013. The New Hope Valley intends to restore the engine to operating condition, which is anticipated to take five to seven years at an estimated cost of $600,000 based on an initial survey of the engine performed in 2012. The engine was given a cosmetic restoration and placed on display, while the railway continues to evaluate the engine's components and raise funds for operation.|$|E
5000|$|Mill a h-Uile Rud broke {{new ground}} in Gaelic music, but they now admit {{that when they}} started they didn't fully {{understand}} the Gaelic music scene. In an interview aired on BBC Alba, Tim explained, [...] "In the beginning we were so naive," [...] and that it wasn't until later that they appreciated the novelty {{of what they were}} doing. Song topics frequently deal with sex which is unusual for contemporary Gaelic music. However the band and others contend that this is in keeping with Gaelic bardic tradition and traditional poets from past centuries such as Iain Lom and Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair. As a <b>band,</b> <b>Mill</b> a h-Uile Rud are highly critical of much Celtic Punk that, in their opinion, sells a cheesy, beer-soaked stereotype of Gaelic culture. They are also noted for their hard-core stance on Gaelic use in and around the band. In a Gaelic music scene where the language is often exploited as a showcase without much actual practical use outside of the songs themselves, Mill a h-Uile Rud stand out for not only singing in Gaelic, but using it in packaging, on their websites, on the stage and with each other. Mill a h-Uile Rud have also never allowed any official translations of their songs.|$|E
50|$|Lahey's Canungra Sawmill {{was again}} badly damaged by {{fire in the}} early hours of 13 January 1906. The main {{building}} which housed the sawing operations was completely destroyed. Up-to-date equipment recently imported from the United States of America was lost, including a broom handle machine, sand-papering machine and butter box printing machine. Several new additions to the mill operations, including a new drying kiln and planning machine shed were, however, saved. The fire forced the closure of the mill for three months.The rebuild following this fire was complemented by improvements between 1907 and 1908. Electric log-hauling machinery was installed. The tramway servicing the mill was extended over time and by 1910 the main line was 13½ km long with a branch 2 km up Flying Fox Creek and a sub-branch 500m up Little Flying Fox Creek to service a new aerial ropeway on Beech Mountain. Eventually, the total length of track laid amounted to 26½ km. Usage of the tramway continued to increase so that during 1915 alone, 15,000 tons of logs were being hauled to the mill along the tramway.In 1913, Tom Lahey left Australia on an inspection of milling operations in the United States of America. The Lahey's were interested in purchasing new milling machinery and keen to stay abreast of the latest trends in sawmilling practice. A range of new equipment was purchased, and once installed, the capacity of the mill doubled and the cost of labour greatly reduced. The introduction of an eight-foot <b>band</b> <b>mill</b> and steam log turner made the Lahey's Canungra Sawmill the biggest softwood mill in Queensland. In its heyday, the mill was producing Australia's largest output of softwood timber. In the process, the township of Canungra was established because of the presence and success of the mill.|$|E
