40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{potential}} of nuclear energy in general and in our country. Nuclear energy offers as almost a necessary alternative to fill growing demand for electricity in our country and the world. Increased {{attention is paid to}} the electricity market in our country, the role of nuclear energy in the Czech energy mix and the possibilities of its use in the future as an alternative to other energy sources (renewable, fossil resources), and savings and imports from abroad. The author summarizes the main benefits, but also the risk that nuclear energy <b>brings.</b> <b>Does</b> not forget the attitude of environmentalists, opponents and the public to the nuclear issue, which improves long-term, giving scope for the use of nuclear energy...|$|E
40|$|The thesis uses Bangladesh as a {{model to}} test a "dependence paradigm". It posits that the sudden influx of {{resources}} that foreign aid <b>brings</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily lead to the social development and equitable economic growth {{which might have been}} expected because micro-economic forces tend to predominate over conventional macro-economic development theory. Instead it results in increasing inequity. The government and upper classes divert the largest proportion of the resources being provided and use them for reasons other than that for which they were meant. More inequitable distribution of income in turn justifies the continued need for foreign aid. The aid provided, justified by poverty, becomes a necessary part of the government's resources, discouraging domestic resource mobilisation and self-reliance. The dimensions of poverty and the nature and evidence of the country's dependence are reviewed. As the amount of aid "appropriated" increases, the government is increasingly dependent on its continuation and more constrained by the conditions attached to it by the donors. The paper then goes on to explain that foreign aid donors tolerate this diversion of aid resources because they measure the results of aid in terms of quantity, not quality. Nor are they prepared to provide adequate means by which to plan, administer, monitor and evaluate the use to which aid is put. The quality of aid is not an issue that serves either their domestic needs or foreign policy objectives. The successes in Bangladesh are shown to be attributable either to market forces or to foreign aid which does not lend itself to diversion by the upper classes. Some comparisons show that the phenomenon of a "resource windfall" leading to "appropriation" by the upper classes exists in other countries and is not unique to Bangladesh. The study concludes that unless appropriate aid is provided with sound ad-ministration, which uses, to the fullest, available expertise in the country, then increasing inequity and dependence are bound to result...|$|E
40|$|Tese de mestrado em Desenho, apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa através da Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2006 The {{resource}} {{to the computer}} has more and more importance in the society. In the artistic field this is also true, though a deep knowledge of what are the surplus values what this fact <b>brings</b> <b>does</b> not exists. The following thesis have an objective: aim to mark an artistic territory inside the digital drawing, in other words, the digital drawing in fact is a drawing, and like drawing that it is it can be artistic. The thesis is supported in five points; the first one equivalent to chapter two {{is the basis of}} the drawing, his time, his relation with the digital drawing. Also in this point the relevance or not of digital drawing is treated in several situations – when it is more efficient. This because computer aided drawing is not a way of substitution of conventional drawing but only another type of drawing. So being, the analogical drawing it will be more appropriate for certain situations and the digital drawing will be more appropriate for others. Chapter three is connected to technical questions where the ways of digital drawing will be described, and principally the characteristics very often erroneous allied with the digital form of drawing. In this chapter some parallelisms are established between the digital drawing and the conventional drawing, like the use of structure or the drawing process itself. Chapter’s four to six will be pointed to methods and generic techniques for a digital construction of drawing, always illustrated from a purely theoretical way and also with the resource of relevant examples. In these chapters demystification is claimed regarding the digital drawing, since it can be easily executed by artists, or draftsmen with essential formation in this area. While demystifying the processes connected with the computer it intends to demonstrate that the difficult thing is not to control the concepts inherent in the graphic computation, the difficult thing keeps on being to dra...|$|E
