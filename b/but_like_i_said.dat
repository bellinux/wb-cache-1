500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
2500|$|Scientology minister-in-training and professed Christian, Craig Gehring, {{was quoted}} in 2007 in The Advocate as saying he thought that his belief in Jesus {{as the son of}} God did not {{conflict}} with his being a Scientologist: [...] "Personally, I believe [...] the son of God - son of man, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> that is not a Scientology doctrine. There isn't a doctrine about [...] in Scientology." [...] I believe very much in the Christian message. Jesus says time and time again, 'The kingdom of God is at hand.' ...

[...] Gehring said that during his time studying Scientology at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana mission, he had not encountered teachings of Scientology space opera as had been reported in 2006 in Rolling Stone.|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski led 383 laps {{on his way}} to {{his fourth}} win of the season. [...] "What a night," [...] said Keselowski. [...] "Part of me, I pulled into victory lane and I pinched myself once to make sure I wasn't dreaming. These are nights you don't forget as a driver and you live for. The Miller Lite Ford Fusion was just flying, and this is I'm couldn't ask for a better way to enter the Chase than to win and take the first seed. We're ready. We want to run for another Cup. We really feel like this team has it." [...] "You know, it's {{definitely}} frustrating not making that Chase, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> when you do make the Chase, {{you want it to be}} for a championship, not just ride around in it," [...] said a disappointed Clint Bowyer.|$|E

5000|$|During the 2012-13 NHL lockout, the Senators {{assigned}} Cowen {{to their}} AHL farm team in Binghamton {{in order to}} give him the opportunity to play at a competitive level. He suffered what was expected to be a season-ending hip injury on October 6, 2012, in a game against the Albany Devils. Cowen underwent surgery on November 17, 2012, in New York to repair a torn labrum in his left hip. By March 27, 2013, Cowen was able to practice with the Senators [...] and he was finally able to return to the Ottawa lineup on April 16, 2013, much sooner than initial estimate of six to eight months. His return to the lineup was a memorable one, as he delivered a clean open-ice hit 13 minutes into the game which caused Carolina star forward Jeff Skinner to leave the game and not return. Cowen later fought both Chad LaRose and Kevin Westgarth. [...] "I think it's the first two-fight game I've had since junior, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it", <b>said</b> Cowen of his first game back.|$|R

2500|$|Eto'o {{refused to}} come on as a {{substitute}} in a league match against Racing de Santander on 11 February 2007. Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard said after the match, [...] "He {{did not want to}} come on; I don't know why." [...] Ronaldinho was critical of Eto'o's actions, saying that Eto'o was not putting the team first, but Eto'o rebutted the comment, claiming that he did not come on because he did not have enough time to warm up properly. Three months later, Eto'o said, [...] "These kind of things are usually just speculation and don't come through to me. However, {{if it is true that}} I am a problem for my team then I will go. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I am happy here. The press can write what they want." [...] Following the comments, Barcelona President Joan Laporta was quick to quash rumours of transfers involving Eto'o and Ronaldinho.|$|E

Kevin Harvick took the lead from Denny Hamlin with 7 laps to go, but a caution forced the race to have a green-white-checkered finish. Harvick and Ryan Newman, who were {{the top of the}} 4 {{championship}} contenders, restarted on the front row. Harvick held off Newman to score his fourth win of the season and take the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup title. “I was just holding the pedal down and hoping for the best,’’ Harvick said. [...] "This new format has been so stressful. I’m going to go sleep for a week." [...] We didn't have quite enough,” Newman said. “That's disappointing, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it was an awesome team effort, and I think, again, this is a great racetrack to have a race like this, and I thought there was some amazing passing, and we don't get that at every racetrack.” ...|$|E

On how the characters meet, Oruche explained: [...] "She's walking down the street minding her own business. She comes across Tony, he looks at her and says something to her but she doesn't answer him. He thinks she's rude [...] She gets hit by a car [...] he then helps her. She's a woman lying in the gutter so he helps her. [...] he comes to the hospital to meet my children [...] Basically I have no help and I'm unconscious so he has to help me..." [...] Pickard added that Gabby asks him to look after her children, Taylor (Shaun Blackstock) and Amber (Lydia Lloyd-Henry), which he takes as an indication she may feel the same. Oruche explained that while her character is hospitalised Tony and Gabby are [...] "getting used to spending time with each other". Pickard revealed that Tony would become [...] "embroiled in the drama of [...] life". Tony discovers Gabby, like Tony, is married but [...] "like Tony, she's not happy".

Oruche also spoke of Phil's return, saying that Gabby and Tony [...] "want to spend their lives together <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the husband comes back. She's not in any fit state to go through separating with somebody". Tony and Gabby have a brief relationship before she leaves Hollyoaks village.|$|E
50|$|It {{turns out}} that Machree is innocent, {{evidenced}} by his confession, 'I didn't do nothing... I didn't do nothing! <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> didn't do nothing!'. Because of this, Daffy and Porky are sentenced to twenty {{years in prison for}} false arrest (thirty years actually, as Porky states so afterwards).|$|R
5000|$|Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind, wrote, [...] "Supernatural is more {{serialized}} than I've {{ever seen}} it. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> in my last review, this probably won't last, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it a lot. It is, in my memory, the strongest opening stretch of episodes that the series has ever had. I am really {{into what is}} going on, and I hope that stays true. One complaint: Supernatural can try too hard to keep the campiness going, and Crowley is suffering for a bit in his interactions with Amara. Less jokes about Crowley buying kids books would be good is all I'm saying." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the fight, Tate stated, [...] "I think I'm not {{in reality}} quite yet. I can't believe that I have a belt {{to take home}} with me. I really had to dig deep those last couple rounds. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> had a tough end to my {{training}} camp, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> just feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> {{went out there and}} I did what I needed to do and I won the fight and I'm world champion." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bird {{said his}} {{victory in the}} sprint race felt [...] "fantastic", [...] "Being back in GP2 is already feeling very good, being back in the feeder series to Formula One {{is a great place}} to be. To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that we have a good car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> we need to score big points in Race 1 and I think that in Barcelona we’ll be in the front." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....Some {{people really}} took Treble & Tremble {{as a concept}} album or a tribute album to Smith, and I wouldn't ever say that the album wasn't {{influenced}} by him, but it wasn't {{meant to be a}} tribute thing. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I can't ever, ever, ever be ashamed of my association with him. I cherish it every day." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{first it}} was a love song to Anna (McCoy's then girlfriend), but it built stuff on top of it, - all of my love songs have been made with Anna in mind - <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it's grown from the {{original}} version. The song has gotten to flow in development, and doesn't feel so personal anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time I was flying by Jet propulsion! No engine vibrations. No torque and no lashing sound of the engine propeller.

5000|$|I think Snoop is a {{lot more}} humble. As a matter of fact, I know he's a lot more humble. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> he's a lot more focused.

5000|$|Echols: What is your {{inspiration}} for acting? Why {{do you do}} it?Pitts: Money. Very, very occasionally a piece of writing comes along that I personally connect with, that really twists something in me, that I will have nothing but the most fervent dedication to. In that case, I do it just for the gratification of being involved with the piece, just to say I was there. <b>But</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> that's about [...]01% of the time. Not that I'm complaining-- when it's otherwise, I'm very well overpaid.|$|E
5000|$|I {{thought about}} it for a long time. I thought maybe I should release it as The Black Hole and put the demos in the right order, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it was never finished, so it wouldn't really stand up, like it wouldn't be a very good listen... It was a very tough decision, but in the end I {{concluded}} that this is the best possible CD I could put out, given all the material I have. This is the best listen and this is what I want to give to the world.|$|E

5000|$|Erik Kain of Forbes wrote, [...] "All told, another solid {{episode of}} Gotham. Still {{lots and lots}} of plot to juggle. Hopefully the writers and showrunners are up for the {{challenge}} and can skillfully weave it all together and resolve everything.

5000|$|On {{the topic}} of getting health care reform {{legislation}} passed, Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it, [...] "he only needs 51."

2500|$|We didn't {{really have}} {{aspirations}} to make records at that point, {{when we first}} started out; it was all about playing live, really. You know, enjoying each other's company, and writing songs, and gettin' stoned, partying and having fun ... Once we started, which was 1996, we didn't really stop until 2005. And, yeah, <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> we were proud of how much we toured. We were-it was a badge of honour to play as much as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Tägtgren {{defined the}} lyrics as [...] "spooky" [...] and said: [...] "Read {{between the lines}} and find the irony. Don't think it's all so serious. For us, it's not to provoke. Yes, we want to shock people <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it's a party album." [...] Lindemann also commented on this matter: “We didn't want to be really nasty or provocative or insulting. {{is the first time}} English {{speakers}} can understand the lyrics, which is usually impossible in Rammstein. It's very sexual, but that's what I've done in Rammstein for twenty years, it's just that nobody's understood it!" ...|$|E

Those who loved the book will love the movie, I think. Those who don't know the book will love it just the same.

I never made a diss record. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> a lot of people, if you feel salty behind that, then I could say if the shoe fit well, I'm not afraid to address it," [...] he said. [...] "I just feel like in Hip Hop, we've got to stick to whether we're going to be real or we not. <b>Like</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I'm just addressing what I see. To be honest with you, that particular song wasn't about nobody in Hip Hop but I think people taking it like that. This was one of these guys that worked at the radio station and didn't believe in me and told me it was over for me. He ridin' up on a skateboard and got a little mini-skirt on.

[...] and added, [...] "the episode had its moments: The Jackson-April story played well, and I can’t tell you how happy I am that Meredith and Derek are finally smiling at each other/”showering” together.
