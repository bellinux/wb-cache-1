5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important that all {{the faithful}} should <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> they cannot live their faith or share fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E
25|$|Gay {{people could}} seldom <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> {{heterosexual}} sex would {{provide them with}} the same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} EV1 (and those released by Honda, Toyota, and others) from 1998 {{to the end}} of the program, featured nickel-metal or even lithium (Nissan) batteries with a range of 100 or more miles. The film documents that the company which had supplied batteries for EV1, Ovonics, had been suppressed from announcing improved batteries, with double the range, lest CARB <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> batteries were improving. Later, General Motors sold the supplier's majority control share to the Chevron Corporation and Cobasys.|$|E

25|$|Searle's thought {{experiment}} {{begins with}} this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research {{has succeeded in}} constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all {{of the questions that}} the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.|$|E
25|$|People with ORS misinterpret the {{behavior}} of others {{to be related to}} the imagined odor (thoughts of reference). In one review, ideas of reference were present in 74% of cases. Usually, these involve misinterpretations of comments, gestures and actions of other people such that it is believed that an offensive smell from the individual is being referred to. These thoughts of reference are more pronounced in social situations which the individual with ORS may find stressful, such as public transport, crowded lift, workplace, classroom, etc. Example behaviors which are misinterpreted include coughing, sneezing, turning of the head, opening a window, facial expressions, sniffing, touching nose, scratching head, gestures, moving away, avoiding the person, whistling. Commonly, when being in proximity to others who are talking among themselves, persons with ORS will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the conversation is about his or her odor. Even the actions of animals (e.g. barking of dogs) can be interpreted as referential to an odor. Persons with ORS may have trouble concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor.|$|E
25|$|What commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the {{historian}} is its authenticity, {{not as the}} Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, {{but rather as a}} document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources behind our text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has been charged in fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the evidence adduced for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> what is in our copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.|$|E

25|$|Egyptian pharaohs {{held the}} highest {{positions}} in Egyptian society, both in {{religious and political}} spheres. Kings were revered as gods in human form. Ellen F. Morris, a professor in Columbia University's Department of Anthropology, suggests that pharaohs used retainer sacrifices {{as a way to}} flaunt their power. She also argues that pharaohs would have to have significant power, in both a political and religious sense, to convince their subjects that it was worth sacrificing their lives on earth for the pharaoh and his comfort in the next life. In addition, their families would have to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the pharaoh's comfort in the life to come was important enough to allow their loved ones to be sacrificed. This would not be possible if those being sacrificed did not have a very strong belief in the life to come. Egypt's government had to convince the people that the king was a god, and what belonged to him in his life on earth, belonged to him in the afterlife also. Dr. David O'Connor, from New York University Institute of Fine Arts, proposes that subjects of a king being willing to escort him into the afterlife demonstrates that a change had occurred in the way the Egyptians viewed their king.|$|E

The ratings success of [...] "Voyage of the Damned" [...] has been partially and fully attributed to Minogue's casting in the role of Astrid.

500|$|One of the Parliament's {{justifications}} for restricting judicial review {{in response to}} Chng Suan Tze was that national security is [...] "not a judicial decision" [...] and is not capable of [...] "objective evaluation by the courts". Commentators have noted, though, {{that the role of}} the court as enunciated in Chng Suan Tze is merely to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> there is a national security issue at hand, not to inquire into the executive action required to preserve it. In fact, the court applied the doctrine of justiciability which recognizes that the limits of judicial review in politically sensitive issues is better left to the discretion of the executive.|$|E

500|$|For artistic pursuits, it is {{not enough}} to promote such things generally, as it is too vague. A body for {{specific}} artistic purposes may be charitable, as in Royal Choral Society v IRC, as is the promotion of a particular composer, seen in Re Delius. For a gift to be charitable, the courts must <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> the subject of advancement be of artistic merit. This includes famous composers, as seen above, and social graces, as in Re Shaw's Wills Trust. When there is doubt, the courts ignore the opinions of the beneficiary and instead rely on experts, as in Re Pinion. This area is covered by the Charities Act 2006, which lists [...] "the advancement of citizenship or community development" [...] and [...] "the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science" [...] as valid types of charitable trust.|$|E
500|$|Aki's {{appearance}} was conceived by the lead animator of the project, Roy Sato, who created several conceptual designs for Sakaguchi to consider, and then used the selected design {{as a guide}} for her character model. Sato perceived Aki's original look as a [...] "supermodel", and subsequently removed her make-up and shortened her hair in order to give her a more intelligent look that would [...] "convince people that she's a scientist." [...] In an interview, Sato described actively trying to make her appear as realistic as possible, making her similar to himself in as many ways as he could in the animation, including elements of his personality through facial expressions. He concluded that Aki ended up being similar to him in almost every way, with the exception that [...] "she's a lot cuter". The model for Aki was designed to closely follow human appearance, with Sakaguchi commenting in an interview [...] "I think it's OK to look at Aki and <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> she's a human." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Senate {{committee}} was very cautious in its questions {{of two of}} Brown's backers, Samuel Howe and George Stearns, {{out of fear of}} stoking violence.
