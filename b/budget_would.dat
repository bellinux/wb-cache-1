5|$|Bryant Haliday {{was cast}} in the lead role as Professor Steiner. He was chosen for the role as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title role, and the <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> not allow a Hollywood star to be used. The fact that Gordon was already {{familiar}} with him, as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll, was also a factor. Haliday, a fan of horror movies, enjoyed doing The Projected Man. British stage actress Mary Peach {{was cast in}} the lead role as Dr. Patricia Hill. It was insisted that she be given top billing for her role. Norman Wooland, a German-born British character actor, was cast as Dr. Blanchard, the film's villain. Derek Farr portrays Inspector Davis, and Ronald Allen {{plays the role of}} Dr. Christopher Mitchell. A scene in the film features actress Norma West lying topless on a morgue table; this scene was added to aid sales overseas.|$|E
5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> be better spent on the delivery of less risky and more critical needs.|$|E

25|$|However, {{later that}} month, {{due to the}} world {{financial}} crisis, the Russian Parliament's Defence Committee stated that the Russian defence <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> instead be slashed by 15 percent, from $40 billion to $34 billion, with further cuts to come. On 5 May 2009, First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov said that the defence budget for 2009 will be 1.3 trillion rubles (US$39.4 billion). 322 billion rubles are allocated to purchase weapons, {{and the rest of}} the fund will be spent on construction, fuel storage and food supply.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, in November the new Secretary of Defense, Neil H. McElroy {{announced}} {{both systems}} would be purchased. Both forces, and their congressional supporters, realized that splitting the <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> mean neither force would be funded {{to the level}} required to fulfill the defence mission. In 1959 both the House and Senate debated the systems, with the Senate recommending cutting funding for Hercules and Congress stating the opposite. Congress eventually came to support the Defense Secretary's position {{as stated in the}} Master Air Defense Plan, retaining Hercules while reducing BOMARC and SAGE.|$|E
25|$|Großadmiral Raeder {{believed}} the navy was {{unprepared for the}} start of World War II by at least five years. The surface fleet was inadequate to fight the Royal Navy and instead adopted a strategy of convoy raiding. Raeder wanted the Kriegsmarine to play an active part because he feared the <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> be cut after the war. The smaller ships were dispersed around the world in order to force the Royal Navy to disperse their ships to combat them, while the battleships would carry out raids in the North Sea, with a view towards gradually reducing the Royal Navy's strength at home.|$|E

5000|$|Thus Phillips, {{along with}} several of his contemporaries, {{found himself in a}} {{position}} in which the prospects of a recording contract or airplay were remote. However, Corporal Punishment caught the attention of the small, independent Shifty label.

25|$|PSV's {{budget in}} 2011 was €60million. Before 2011, PSV's <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> only remain {{balanced}} {{if the team}} would qualify for the UEFA Champions League every year. But disappointing performances since 2008 meant that the club {{ended up with a}} yearly €10–20million negative balance, forcing the club to cut costs and obtain new revenues. The ground under the stadium and the training facilities were sold for €48.4million to the Eindhoven municipality in a leasehold estate construction. PSV also took out a €20million loan with Philips and additional loans with local entrepreneurs. The club also introduced sponsoring {{on the back of the}} player kits. Freo, part of De Lage Landen, was the company to present its name there.|$|E
25|$|Both the Christian Democrats and the Liberals openly {{supported}} a three-party coalition with Solberg as Prime Minister. A new Christian DemocratLiberalConservative {{government would have}} avoided the need for support from the Progress Party, by leaving the draft budget from the Red-Green Coalition unchanged. This <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> then pass {{with support from the}} Red-Greens and the new non-socialist government. Further issues could then be postponed until 2010 and be handled individually. The Progress Party had promised to vote for measures with which they agree, and the Red-Green parties were expected to do the same. By the start of September, the Progress Party had lost 4.9% of its public support, and many believed that this was due to their One Hundred Day Plan. Meanwhile, the Conservative party gained 3.7%, many of whom were former Progress Party supporters.|$|E
25|$|As of April 2010, an {{extension}} of the railroad from Fairbanks to Delta Junction is planned, having been proposed as early as 2009. Originally, the extension was to be completed by 2010, but construction of a major bridge across the Tanana River has barely begun, and construction of track has not started. A proposed 2011 Alaska state <b>budget</b> <b>would</b> provide $40 million in funding for the bridge, which would initially be for vehicular use, but would support Alaska Railroad trains once construction of track to Delta Junction began. The United States Department of Defense would provide another $100 million in funds, as the bridge and subsequent rail line would provide year-round access to Fort Greely and the Joint Tanana Training Complex. A groundbreaking ceremony for the Tanana River Bridge took place on September 28, 2011.|$|E
