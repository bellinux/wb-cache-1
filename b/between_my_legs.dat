60|$|My tale was not {{too hard}} of belief, and before noon I {{was on my way}} to Winchelsea, a stout nag enough <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E

60|$|Well, I went. Tom shot when I wasn't {{more than}} four yards from him, and the whole charge passed like a bullet <b>between</b> <b>my</b> hind <b>legs</b> and struck the ground under my stomach, sending up such a shower of earth and stones that I was knocked right over.|$|R
60|$|Wallace's big sorrel plunged {{after him}} and the rolling stones cracked. Suffering as I was by this time, with cramp in <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> and torturing pain, I had to choose <b>between</b> holding <b>my</b> horse in or falling off; so I chose the former and {{accordingly}} got behind.|$|R
25|$|And <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> {{begin to}} cramp.|$|R
6000|$|... "That cur!... Can't I {{believe my}} own eyes? Will {{you tell me}} that the beggar didn't bolt <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> this moment, and went into the hole before the terrier?" ...|$|E
60|$|BERTRAND. Macaire, I {{came into}} this place with my tail <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> already, and hungry besides; {{and then you get}} to flourishing, and it {{depresses}} me worse than the chaplain in the gaol.|$|E

5000|$|Only {{the body}} of the car was smashed, {{especially}} around my seat. Carefully I drew <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> out of the steel trap. Bracing myself against the frame of the body, I slowly extricated myself from the seat ... I tried to hurry out of the car. I wanted to show that nothing had happened to me, that I was absolutely unhurt. I stepped to the ground. At that instant the pain flashed through <b>my</b> <b>leg.</b> It was a ferocious pain, as if <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> were being slashed by hot, glowing knives. I collapsed, Chiron catching me in his arms.|$|R

60|$|I don't know 'ow he did it, but 'e did. He {{seemed to}} sink away <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> and afore I knew wot was 'appening, I was {{standing}} upside down {{with all the}} blood rushing to my 'ead. As I rolled over he bolted through the wicket, and was off like a flash of lightning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Answered them! yes, indeed; {{who would}} not answer such a salute, and gun for gun, {{if he had a}} chance. I {{certainly}} thought he was firing at us, and having a musket <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> I let fly in return, and even the chaplain here will allow that was returning `good for evil.' But explain your meaning." ...|$|E
6000|$|The noise not leavin off, I {{laid down}} my pipe, and I {{took up a}} candle, and I went down and opened the door.

60|$|But it was Lop-Ear and I {{who caught}} them. He looked at me, {{and then we}} made a dash for it. The puppies knew no place to run except into the lair, and we headed them off. One rushed <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b> I squatted and grabbed him. He sank his sharp little teeth into my arm, and I dropped him in the suddenness of the hurt and surprise. The next moment he had scurried inside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, the Spaniard ran {{when he saw}} me, and {{got into}} a cabin; but the woman, instead of running, came {{at me with a}} knife, and chased me round the table like a very cat-a-mountain. So I ducked under the old man's hammock, and out into the gallery; and when I thought the coast was clear, back again I came, and {{stumbled}} over this. So I just picked it up, and ran on deck with my tail <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> for I expected verily to have the black woman's knife between my ribs out of some dark corner." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had little}} object--certainly no hope these researches; but a vague curiosity {{prompted}} {{me to continue}} them. Quitting the wall, I resolved to cross {{the area of the}} enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b> I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.|$|E

6000|$|... "So, for the moment, {{while the}} coffin went overside, I was not slain. And {{it was strange}} that I was glad {{immediately}} that I was to live. And I began to remember Malia, and to begin to plot a vengeance on Anapuni. And {{with the blood of}} life thus freshening in me, my thirst multiplied on itself tenfold and my tongue and mouth and throat seemed as sanded as the tongue of the harpooner. The coffin being overboard, I was sitting {{in the bottom of the}} canoe. A coconut rolled <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> and I closed them on it. But as I picked it up in my hand, Aimoku smote my hand with the paddle-edge. Behold!" ...|$|E
60|$|Wander with {{me through}} one {{mood of the}} myriad moods of sadness into which one is plunged by John Barleycorn. I ride out over my {{beautiful}} ranch. <b>Between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> is a beautiful horse. The air is wine. The grapes on a score of rolling hills are red with autumn flame. Across Sonoma Mountain wisps of sea fog are stealing. The afternoon sun smoulders in the drowsy sky. I have everything to make me glad I am alive. I am filled with dreams and mysteries. I am all sun and air and sparkle. I am vitalised, organic. I move, I have the power of movement, I command movement of the live thing I bestride. I am possessed with the pomps of being, and know proud passions and inspirations. I have ten thousand august connotations. I am a king {{in the kingdom of}} sense, and trample the face of the uncomplaining dust....|$|E
60|$|He shouted {{that the}} water was too deep and for me to save his fish. This was an awful predicament for me. I knew the instant I grasped the leader that the big trout would break it or pull free. The same situation, with {{different}} kinds of fish, had presented itself many times on my numberless fishing jaunts with R.C. and they all crowded to my mind. Nevertheless I had no choice. Plunging in to my knees I frantically reached for the leader. The red trout made a surge. I missed him. R.C. yelled that something would break. That was no news to me. Another plunge brought me {{in touch with the}} leader. Then I essayed to lead the huge cutthroat ashore. He was heavy. But he was tired and that gave birth to hopes. Near the shore as I was about to lift him he woke up, swam round me twice, then ran <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a heavy}} bucket, {{with strong}} iron hoops, and might have held perhaps two gallons. But it was only half full now of a sort of thick lobbered gravy, which I {{afterward}} learned was boiled out of the salt beef used by the sailors. Upon getting into the rigging, I found it was no easy job to carry this heavy bucket up with me. The rope handle of it was so slippery with grease, that although I twisted it several times about my wrist, it would be still twirling round and round, and slipping off. Spite of this, however, I managed to mount {{as far as the}} [...] "top," [...] the clumsy bucket half the time straddling and swinging about <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> and in momentary danger of capsizing. Arrived at the [...] "top," [...] I came to a dead halt, and looked up. How to surmount that overhanging impediment completely posed me for the time. But at last, with much straining, I contrived to place my bucket in the [...] "top;" [...] and then, trusting to Providence, swung myself up after it. The rest of the road was comparatively easy; though whenever I incautiously looked down toward the deck, my head spun round so from weakness, that I was obliged to shut my eyes to recover myself. I do not remember much more. I only recollect my safe return to the deck.|$|E

Did you ever see a Chink go swimmin' out through the breakers at Carmel?--or boxin', wrestlin', runnin' an' jumpin' for the sport of it? Did you ever see a Chink take a shotgun on his arm, tramp six miles, an' come back happy with one measly rabbit? What does a Chink do? Work his damned head off. That's all he's good for. To hell with work, if that's {{the whole of the}} game--an' I've done my share of work, an' I can work alongside of any of 'em. But what's the good? If they's one thing I've learned solid since you an' me hit the road, Saxon, it is that work's the least part of life. God!--if it was all of life I couldn't cut my throat quick enough to get away from it. I want shotguns an' rifles, an' a horse <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b> I don't want to be so tired all the time I can't love my wife. Who wants to be rich an' clear two hundred an' forty thousand on a potato deal! Look at Rockefeller. Has to live on milk. I want porterhouse and a stomach that can bite sole-leather. An' I want you, an' plenty of time along with you, an' fun for both of us. What's the good of life if they ain't no fun?" ...|$|E

I will not, in presenting--it {{must not}} be called the other side, but the supplementary, and {{wilfully}} omitted, facts, of this ideal,--oppose, as I fairly might, the discomforts of a modern cheap excursion train, to the chariot-and-four, with outriders and courier, of ancient noblesse. I will compare only the actual facts, in the former and in latter years, of my own journey from Paris to Geneva. As matters are now arranged, I find myself, at half past eight in the evening, waiting in a confused crowd with which I am presently to contend for a seat, {{in the dim light}} and cigar-stench of the great station of the Lyons line. Making slow way through the hostilities of the platform, in partly real, partly weak politeness, as may be, I find the corner seats of course already full of prohibitory cloaks and umbrellas; but manage to get a middle back one; the net overhead is already surcharged with a bulging extra portmanteau, so that I squeeze my desk as well as I can <b>between</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> and arrange what wraps I have about my knees and shoulders. Follow a couple of hours of simple patience, with nothing to entertain one's thoughts but the steady roar of the line under the wheels, the blinking and dripping of the oil lantern, and the more or less ungainly wretchedness, and variously sullen compromises and encroachments of posture, among the five other passengers preparing themselves for sleep: the last arrangement for the night being to shut up both windows, in order to effect, with our six breaths, a salutary modification of the night air.|$|E
