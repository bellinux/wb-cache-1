5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The <b>Body</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man {{match in}} the seventh match, as then-champion, A.J. Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles {{following}} bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between his legs, tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90°, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the Angel's Wings. Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece. Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mat in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster {{would go into the}} hole, and his spirit would fly out from his <b>body</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would fall to the ground and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E
