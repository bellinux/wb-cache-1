40|$|This paper {{defends the}} view that {{intrinsic}} <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> a human being consists exclusively in survival. It takes as its point of departure the neo-Aristotelian view that inquiry into intrinsic <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> a human being should take place within a wider theory of intrinsic <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> living things, generally. The paper first argues that the neo-Aristotelian view that intrinsic <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> a living thing consists in flourishing {{as a member of}} its species, is mistaken. Rather, intrinsic <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> a living thing consists in survival, and not survival as a member of its species, but survival simpliciter. A refined understanding of survival is developed in the paper. The paper then applies this Survivalist account of intrinsic <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> human beings: The things we take to be good for human beings—e. g., pleasure, desire-fulfillment, etc. —are good to the extent and because they promote the one intrinsic benefit of survival...|$|R

30|$|We {{also tested}} the {{hypothesis}} whether the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion {{in respect to}} four outcomes (employment, salary, occupational status, and further study) was associated with completion outcomes. The {{results show that the}} impact of the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion is very limited, and in the area of a one percent impact on completion probability. Only the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion in terms of further study is slightly more pronounced with about a three percentage point increase in completion probability between first and third tertile of the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion. These results showing a relative lack of impact of the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion on the probability of completions were somewhat unexpected. Two limitations of these predictor variables should thus be considered. First, it would appear that it is somehow implied that individual students are aware of the benefit of completing their course of study. This may not necessarily be the case and it can thus not be assumed that the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion plays a role in their decision making on whether or not to complete. Secondly, the way the variables indicating the <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion are constructed means that they represent the overall <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> completion, rather than the net benefit. In other words, individual economic costs <b>to</b> obtain the <b>benefit</b> are not taken into account. This represents a shortcoming of all the benefit variables and is difficult to overcome with presently available data. In the future {{it might be possible to}} address this via a survey that collects data on individual’s time, effort, and financial input into their training.|$|R
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' <b>benefits.</b> <b>To</b> avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} the G.I. Bill, denied <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E

The new health plan also extends health <b>benefits</b> <b>to</b> unmarried heterosexual domestic partners of city employees. On October 10, 2006, the City Council approved an ordinance to prohibit smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars.
