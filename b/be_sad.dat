5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout different worlds and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to <b>be</b> <b>sad,</b> whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

25|$|The {{curator at}} Old Trafford {{had been ordered}} to prepare a dusty, {{spinning}} pitch that was devoid of grass for the Fourth Test. A win for England would see them retain the Ashes. England's chairman of selectors and former captain Gubby Allen thought that the pitch would fall apart by tea on the first morning; the surface had already cracked {{before the start of}} play. When the curator asked Allen if he would like the remaining grass removed, he indicated that he would not <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> if it happened, so the groundsmen cut what remained of the grass. The umpires felt that the match would be over within three days. Miller bowled 21 wicketless overs for 41 runs as England amassed 459 on the deteriorating and crumbling pitch. Australia began batting after lunch on the second day, and the pace pair of Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey only bowled then overs to remove the shine from the ball before Laker and Lock took over.|$|E

There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity." [...] A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi-Fi/Stereo Review, who described the record as [...] "an enjoyable and well-made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains a good deal {{about what is going on}} around us." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{controversial}} action of Jackson's tenure as CGS was the Army's modernisation of the regimental structure in 2004, {{in which many}} regiments were merged to form larger ones. The amalgamations led {{to the loss of}} many regimental names, including the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, which became part of The Rifles and the Black Watch, which, after intervention by Queen Elizabeth II, retained its name but became a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. Jackson insisted that the change was necessary to give the Army greater flexibility and capability, but said he was [...] "acutely aware that this will <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> and unwelcome news for {{at least some of the}} infantry". As part of the same review, the arms plot system, which kept infantry units moving around every few years, was also phased out as being inefficient.|$|E

A reviewer from the Ottawa Citizen said that [...] "here's also a lot to like about Break The Ice, Why Should I <b>Be</b> <b>Sad</b> and Perfect Love".

The song, a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, was recorded on 4 September 1995.

500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> to see him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E

He phoned Poehler and explained the story to her, noting that her role would be the driving force in the film.

500|$|Johann Peter Hebel {{was born}} on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were {{employed}} in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel {{and the other half}} in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, [...] "there I learned early on {{what it meant to be}} poor and rich... to have nothing and to have everything, to be happy with the happy people and to <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> with those who cried". Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel's father, who had moved to southern Baden from the HunsrÃ¼ck area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (Gymnasium am MÃ¼nsterplatz). His mother died when he was thirteen.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to <b>be</b> <b>sad,</b> one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Gypsy" [...] is a Europop and electropop {{song with}} classic rock and house influences. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Gypsy" [...] {{contains}} [...] "barroom ivory-tickling" [...] and a swooping hook. Rolling Stone described the song as an [...] "eighties-style anthem." [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, [...] "Gypsy" [...] {{is written in}} the key of C major and composed in the common time signature. The song moves at a tempo of 134 beats per minute, and Gaga's vocals span from G3 to D5. The song's verses follow a chord progression of Câˆ’Gâˆ’Fmaj7âˆ’Gsusâˆ’G, and the chorus follows with the progression Gâˆ’Amâˆ’Fâˆ’C (Vâˆ’viâˆ’IVâˆ’I). It begins with a soft piano sound and then changes into a high-energy electro song. The composition is in a sing-along style, with Gaga belting out [...] "I don't want be alone forever, but I can be tonight" [...] during the chorus, talking about navigating an unknown road based only on her instincts. The lyrics also talk about falling in love while being true to oneself, which was the initial inspiration for the track. She compares herself with [...] "Dorothy on a yellow brick, Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick", referring to the fictional yellow brick road traveled by Dorothy Gale in the 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz. The line refers to the singer approaching a crossroad in her relationships, however she feels safe with her fans. Ericka Welch of The Huffington Post explained that [...] " [...] with the looming sense of loss, Gaga can't <b>be</b> <b>sad</b> when she sees all the stamps on her passport and realizes that she has the whole world in front of her." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus has {{an unusual}} structure, which {{includes}} an arioso passage for the bass voice. All instruments except the trumpet play a ritornello, after which a choral fugue pictures the weeping and wailing {{of the text}} in unrelated musical material, rich in chromaticism. In great contrast the following line, [...] "" [...] (But the world will rejoice), is conveyed by the chorus embedded in {{a repeat of the}} first part of the ritornello. The sequence is repeated on a larger scale: this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second theme taken from the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety. The bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings three times, with a sudden tempo change to adagio, [...] "" [...] (But you will <b>be</b> <b>sad)</b> as an accompagnato recitative. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes: [...] "This recitative is a mere eight bars long but its context and piteousness give it enormous dramatic impact. Bach's lack of respect for the conservative Leipzig authorities' dislike of operatic styles in religious music was never more apparent!" [...] Klaus Hofmann compares the recitative's [...] "highly expressive melody and harmony" [...] to Bach's Passions. Finally, the extended sequence of fugue and ritornello with chorus returns transposed, on the text [...] "" [...] (Yet your sorrow shall be changed into joy). According to Alfred DÃ¼rr, the architecture of the movement is a large scale experiment combining elements of the older style of a text-related motet with the form of a concerto of instrumental groups and voices, as typically used by Bach.|$|E
500|$|The fear in of {{the fourth}} floor refers to tetraphobia, the superstitious fear of the number four.

Leslie said Tom hides his emotions behind [...] "a very thick layer of Axe body spray", a reference to the real-life male grooming product. The Parks department employees eat at a restaurant called Jurassic Fork, a reference to the Steven Spielberg dinosaur adventure film Jurassic Park, which was adapted from a novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. During one scene, Tom refers to Ron as [...] "Rondoleezza Rice", a reference to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. At the strip club, Leslie mistakenly refers to a stripper named Sierra by the name Seabiscuit, a champion thoroughbred racehorse. Reflecting on his marriage, Tom said, [...] "At least we lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and that guy from Sum 41", a reference to the pop singer's short-lived marriage to Sum 41 guitarist Deryck Whibley. Tom says one of the strippers also works at Quiznos, a sandwich fast-food franchise; Tom says of her: [...] "She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos."
