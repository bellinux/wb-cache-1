5|$|Nevertheless, within just a year, in 429 BC, the Athenians {{not only}} forgave Pericles but also re-elected him as strategos. He was {{reinstated}} {{in command of}} the Athenian army and led all its military operations during 429 BC, having once again under his control the levers of power. In that year, however, Pericles witnessed the death of both his legitimate sons from his first wife, Paralus and Xanthippus, in the epidemic. His morale undermined, he <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> tears and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. He himself died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} Imelda good with people, {{she was also}} a skilled {{mediator}} who mended broken relationships that occurred with Marcos. During Marcos's presidency in the Nacionalista Party, Fernando Lopez, back then Marcos's vice presidential running mate, was unwilling to continue his political career. Marcos asked Imelda to help him mend ties with Lopez, and Imelda <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> tears in order to convince Lopez that he should run as the Nacionalista vice presidential candidate.|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorm asthma is the {{triggering}} of an asthma {{attack by}} environmental conditions directly {{caused by a}} local thunderstorm. During a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> laughter.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. Just before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E

5|$|In June 1941, JG51 was {{transferred}} East {{to take part}} in Operation Barbarossa with 1 staffel. On the morning of the 22 June, Bär and his wingman Oberfeldwebel Heinrich Höfemeier were escorting a damaged Heinkel He 111 over German lines when they made contact with 18 Tupolev SB bombers from the 39 SBAP (Skorostnoy Bombardirovohchnyy Aviatsionny Polk—high speed bomber aviation regiment) and 10 SAD (Smeshannaya Aviatsionnaya Diviziya—composite aviation regiment). The German pilots attacked; Höfemeier claimed four, Bär two—though the former was wounded in the arm. The Germans noted the vulnerability of the Soviet aircraft which lacked self-sealing fuel tanks and had a propensity to <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> flames. More JG51 Bf 109s appeared and claimed six more. None of the 39 SBAP or 10 SAD aircraft returned home. Bär had achieved his 19th and 20th victory.|$|E
5|$|Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and {{her mother}} {{received}} him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance {{in the middle of}} December out of fear that Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary {{and her mother}}, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> tears because of their ill fate.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{years before}} the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later {{approaches}} a home and claims {{to be there to}} repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E

5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|Certainly many {{problems}} remained to be resolved, including re-establishing royal {{authority over the}} provinces and resolving the complex issue of which barons should control the contested lands and estates after the long civil war. Stephen <b>burst</b> <b>into</b> activity in early 1154, travelling around the kingdom extensively. He began issuing royal writs for the south-west of England once again and travelled to York where he held a major court {{in an attempt to}} impress upon the northern barons that royal authority was being reasserted. After a busy summer in 1154, however, Stephen travelled to Dover to meet the Count of Flanders; some historians believe that the King was already ill and preparing to settle his family affairs. Stephen fell ill with a stomach disorder and died on 25 October at the local priory, being buried at Faversham Abbey with his wife Matilda and son Eustace.|$|E
