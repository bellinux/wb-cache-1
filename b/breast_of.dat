5|$|A {{patch of}} {{coloured}} feathers {{found on the}} throat or upper <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> some species of birds. It is a feature found on many male hummingbirds, particularly those found in North America, whose gorgets are typically iridescent. Other species have gorgets, such as the purple-throated fruitcrow and the chukar partridge. The term {{is derived from the}} gorget used in military armor to protect the throat.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{spent the}} next three days in prison agonising over whether to confess to the crime and make a clean <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> his sins before God. He finally confessed after several {{meetings}} with the prison chaplain, entreaties from his wife, and pleas from both his warder and John Orridge, the governor of the prison. He strongly denied stabbing Maria, claiming that he had accidentally shot her in the eye after they argued while she was changing out of her disguise.|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. To pacify Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{southwest}} area of {{the hill}} fort is apparently built over and around preceding Bronze Age burial mounds or tumuli. Part of the inner ditch is occupied by a large circular barrow, which was excavated, but was found empty. A few feet further to the west are two other barrows, over which the great inner rampart passes; these on opening, proved to be sepulchral: in the largest was found a cist containing burned human bones at the depth of two feet; and in the smallest, two skeletons were found, lying from south to north, {{the head of the}} smallest reclining on the <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> the other.

25|$|Mastopexic {{correction}} {{results in}} surgical scars on the lifted breasts; the periareolar mastopexy outcome often is a <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> bottom-heavy appearance, with puckered surgical scars; and the Anchor mastopexy outcome is an aesthetic <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> natural size, look, and feel, but with many scars. Whereas, {{advocates of the}} mechanical principle of the B technique mastopexy propose {{that the creation of}} a rotational pedicle (with an elevated epidermal flap that rotates around the nipple-areola complex), lifts the breasts with an incision plan with vertical and horizontal incisions that eliminate the medial incision (and its vertical scar), whilst providing good projection of the corrected bust from the chest, and a viable nipple-areola complex. Furthermore, advocates of the B technique mastopexy report that it usually does not require secondary correction, because it allows for the better transposition of excess lateral tissues of the breasts by means of curvilinear incision (inverted, upper-case, letter-B) to the skin envelope.|$|E

25|$|In Portugal, these barrows {{are called}} mamoa, from the Latin mammula, {{given to them}} by the Romans because of their shape, similar to the <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> a woman (mama in Portuguese). Near Cividade de Terroso there's the most {{relevant}} one, the Mamoa de Sejães. This tumuli is located near the hamlet of Sejães, in the eastern hill slope. Given the fact that no archaeological surveys were made until the present day, nothing is known about the structure of the monument, and after thousands of years it is still unbroken.|$|E
25|$|Reduction mammoplasty, {{surgery or}} lipectomy, is the {{technically}} reliable method for diminishing {{the size and}} volume of the enlarged breast. The traditional, surgical techniques for breast reduction remodel the breast mound using a skin and glandular (breast tissue) pedicle (inferior, superior, central), and then trim and re-drape the skin envelope into a new <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> natural size, shape, and contour; yet it produces long surgical scars upon the breast hemisphere. In response, L. Benelli, in 1990, presented the round block mammoplasty, a minimal-scar periareolar incision technique that produces only a periareolar scar — around the nipple-areola complex (NAC), where the dark-to-light skin-color transition hides the surgical scar.|$|E
25|$|The breast-tissue matrix {{consists}} of engineered tissues of complex, implanted, biocompatible scaffolds seeded {{with the appropriate}} cells. The in-situ creation of a tissue matrix in the breast mound is begun with the external vacuum expansion of the mastectomy defect tissues (recipient site), for subsequent seeding (injecting) with autologous fat grafts of adipocyte tissue. A 2010 study, reported that serial fat-grafting to a pre-expanded recipient site achieved (with a few 2-mm incisions and minimally invasive blunt-cannula injection procedures), a non-implant outcome equivalent to a surgical breast reconstrcution by autologous-flap procedure. Technically, the external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues created a skin envelope as it stretched the mastectomy scar, and so generated a fertile breast-tissue matrix to which were injected large-volume fat grafts (150–600ml) to create a <b>breast</b> <b>of</b> natural form, look, and feel.|$|E
