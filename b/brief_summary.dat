5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. The Celluloid Couch does not include any credits and only a <b>brief</b> <b>summary</b> of the film in its filmography listing. It is also listed in Psychotherapists on Film without further detailing onto the cast or credits. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the actors of Deering and his daughter.|$|E
