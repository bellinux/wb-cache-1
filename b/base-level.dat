40|$|Due {{to their}} spatial {{complexity}} and dynamic nature, floodplains provide {{a wide range}} of ecosystem functions. However, because of flow regulation, many riverine floodplains have lost their characteristic heterogeneity. Restoration of floodplain habitats and the rehabilitation of key ecosystem functions has therefore become a major goal of environmental policy. Many important ecosystem functions are linked to organic carbon (C) dynamics in riparian soils. The fundamental understanding of the factors that drive the processes involved in C cycling in heterogeneous and dynamic systems such as floodplains is however only fragmentary. We quantified soil organic C pools (microbial C and water extractable organic C) and fluxes (soil respiration and net methane production) in functional process zones of adjacent channelized and widened sections of the Thur River, NE Switzerland, on a seasonal basis. The objective was to assess how spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of these pools and fluxes relate to physicochemical soil properties on one hand, and to soil environmental conditions and flood disturbance on the other hand. Overall, factors related to seasonality and flooding (temperature, water content, organic matter input) affected soil C dynamics more than soil properties did. Coarse-textured soils on gravel bars in the restored section were characterized by low <b>base-levels</b> of organic C pools due to low TOC contents. However, frequent disturbance by flood pulses led to high heterogeneity with temporarily and locally increased pools and soil respiration. By contrast, in stable riparian forests, the finer texture of the soils and corresponding higher TOC contents and water retention capacity led to high <b>base-levels</b> of C pools. Spatial heterogeneity was low, but major floods and seasonal differences in temperature had additional impacts on both pools and fluxes. Soil properties and base levels of C pools in the dam foreland of the channelized section were similar to the gravel bars of the restored section. By contrast, spatial heterogeneity, seasonal effects and flood disturbance were similar to the forests, except for indications of high CH 4 production that are explained by long travel times of infiltrating water favouring reducing conditions. Overall, the restored section exhibited both a larger range and a higher heterogeneity of organic C pools and fluxes as well as a higher plant biodiversity than the channelized section. This suggests that restoration has indeed led to an increase in functional diversity...|$|R

The analysis aims to identify additional parameters to recognize areas in southern Italy with different tectonic activities and behaviours. The axial zone of the Campania-Lucania Apennine and the Sila Massif in Calabria, Italy, characterized by quite different evolutionary histories, have been chosen as test areas sufficiently wide to validate observations on a sub-regional scale at least. Geomorphological information on the shape of palaeosurfaces has been used to estimate uplift and/or erosion amounts and rates. Palaeosurfaces are identified on the DEM as regions with an altitude higher than 1000 m a. s. l. and sub-planar land surfaces dipping less than 6 °. Information about the shape of palaeosurfaces during the first stage of uplift and before the tectonic-induced block fragmentation has been extracted. A fragmentation index has been computed for these erosional surfaces. The first stage of this landscape evolution has been studied in terms of the geometric characteristics of fragmented blocks.

The earliest terrace (T 1) reflects sandur-style deposition during deglaciation and it aggraded in a reach cut into glacial diamict and glaciolacustrine muds. Incision below T 1 spanned {{the start of the}} Holocene, driven by a combination of reduced sediment supply under a stabilising landscape and lower <b>base-levels.</b> T 2 had aggraded and was being abandoned by 4000 BC; its formation latterly involving a period of comparative stability in terms of channel migration, perhaps a function of extensive forest cover and sea levels reaching above present day levels. The last 3000  years were marked by substantial changes in the sedimentary regime, with increased and varying sediment supply driving cycles of cut-and-fill and greater lateral channel migration. These changes coincided with the first widespread and substantial reductions in forest cover and a progression towards an agricultural landscape. Between the aggradation of terraces T 3 and T 4 there was a substantial increase in sediment supply, which is broadly in keeping with the erosion history in the surrounding uplands. This sediment slug appears to have induced a switch from highly sinuous meandering to lower sinuosity channels characterised by lateral scroll-style migration.

The study area includes three catchment sub-basins of the north-eastern flank of the Agri Valley, a tectonically active morpho-structural low located in the axial zone of the southern Apennines and affected by desertification processes in its middle part. Long and mid-term rates have been estimated evaluating the missing volume of eroded rocks, on the grounds of GIS-aided calculations linked to geomorphological markers corre-sponding to ancient <b>base-levels</b> of the erosion. Short-term rates have been calculated converting the parameter related to the turbid transport of streams (Tu), derived from the quantitative geomorphic analysis, adopting an average value for the specific weight of the outcropping rocks, Such an approximation has to be considered acceptable {{because of the presence of}} conditions of lithological homogeneity in two of the chosen basins.

A classification of gypsum karsts is proposed based on the hydrogeological, tectonic and stratigraphic criteria that decisively control the evolution of gypsum karsts. In this respect, lithological aspects of Messinian and Triassic-Permian gypsum series in south-eastern Spain are considered, such as the alternation of rhythmic levels of marl and gypsum, as well as geodynamic aspects. The influence of the hydrogeological characteristics of evaporite aquifers on gypsum cave speleogenesis is discussed; this includes speleogenetic processes in confined, semi-confined or free aquifers controlled by regional and local base levels. Also, the importance of intense saline diapiric uplift is examined. To illustrate our classification, examples of gypsum caves developed in Spain are presented. Their similarities and differences with gypsum karsts in other regions (Italy, Ukraine, and USA) are discussed. A first general division addresses: (1) caves controlled by stratigraphic factors and (2) caves controlled by tectonic factors. Several typologies can be described, including (A) multilayer caves with confined hydrogeological origin, (B) confined hypophreatic caves with linear or maze configurations, (C) caves controlled by the variation or remanence of regional or local <b>base-levels,</b> and (D) caves controlled by the halokinetic evolution of salt/gypsum diapirs. The proposed classification is flexible and adaptable to each case, because different genetic mechanisms can coincide in time and space.

Four orders of palaeosurfaces were recognized: I (> 1100 m a. s. l), II (900 - 1000 m a. s. l), III (750 - 850 m a. s. l.), IV (600 - 720 m a. s. l.). The most ancient orders (I and II) are cut into the bedrock and are located {{at the top of the}} Matese and Montagnola di Frosolone massifs.

40|$|The rangelands or {{semi-arid}} and arid {{regions of}} Western Australia occupy about 87 {{percent of the}} land area. Pastoral grazing of managed livestock, mainly sheep and cattle, occurs over much of this area, with an increasing proportion being allocated to the state conservation estate. Rangeland monitoring began at the local scale in the 1950 s and since then has been closely tied {{to the needs of the}} pastoral industry. By 1992 a regional-scale, ground-based system was in place after two decades of trialling precursor techniques. The state-wide pastoral monitoring programme, known as the Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS), helps to monitor the state’s natural vegetation and soil resources. Change in soil and vegetation attributes through time, in response to climatic conditions, herbivore grazing, fire and other natural and anthropogenic drivers in the rangelands is known as change in range condition or range trend. When range condition is used in an ecological context, as it is in this research, an improving trend implies an improvement in ecological integrity or ecosystem health. In contrast, a declining trend implies a reduction in integrity, otherwise known as natural resource degradation. The principal objective of this study is to produce a regional-scale, long-term quantitative assessment of range condition change in the southern rangelands of Western Australia, using WARMS transect data. Previous analyses of the WARMS database have examined selected vegetation parameters, but this study is the first to calculate a single integrated range condition index. The assessment covers an area of approximately 760, 000 km 2, stretching southeast from the southern Pilbara region through the Gascoyne-Murchison and Goldfields regions to the Nullarbor region on the Great Australia Bight. WARMS is designed to provide data and information for assessing regional and long-term changes in rangeland ecological condition. It consists of two principal parts: (1) numerous permanent field monitoring sites and (2) a large relational database. By the end of 2006, there were 980 WARMS sites located on 377 pastoral leases (stations) in the southern rangelands of Western Australia. Average lease size is 202, 190 ha and the largest is 714, 670 ha. The total area occupied by leases (pastoral plus leases converted to the conservation estate) is approximately 76, 250, 000 ha. WARMS sites are at an average density of 2. 6 sites per lease or 1 site per 77, 780 ha of pastoral rangeland. Field-recorded metrics include 11 soil surface parameters and four plant parameters (location on belt-transect, species, height and maximum canopy extent). The field data collection protocol has remained essentially unchanged since 1992 and new field data are captured at each site on a 5 -year cycle. This is the most extensive quantitative, ground-based rangeland monitoring system in Australia. This assessment of range condition is based a suite of soil and vegetation indices derived from the WARMS transect field metrics. Seven basic indices have been derived and algorithmically combined into three higher-order indices, one for each of three components of ecological integrity: composition, function and structure. The three indices are then combined into an overall index of ecological health called the Shrubland Range Condition (SRC) Index. In addition, the indices have been assigned to particular time-slices based on the field acquisition date of their component metrics, allowing the calculation of change through time. The combination of the hierarchical index framework, the use of time-slices and GIS mapping techniques provided a suitable analysis platform for the elucidation of spatial and temporal change in rangeland ecological integrity or health at WARMS sites. The nature of change in the SRC Index and the landscape function, vegetation structure and vegetation composition sub-indices has enabled possible causes to be inferred. The patterns of range condition and change are complex at all landscape scales. However, based on analysis of the WARMS sites, range condition is considerably more variable, in space and time, in the northern parts of the southern rangelands compared to the southern parts, with the exception of the Nullarbor region. Through time, the Ashburton and Gascoyne regions consistently demonstrate the largest area (site clusters) of change and the greatest magnitude of change. For many areas, range trend has fluctuated markedly between improvement and decline since the mid- 1990 s. However, there are two large clusters of sites which show continuing decline through more than two decades. The legacy of historical degradation and ongoing poor land stewardship (principally through over-stocking) is hindering the widespread recovery in range condition, despite more than a decade of good rainfall seasons. An uncommon exception to this sad story is a group of sites located in the upper region of the Gascoyne catchment, where there has been almost continuous improvement over the same period. This work also provides empirical evidence of a fundamental difference in the behaviour of surface water-flows in different catchment types. Using the Landscape Function Factor (LFF), there is conspicuous regional differentiation of sites located in exorheic catchments from those located in endorheic-arheic catchments. In general, sites located in the coastal draining exorheic catchments exhibit greater rates of soil erosion compared to sites located in the other internally draining catchment types; the different erosional regimes are probably related to the nature of the ultimate and local <b>base-levels</b> associated with each catchment type. This has important implications for the long-term management of the rangelands of Western Australia...|$|R
