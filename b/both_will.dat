5|$|Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann: Governor Swann's {{daughter}} and Will's fiancée, who is arrested {{on her wedding}} day for helping Captain Jack Sparrow escape. Escaping jail with help from her father, she meets up with Jack in Tortuga and joins his crew to search for <b>both</b> <b>Will</b> and the chest.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although <b>both</b> <b>will</b> take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for a nest, and <b>both</b> <b>will</b> defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E

5|$|Though different, the children's stories {{share similar}} structures. The story reaches its climax as a {{stairway}} {{appears at the}} Dream Gate and Helen and Nights ascend, only to be trapped by Wizeman and pulled into darkness. Will arrives too late and dives in after them, arriving in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds {{that he has the}} ability to fly without Nights or their Ideya. He rescues Helen, and the two attempt to save Nights, who has been imprisoned at the top of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala arrives to stop their efforts and accepts Nights' challenge to battle. After defeating Reala, the trio prepare to face Wizeman. <b>Both</b> <b>Will</b> and Helen defeat Wizeman, who is subsequently destroyed. Since Wizeman kept all of his creations alive, Nights vanishes in a white light, bowing as if it were the end of a performance, and the children wake up crying. That evening, Helen plays her violin for her mother in a crowded hall, while Will celebrates with his father after winning a football game. He then loses the ball and goes after it, only to come upon Helen playing her violin. The lights suffer a temporary blackout, and when they turn back on, Helen sees Will extending a friendly hand to her. Recognising each other from their adventures in Nightopia, the two reach for each other as it begins to snow. The final scene is of either child sleeping in their rooms at home as the camera pulls back towards Bellbridge's clock tower, atop which Nights is seen to be alive and peacefully watching over the city.|$|E

2500|$|God, he says, either {{wishes to}} take away evils, and is unable; or He is able, and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is <b>both</b> <b>willing</b> and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in {{accordance}} with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is , which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing nor able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is <b>both</b> <b>willing</b> and able, which alone is suitable to God, from what source then are evils? Or why does He not remove them? ...|$|R

25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that the themes and taglines are largely different; and it is the theme that the parade or Show segment, on in some cases (2009 and 2015), <b>both</b> <b>will</b> be based on.|$|E
50|$|Classic Wills: <b>Both</b> <b>Wills</b> and Classic enjoyed {{their time}} in the market and their {{respective}} audiences, however {{the time had come to}} create an entity that has the values of them both. This decision gave birth to Classic Wills.|$|R
5000|$|Project MKULTRA, or MK-ULTRA, was {{the code}} {{name for a}} CIA mind-control {{research}} program that began in 1950, involved primarily with the experimentation of drugs and other [...] "chemical, biological and radiological" [...] stimuli on <b>both</b> <b>willing</b> and uninformed subjects.|$|R

25|$|During {{an episode}} of Big Brother, the house guests competed in a luxury {{challenge}} to see an advance screening of the film. Although they weren't actually in the house, <b>both</b> <b>Will</b> Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg made an on-screen video appearance.|$|E
25|$|DARPS, Differential, Absolute and Relative Positioning System. Commonly used on shuttle tankers while loading from a FPSO. <b>Both</b> <b>will</b> have a GPS receiver. As {{the errors}} {{are the same}} for the both of them, the signal {{does not need to be}} corrected. The {{position}} from the FPSO is transmitted to the shuttle tanker, so a range and bearing can be calculated and fed into the DP system.|$|E
25|$|In general, in the {{presence}} of both a charge density ρ(r, t) and current density J(r, t), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and <b>both</b> <b>will</b> vary in time. They are determined by Maxwell's equations, a set of differential equations which directly relate E and B to the electric charge density (charge per unit volume) ρ and current density (electric current per unit area) J.|$|E

25|$|Pos Malaysia and MP Muar {{won their}} {{respective}} matches and thus stay in Liga Premier next season. Losing teams are Shahzan Muda and Betaria; <b>both</b> <b>will</b> play in FAM League next season. Later, {{as a result}} of MP Muar decision {{to pull out of the}} league, another play-off match was arranged between Betaria and UiTM, the 3rd place club in the FAM League. Betaria won the match and retained their place in the Liga Premier.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{predictions}} of the greenhouse effect is that the stratosphere will cool. Although this cooling has been observed, it is not trivial to separate the effects {{of changes in the}} concentration of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion since <b>both</b> <b>will</b> lead to cooling. However, this can be done by numerical stratospheric modeling. Results from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory show that above , the greenhouse gases dominate the cooling.|$|E
25|$|Mine rollers {{and mine}} flails. The roller method {{originated}} during World War I and the flail method during World War II but both are still used. Neither system is completely reliable and <b>both</b> <b>will</b> leave undetonated mines, requiring the minefield to be rechecked by another method. Mine flail effectiveness can approach 100% in ideal conditions, but clearance rates {{as low as}} 50–60% have been reported. This is well below the 99.6% standard set by the United Nations for humanitarian demining.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to a request to rectify <b>both</b> <b>wills,</b> {{the court held that}} the husband’s will was capable of being rectified, but the wife’s will was not, as the court was not satisfied that she had the requisite capacity to execute a will due to her affliction with Alzheimer’s syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1950, the CIA {{researched}} and experimented {{with the use}} of possible mind-control drugs and other chemical, biological and radiological stimuli on <b>both</b> <b>willing</b> and uninformed subjects.

25|$|Brazilians {{normally}} {{place the}} object pronoun before the verb (proclitic position), as in ele me viu ("he saw me"). In many such cases, the proclisis {{would be considered}} awkward or even grammatically incorrect in EP, in which the pronoun is generally placed after the verb (enclitic position), namely ele viu-me. However, formal BP still follows EP in avoiding starting a sentence with a proclitic pronoun; so <b>both</b> <b>will</b> write Deram-lhe o livro ("They gave him/her the book") instead of Lhe deram o livro, though it will seldom be spoken in BP (but would be clearly understood).|$|E
25|$|A {{land-based}} component, Aegis Ashore, also {{is planned}} (pictured). This {{would consist of}} equipment which is commonly used by the Navy being deployed in land-based facilities. This would include SPY-1 radars and a battery of Standard Missile-3s. The Obama administration’s plans call for two sites: the first in Romania at Deveselu that was opened in May 2015 and the second in Poland in 2018. In 2020, <b>both</b> <b>will</b> get the latest versions of the Aegis BMD software and {{the latest version of}} the SM-3. Some radar facilities will be placed in Turkey at a future date.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} in FORECON's Mission Training Plan takes {{place within the}} MEU's Pre-deployment Training Program (PTP) Initial Training Phase. In order for Marines to become Force Recon operators, it is {{required}} to complete each course as they progress through the 'Accession Pipeline' although there are other senior and veteran Marines that have already served with Force Recon, choosing to stay attached to the company only to repeat the 2-year platoon cycle continuously. Whichever the case, they <b>both</b> <b>will</b> attend their respective schools: the candidates traverse through the accession pipeline, as the recon veterans attend specialized schools—both participating in Phase 1 of the MTP.|$|E
