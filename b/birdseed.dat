25|$|Today, {{the plant}} is mostly grown in Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Syria, Mexico, Chile, and China. Since cumin is often used as part of <b>birdseed</b> and {{exported}} to many countries, the plant can occur as an introduced species in many territories. Cumin occurs rarely as an introduced species in the British Isles, mainly in Southern England, but the frequency of its occurrence has declined greatly. According to the Botanical Society of the British Isles' most recent atlas, only one record has been confirmed since 2000.|$|E
25|$|Gartenskulptor (Garden Sculpture), for instance, {{had started}} out as a copy of the {{multiple}} P.O.TH.A.A.VFB, a self-portrait bust made of chocolate and <b>birdseed</b> standing on a bird-table, exposed to the elements. Referred to by Roth as a 'dis- and re-assembly object', each new incarnation gradually acquired working drawings, paintings, sculpted rabbits and collages placed on trellises in collector's gardens. It even acquired a real rabbit and the rabbit's hutch for a number of years. The last time it was installed in a garden was in 1989. When it was exhibited indoors in Switzerland, 1992, Gartenskulptor took up an entire room. By 1995 it was 20m long and included all sorts of objects including a fire ladder and television screens. By 2000, in Mönchengladbach, it was 40 metres long, having acquired elements from each of the installations' incarnations, including pebbly earth excavated by the architects Herzog and de Meuron for the facade of the Schaulager, for instance. The rabbit was no longer present.|$|E
25|$|Generally, American {{black bears}} are largely crepuscular in {{foraging}} activity, though may actively feed at any time. Up to 85% {{of the black}} bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes virtually the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts {{become the most important}} part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, <b>birdseed,</b> agricultural products and honey from apiaries.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{described}} Mr. Hooper as [...] "slightly cranky but good-hearted". [...] Gikow called Mr. Hooper [...] "curmudgeonly". [...] Davis {{stated that}} since Mr. Hooper's {{appearance in the}} first episode of Sesame Street, he had become many things to many young children, [...] "...the guy in the apron {{at the far side}} of the generation gap, his half-lens glasses slipping down his nose". [...] Davis also stated that Hooper's Store, which he called [...] "an idealized social institution", is an extension of Mr. Hooper's personality. [...] Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird, who would often come into Hooper's Store for a <b>birdseed</b> milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper's name, although most attempts ended in [...] "ooper," [...] such as [...] "Looper" [...] or [...] "Cooper". [...] Mr. Hooper's first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.|$|E

2500|$|Capsaicin is {{also used}} to deter pests, {{specifically}} mammalian pests. [...] Targets of capsaicin repellants include voles, deer, rabbits, squirrels, bears, insects, and attacking dogs. [...] Ground or crushed dried chili pods may be used in <b>birdseed</b> to deter rodents, taking advantage of the insensitivity of birds to capsaicin. [...] The Elephant Pepper Development Trust claims the use of chili peppers to improve crop security for rural African communities. Notably, an article published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Health in 2006 states that [...] "Although hot chili pepper extract is commonly used as a component of household and garden insect-repellent formulas, {{it is not clear that}} the capsaicinoid elements of the extract are responsible for its repellency." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{multiple}} was an {{edition of}} 100 cakes {{in the shape}} of a motorcyclist handed out at the opening to an exhibition of Roth's work at Gallery Hansjorg Mayer. Inevitably, few of these have survived, having been eaten by the visitors. Later multiples used chocolate (Untitled 1969, featuring a doll immersed down to her ankles in chocolate); chocolate and <b>birdseed</b> (P.o.TH.A.A.VFB, 1968, a bust of the artist designed to be left out in the garden [...] ); banana (A Pocket Room by Diter Rot, 1968, featuring a slice of banana placed on a print of a kitchen table in a box [...] ) and rabbit shit (Rabbit-Shit-Rabbit, 1972, in which the Lindt chocolate bunny mould was re-used, making an immediately recognisable bunny rabbit from rabbit shit.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The cleverness of many MIT hacks {{has even}} {{resulted}} in urban legends about supposed hacks {{that may not}} have occurred. [...] One rumored hack involved a certain student's adherence to classical conditioning behavior response, as studied by Harvard Professor B. F. Skinner. Throughout the off-season, this supposed student visited the Harvard football stadium during his lunch break. He dressed in a black and white striped shirt and trousers, filled his pockets with bird-seed, then went on the field, blew a whistle, and spread his <b>birdseed</b> on the field. The result of all of this effort, the story goes, is that on opening day as the Harvard football team took the field to face their opponent, the referee blew his whistle to signal the start of the game, and the field was suddenly inundated by a flock of birds looking for their lunch. [...] Despite sounding like a classic MIT hack, this particular prank has never been verified. [...] The author of a 1990 book about pranks pulled by MIT students stated that he had not come across clear documentation of this tale during his years of research.|$|E
2500|$|Some Roman men kept a male {{concubine}} (concubinus, [...] "one who lies with; a bed-mate") {{before they}} married a woman. Eva Cantarella has described {{this form of}} concubinage as [...] "a stable sexual relationship, not exclusive but privileged". Within the hierarchy of household slaves, the concubinus {{seems to have been}} regarded as holding a special or elevated status that was threatened by the introduction of a wife. In a wedding hymn, Catullus portrays the groom's concubinus as anxious about his future and fearful of abandonment. His long hair will be cut, and he will have to resort to the female slaves for sexual gratification—indicating that he is expected to transition from being a receptive sex object to one who performs penetrative sex. The concubinus might father children with women of the household, not excluding the wife (at least in invective). The feelings and situation of the concubinus are treated as significant enough to occupy five stanzas of Catullus's wedding poem. He plays {{an active role in the}} ceremonies, distributing the traditional nuts that boys threw (rather like rice or <b>birdseed</b> in the modern Western tradition).|$|E
2500|$|On August 30, 1928, the Marion Palace Theatre {{opened to}} a packed house for two performances. At the first performance, Colonel George B. Christian gave a brief opening address. The father of President Warren G. Harding's secretary, George B. Christian Jr., the elder Christian was {{actively}} involved in Marion's civic life. His remarks included a short history of theatres in Marion, and he praised {{the beauty of the}} building. John Eberson then made a few remarks and introduced Young. He presented Young with a bag of <b>birdseed,</b> a tongue-in-cheek reference to the stuffed pigeons that Eberson had installed to create the feeling of being outdoors at the Palace. The entertainment began with organ music by Banks Kennedy, a well-known Chicago organist. He had written a new composition, which he titled [...] "Everybody's Welcome to the Palace." [...] Next was a theatre overture, [...] "A Night in the Clock Store," [...] by the Palace Orchestra under the direction of Elmer Newstrom. Four vaudeville acts followed: Harry Kahne, a nationally known mental wizard; Tilyou and Rogers, a comedy team; Johnny Mack and Company (including Ethel Dunton, Dolly Moran and Shirley Manion); and the Castlemans, a trio of entertainers. Following the live acts, a Metro-Goldwin-Mayer silent picture, Excess Baggage (1928 film), starring William Haines, Josephine Dunn and Ricardo Cortez, was shown. The film is now lost. The owner had hoped to open the theatre with the new [...] "talkie" [...] equipment. While the theatre was pre-wired for sound motion pictures, the equipment did not arrive until the following year.|$|E
