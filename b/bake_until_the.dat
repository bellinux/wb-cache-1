5000|$|Chicken Vesuvio, a {{specialty}} of Chicago, is an Italian-American dish made from chicken on {{the bone and}} wedges of potato, celery, and carrots; sauteed with garlic, oregano, white wine, and olive oil, then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> chicken's skin becomes crisp. The dish is often garnished with a few green peas for color, although some more modern variations may omit some of these.|$|R
50|$|The {{dough is}} {{stretched}} out on a large table, or flattened with a pasta maker, then brushed with a fat (butter, lard, shortening, margarine, or a mixture), then rolled into a log (much like a Swiss roll, but with many more layers). Disks are cut from the end, shaped to form pockets, and filled. <b>The</b> pastry is <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> layers separate, forming the sfogliatella's characteristic ridges.|$|R
5000|$|Fa gao (...) is a Chinese cupcake-like pastry, most {{commonly}} consumed on the Chinese new year, {{that is made}} of flour (usually rice flour), leavening (traditionally yeast, but can be chemical leavening), sugar or another sweetener, steamed (instead of <b>baked),</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> top splits into a characteristic [...] "split top" [...] of four segments https://web.archive.org/web/20080723185702/http://my.opera.com/pabha/blog/index.dml/tag/3D%20cake. The batter is typically left to rest for fermentation prior to being steam-cooked.|$|R
50|$|A butter tart {{is a type}} {{of small}} pastry tart highly {{regarded}} in Canadian cuisine and considered one of Canada's quintessential desserts. The tart consists of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg filled into a flaky pastry and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top. The butter tart {{should not be confused with}} butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} beans, the fasolia gigandes turn out better if soaked {{overnight}} in cold water. Then the beans are boiled until tender and drained, {{and the rest}} of ingredients are added. The aromatics are sautéed to make a sofrito and mixed with the beans. Then <b>the</b> beans are <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> top layer of the dish is browned. The beans are garnished with parsley and Greek feta, and served with bread.|$|R
5000|$|Kouign-amann ( [...] ; pl. kouignoù-amann) is a Breton cake. It is a round crusty cake, {{originally}} {{made with}} bread dough (nowadays sometimes viennoiserie dough), containing layers of {{butter and sugar}} folded in, similar in fashion to puff pastry albeit with fewer layers. The resulting cake is slowly <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> butter puffs up the dough (resulting in the layered aspect of it) and the sugar caramelizes. The effect {{is similar to a}} muffin-shaped, caramelized croissant.|$|R
50|$|Baked {{beans are}} a staple side dish for {{various types of}} barbecue. This {{is due in part}} to the ease of handling, as they can be served hot or cold, {{directly}} from the can, making them handy for outdoor eating. The tomato-based sweet sauce also complements many types of barbecue. The already-cooked beans may also be baked in a casserole dish topped with slices of raw bacon, which is <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> bacon is cooked. Additional seasonings are sometimes used, such as additional brown sugar or mustard to make the sauce more tangy.|$|R
50|$|Albanian, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Romanian, Slovenian and Serbian {{versions}} use potatoes {{instead of}} eggplant, pork or beef mince, {{and the top}} layer is usually milk or yogurt mixed with raw eggs, sometimes {{with a couple of}} spoons of flour added. There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a custard. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> top is browned.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{forms of}} {{preparation}} existed for the dish. Outside of the fasting period, {{it was made}} from pork and chicken. The meat was finely chopped or ground and mixed with saffron, eggs, bread crumbs ,almonds and spices. It was then boiled in a saumagen (pig's stomach), after which the saumagen was removed, the meat mass was coated with an egg yolk and the dish was then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> egg and bread crumbs solidified. In its form, this dish may have been prepared to resemble a human head.|$|R
50|$|Buttermilk pie is a custard-like pie. Originally {{from the}} United Kingdom, {{it is now}} a {{traditional}} pie of the southern United States. It is similar to, and sometimes confused with, chess pie but it does not include cornmeal. The basic filling consists of a mixture of sugar, butter, eggs, buttermilk and wheat flour. Variations on the recipe may include flavorings such as vanilla, lemon zest and nutmeg. Buttermilk pies are made with a pie crust. The filling is poured into <b>the</b> crust and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mixture sets. The pie is best eaten at room temperature after being allowed to cool, but may be eaten either warm from the oven or after being chilled.|$|R
5000|$|An Arizona cheese crisp (simply [...] "cheese crisp" [...] in the region) is an open-faced, flour tortilla {{covered in}} {{shredded}} cheese. It {{is put on}} a metal pizza pan that has been brushed with butter or margarine and put under a broiler until it gets crisp. It {{is similar to a}} quesadilla, but distinct in that a cheese crisp is not folded over, and that it is also <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> tortilla becomes crisp. Common cheeses to use include in various combinations are Oaxaca, Monterey Jack, or cheddar. Cheese crisps sometimes are topped with onions, cilantro, or peppers. [...] The cheese crisp {{is said to have been}} made famous by El Charro Café in Tucson, Arizona.|$|R
50|$|Malooga {{dough is}} made much like pizza dough with water, yeast, salt, and flour. It is kneaded {{very well and}} set to rise for an hour. It is cut to large rounds. Each round is then {{stretched}}, and warm ghee is spread over the stretched dough, it is folded over and more ghee is applied, and this process is repeated 1-3 times. All sides are pinched {{together to form a}} neat ball. After a few minutes of sitting, the round is stretched into a flat circular shape and placed on a makhbaza that is used in placing the dough on the wall of a hot taboon much like the tandoor. It is then glazed with an egg-wash, ghee, or buttermilk and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> bottom is brown and with some browning on top.|$|R
50|$|The modern Greek {{version was}} {{probably}} formulated by chef Tselementes in the 1920s. It has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined {{for the final}} baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant sautéed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or puréed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices (cinnamon, allspice and black pepper); and a top layer of Béchamel sauce or savoury custard. The composed dish is then layered into a pan and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> top layer is browned. Moussaka is usually served warm, not piping hot; if cut hot out of the oven, moussaka squares tend to slide apart and consequently the dish needs some resting time to firm up before serving. Reheating, however, does not present the same problem.|$|R
5000|$|The Southern New Mexican {{version is}} usually pork cut into strips and chunks. Historically, before refrigeration, the pork was {{fermented}} in red chile in a crock {{using the same}} bacterial cultures as in yogurt (but it is not dairy). Fermented meat {{was a way of}} preservation and imparted a [...] "sour" [...] taste to the pork which explains why modern New Mexican adovada recipes call for a bit of white vinegar or lemon/lime juice. The red chile is prepared [...] "con pellejo" [...] with bits of the chile skin using spices of fresh minced garlic, mortar and pestle ground oregano, comino (cumin), cilantro, and coriander seeds {{that may or may not}} be toasted. The dish is then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> meat is tender, moist and succulent on the inside while encrusted with a semi-dry and crisp red chile exterior that is almost blackened. Other versions of red chile and boiled or braised pork may be claimed as carne adovada. Other versions of red chilli and pork sin pellejo are actually what is known as Chile Colorado. Carne adovada may be served with a tortilla, beans and rice, fideos or homefries, or papas with a fresh vinegar slaw or salad.|$|R
50|$|The Hot Brown is an open-faced {{sandwich}} {{of turkey}} and bacon, covered in Mornay sauce and <b>baked</b> or broiled <b>until</b> <b>the</b> bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Many Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce {{instead of the}} Mornay.|$|R
2500|$|There {{have been}} no shops in the old village since the early 20th century, {{when there was a}} Butcher and {{slaughterhouse}} (now a dental practice) on the Aylesbury Road, a Blacksmith's forge on the corner with Burton Lane (the house next to it is still called Forge Cottage), and a pub, the Nag's Head (now a house) on the opposite corner. [...] On Burton Lane there was a Saddler and Harness maker (who also made ropes) and a Bakehouse where bread continued to be <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> 1966. Earlier <b>the</b> bakehouse used also to be a general store. In the later 20th century Aston & Full had a factory {{on the north side of}} Mill Lane. In the early 21st century the land was re-designated for residential use.|$|R
5000|$|Onomasiology, {{as a part}} of lexicology, {{starts from}} a concept which is taken to be prior(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an {{activity}} etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as semasiology: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., [...] "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" [...] (answers: french fries in the US, chips in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., [...] "what is the meaning of the term chips?" [...] (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> crisp' in <b>the</b> US).|$|R
5000|$|The normal {{method is}} to make the dough, let it rise to double its volume at room {{temperature}} and then punch it down and let it rise again in the refrigerator for varying periods (according to the recipe), retarding the dough to develop the flavor. Refrigeration also stiffens the dough, which still rises, albeit slowly, making it easier to form. The dough is then shaped, placed in containers for the final proofing, and generally brushed on top with an egg wash before being <b>baked</b> at [...] <b>until</b> <b>the</b> crust browns and the interior reaches at least [...] The first rise time for small rolls is 1 to 1½ hours, for larger brioche the time is lengthened <b>until</b> <b>the</b> loaves double.|$|R

50|$|Fruit is {{sprinkled}} by {{sugar or}} raisins. Mixture is <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> golden crust forms on the top.|$|R
50|$|Cooked {{leftovers}} from a roast meal can be used. However, to make fresh rumbledethumps {{one needs}} to lightly sauté the shredded onion and cabbage in butter <b>until</b> <b>the</b> onion is translucent and the cabbage wilted, then add some potatoes mashed with butter, salt and pepper; after thoroughly mixing the ingredients, they are placed into an oven proof dish, and cheddar (or similar) cheese placed on top, if desired. This is then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> golden brown on top.|$|R
5000|$|... ciambella frastagliata, 'jagged doughnut', {{made with}} mistrà (aniseed-flavour liquor) {{and a high}} {{proportion}} of egg, which is boiled, dried with a cloth, cut in half and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> crispy.|$|R
50|$|Kue bingka, cake made of mashed potato, flour, eggs, sugar, coconut milk, vanilla, {{milk and}} margarine, all mixed as dough and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> {{golden brown and}} cooked. {{probably}} related to Philippines bibingka cake.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the steak, the original meal also included a potato dish, known as Delmonico potatoes, prepared by making a mashed potato dish topped with grated cheese and buttered breadcrumbs, then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> golden brown and served steaming.|$|R
50|$|An apple {{dumpling}} is {{a pastry}} filled with apple, cinnamon and occasionally raisins. Apples are peeled and cored, {{placed on a}} portion of dough, then filled with cinnamon, butter and sugar. Then the dough is folded over the apples and <b>the</b> dumplings are <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> tender.|$|R
50|$|A Bosnian style kadaif pastry is made {{by putting}} down a layer of wire kadaif, then a layer of a filling of chopped nuts, then another layer of wire kadaif. The {{pastries}} are painted with melted butter, <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> golden brown, then drenched in sugar or honey syrup.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the north}} of the Netherlands brown beans are often stewed and served with lardons <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> crisp, pickled {{silverskin}} onions and gherkins, and sugar or apple syrup. In the province of Drenthe, this dish has a cultural significance due to the regional nostalgic novel and tv-series Bartje.|$|R

50|$|The {{chicken wings}} used for Buffalo wings are usually {{segmented}} {{into three parts}} with the end section of the wing, called the flapper or pointer, being discarded. Typically, the wings are deep-fried in oil (although they are sometimes grilled or <b>baked)</b> <b>until</b> they are well browned and then drained if deep fried.|$|R
50|$|It {{comes in}} two {{different}} versions: wet bottom and dry bottom. The dry-bottom version is <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> fully set and results in a more cake-like consistency throughout.
