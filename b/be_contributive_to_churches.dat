Tensile twinning dominates the early stage of plastic deformation and numerical results explicitly show the twinning process including twin formation, propagation and growth. After a twin band (or a narrow twin) is formed, a large gradient of effective stress is found across the band front.

In this paper, we present a novel DCT {{architecture}} that allows aggressive voltage scaling by exploiting {{the fact that not}} all intermediate computations are equally important in a DCT system to obtain “good ” image quality with Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) > 30 dB. This observation has led us to propose a DCT architecture where the signal paths that <b>are</b> less <b>contributive</b> <b>to</b> PSNR improvement <b>are</b> designed to be longer than the paths that <b>are</b> more <b>contributive</b> <b>to</b> PSNR improvement. It {{should also be noted that}} robustness with respect to parameter variations and low power operation typically impose contradictory requirements in terms of architecture design. However, the proposed architecture lends itself to aggressive voltage scaling for low-power dissipation even under process parameter variations. Under a scaled supply voltage and/or variations in process parameters, any possible delay errors would only appear from the long paths that <b>are</b> less <b>contributive</b> towards PSNR improvement, providing large improvement in power dissipation with small PSNR degradation. Results show that even under large process variation and supply voltage scaling (0. 8 V), there is a gradual degradation of image quality with considerable power savings (62. 8 %) for the proposed architecture when compared to existing implementations in 70 nm process technology. 1...|$|R

Sometimes located to one organ, these lesions can be multifocal or related to inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic or premalignant underlying diseases. The abundant data and images imposed us to separate this review into two parts; the systemic diseases will be the subject of a further publication. Aim :An efficient management of such lesions calls for a better collaboration between the specialists within the field of perineology. Proctologists and gynaecologists are the first concerned in their technical and clinical approach. For the different pathologies a therapeutic model is proposed. Diagnostic approach :Images of the various lesions <b>are</b> <b>contributive</b> <b>to</b> a differential diagnosis which can be assessed by histological and serological data whenever necessary.

The perineal disciplines are on the first line for this approach and have a lot to gain of collaboration but finally the healing status will have to be confirmed by the dermatologist.

This refinement approach utilizes the 95 % confidence interval of the estimated parameters of the model to determine their statistical significance in a least-squares regression setting.
