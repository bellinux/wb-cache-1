500|$|Now homeless, Sylvester {{spent much}} of the next decade staying with friends and relatives, in particular, his {{grandmother}} Julia, who expressed no disapproval of his homosexuality, having been a friend of a number of gay men in the 1930s. On occasion, he [...] returned to his mother and step-father's house for a few days at a time, particularly to spend time with his younger sisters, Bernadette and <b>Bernadine.</b> Aged 15, he began frequenting local gay clubs and built up a group of friends from the local gay black community, eventually forming themselves into a group which they called the Disquotays. Sylvester's best friend among the Disquotays was a trans woman named Duchess, who earned her money as a prostitute, a job that Sylvester refused to engage in. The group held lavish house parties, sometimes (without permission) at the home of their friend, rhythm and blues singer Etta James, in which they dressed up in female clothing and wigs, constantly trying to outdo one another in appearance.|$|E
60|$|Again Peter {{blew his}} whistle {{and again the}} silence was broken only by <b>Bernadine's</b> laugh. Suddenly, however, that laugh was checked. Everyone had turned toward the door, listening. A bell was ringing {{throughout}} the house.|$|R

500|$|In July, some of Perot's past actions, {{including}} a private {{investigation of the}} Bush family in the late 1980s, circulated in the media, causing frustration for the campaign. Perot blamed the reports on a [...] "Republican research team" [...] and claimed that he was warned that since {{he had such a}} [...] "clean record they have got to try to redefine you and destroy you". Campaign officials tried {{to come up with a}} new strategy to combat the negative press, and to end Perot's use of generalizations on the issues. Perot sought National Institutes of Health head Dr. <b>Bernadine</b> Healy as his running mate, but she declined. Meanwhile, Perot faced obstacles on the campaign trail. During an Olympia rally, he was approached by a gay rights group, demanding that he address AIDS and gay rights; he soon flipped on the issue and stated that he would allow gays to serve in the military and in his cabinet. During an address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot faced his toughest demographic, and made the gaffe of referring to African Americans as [...] "you people". It was later revealed that Perot did not want to appear at the meeting or any other forum without his supporters. Press consultant Squires had written a speech for Perot for the occasion, but he instead used his own. After the speech, Perot was concerned that members of the New Black Panther Party were plotting his assassination.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Watson was {{appointed}} as the Head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, {{a position he}} held until April 10, 1992. Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new NIH Director, <b>Bernadine</b> Healy. Watson was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the [...] "laws of nature." [...] Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, [...] "The {{nations of the world}} must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations." [...] He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs.

2500|$|From its {{inception}} in 1930 until 2006, the Magen David Adom organization, the Israeli equivalent to the Red Cross, was not accepted {{as part of the}} Federation, as it used the Star of David, which the ICRC refused to recognize as an acceptable symbol. This meant that although Arab ambulances would be protected by the ICRC, Israeli ambulances would not. [...] In May 2000, <b>Bernadine</b> Healy, the president of the American Red Cross, wrote: [...] "The international committee's feared proliferation of symbols is a pitiful fig leaf, used for decades as the reason for excluding the Magen David Adom – the Shield (or Star) of David." [...] In protest over the ICRC's perceived anti-Israel discrimination, the ARC withdrew its financial support. In 2005, at a meeting of nations party to the Geneva convention, the ICRC adopted the new Red Crystal. [...] Magen David Adom then centered the Star of David sign inside the newly accepted signage, and in 2006 was accepted as a full member. Yonatan Yagodovsky, director of MDA’s fundraising department, said in an article published in October 2011 that [...] "MDA will continue to use its emblem and logo, and no one ever asked us to take it off." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you mind}} coming in mine?" [...] she begged. [...] "It {{is of no}} consequence, if you object, but every servant in <b>Bernadine's</b> house is a German and a spy.

60|$|She {{touched the}} knobs {{in the wall}} and the room was {{suddenly}} flooded with illumination. At the further end of the apartment was the great safe. Close to it, in an easy chair, his evening coat changed for a smoking jacket, with a neatly tied black tie replacing his crumpled white cravat, the Baron de Grost sat awaiting his guest. A fierce oath broke from <b>Bernadine's</b> lips. He turned toward the door only in time to hear the key turn. Violet tossed it lightly in the air across to her husband.|$|R
60|$|The {{shooting}} began a {{few minutes}} later. Major Kosuth, from a camp stool a few yards behind his friend, watched with somewhat languid interest. He gave one, indeed, the impression that his thoughts were far removed from this simple country party, the main object of whose existence for the present {{seemed to be the}} slaying of a certain number of inoffensive birds. He watched the indifferent performance of his friend and the remarkably fine shooting of his neighbour on the left, with the same lack-lustre eye and want of enthusiasm. The beat was scarcely over before Peter, resigning his smoking guns to his loader, lit a cigarette and strolled across to the next stand. He plunged at once into a conversation with Kosuth, notwithstanding <b>Bernadine's</b> ill-concealed annoyance.|$|R
60|$|<b>Bernadine</b> {{opened the}} door and called softly to one of his men. In less than five minutes De Grost was bound hand and foot. <b>Bernadine</b> stepped back and eyed his adversary with an air of ill-disguised triumph.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{young girl}} Griffin {{attended}} St. <b>Bernadine's</b> Elementary School and began to develop a dislike for organized religion because of the punishments she and other [...] "vulnerable" [...] students received from the nuns. After graduation, she attended Oak Park and River Forest High School and sought refuge in musical theatre, playing roles such as Rosemary in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Hodel in Fiddler on the Roof. During her senior year she began arguing with her parents, who wanted her to attend college, {{because she wanted to}} become a professional actress. Her first appearance on television was as an extra on a Chicago White Sox commercial, and she was then signed with several Chicago talent agencies. At 18, Griffin persuaded her parents to move to Los Angeles to help her become famous.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{read the}} story in the New York Herald," [...] Peter continued. [...] "It is grossly exaggerated, of course, but this is the {{substance}} of it. Sirdeller and his suite were stopped upon the Spanish frontier and treated in an abominable fashion by the customs officers. He was forced to pay a very large sum, unjustly I should think. He paid under protest, appealed to the authorities, with no result. At San Sebastian he was robbed right and left, his privacy intruded upon. In short, he took a violent dislike and hatred to the country and every one concerned in it. He moved with his entire suite to Nice, to the Golden Villa. There he expressed himself freely concerning Spain and her Government. Count von Hern heard of it and presented Marsine. The plot was, without doubt, <b>Bernadine's.</b> Can't you imagine how he would put it? 'A revolution,' he would tell Sirdeller, 'is imminent in Spain. Here is the new President of the Republic. Money is no more to you than water. You are a patriotic American. Have you forgotten that a warship of your country with six hundred of her devoted citizens was sent to the bottom by the treachery of one of this effete race? The war was an inefficient revenge. The country still flourishes. It is for you to avenge America. With money Marsine can establish a republic in Spain within twenty-four hours.' Sirdeller hesitates. He would point out that it had never been proved that the destruction of the Maine was really due to Spanish treachery. It is the idea of a business man which followed. He, at his own expense, would raise the Maine. If it were true that the explosion occurred from outside, he would find the money. You see, the message has arrived. After all these years the sea has given up its secret. Marsine will return to Spain with an unlimited credit behind him. The House of Brangaza will crumble up like a pack of cards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is never}} {{too young for}} <b>Bernadine</b> to take a hand," [...] the Marquis replied grimly. [...] "Listen, de Grost. <b>Bernadine</b> will {{probably}} try {{to make friends with}} you. You may think it wise to accept his advances, you may believe that you can guard your own secrets in his company; perhaps, even, that you may learn his. Do not try it, my friend. You have received the best proof possible that we do not underrate your abilities, but there is no other man like <b>Bernadine.</b> I would not trust myself alone with him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Bernadine</b> twirled {{his fair}} {{moustache}} and shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a moment," [...] he admitted, [...] "when I had a suspicion. It has passed. This {{woman is}} no Roman. She sells {{the secrets of}} <b>Bernadine</b> as she would sell herself. Nevertheless, it is well always to be prepared. There were {{probably}} others beside <b>Bernadine</b> who had the entree here." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>Bernadine</b> {{took the}} plunge. He became {{suddenly}} very grave.|$|E
60|$|Peter {{replaced}} {{the receiver and}} turned slowly round. <b>Bernadine</b> was smiling.|$|E
60|$|He half {{filled a}} glass and pushed the bottle toward <b>Bernadine.</b>|$|E
60|$|The hip pocket was empty. Peter's {{sentence}} ended abruptly. <b>Bernadine</b> mocked him.|$|E
