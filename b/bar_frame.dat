25|$|The R class {{adopted the}} <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> {{construction}} of the H and S class express passenger locomotives, which had proven {{to be far more}} robust in coping with the VR's varying track quality than the fracture-prone plate frames of the A2.|$|E
25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, power-operated reversing gear, American-style <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|E
2500|$|The main frames were [...] thick cut bar frames. On the SAR, the <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> had {{previously}} only been employed on the German-built Class GCA 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt.|$|E
50|$|Specialty frames such as cell <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> {{are used}} to raise new queens.|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each engine unit, outside <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the grate area. They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve gear and outside <b>bar</b> <b>frames.</b> The leading wheels were arranged as conventional pony trucks, while the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R
50|$|The 20th {{class was}} the first and only class of Rhodesia Railways {{locomotives}} to be fitted with mechanical stokers. Other technical features included <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> and thermic syphons.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives EF10 34 to 41 {{used the}} {{original}} <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> bogie design.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had a <b>bar</b> <b>frame,</b> Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and used saturated steam.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Class B Hendrie D, the ALCO {{locomotive}} {{also used}} Walschaerts valve gear, {{but it had}} a <b>bar</b> <b>frame,</b> larger 24 in diameter pistons, lower [...] boiler pressure, superheating, an American type cab and some other features which were typical of American design, such as high running boards. It was the first superheated locomotive to be acquired by the NGR and also the first with a <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1944 tow <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> had {{holes for}} bolting through the drag chains - 1950 {{trailers}} had no holes and drag chain ends welded to the tow frame.|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, ten Class U Union Garratt {{locomotives}} {{were placed}} in service. The locomotives, designed and built by Maffei, were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear and <b>bar</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|They were {{conceived}} as mixed traffic locomotives, equally suitable for goods and passenger work, and had <b>bar</b> <b>frames,</b> narrow fireboxes and used saturated steam. The Type WG bogie tender entered service with these engines.|$|R
50|$|The {{patented}} type of {{tandem compound}} cylinders were arranged outside the <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b> The high-pressure cylinders, in front, were 13 in in diameter, while the low-pressure cylinders, arranged behind, were 23 in in diameter, {{with a common}} stroke of 26 in. Each cylinder, with its valve chest, was cast separately and separate from the saddle casting. The high-pressure cylinders were bolted onto {{the front of the}} low-pressure cylinders which, in turn, were bolted onto the saddle casting which was fitted to the main <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The new DR Class 99.23-24 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} {{on the basis of}} the Einheitsloks. Differences in the new engines are the feedwater heater and the <b>bar</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main frames were 5 {{in thick}} cut bar frames. On the SAR, the <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> had {{previously}} only been employed on the German-built Class GCA 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} had <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> (as was usual American practice) but, otherwise, {{they were}} of quite [...] "British" [...] appearance. Both were fitted with new taper boilers at the GWR's Swindon Works in 1908.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} design followed North American {{practice in}} many ways and their appearance was typically American, with high running boards and large cabs. They had <b>bar</b> <b>frames,</b> Walschaerts valve gear, Belpaire fireboxes and were superheated.|$|R
50|$|When {{taken into}} the NZR fleet in 1908, she was {{allocated}} her own class and NZR No. 466. With a tendency for breaking the <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> on the heavy banking duty, she saw little service after 1920.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives EF10 18 and 19 {{continued}} {{with the same}} rounded body styling as EF10 17, but used a similar <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> bogie design to the first batch of locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{differed in}} several points from earlier principles for Prussian locomotive design. Firstly {{they had a}} continuous <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> and a wide, outer, Belpaire firebox located above the frame with a large grate area.|$|E
50|$|The three driven {{wheelsets}} {{are fixed}} firmly in a <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> with a 70 mm side thickness (Wangenstärke). The two {{front and rear}} carrying axles are able to swing out radially and are housed in a Bissell truck.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, {{fourteen}} 6th Class <b>bar</b> <b>framed</b> steam locomotives with a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement {{were placed}} in service by the Cape Government Railways. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and designated Class 6J.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{use of the}} 20th {{class was}} ill-fated. The {{locomotives}} were plagued with teething troubles including cracks in the locomotives' frames and fireboxes. Unlike the South African Railways' GMA, which had cast steel frames, the 20th had conventional fabricated <b>bar</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and were superheated, using the Schmidt type superheater. Unlike {{most of the}} other SAR Mallet classes, which had round-topped fireboxes, the Class MJ had Belpaire fireboxes. The four cylinders were arranged outside the 4 in thick <b>bar</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|The two {{machines}} {{were the first}} in Germany to have a <b>bar</b> <b>frame,</b> which had been standard in the USA virtually {{from the beginning and}} which had been developed from the wooden beam frames of the early locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> while the slide valves, arranged above the cylinders, were actuated by Stephenson link motion through rocker shafts. Two sandboxes were mounted atop the boiler, {{fore and aft}} of the steam dome.|$|E
50|$|These {{were made}} of two steel bars which are usually 4 - 7 in thick. They were first used on the Bury <b>Bar</b> <b>Frame</b> {{locomotive}} during the 1830s, and were widely used in the USA throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|Advance Concrete uses AutoCAD {{technology}}: ObjectARX. This technology {{provides users}} with professional objects (beams, columns, slabs, <b>bars,</b> <b>frames,</b> stirrup <b>bars)</b> integrated into AutoCAD and on which most basic AutoCAD functions {{can be applied}} (stretch, shorten, copy, move). The Advance Concrete native file is the DWG file.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated, with <b>bar</b> <b>frames,</b> Walschaerts valve gear, steam-operated {{reversing gear}} and 11 in diameter piston valves. Since {{the proportions of}} the engine units and the wheel diameters {{were the same as}} that of the Class 19D, many of their parts were made interchangeable.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, five Class GDA Garratts entered branchline service. They {{were built}} by Linke-Hofmann Werke AG in Breslau, Germany, {{to the same}} {{specifications}} as the Class GD, also superheated and with Walschaerts valve gear, but with <b>bar</b> <b>frames,</b> differently shaped coal and water bunkers and round-topped fireboxes.|$|R
50|$|The R class {{adopted the}} <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> {{construction}} of the H and S class express passenger locomotives, which had proven {{to be far more}} robust in coping with the VR's varying track quality than the fracture-prone plate frames of the A2.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a superheated, four-cylinder, {{compound engine}} and a <b>bar</b> <b>frame,</b> {{like most other}} Bavarian four-cylinder compounds, which simplified access to the inside driving gear. All four cylinders drove the second coupled axle. The leading axle was of the Adams type.|$|E
5000|$|In 1931, {{a single}} light Class NG G14 Garratt entered service. Built by Hanomag in 1930, it {{was similar to}} but {{slightly}} larger than the Class NG G12, also superheated but with larger bore cylinders, an outside <b>bar</b> <b>frame</b> and a round-topped firebox.|$|E
25|$|The Sclass was VR's first three-cylinder locomotive, and Smith's {{design was}} {{influenced}} by Nigel Gresley's Great Northern Railway A1 class 4-6-2 with its Gresley conjugated valve gear. The Sclass also showed American design influence in its use of a delta trailing truck and <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> rather than plate frames.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the CSAR's Classes 8 and 9, the Class F {{suffered}} from fractures in the <b>bar</b> <b>frames,</b> particularly between the cylinders and the leading coupled wheels. The problem was overcome by fitting 1/2 in thick flitch plates {{on each side of}} the frame at this point.|$|R
50|$|The main {{differences}} were the welded plate <b>frames</b> instead of <b>bar</b> <b>frames</b> {{and more powerful}} boilers with combustion chambers. The locomotives which were newly developed by the Bundesbahn stand out visually from their Reichsbahn and former state railway (Länderbahnen) counterparts, particularly because of their shiny, silver-coloured boiler rings.|$|R
