Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes' Trevor Kidd. Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered {{an integral part of the}} Islanders' defence, and, along with Zdeno Chára, Kenny Jönsson and Roberto Luongo, was considered untouchable by management at the 1999 NHL trade deadline. Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.|$|E

However, a deal failed to materialize and there was speculation in the media that he would instead play in Europe. It was reported that Kariya was seeking a US$12 million contract over five years from the Ducks. As both sides continued contract talks leading up to training camp for the 1994–95 season, Kariya agreed to a three-year, $6.5 million deal on August 31, 1994. The majority of the contract consisted of a signing bonus worth $4.775 million, while the annual <b>base</b> <b>salary</b> was valued at $575,000.

5|$|A 33-point season {{followed}} for Niedermayer in 1995–96, but the Devils {{became the first}} defending champion in 26 years to miss the playoffs. After a 35-point season in 1996–97, Niedermayer's best statistical season in New Jersey came in 1997–98 with a 14-goal, 57-point campaign. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, scoring a goal, and {{was named to the}} NHL's Second All-Star Team at the season's end. After finishing second in league scoring amongst defencemen, despite playing in New Jersey's stifling defensive system that suppresses offence, Niedermayer demanded a significant raise. He rejected an offer that would have paid him a <b>base</b> <b>salary</b> of $3.25 million and, unable to come to terms {{before the start of the}} 1998–99 season, began the year as a holdout. As the dispute dragged into the season, he joined the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). After missing the first month of the NHL season, Niedermayer and the Devils finally agreed to a multi-year contract, the terms of which were not released. He appeared in 71 games with the Devils that season, recording 46 points.|$|E
5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His <b>base</b> <b>salary</b> for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.|$|E

His numbers were impressive through the rest of the season, allowing no runs between June 9 and August 18, and between August 25 and September 16. and finishing 2004 with 44 saves in 47 opportunities and an ERA of 1.62. The Twins won the AL Central division and faced the New York Yankees in the ALDS.

40|$|Because <b>base</b> <b>salaries</b> for {{teachers}} in Cote d'Ivoire {{are higher than}} wages of workers in other occupations, there is some question about whether teachers are overpaid. This paper used multivariate analysis based on the monthly wage rate functions to investigate the differences between teachers andother occupations. It {{was found that the}} <b>base</b> <b>salaries</b> {{for teachers}} contained an economic rent component, largely due to the wage setting behaviour of the Ivorian government. This salary premium disappears, however, when the total renumeration package is considered, i. e. including in-kind benefits, bonuses and commissions, which are more widely received by non-teachers. Policymakers should thus be cautious when considering budget cuts that would lower teachers salaries, cuts certain to make the teaching profession less attractive.
