5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it.

5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning.

I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up.
