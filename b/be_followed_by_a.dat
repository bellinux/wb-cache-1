5|$|A novel {{adaptation}} of The Fifth Element, written by Terry Bisson, {{was published by}} HarperPrism in 1997. There were rumors after the film's release that it would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sequel, tentatively titled Mr. Shadow. In 2011, Besson stated that a sequel was never planned, {{and that he has}} no desire to make one.|$|E
5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone. It's not only {{hard to believe that}} a sequel this downright abominable didn't kill the franchise, but that it actually would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> movie that was arguably worse—Jaws: the Revenge.|$|E
5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several of the short stories from the novel to create a single narrative, and adding in an all-purpose villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio {{hoped it would be}} successful enough to <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995.|$|E
50|$|The opening <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> hymn. The hymn <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> psalmody. The psalmody <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> scripture reading. The {{reading is}} called a chapter (capitulum) if it is short, or a lesson (lectio) if it is long.|$|R

5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross Music Selection is a mini-album of Chrono Cross {{music that}} was {{released}} in North America exclusively as a bonus for pre-ordering Chrono Cross. The five-track disc was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, has a length of 15:47 and was published by Square along with the game on August 15, 2000. Although {{the release of the}} album sparked rumors that it would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> North American release of the full soundtrack album, Square Enix has not to date published Chrono Cross OST outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|He {{ended the}} season by winning his first career postseason start; on October 7, {{he earned a}} 3–1 victory in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He pitched 6⅔ shutout innings, struck out nine, walked two and allowed four hits. It remains the Padres' only victory in ten post-season games against the Cardinals. The Padres lost the series three games to one. Young's 6–0 road {{performance}} in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories by a pitcher since post-season play began in 1903. However, {{it was the first}} to <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> postseason road victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater political control {{at the expense of}} independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> long minority and a period of political instability.|$|E

5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, {{and in the same}} individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|Desaix’s arrival around 5:30 pm stabilised the French {{position}} as the 9th Light Infantry Regiment delayed the Austrian advance down the main road {{and the rest of}} the army re-formed north of Cascina Grossa. As the pursuing Austrian troops arrived, a mix of musketry and artillery fire concealed the surprise attack of Général de Brigade (GdB) François Étienne de Kellermann’s cavalry, which threw the Austrian pursuit into disordered flight back into Alessandria, with about 14,000 killed, wounded, or captured. The French casualties were considerably fewer, but included Desaix. The whole French line chased after the Austrians to seal une victoire politique (a political victory) that secured Bonaparte’s grip on power after the coup. It would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> propaganda campaign, which sought to rewrite the story of the battle three times during Napoleon’s rule.|$|E
5|$|Most often, of course, the {{predicate}} {{consists of}} a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, {{with or without a}} copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g. uuž orhison drink- leave- 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g. ter güjž bajna s/he run- be- 'she is running'. Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect, e.g., progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g., ter irsen bajna s/he come- be- 'he has come'. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} that the game was transitioning to become a free-to-play game under the title Evolve: Stage 2 due to the game downloadable content controversy and mixed critical reception. The new version introduces new changes, including longer respawn time, non-ranked queue for casual players, and changes to hunters' abilities. Turtle Rock also promised that patches would be released more frequently and that most items featured in the game would be unlocked through simply playing the game. The alpha version of Stage 2 would begin on July 7, 2016, for PC, and will <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> beta in August in the same year. Players who purchased the game will be given the Founders status, which gives them exclusive cosmetic items. In October 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced that}} they would end support for Evolve, and that Evolve: Stage 2 would not be released for consoles, but servers for the game will remain online for ‘foreseeable future’. Turtle Rock also revealed that it was 2K's decision to end the game's support.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{commander}} on Bougainville, Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, initially {{believed that}} the landing at Empress Augusta Bay was a diversion, and would <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> direct assault on {{the south of the}} island. However, he conducted several small and unsuccessful attacks against the beachhead in early November after being ordered to do so by the Eighth Area Army using units from his 17thArmy and forces dispatched directly from Rabaul. The United States forces subsequently expanded their beachhead, and defeated the Japanese forces in the area in a series of battles in November and December. While most of the Japanese units involved in these engagements were destroyed, the total number of casualties inflicted on the 17thArmy was not crippling; the Americans captured 25 prisoners and a small amount of equipment and estimated that over 2,458 Japanese had been killed.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climate deterioration, {{resulting}} in more land becoming unproductive. Self-sufficient farms were based around a single homestead or a small cluster of homes. More oats and barley were grown than corn, and cattle {{were the most important}} domesticated animal. From c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at greater heights and made land more productive. The system of infield and outfield agriculture may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century. By the late Medieval period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. These were settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, organised in run rigs. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen. The rural economy boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> slow recovery in the fifteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|... "M", unlike Hamasaki's {{antecedent}} songs, {{does not}} follow the verse-chorus form; rather, the song opens with <b>an</b> introduction that <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> brief instrumental bridge that precedes two verses. The verses <b>are</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pre-chorus after which comes an instrumental bridge; that <b>is</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> repetition of the pre-chorus and the verse. The chorus and a repetition of it follow; the chorus and its repetition are separated by another instrumental bridge. Finally, a second verse is sung before the repetition of the introduction, {{at which point the}} song ends.|$|R

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{to cut down}} the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include carriages and horsemen. After the tree {{to be used as}} the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, apples, and sometimes with the Serbian flag. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often bunches of leaved oak twigs are prepared to be distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> procession, {{as is the case in}} parts of Republika Srpska and the Bay of Kotor.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Renaissance on Scottish {{architecture}} {{has been seen as}} occurring in two distinct phases. First, from the early fifteenth century the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture, to <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> second phase of more directly influenced Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century. The re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly dominant in England in the late Medieval era, may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and may have been a conscious reaction to English forms in favour of continental ones. It {{can be seen in the}} nave of Dunkeld Cathedral, begun in 1406, the facade of St Mary's, Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's Kings College, Aberdeen (1500–9). About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Many, like Trinity College, Edinburgh, showed a combination of Gothic and Renaissance styles.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to <b>be</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
