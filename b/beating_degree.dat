The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of beating and refining {{as well as the}} fibre furnish on the properties of silk paper, such as air permeance, softness, pore size, tensile index and burst index. The results showed that the beating characteristic of silk fibre was similar to that of plant fibre, they all had the characteristic of fibrillation. Silk paper had excellent softness and air permeance when the <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> of silk pulp was 20 °SR, 181. 3 µm/Pa·s and 2. 5 mN·m 2 /g respectively, which was superior to paper made from plant fibres of the same <b>beating</b> <b>degree.</b> The minimum average pore size of silk paper was 5. 11 µm at the <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> of 20 °SR, and it decreased with the increase of <b>beating</b> <b>degree,</b> reached 0. 79 µm at the <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> of 67 °SR. With the increase of <b>beating</b> <b>degree,</b> the tensile index of silk paper increased at first, and then decreased. The burst index of silk paper showed a upward trend, but the softness and air permeance of it constantly decreased. The tensile strength of paper made from mixed-furnish pulp consisting of silk and softwood reached the maximum when the amount of silk fibre was 4 %, and its air permeance increased with the increase of silk fibre...|$|E

40|$|In this work, corn stover was refined by a pulp {{refining}} instrument (PFI refiner) after NaOH pretreatment under varied conditions. The quantitative {{characterization of}} the influence of PFI refining on enzymatic hydrolysis was studied, and it was proved that the enhancement of enzymatic saccharification by PFI refining of the pretreated corn stover was largely due to the significant increment of porosity of substrates and the reduction of cellulose crystallinity. Furthermore, a linear relationship between <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> and final total sugar yields was found, and a simple way to predict the final total sugar yields by easily testing the <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> of PFI refined corn stover was established. Therefore, this paper provided the possibility and feasibility for easily monitoring the fermentable sugar production by the simple test of <b>beating</b> <b>degree,</b> and this will be of significant importance for the monitoring and controlling of industrial production in the future.

40|$|Soy-protein is used, for {{the first}} time, as bulk binder in {{papermaking}} from wood pulps (hardwood and softwood pulps). Wood pulps represent the major pulps used for paper production. A green denaturing method, involving only biodegradable compounds, was found sufficient to expose the functional groups of proteins. Addition of denatured soy-protein caused a considerable increase in all strength properties of paper, at all <b>beating</b> <b>degrees.</b> The effect was highest in non-wood (for comparison) followed by hardwood and softwood pulps respectively. This could be correlated to ratio of fiber length/width, fines, and hemicellulose content of pulps. The less the ratio, and the higher the fines and hemicellulose content, the more was the increase in strength properties; due to more exposed surfaces. The outstanding effect of soy-protein was magnifying the desired opacifying effect and retention of inorganic fillers e. g. kaolin, while eliminating the loss in strength, which occurs normally due to fillers...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{mechanical}} properties of ultra-low density plant fiber composite (ULD_PFC), a suitable beating process {{to improve the}} fibrillation of cellulose fibers and maintain their length was investigated. The physical properties of cellulose fibers and papers, surface chemical bonds, and internal bond strength (IB) of ULD_PFCs were analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} beating degrees, degree of fibrillation, and fiber fines increased with the decreasing of beating gap, except for the fiber weight-average length, width, kink index, and curl index. The tensile index and burst index of paper showed an increasing trend with an increase in <b>beating</b> <b>degree,</b> while the tear index showed a decreasing trend.

30|$|It is not {{surprising}} that RANDOM has the worst performance on all datasets. The degree-centrality heuristic, DEGREE, greatly improves the influence spread, which is 4 - 8 times better than RANDOM. It makes sense that the well-connected nodes (social hubs) facilitate influence diffusion with their high reach to others. Top-K is analogous to DEGREE in the sense of targeting the group of most influential nodes who achieve largest influence spread individually. It achieves an improvement of 28.4 %, 3.8 %, 6.5 %, and 7.3 % over DEGREE on PGP, NetHEPT, WikiVote, and C.elegans, respectively. However, its improvement on influence spread comes with a huge sacrifice on efficiency since it relies on expensive MC simulation. Both DEGREE and Top-K fail to capture {{the fact that many of}} the highest-degree or most influential nodes may be clustered, which results in large overlaps of influence spread. IV-Greedy incorporates the mechanism to minimize overlaps, and achieves the best performance in the comparison with RANDOM, DEGREE, and Top-K. The larger seed-set size, the greater improvement.

40|$|Reversible thermochromic paper able {{to resist}} {{counterfeiting}} was prepared by adding reversible thermochromic microcapsules (RTM) to a slurry of cellulosic fibers, {{a process that is}} difficult to imitate. However, the loss of RTM {{is one of the biggest}} problems that inhibits industrial use of this approach. So, the retention of RTM in pulp was investigated. The RTM was synthesized by in-situ polymerization, and its properties were characterized. It exhibited strong color contrast between cool and heated conditions, and such behavior could be used to achieve distinctive anticounterfeiting characteristics in the paper. The surface of each microcapsule was smooth, and there was no coherence between particles. The diameters of the microcapsules were mainly in the range 3. 0 μm to 5. 0 μm. Retention of RTM was closely related to <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> and pulp composition; the higher the <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> and hardwood pulp content, the higher the retention of RTM.

The amounts of PAn coated on chemical pulps were higher than those coated on high yield pulps, and the surface resistivities of conductive papers prepared from chemical pulps were lower than those prepared from high yield pulps. As the substrates {{for the production of}} PAn-coated conductive paper, bleached chemical pulps were better than unbleached chemical pulps. The conductivity had a significant positive linear correlation with the amount of PAn coated. The amount of PAn coated increased with increasing content of sulfonic groups in CTMP or decreasing kappa number of unbleached kraft pulp. We hypothesized that this might be associated with the ionizability of acidic groups and the inhibiting effect of lignin on aniline polymerization. The <b>beating</b> <b>degree</b> of pulp seemed to have an insignificant effect on the conductivity of PAn-coated conductive paper.

40|$|Music is a {{universal}} human behaviour, is fundamentally temporal, and has unique temporal properties. This thesis presents research on the cognitive neuroscience of the temporal aspects of music: rhythm, beat, and metre. Specifically, this work investigates how cultural experience influences behavioural and neural measures of rhythm processing, and the different neural mechanisms (with particular interest {{in the role of}} the striatum) that underlie different stages of beat perception, as musical rhythms unfold. Chapter 1 presents an overview of the existing literature on the perceptual, cognitive, and neural processing of rhythm, including the entrainment of neural oscillations to rhythm and the neuroanatomical substrates of rhythm perception. Chapter 2 presents research on cross-cultural differences in the perception and production of musical rhythm and beat. Here, East African and North American participants performed three tasks (beat tapping, rhythm discrimination, and rhythm reproduction) using rhythms from East African and Western music. The results indicate an influence of culture on beat tapping and rhythm reproduction, but not rhythm discrimination. Chapter 3 presents electroencephalographic (EEG) research on cross-cultural differences in neural entrainment to rhythm and <b>beat.</b> The <b>degree</b> to which neural oscillations entrained to the different regular ‘metrical levels’ of rhythms differed between groups, suggesting an influence of culture. Moreover, across all participants, the proportion of trials in which different rates were tapped was correlated with the degree of neural entrainment to those rates. Chapter 4 presents functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research on the different neural mechanisms that underlie the different stages of beat perception (finding, continuation, and adjustment). Distinct regions of the striatum (dorsal vs. ventral putamen) were active to different extents in beat finding and adjustment, respectively. Activity in other regions (including the cerebellum, parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, and insula) also differed between stages. Additionally, when rhythms were metrically incongruent (polyrhythmic), additional activity was found in superior temporal gyri and the insula.

It has also been suggested that the LLD position is associated with increased sympathetic nervous activity. MethodsA total of 75 patients with CHF and 75 control subjects underwent nocturnal polysomnography with monitoring of body position. Echocardiography was performed in all patients with CHF to determine left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD). A total of 40 patients underwent cardiac catheterization from which pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac output (CO) were obtained. ResultsPatients with CHF spent significantly less time in the LLD position than in the right lateral decubitus position. No such difference was observed among control subjects. Among patients with CHF, those with larger LVEDD, higher PCWP, and lower CO spent less time in the LLD position. ConclusionsPatients with CHF avoid the LLD position spontaneously during sleep.

The present study developed the train {{of research on}} synchronous music and extended it to elite athletes. Design: Repeated-measures laboratory experiment. Method: Elite triathletes (n = 11) ran in time to self-selected motivational music, a neutral equivalent and a no-music control during submaximal and exhaustive treadmill running. Measured variables were time-to-exhaustion, mood responses, feeling states, RPE, blood lactate concentration, oxygen consumption and running economy. Results: Time-to-exhaustion was 18. 1 % and 19. 7 % longer, respectively, when running in time to motivational and neutral music, compared to no music. Mood responses and feeling states were more positive with motivational music compared to either neutral music or no music. RPE was lowest for neutral music and highest for the no-music control. Blood lactate concentrations were lowest for motivational music. Oxygen consumption was lower with music by 1. 0 %–. 7 %. Both music conditions were associated with better running economy than the no-music control. Conclusions: Although neutral music did not produce {{the same level of}} psychological benefits as motivational music, it proved equally beneficial in terms of time-to-exhaustion and oxygen consumption.

It {{is characterized by the}} presence {{of a large number of}} toxins that specifically interact with ion channels of excitable cells. The Egyptian scorpion Androctonus bicolor belongs to the family of Buthidae and until now no information is available about the effect of its venom on cardiac muscles. Using an in vitro approach, cardiotoxicity and mode of action of A. bicolor venom on isolated toad’s heart were investigated. Direct application of scorpion venom (0. 5 μg/ml) into isolated toad’s heart induced a remarkable bradycardia concomitant with a protraction in the conduction time (P–R interval). In the meantime, a significant increase in the R-wave amplitude (ventricular contraction) was noticed after 5 min of venom perfusion. Various cases of cardiac disorders were recorded such as sinus arrhythmias, ectopic <b>beats</b> and different <b>degrees</b> of heart block. Through using different autonomic and ion channel blockers, the possible mechanism of action of A. bicolor venom on isolated toad’s heart was revealed. The application of both atropine (4 μg/ml) and verapamil (5 μg/ml) could not alleviate the pronounced negative chronotropic and positive inotropic effects. Meanwhile, a significant decrease in the R-wave amplitude was observed after propranolol (5 μg/ml) application. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the venom of A. bicolor directly influenced the cardiac electrical activity of toads through β-adrenergic receptors. The direct effect of this venom on cardiac tissues may significantly contribute in the development of several cardiotoxic effects following scorpion sting...|$|R

It was found that bonding is clearly increased by beating of kraft pulp, starch addition, and thermomechanical pulp fines, whereas activation benefited most from beating and addition of reinforcement fibers to mechanical pulp based furnishes. Subjecting test sheets to increasing amounts of drying stress affected activation positively, and bonding negatively.

Bonding, on the other hand, deteriorated more significantly in sheets made of extensively beaten kraft fibers, i. e. in sheets where the initial bonding potential was higher. Commonly used paper strength measurements provide dependable and accurate tools for assessing the effect of different variables on both bonding and activation. A short literature survey of bonding and activation is also provided...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{high level}} {{production}} of a cellulase-free xylanase using wheat bran, a cost-effective substrate, under submerged fermentation by alkalophilic Bacillus subtilis ASH. Production of xylanase was observed even at alkaline pH up to 11. 0 and temperature 60 °C, although the highest enzyme titer was recorded at neutral pH and 37 °C. The enzyme production under optimized fermentation was 1. 5 -fold greater than under unoptimized conditions. Pre-treatment of unbleached pulp of 10 % consistency with crude xylanase (6 IU/g o. d. pulp) at 60 ºC for 2 h increased the final brightness by 4. 9 %. The enzyme treatment reduced the chlorine consumption by 28. 6 % with the same brightness as in the control. A reduction in kappa number and increase in viscosity was observed after enzyme pre-treatment. Scanning electron microscopy revealed loosening and swelling of pulp fibers. The strength properties viz. grammage, fiber thickness, <b>beating</b> <b>degree,</b> tensile index, breaking length, tear index and double fold of the treated pulp were improved {{as compared to the}} control pulp. This study reveals the potential of B. subtilis ASH xylanase as a biobleaching agent for the paper and pulp industry...|$|E
40|$|This tracing {{was taken}} during {{percutaneous}} catheter cryoablation (Cryocath) {{of a right}} anteroseptal accessory pathway (AP) in a 22 -year-old man with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Preexcitation was abolished after approx-imately 18 seconds of cooling (down to 75 °C). The rst four beats in the gure are completely preexcited. The next four <b>beats</b> show lesser <b>degree</b> of preexcitation, and the preexcitation is completely lost by the ninth beat. Theoret-ically, the gradual loss of preexcitation {{could be due to}} either gradual slowing anterogradely over the AP prior to block or enhanced conduction via the AV node. Because the AV nodal conduction time does not change (constant AH interval), the former is the likely mechanism. The cryoablation catheter channel in the gure shows the classic artifact seen during cryoablation. The electrogram gradually is overlapped and then replaced by a larger and thicker artifact as the “iceball ” is formed (the thick artifact {{on the right side of}} the screen). This usually occurs at 20 ° to 30 °C, and at this moment the catheter adheres to the endocardial surface to produce the lesion. 1 Clearly, the gradual buildup of the “iceball ” coincides with the gradual loss of preexcitation. This observation is consistent with previously published data showing that cooling causes slowing of ventricular tachycardia by slowing conduction prior to termination during cryoablation in humans as well as in canine models. 2, 3 In contrast to the usual sudden loss of preexcitation seen during radiofrequency ablation, this nding suggests that percutaneous cryoablation may be associated with gradual loss of preexcitation during buildup of the “iceball ” that leads to lesion formation...|$|R
40|$|These {{experiments}} show, then, {{that there}} are changes in rate which take place during the incubation period and that {{the direction of the}} curve expressing them changes in an orderly fashion. No attempt has yet been made to ascertain the influences operative in bringing about these alterations. It is our intention, however, to attempt to correlate them with such processes as changes in the rate of the general metabolism of the body, changes in structure of the heart muscle, and if possible with changes in the inherent dynamics of the muscle. It will be seen that the number of experiments at a given age is relatively speaking small. The temperature in spite of the precaution mentioned has likewise not been uniform, the range in the greatest number (38) of experiments having been 38 °C. ± 1 °. A few (four) counts have been made when the temperature was as low as 33. 6 °C. and a few (two) also at a temperature as high as 40 °C. Although a curve as smooth as the one which has been drawn in all probability represents the general course of heart rate change, an explanation of the deviations which have been found is desirable. At least two influences which may be operative suggest themselves. First may be considered the effect of the unavoidable injury incident to cutting a window in the shell and removing so much of the shell membrane as to make the object visible. It has been a uniform practise to discard those eggs in which hemorrhage took place, so that if opening the egg has a share in the difficulty, this operation may be thought of as exerting a mechanical stimulus on a nervous or other controlling mechanism. But whether, especially at the early ages, a mechanism of such a nature exists within the embryo, we do not know. The search for one lies for the present beyond the range of our interest. A second influence responsible for the relatively large deviation in rate from the average may be that of fluctuations in temperature. The air of the room in which the observations were made was, in a given situation, fairly uniform at 38 °C. ± 1. 0 °. as the temperature records show. In the earlier experiments the temperature was read at a distance about 1 foot away from the egg. Between this point and the egg a difference unknown to us may well have existed. It is improbable, however, that it can have been more than 2 °C., that is to say, 38 ° ± 2 °. Roughly if the change in rate is approximately 15 <b>beats</b> per <b>degree</b> a maximum deviation of 30 beats may be expected. In point of fact a deviation as great as this did not take place. In later experiments the temperature was read in the immediate vicinity of the eggs, so that a correction can be made more accurately. There is in all probability a high degree of uniformity in the rate of the heart of the chicken embryo at each stage of development, although variation is also found. What the extent of the deviation is that may properly be encountered we do not yet know. It is desirable to pursue this subject further. Observations will accordingly be made and will be reported later...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn Earth, eye {{velocity}} of horizontal optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) orients to gravito-inertial acceleration (GIA), {{the sum of}} linear accelerations acting {{on the head and}} body. We determined whether adaptation to micro-gravity altered this orientation and whether ocular pursuit exhibited similar properties. Eye movements of four astronauts were recorded with three-dimensional video-oculography. Optokinetic stimuli were stripes moving horizontally, vertically, and obliquely at 30 degrees/s. Ocular pursuit was produced by a spot moving horizontally or vertically at 20 degrees/s. Subjects were either stationary or were centrifuged during OKN with 1 or 0. 5 g of interaural or dorsoventral centripetal linear acceleration. Average eye position during OKN (the beating field) moved into the quick-phase direction by 10 degrees during lateral and upward field movement in all conditions. The beating field did not shift up during downward OKN on Earth, but there was a strong upward movement of the <b>beating</b> field (9 <b>degrees)</b> during downward OKN in the absence of gravity; this likely represents an adaptation to the lack of a vertical 1 -g bias in-flight. The horizontal OKN velocity axis tilted 9 degrees in the roll plane toward the GIA during interaural centrifugation, both on Earth and in space. During oblique OKN, the velocity vector tilted towards the GIA in the roll plane when there was a disparity between the direction of stripe motion and the GIA, but not when the two were aligned. In contrast, dorsoventral acceleration tilted the horizontal OKN velocity vector 6 degrees in pitch away from the GIA. Roll tilts of the horizontal OKN velocity vector toward the GIA during interaural centrifugation are consistent with the orientation properties of velocity storage, but pitch tilts away from the GIA when centrifuged while supine are not. We speculate that visual suppression during OKN may have caused the velocity vector to tilt away from the GIA during dorsoventral centrifugation. Vertical OKN and ocular pursuit did not exhibit orientation toward the GIA in any condition. Static full-body roll tilts and centrifugation generating an equivalent interaural acceleration produced the same tilts in the horizontal OKN velocity before and after flight. Thus, the magnitude of tilt in OKN velocity was dependent on the magnitude of interaural linear acceleration, rather than the tilt of the GIA with regard to the head. These results favor a 'filter' model of spatial orientation in which orienting eye movements are proportional to the magnitude of low frequency interaural linear acceleration, rather than models that postulate an internal representation of gravity as the basis for spatial orientation...|$|R
