25|$|One {{physiological}} {{stimulus to}} epinephrine secretion is exercise. This was first demonstrated using the denervated pupil {{of a cat}} as an assay, later confirmed using a <b>biological</b> <b>assay</b> on urine samples. Biochemical methods for measuring catecholamines in plasma were published from 1950 onwards. Although much valuable work has been published using fluorimetric assays to measure total catecholamine concentrations, the method is too non-specific and insensitive to accurately determine the very small quantities of epinephrine in plasma. The development of extraction methods and enzyme-isotope derivate radio-enzymatic assays (REA) transformed the analysis down to a sensitivity of 1 pg for epinephrine. Early REA plasma assays indicated that epinephrine and total catecholamines rise late in exercise, mostly when anaerobic metabolism commences.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has empanelled {{biological}} and statistical experts to develop chapters {{pertaining to the}} practice of <b>biological</b> <b>assays.</b> These include a rewrite of General Chapter Design and Analysis of <b>Biological</b> <b>Assays</b> h 111 i and the development of two new General Chapters, Design of <b>Biological</b> <b>Assays</b> h 1032 i and Validation of <b>Biological</b> <b>Assays</b> h 1033 i. These experts have come to realize a need for clear and uniform terminology in their discussions, throughout the three chapters, and, indeed, throughout all portions of USP–NF that relate to <b>biological</b> <b>assays.</b> Accordingly, they have developed a glossary pertinent to <b>biological</b> <b>assays.</b> The purpose of this Stimuli article is to share this nascent glossary with the USP audience and to resolve and/or clarify differences in measurement terminology for well- (small molecules) and poorly characterized (biologicals and biotechnological moieties), hereafter referred to collectively as drug substances. In many cases the terms developed herein have common usages or appear elsewhere, for example in contemporary references by the International Conferences on Harmonization [ICH, for example Guideline Q 2 A, Text on Validation of Analytical Procedures (1) ], Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and USP. For some of the terms in this document, the derivation may be clear. Rather than claim originality, the authors seek to associate with this work a compendial perspective that will provide clarity going forward, consistency with previous authoritative usage, and a useful focus on the bioassay context.

25|$|Chromatophores {{are also}} used as a {{biomarker}} of blindness in cold-blooded species, as animals with certain visual defects fail to background adapt to light environments. Human homologues of receptors that mediate pigment translocation in melanophores {{are thought to be}} involved in processes such as appetite suppression and tanning, making them attractive targets for drugs. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies have developed a <b>biological</b> <b>assay</b> for rapidly identifying potential bioactive compounds using melanophores from the African clawed frog. Other scientists have developed techniques for using melanophores as biosensors, and for rapid disease detection (based on the discovery that pertussis toxin blocks pigment aggregation in fish melanophores). Potential military applications of chromatophore-mediated colour changes have been proposed, mainly as a type of active camouflage, which could as in cuttlefish make objects nearly invisible.|$|E
25|$|From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian {{research}} team of Albert Szent-Györgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely, {{as well as}} the American team led by Charles Glen King in Pittsburgh, first identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Györgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid (actually, L-hexuronic acid, although he did not know the stereochemistry at that time) from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor, but could not prove this without a <b>biological</b> <b>assay.</b> At the same time, for five years King's laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh had been trying to isolate the antiscorbutic factor in lemon juice using the original 1907 model of scorbutic guinea pigs which developed scurvy when not fed fresh foods, but were cured by lemon juice. They had also considered hexuronic acid as being the vitamin, but had been put off the trail when a coworker made the explicit (and mistaken) experimental claim that this substance was not the antiscorbutic substance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNew {{insight into}} the {{importance}} of carbohydrates in biological systems underscores the need for rapid synthetic and screening procedures for them. Development of an organic synthesis-compatible linker that would attach saccharides to microtiter plates was therefore undertaken to facilitate research in glycobiology. Galactosyllipids containing small, hydrophobic groups at the anomeric position were screened for noncovalent binding to microtiter plates. When the lipid component was a saturated hydrocarbon between 13 and 15 carbons in length, the monosaccharide showed complete retention after aqueous washing and could be utilized in <b>biological</b> <b>assays.</b> This alkyl chain was also successfully employed with more complex oligosaccharides in <b>biological</b> <b>assays.</b> In light of these findings, this method of attachment of oligosaccharides to microtiter plates should be highly efficacious to high-throughput synthesis and analyses of carbohydrates in <b>biological</b> <b>assays...</b>|$|R

40|$|All-trans {{retinoic acid}} (ATRA) plays key roles in {{neurogenesis}} mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RARs). RARs are important {{targets for the}} therapeutic regulation of neurogenesis but effective drug development depends on modelling-based strategies to design high-specificity ligands in combination with good <b>biological</b> <b>assays</b> to discriminate between target-specificity and off-target effects. Using neuronal differentiation as a model, {{the aim of this}} study was to test the hypothesis that responses across different temporal scales and assay platforms can be used as comparable measures of retinoid activity. In <b>biological</b> <b>assays</b> based on cell phenotype or behaviour, two structurally similar synthetic retinoids, differing in RAR affinity and specificity, retained their relative activities across different temporal scales. In contrast, assays based on the transcriptional activation of specific genes in their normal genomic context were less concordant with <b>biological</b> <b>assays.</b> Gene-induction assays for retinoid activity as modulators of neurogenesis require careful interpretation in the light of variation in ligand-receptor affinity, receptor expression and gene function.
