40|$|There {{are various}} {{projections}} concerning the emigration {{pressure from the}} accessing countries into the member states of the European Union. The arguments are based mostly on economic considerations supposing that sufficient difference between the economic strength (GDP, wages etc.) of the possible sending and receiving countries would induce considerable migration. Others argue that lessons on previous enlargement experiences of the EU can be of much relevance: the new candidate countries emigration patterns {{are expected to be}} similar - or just different - than the previous ones have been. There is not much empirical evidence on East-West labour migration. Mobility under bilateral agreements is a special frame to stimulate the desired labour migration that has gained special importance in the enlargement process of the European Union. The paper is based on empirical research of <b>bilateral</b> labour <b>programmes</b> between Hungary and the countries of the European Union. The present work has been a first attempt to set up and use empirical data to analyse Hungarian labour emigration. We confronted some theoretical considerations concerning <b>bilateral</b> <b>programmes</b> that should influence labour migration into the desired way to the receiving countries with the Hungarian experience of labour migration under the <b>bilateral</b> <b>programmes.</b> We found that programmes were effective to channel labour migration in the desired way. The structure of the labour migration under these programmes coincides, however, the general migration tendencies. Unregulated migration would, presumably, not give a considerable different character to Hungarian labour emigration. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I ask the question: what has {{literature}} to offer computer science? Can a <b>bilateral</b> <b>programme</b> of research be {{started with the}} aim of discovering the same kind of deep intertwining of ideas between computer science and literature, as already exists between computer science and linguistics? What practical use could such results yield? I begin by studying a classic forum for some of the most unintelligible pieces of prose ever written, the computer manual. Why are these books so hard to understand? Could a richer diet of metaphor and onomatopoeia help me get my laser printer working? I then dig down a little deeper and explore computer programs themselves as literature. Do they exhibit aesthetics, emotion and all the other multifarious aspects of true literature? If so, does this support their purpose and understandability? Finally I explore the link between computer code and the human writer. Rather than write large amounts of code directly, we encourage students to write algorithms as pseudo-code as a first step. Pseudo-code tells a story within a semi-formalised framework of conventions. Is this the intertwining we should be looking for...|$|E
40|$|Inorganic {{carbon removal}} through {{acidification}} {{is a common}} practice prior to isotopic analysis of macroinvertebrate samples. We have experimentally tested the effect of acidification on the elemental and isotopic composition {{of a range of}} beach arthropod species. Acidification resulted in a significant depletion of 7. 7 % and 1. 2 % in average for carbon and nitrogen, respectively. This highlights that acid washing affects other body compounds apart from carbonates. With a few exceptions,  13 C and  15 N showed no changes following the 1 N HCl attack. Our results strongly suggest that samples with a presumable high CaCO 3 content, result impoverished in 13 C as a consequence of acidification, while those suspected to be carbonate-free are not significantly affected. Regarding  15 N values, it seemed that only high carbonate species may be 15 N impoverished when treated with HCl. It is recommended to acidify only carbonate-rich samples prior  13 C analyses as a standard protocol.

40|$|Abstract. We {{define a}} Fourier-Mukai {{transform}} for a triple {{consisting of two}} holomorphic vector bundles over an elliptic curve and a homomorphism between them. We prove {{that in some cases}} the transform preserves the natural stability condition for a triple. We also define a Nahm transform for solutions to natural gauge-theoretic equations on a triple — vortices — and explore some of its basic properties. Our approach combines direct methods with dimensional reduction techniques, relating triples over a curve with vector bundles over the product of the curve with the complex projective line.

40|$|Timor-Leste is in {{the process}} of {{addressing}} a key issue for the country’s health sector: a medical workforce that is too small to provide adequate care. In theory, a <b>bilateral</b> <b>programme</b> of medical cooperation with Cuba created in 2003 could solve this problem. By the end of 2013, nearly 700 new doctors trained in Cuba had been added to Timor-Leste’s medical workforce and by 2017 a further 328 doctors should have been trained in the country by Cuban and local health professionals. A few more doctors who have been trained in Indonesia and elsewhere will also soon enter the workforce. It is expected that the number of physicians in Timor-Leste in 2017 will be more than three times the number present in the country in 2003. Most of the new physicians are expected to work in rural communities and support the national government’s goal of improving health outcomes for the rural majority. Although the massive growth in the medical workforce could change the way health care is delivered and substantially improve health outcomes throughout the country, there are challenges that must be overcome if Timor-Leste is to derive the maximum benefit from such growth. It appears crucial that most of the new doctors be deployed in rural communities and managed carefully to optimize their rural retention...|$|E
40|$|The pyrimidinones mhcpe, 2 -methyl- 3 H- 5 -hydroxy- 6 -carboxy- 4 -pyrimidinone {{ethyl ester}} (mhcpe, 1), 2, 3 - dimethyl- 5 -benzyloxy- 6 -carboxy- 4 -pyrimidinone ethyl ester (dbcpe, 2) and N-methyl- 2, 3 -dimethyl- 5 - hydroxy- 6 -carboxyamido- 4 -pyrimidinone (N-MeHOPY, 3), are {{synthesized}} and their structures determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The acid–base properties of 1 are studied by potentiometric and spectrophotometric methods, the pKa values being 1. 14 and 6. 35. DFT calculations {{were carried out}} to determine the most stable structure {{for each of the}} H 2 L+, HL and L− forms (HL = mhcpe) and assign the groups involved in the protonation–deprotonation processes. The mhcpe− ligand forms stable complexes with VIVO 2 + in the pH range 2 to 10, and potentiometry, EPR and UV-Vis techniques are used to identify and characterize the VIVO–mhcpe species formed. The results are consistent with the formation of VIVO, (VIVO) L, (VIVO) L 2, (VIVO) 2 L 2 H− 2, (VIVO) L 2 H− 1, (VIVO) 2 L 2 H− 3, (VIVO) LH− 2 species and VIVO-hydrolysis products. Calculations indicate that the global binding ability of mhcpe towards VIVO 2 + {{is similar to that of}} maltol (Hmaltol = 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 H-pyran- 4 -one) and lower than that of 1, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 - pyridinone (Hdhp). The interaction of VIVO-complexes with human plasma proteins (transferrin and albumin) is studied by circular dichroism (CD), EPR and 51 V NMR spectroscopy. VIVO–mhcpe–protein ternary complexes are formed in both cases. The binding of VIVO 2 + to transferrin (hTF) in the presence of mhcpe involves mainly (VIVO) 1 (hTF) (mhcpe) 1, (VIVO) 2 (hTF) (mhcpe) 1 and (VIVO) 2 (hTF) (mhcpe) 2 species, bound at the FeIII binding sites, and the corresponding conditional formation constants are determined. Under the conditions expected to prevail in human blood serum, CD data indicate that the VIVO–mhcpe complexes mainly bind to hTF; the formation of VIVO–hTF–mhcpe complexes occurs in the presence of FeIII as well, distinct EPR signals being clearly obtained for FeIII–hTF and to VIVO–hTF–mhcpe species. Thus this study indicates that transferrin plays the major role in the transport of VIVO–mhcpe complexes under blood plasma conditions in the form of ternary VIV–ligand–protein complexes.
