5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the vapor cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E

25|$|The {{conductivity}} {{of intrinsic}} semiconductors is strongly {{dependent on the}} band gap. The only available charge carriers for conduction are the electrons that have enough thermal energy to <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> across the band gap and the electron holes that are left off when such an excitation occurs.|$|E
25|$|Stimulated {{emission}} {{from the}} N-V− center has been demonstrated, {{though it could}} be achieved only from the phonon side-band (i.e. broadband light) and not from the ZPL. For this purpose the center has to <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> at wavelength longer than ~650nm, as higher-energy excitation ionizes the center.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{substances}} produce {{light when}} they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, {{a process known as}} fluorescence. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials can also <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> by bombarding them with subatomic particles. Cathodoluminescence is one example. This mechanism is used in cathode ray tube television sets and computer monitors.|$|E

25|$|There {{exist only}} limited {{possible}} states {{of energy for}} electrons, atoms and molecules. These {{are determined by the}} rules of quantum mechanics, which require quantization of energy of a bound system. The atoms/molecules in a higher energy state are said to <b>be</b> <b>excited.</b> The molecules/atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive; that is, more amenable to chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|If light (photons) of {{frequency}} ν12 {{passes through the}} group of atoms, {{there is a possibility}} of the light being absorbed by atoms which are in the ground state, which will cause them to <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> to the higher energy state. The rate of absorption is proportional to the radiation intensity of the light, and also to the number of atoms currently in the ground state, N1.|$|E

Nanoparticles along with multi-modal imaging techniques {{have been used}} as a way to diagnose cancer non-invasively. Skin with high permeability allowed quantum dots with an antibody attached to the surface for active targeting to successfully penetrate and identify cancerous tumors in mice. Tumor targeting is beneficial because the particles can <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> using fluorescence microscopy and emit light energy and heat that will destroy cancer cells.|$|E

25|$|Illumination of the {{phosphor}} {{is achieved}} using UV light. Most thermographic phosphors absorb {{light in a}} broad band in the UV and therefore can <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> using a YAG:Nd laser. Theoretically, the same light can be used both for PIV and temperature measurements, but this would mean that UV-sensitive cameras are needed. In practice, two different beams originated in separate lasers are overlapped. While one of the beams is used for velocity measurements, the other is {{used to measure the}} temperature.|$|E
25|$|Because {{at least}} half the {{population}} of atoms must <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> from the ground state to obtain a population inversion, the laser medium must be very strongly pumped. This makes three-level lasers rather inefficient, despite being the first type of laser to be discovered (based on a ruby laser medium, by Theodore Maiman in 1960). A three-level system could also have a radiative transition between level 3 and 2, and a non-radiative transition between 2 and 1. In this case, the pumping requirements are weaker. In practice, most lasers are four-level lasers, described below.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only a few}} atoms must <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> {{into the}} upper laser level to form a {{population}} inversion, a four-level laser is much more efficient than a three-level one, and most practical lasers are of this type. In reality, many more than four energy levels {{may be involved in}} the laser process, with complex excitation and relaxation processes involved between these levels. In particular, the pump band may consist of several distinct energy levels, or a continuum of levels, which allow optical pumping of the medium over a wide range of wavelengths.|$|E

25|$|Fluorophores {{are more}} likely to <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> by photons if the {{transition}} moment of the fluorophore is parallel to the electric vector of the photon. The polarization of the emitted light will also depend on the transition moment. The transition moment is dependent on the physical orientation of the fluorophore molecule. For fluorophores in solution this means that the intensity and polarization of the emitted light is dependent on rotational diffusion. Therefore, anisotropy measurements can be used to investigate how freely a fluorescent molecule moves in a particular environment.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{molecular}} orbital formalism, a typical ground-state molecule has electrons {{in the lowest}} possible energy levels. According to the Pauli principle, at most two electrons can occupy a given orbital, and if an orbital contains two electrons they must be in opposite spin states. The highest occupied molecular orbital is called the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is called the LUMO; the energy gap between these two states {{is known as the}} HOMO-LUMO gap. If the molecule absorbs light whose energy is equal to this gap, an electron in the HOMO may <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> to the LUMO. This is called the molecule's excited state.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron to <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an intersystem crossing from the singlet state to a triplet state {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.|$|E

25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Radio galaxies. These objects show {{nuclear and}} {{extended}} radio emission. Their other AGN properties are heterogeneous. They can broadly {{be divided into}} low-excitation and high-excitation classes. Low-excitation objects show no strong narrow or broad emission lines, and the emission lines they do have may <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> by a different mechanism. Their optical and X-ray nuclear emission is consistent with originating purely in a jet. They {{may be the best}} current candidates for AGN with radiatively inefficient accretion. By contrast, high-excitation objects (narrow-line radio galaxies) have emission-line spectra similar to those of Seyfert 2s. The small class of broad-line radio galaxies, which show relatively strong nuclear optical continuum emission probably includes some objects that are simply low-luminosity radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of radio galaxies, whatever their emission-line type, are essentially always ellipticals.|$|E
