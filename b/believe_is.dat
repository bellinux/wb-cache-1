5|$|Bombard weaponry: The oldest {{representation}} of a bombard {{can be found in}} the Chinese town of Ta-tsu. In 1985, the Canadian historian Robin Yates visited the Buddhist cave temples when he saw a sculpture on the wall depicting a demon holding a hand-held bombard. The muzzle seems to have a blast and flames coming from it which some <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> proof of some type of super gun. Yates examined the cave and believed the drawings dated back to the late 12th century.|$|E

Brennan brings in his sketch, which Cooper identifies {{as the man}} from his dream. He also receives a call from Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse), who has located the one-armed man they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> somehow involved; the group find him at a motel. The man, Philip Michael Gerard (Al Strobel) is a traveling salesman, who denies any involvement or that he knows BOB.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is {{a fantasy}} novel written by British author J. K. Rowling {{and the third}} novel in the Harry Potter series. The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped {{prisoner}} from Azkaban who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> one of Lord Voldemort's old allies.|$|E
5|$|Season three {{continues}} the story 67 {{days after the}} crash. The season begins where the second season left off: three of the crash survivors are held in captivity by the mysterious Others. More backstory on the Others, {{as well as the}} Dharma Initiative, is revealed. The survivors face continuous threats from their enemies, and also from their friends. The survivors attempt to make contact with a freighter which they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> there to rescue them. Season three takes place over 24 days.|$|E

5|$|With unity as an {{essential}} teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an administration they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any Bahá'í divisions have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following. The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining the classification.|$|E
5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E

5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and {{his friend}} Captain Haddock plan an {{expedition}} to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler, the Sirius, {{to search for the}} treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. Having previously read three parchments authored by Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, the duo had discovered the coordinates to what they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> the treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel, the Unicorn, near an unknown island. An eccentric, hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers to aid them with the use of his shark-shaped one-man submarine, but they decline his assistance. Setting sail, they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that Calculus has stowed away on board, bringing his submarine with him.|$|E

5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. They hope to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
