25|$|Ingo Haar who is {{currently}} {{on the faculty of}} the University of Vienna said on 14 November 2006 in Deutschlandfunk that about 500,000 to 600,000 victims are realistic, based on a German governmental studies initiated in the 1960s. Haar said these numbers were compiled from actually reported deaths, while higher figures of about two million deaths were estimated with the population <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> in a German governmental study of 1958. Haar said the higher estimates must be seen in the historical context of the 1950s, when the government of West Germany needed high numbers for political reasons. During the Cold War West Germany wanted to revert to prewar borders in Central Europe. Military historian Rüdiger Overmans said on 6 December 2006 in Deutschlandfunk that only the about 500,000 registered deaths could be counted, and that the unaccounted cases calculated with the population <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> need be confirmed by further research. However, on 29 November 2006 State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Christoph Bergner, reaffirmed the position of the German government that 2 million civilians perished in the flight and expulsion from Central and Eastern Europe. The German Red Cross in 2005 maintained that death toll in the expulsions is 2,251,500 persons.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> for an {{oil field}} uses an equation that relates {{the volume of}} oil, water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in reservoir pressure to calculate the remaining oil. It assumes that, as fluids from the reservoir are produced, {{there will be a}} change in the reservoir pressure that depends on the remaining volume of oil and gas. The method requires extensive pressure-volume-temperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field. It requires some production to occur (typically 5% to 10% of ultimate recovery), unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and fluid characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{accurate}} records listing confirmed deaths, {{estimates of}} German population transfers from 1945–1950 and associated deaths depended upon a population balance methodology. West German government official figures derived during the 1950s using the population <b>balance</b> <b>method</b> put the death toll at about 2 million. Recently some German historians believe the death toll is closer to 500,000 based on recently disclosed documentation that listed only confirmed deaths. The wide range of estimates stems from a number of factors. First, the ethnic German population in 1939 was by no means certain because bilingual persons were of dubious German ethnic identity. Second, Civilian losses were overstated because German military casualties in 1945 were poorly documented. Third, After the war it was difficult to gather reliable population data; post war census data in Central and Eastern Europe did not breakout the ethnic German population and during the Cold War {{there was a lack of}} cooperation between West Germany and communist bloc countries in the effort to locate persons reported missing. Persons reported missing may have been living in Eastern Europe after having been assimilated into the local population. Estimates of total populations expelled and deaths often include figures from the evacuation, because these people were not allowed to return, thus making it difficult to arrive at an accurate and undisputed estimate of population movements and deaths due solely to the expulsions. Some of the differences may arise from political bias, as the expulsion of Germans was widely utilized as political weapon during the Cold War.|$|E
2500|$|Demographic {{estimates}} of the flight and expulsion of Germans have been derived by either the compilation of registered dead and missing persons or by a comparison of pre-war and post-war population data. Estimates {{of the number of}} displaced Germans vary in the range of 12.0–16.5 million. [...] The death toll attributable to the flight and expulsions was estimated at 2.2 million by the West German government in 1958 using the population <b>balance</b> <b>method.</b> German records which became public in 1987 have caused some historians in Germany to put the actual total at about 500,000 based on the listing of confirmed deaths. The [...] puts the figure at 600,000 victims, they maintain the official figure of 2 million cannot be supported. However the German Red Cross still maintains that death toll in the expulsions is 2,251,500 persons.|$|E

Testing results reveal the battery pack efficiency with balancing as the difference between the energy that is required to charge the pack and the energy that can be obtained when the battery the battery is discharged. While the first efficiency test uses a laboratory power supply to charge the battery pack, the second efficiency test uses a prototype charger circuit.
