This led to complaints that [...] "slope" [...] is a derogatory term for an Asian person. In April, Top Gear’s executive producer Andy Wilman apologised for the racist remark. In July 2014 Ofcom ruled that the BBC had breached broadcasting rules <b>by</b> <b>including</b> <b>this</b> offensive racial term. In May 2014, there were complaints and calls for Clarkson to be sacked after {{it was revealed that}} he recited [...] "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe; catch a nigger by his toe" [...] as a children's rhyme on an unaired take from the show. Clarkson denied having used the word, then apologised when a previously unbroadcast clip revealed him doing so.|$|E

The two stated aims of the Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize are to encourage creative representational painting and promote the skill of draughtsmanship, so I often asked myself: would we be fulfilling that promise <b>by</b> <b>including</b> <b>this</b> work? Would a visitor expecting these qualities be truly satisfied by every painting we chose? I hope you’ll agree that we have stayed true to those principles and selected a collection of work that really celebrates the vitality, diversity and skill of contemporary representational painting in the UK today." ...|$|E

5000|$|The piece {{begins with}} a Russian liturgical hymn, O Lord, Save thy People. This hymn {{represents}} the praying for deliverance from the invading army. A part of this hymn translates to [...] "Grant victory to all Orthodox Christians over their enemies." [...] <b>By</b> <b>including</b> <b>this</b> hymn in the piece, Tchaikovsky is suggesting that God granted the Orthodox Russians victory over the French imperial troops. Later in the piece when La Marseillaise is played, {{it seems as though}} the Russians will lose the battle. Then O Lord, Save thy People, along with God Save the Tsar!, is played powerfully in the brass section with a strong display of chimes in the background. The ringing chimes are written to represent the bells of Moscow. The bells of Moscow have such a huge influence on Russia because, in the Orthodox religion, the bells represent an icon of the voice of God. At this moment in the piece, the Russian should feel great pride for their country. In the years following the premiere of the 1812 Overture, national pride in Russia was higher {{than it had been in}} decades.|$|E
