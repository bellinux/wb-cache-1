5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a gargoyle spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
500|$|While the {{operation}} {{itself was a}} success, {{the images of the}} evacuation symbolized the wastefulness and ultimate futility of American involvement in Vietnam. President Ford later called it [...] "a sad and tragic period in America's history" [...] but argued that [...] "you couldn't help but <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> those pilots and others who were conducting the evacuation". Nixon's pledge of Peace with Honor in Vietnam had become a humiliating defeat, which together with Watergate contributed to the crisis of confidence that affected America throughout the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Brad Wete {{wrote that}} the concerts proved that [...] "Beyoncé's bigger than any ballroom." [...] He continued, [...] " [...] {{excellence}} is undeniable. Her quaking vocals beat her contemporaries and competes with legends', as does her dancing", and concluded, [...] "I'm {{looking forward to seeing}} her in a bigger venue, where there's more space for her voice to soar, elbow room for her band to play, and room for her wild-child fans to dance." [...] Dan Aquilante of the New York Post stated that after the Beyoncé's performances of the songs on 4 at the concerts, the album was to be rated a 10 out of 10. He further wrote, [...] "Where tunes felt lackluster and flabby on the recording, Beyoncé injected a vibrancy in the new songs that boosted the material to be almost the equal to some of her best and biggest radio hits." [...] Yolanda Sangweni of Essence magazine viewed the concert as a chance for Beyoncé to remind people that her [...] "vocal chops" [...] are what got her where she stands today as an artist, and concluded that Michael Jackson and Diana Ross would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> Beyoncé's accomplishments and performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé.|$|E

Usher spoke to students at the Center for the Creative arts explaining the importance of education. His effort of giving back was to honor the legacy of his grandmother who passed early in the year. Who he called Nanny expressed to singer at a young age [...] "whatever you want to do, I promise you can do it. We're going to look back one day, your teachers and I, and <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> you". At CCC, a donation of an undisclosed amount was made by the singer that would pay for new surfaces for the floors of two dance studios, a new digital lighting board and LED lights for the performing arts school's auditorium. Usher's second stop was Orange Grove Center, a nonprofit that serves adults and children with intellectual disabilities. There, he took part in a groundbreaking for planned improvements to the facility's track, said development director Heidi Hoffecker.
