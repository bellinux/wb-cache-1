In several scenes of the film, Hal is trying to ask for a slice of pizza but cannot say the word [...] "pizza"; this is drawn from Blitz's experience of trying to order a hamburger from hotel room service without <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the word [...] "hamburger". Hal's first debate scene is based on Blitz's first debate, where, for a full eight minutes, he could only make the sound [...] "agh", and the scene in which Hal throws a cello through a window was inspired by Blitz's own destruction of a flute. While Blitz grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey, he chose to set the narrative in Plainsboro, New Jersey—a place he has never visited—because it was closer to Trenton, rather than New York City. He found it humorous that the characters referred to Trenton as the [...] "Big City" [...] and that Plainsboro seemed to orbit around a dead city, Trenton, in comparison to New York.|$|E

Word soon spread and the demand for Love is... escalated. Roberto recognised their commercial potential and showed them to an American journalist." [...] Although other sources differ regarding whether it was Roberto or Casali herself who first showed the cartoons to an acquaintance working for the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper picked them up for publication and published the first of the series on 5 January 1970, under the pen name [...] "Kim". The cartoon's release coincided with the wave of success of the novel Love Story (1970) by Erich Segal, and the subsequent movie of the same name starring Ali MacGraw as a girl dying of an incurable disease and Ryan O'Neal as the student who worshiped her. The film's slogan was [...] "Love means never having to say you're sorry." [...] Casali altered it into one of her most famous cartoons: [...] "Love is... <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you're sorry." ...|$|E
