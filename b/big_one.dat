5|$|Ostapchuk {{vowed to}} return the Princess to the stature it held under Susan Morrow. To that end, he hired a new film programmer, Leonard Schein of Vancouver’s Fifth Avenue Cinemas. The first film {{exhibited}} under new management was Michael Moore’s The <b>Big</b> <b>One.</b> Ostapchuk began major renovations to the theatre, and in 1999 unveiled The Princess II in Chinook Theatre’s old space. The basement theatre featured 100 seats, its own concession and washrooms, and a new 35mm projector. The renovations cost $200,000.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered on October 23, 2010, as {{the start}} of the Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Halloween {{programming}} block. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.6 million viewers, which made it the second highest performing television movie on all ad-supported cable television networks for the night. Critical response to Growing the <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> was largely positive; some critics praised the story and Doherty's performance, while others were more critical of the chemistry between the two lead actors. It was released on DVD three days following the film's premiere.|$|E

25|$|TV Nation was {{formatted}} as a newsmagazine, {{with stories}} interspersed by short clips of the show's theme (for example, Moore spending {{a day with}} Dr. Jack Kevorkian) and factual polls surveying the American public. The show's investigative reports delved into various aspects of American life, and were filmed and presented in a style similar to Moore's feature-length documentaries such as The <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> (1996).|$|E
25|$|Considerable debate exists {{within the}} roller coaster enthusiast {{community}} whether the height record of Moonsault Scramble was, in fact, legitimate (and if it should, consequently, be given the hypercoaster designation). As shuttle roller coasters—by definition—do not make a complete circuit, the tallest points of these coasters typically have very few (if any) riders who experience these heights. For this reason, many roller coaster enthusiasts reserve height records for complete circuit roller coasters. If these definitions are taken, the world's tallest roller coasters from 1983 until 1996 were Dragon Mountain, Magnum XL-200, Desperado, Pepsi Max <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> and finally Fujiyama.|$|E
25|$|In 2014-15, Backlund faltered slightly, {{suffering}} through {{injuries and}} trade rumours; however, the Flames surprisingly skyrocketed up the standings {{en route to}} their first playoff berth in six years. Backlund's 10 goals and 27 points were just 11th and 12th on the Flames, but he only played 52 games in the regular season. He continued struggling into the playoffs, only posting one goal and one assist in eleven games played. The one goal that Backlund did score was a <b>big</b> <b>one,</b> though, as it came in overtime of Game 3 of the Flames' second-round series against the Anaheim Ducks to give Calgary their first win past the first round in thirteen years.|$|E

25|$|Many Dallas players {{described}} this game {{as the most}} devastating loss of the 1966–1970 period. Having lost this game and the 1966 title game in the waning seconds of each game, Landry was subject to criticism that {{he was unable to}} win the <b>Big</b> <b>One,</b> a stigma that persisted until Dallas won its first NFL title in the 1971 season. In the three seasons following 1967, the Cowboys suffered two upsets in the playoffs to the Cleveland Browns, then lost Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts 13–16 on a last-second field goal. Schramm considered this game to be turning point to Dallas becoming America's Team {{because of the way the}} Cowboys battled back in the game.|$|E
25|$|For his 2013 season, Vickers {{performed}} well at Bristol. His second {{ride in the}} No. 55 at Martinsville was unlucky. He had crashed in the early laps and after repairing his car, got back on the lead lap and then spun around. After again getting back on to the lead lap, on the final lap of the race he passed Danica Patrick for 11th place. Seconds later he was intentionally spun by Kevin Harvick who was angry with Vickers for prior contact. In reply Vickers bumped Harvick when entering pit road after the race was over; he climbed out and the two briefly argued. Vickers ran the No. 11 FedEx Toyota at Texas, Kansas and Richmond for an injured Denny Hamlin. Though Hamlin returned at Talladega for the Aaron's 499, Vickers substituted for him on lap 23, though he was eventually collected in The <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> less than 15 laps after the switch.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 2011, the World Series of Poker and Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté {{announced}} plans for an officially sanctioned special fundraising event, known as The <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> for One Drop, starting on July 1, 2012 with a record US$1 million entry fee. 11% of the money (more precisely, $111,111 from each buy-in) went to Laliberté's charity, the One Drop Foundation, and the WSOP waived its normal 10% rake of the entry fees. At {{the time of the}} original announcement, 15 of the maximum 48 seats had been taken. By early December 2011, the field size had increased to 22, the minimum required for an official bracelet tournament. Among those who committed early to the event were Johnny Chan, Daniel Negreanu, Jonathan Duhamel, Tom Dwan, Laliberté, billionaire businessman Phil Ruffin and Erik Seidel. On April 12, 2012, the WSOP announced that 30 players had committed to the tournament, which brought the first prize to $12.3 million, exceeding the record amount won by Jamie Gold. In the end, all 48 seats were filled, resulting in a first prize of $18.3 million. Poker professional Antonio Esfandiari won the event, also receiving a special platinum WSOP bracelet.|$|E
