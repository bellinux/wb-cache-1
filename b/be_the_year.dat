Marytown is located in Libertyville, Illinois, and also features the Kolbe Holocaust Exhibit. In 1991, Krzysztof Zanussi released a Polish film {{about the life of}} Kolbe.

5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.|$|E

25|$|Timaeus of Taormina, a {{third century}} B.C.

Timaeus in Sicily was proximous to Cathaginians and their version of the city's foundation; his date is generally accepted as approximate. Ancient authors, such as Sallust and Pliny the Elder, give founding dates several hundred years earlier for other Phoenician cities in the western Mediterranean, such as Utica and Gades, but recent archeology has been unable to verify these earlier dates.|$|E

25|$|By now, Dravid {{had been}} branded as a Test specialist. While he {{continued}} to score heavily in Test cricket, his poor strike rate in ODIs came under scanner. He drew criticism {{for not being able}} to adjust his style of play to the needs of ODI cricket, his lack of attacking capability and play big strokes. However, 1999 proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of renaissance for Dravid's ODI career. Dravid worked hard and re-tooled his game by increasing his range of strokes and adapting his batting style to suit the requirements of ODI cricket. He learned to pace his innings cleverly without going for the slogs.|$|E
25|$|Robert {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} clerics in the reign of King Alexander I of Scotland (Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim). He was appointed as the first Prior of Scone, the flagship Augustinian monastic establishment of Alexander's reign. This may have happened as early as 1114, and Walter Bower tells us that the new priory was dedicated by Thurgot, then bishop of Cell Rígmonaid. As Turgot left Scotland in 1115, no later date would be possible if Bower is to be believed. Many historians have rejected this date, because the Augustinian Rule was not instituted at Nostell until 1119, but as Kenneth Veitch points out, the date of the formal institution of the Rule is little guide to the actual activities of the monastic establishment. Moreover, the year 1114 just happened to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> in which Alexander was present in England in the service of his overlord, King Henry I of England.|$|E
25|$|Cixi's {{ascendancy}} {{came at a}} time {{of internal}} chaos and foreign challenges. The effects of the Second Opium War were still hovering over the country, and the Taiping Rebellion continued its seemingly unstoppable advance through China's south, eating up the Qing Empire bit by bit. Internally, both the national bureaucracy and regional authorities were infested with corruption. 1861 happened to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of official examinations, whereby officials of all levels presented their political reports from the previous three years. Cixi decided that the time was ripe for a bureaucratic overhaul, and she personally sought audience with all officials above the level of provincial governor, who had to report to her personally. Cixi thus took on part of the role usually given to the Bureaucratic Affairs Department (吏部). Cixi had two prominent officials executed to serve as examples for others: Qingying, a military shilang who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then Viceroy of Liangjiang, who fled Changzhou in the wake of an incoming Taiping army instead of trying to defend the city.|$|E

25|$|Seleucus {{was the son}} of Antiochus. Historian Junianus Justinus {{claims that}} Antiochus was one of Philip II of Macedon's generals, but no such general is {{mentioned}} in any other sources, and nothing is known of his supposed career under Philip. It is possible that Antiochus was a member of an upper Macedonian noble family. Seleucus' mother was supposedly called Laodice, but nothing else is known of her. Later, Seleucus named a number of cities after his parents. Seleucus was born in Europos, located {{in the northern part of}} Macedonia. Just a year before his birth (if the year 358 BC is accepted as the most likely date), the Paeonians invaded the region. Philip defeated the invaders and only a few years later utterly subdued them under Macedonian rule. Seleucus' year of birth is unclear. Justin claims he was 77 years old during the battle of Corupedium, which would place his year of birth at 358 BC. Appianus tells us Seleucus was 73 years old during the battle, which means 354 BC would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of birth. Eusebius of Caesarea, however, mentions the age of 75, and thus the year 356 BC, making Seleucus the same age as Alexander the Great. This is most likely propaganda on Seleucus' part to make him seem comparable to Alexander.|$|E

500|$|St Alban's Church, {{built in}} the Neogothic style and consecrated in 1908, is the Roman Catholic church of Odense. Its steeple is [...] high. St Mary's Church (Vor Frue Kirke or Our Lady's Church), {{built in the}} 13th century and {{restored}} in 1851–1852 and again in 1864, contains a carved 16th-century altarpiece by Claus Berg of Lübeck. St John's Church (Sankt Hans Kirke), first mentioned in 1295, was built by the Knights Hospitaller, {{also known as the}} Order of Saint John. Not much of the original building remains as it was rebuilt in 1636 and subsequently restored. Built of red brick with horizontal decorations on the chancel wall, it has large Gothic windows. The date of 1496 on one of the bells in the step-ribbed tower may well <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> the church was completed. The tower is adjacent to Odense Palace which was originally built as a monastery.|$|E
500|$|... "Why", asked Coward, [...] "am I always {{expected}} {{to wear a}} dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a long holder and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?" [...] The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been {{taken up by the}} upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: [...] "I am determined to travel through life first class." [...] He first wore a dressing gown onstage in The Vortex and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including Private Lives and Present Laughter. George Walden identifies him as a modern dandy. In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, The Independent commented, [...] "His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era.

500|$|On {{returning}} to Britain Thomas {{began work on}} two further poems, [...] "In the white giant's thigh", which he read on the Third Programme in September 1950, and the incomplete [...] "In country heaven". 1950 is also believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> that he began work on 'Under Milk Wood', under the working title 'The Town That Was Mad'. The task of seeing this work through to production {{was assigned to the}} BBC's Douglas Cleverdon, who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'. Despite Cleverdon's urges, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to Iran to work on a film for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The film was never made, with Thomas {{returning to}} Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary entitled 'Persian Oil'. Early that year Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris describes as [...] "unusually blunt"; the ribald [...] "Lament" [...] and an ode, {{in the form of a}} villanelle, to his dying father [...] "Do not go gentle into that good night".|$|E
