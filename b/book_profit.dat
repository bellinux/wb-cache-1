In the previous <b>book,</b> <b>Profit</b> from the Core, Zook explains how to grow profitably by concentrating on and harvesting the full potential in the core business. But if the core business fails to provide new growth, managers should stick to an expansion strategy based on various combinations of adjacency moves into areas away from, but related to, the core business, such as new product lines or new channels of distribution. This strategy is less risky than diversification; however, it can still create a substantial competitive advantage because the growth is based on or relates to the pack of skills that the business already does best. Zook bases his research on studying thousands of companies worldwide and interviewing CEOs of 25 top performers that have succeeded growing beyond theie core businesses.|$|E
