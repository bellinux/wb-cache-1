50|$|The masked <b>booby</b> (Sula dactylatra) {{is a large}} seabird of the <b>booby</b> family, Sulidae. This species breeds on {{islands in}} {{tropical}} oceans, except in the eastern Atlantic; in the eastern Pacific it is replaced by the Nazca <b>booby,</b> Sula granti, which was formerly regarded as a subspecies of masked <b>booby.</b> It is also called the masked gannet or the blue-faced <b>booby.</b>|$|R

5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as <b>boobies,</b> {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets {{after they have}} caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked <b>boobies</b> estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E
50|$|The brown <b>booby</b> (Sula leucogaster) {{is a large}} seabird of the <b>booby</b> family, Sulidae. They present sexual dimorphism. The female <b>booby</b> reaches about 80 cm in length, its {{wingspan}} measures up to 150 cm, {{and they}} can weigh up to 1300 g.

5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to <b>boobies</b> and gannets. The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did <b>boobies</b> analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|The Fregatidae are {{a sister}} group to Suloidea which {{consists}} of cormorants, darters, gannets, and <b>boobies.</b> Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread, (the magnificent, great and lesser frigatebirds) while two are endangered (the Christmas Island and Ascension Island frigatebirds) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus Limnofregata, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.|$|E
5000|$|First {{described}} by French naturalist René-Primevère Lesson in 1831, the masked <b>booby</b> {{is one of}} six species of <b>booby</b> in the genus Sula. The Nazca <b>booby</b> (S. granti) was formerly regarded as a subspecies. There are four subspecies, none of which is separable at sea: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{these three}} <b>booby</b> species, {{hatching}} order indicates chick hierarchy in the nest. The A-chick is dominant to the B-chick, {{which in turn}} is dominant to the C chick, etc. (when there are more than two chicks per brood) Masked <b>booby</b> and Nazca <b>booby</b> dominant A-chicks always begin pecking their younger sibling(s) as soon as they hatch; moreover, assuming it is healthy, the A-chick usually pecks its younger sibling to death or pushes it out of the nest scrape within the first two days that the junior chick is alive. Blue-footed <b>booby</b> A-chicks also express their dominance by pecking their younger sibling. However, unlike the obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca <b>booby</b> chicks, their behavior is not always lethal. A study by Lougheed and Anderson (1999) reveals that blue-footed <b>booby</b> senior chicks only kill their siblings in times of food shortage. Furthermore, even when junior chicks are killed, it does not happen immediately. According to Anderson, the average age of death of the junior chick in a masked <b>booby</b> brood is 1.8 days, while the average age of death of the junior chick in a blue-footed <b>booby</b> brood may be as high as 18 days. The difference in age of death in the junior chick in each <b>booby</b> species is indicative of the type of siblicide that the species practices. Facultatively siblicidal blue-footed <b>booby</b> A-chicks only kill their nest mate(s) when necessary. Obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca <b>booby</b> A-chicks kill their sibling no matter if resources are plentiful or not; in other words, siblicidal behavior occurs independently of environmental factors.|$|R
50|$|A <b>booby</b> {{prize is}} a joke prize usually given in {{recognition}} of a terrible performance or last-place finish. A person who finishes last, for example, may receive a <b>booby</b> prize such as a worthless coin. <b>Booby</b> prizes are sometimes jokingly coveted {{as an object of}} pride.|$|R
5|$|Frigatebirds {{were grouped}} with cormorants, and sulids (gannets and <b>boobies)</b> {{as well as}} {{pelicans}} in the genus Pelecanus by Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. The genus Fregata was defined by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the genus name Tachypetes in 1816 for the great frigatebird. The genus name Atagen had been coined by German naturalist Paul Möhring in 1752, though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of Linnaean taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and <b>boobies,</b> {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history. Tropicbirds, darters, cormorants, gannets, <b>boobies</b> and frigatebirds, all {{traditional}} members of the order, have since been reclassified: tropicbirds into their own order, Phaethontiformes, and the remainder into Suliformes. In their place, herons, ibises, spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill have now been transferred into Pelecaniformes. Molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} shoebill and the hamerkop form a sister group to the pelicans, though there is some doubt as to the exact relationships among the three lineages.|$|E

50|$|The {{island is}} frequented by sea turtles, which come to {{reproduce}} there, {{but it is}} the home of the seabirds: magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), brown <b>booby,</b> masked <b>booby,</b> terns, double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels nest on the cliff of the island. Red-footed <b>booby</b> (Sula sula) and blue-footed <b>booby</b> (Sula nebouxii) are only observable on Grand-Îlet, among the islands of Guadeloupe department. The waste of these birds results in a strong concentration of guano on the rocks and beaches.|$|R
5|$|Some species, {{including}} frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked <b>boobies</b> estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds' feeding {{habits are}} pelagic, {{and they may}} forage up to 500km (310mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, {{particularly}} the genera Exocoetus and Cypselurus, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus Brevoortia {{can be an important}} prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including <b>boobies,</b> petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|The flesh-footed shearwater, which breeds {{in large}} numbers on the main island in spring-autumn, used to have its chicks {{harvested}} for food by the islanders. The wedge-tailed and little shearwaters breed on the main island and surrounding islets; though {{only a small number}} of the latter species can be found on the main island. Breeding white-bellied storm petrels were another discovery by Roy Bell. Masked <b>boobies</b> are the largest seabirds breeding on Lord Howe and can be seen nesting and gliding along the sea cliffs at Mutton Bird Point all year round. Sooty terns can be seen on the main island at Ned's and Middle Beaches, North Bay, and Blinkey Beach; the most numerous of the island's breeding seabirds, their eggs were formerly harvested for food. Common and black noddies build nests in trees and bushes, while white terns lay their single eggs precariously in a slight depression on a tree branch, and grey ternlets lay their eggs in cliff hollows.|$|E

50|$|A <b>booby</b> trap {{may be of}} any size. However, as {{a general}} rule the size of most {{explosive}} <b>booby</b> traps use between 250 g and 1 kg of explosive. Since most <b>booby</b> traps are rigged to detonate within a metre of the victim's body, this is adequate to kill or severely wound.|$|R
5|$|The two holes—circular, oval or slit-like in shape—which lead to {{the nasal}} {{cavities}} within the bird's skull, and thus {{to the rest of}} the respiratory system. In most bird species, the nares are located in the basal third of the upper mandible. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their bills. A handful of species have no external nares. Cormorants and darters have primitive external nares as nestlings, but these close soon after the birds fledge; adults of these species (and gannets and <b>boobies</b> of all ages, which also lack external nostrils) breathe through their mouths. There is typically a septum made of bone or cartilage that separates the two nares, but in some families (including gulls, cranes and New World vultures), the septum is missing. While the nares are uncovered in most species, they are covered with feathers in a few groups of birds, including grouse and ptarmigans, crows and some woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Gannets, <b>boobies,</b> tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing <b>boobies</b> to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E
25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown <b>booby,</b> masked <b>booby,</b> terns, double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-Îlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of <b>booby</b> found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed <b>booby</b> (Sula sula) and blue-footed <b>booby</b> (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|Abbott's <b>booby</b> is {{the only}} <b>booby</b> {{restricted}} to a single location, although its former distribution covered much of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. There is fossil evidence of its former presence in the South Pacific, and eyewitness reports of it formerly breeding on the Mascarene Islands. In April 2007, an individual of this species was photographed at a <b>booby</b> colony on Rota in the Pacific Ocean, and the same individual has been seen off-and-on in the red-footed <b>booby</b> colony there through at least 2011 (Pratt in press).|$|R
50|$|What distinguishes a <b>booby</b> trap is {{that its}} {{activation}} {{is intended to be}} unexpected to its victim. Thus <b>booby</b> trap design is widely varied, with traps or their trigger mechanisms often hidden. Frequently {{at least part of the}} device is improvised from standard ordnance, such as an artillery shell, grenade, or high explosive. However, some mines have features specifically designed for incorporation into <b>booby</b> traps and armies have been equipped with a variety of mass-produced triggering mechanisms intended to be employed in <b>booby</b> traps deployment.|$|R
