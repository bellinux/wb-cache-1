5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E

25|$|I think {{global warming}} {{is an issue that}} is {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and a symptom of the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E
25|$|In First-class cricket (two innings match), {{the team}} that scores more runs, having {{dismissed}} its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because {{there was not much}} time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316–9, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.|$|E

500|$|The {{new century}} saw the Echo falling {{behind the times}} in its {{production}} methods. Established as a [...] "leading daily newspaper", {{it was one of}} the last to still <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> type by hand in 1900. This changed in 1902, when Linotype lead-setting machines were brought in to set type mechanically. A landslide victory for the Liberal Party followed at the 1906 General Election, which heralded a new era for the Echo. The paper's old rival, the Sunderland Daily Post, was discontinued six months later, and the Football Echo was launched on 7 September 1907.|$|E

Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why would I <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E

[...] Despite Captain Brown's warning that the Indians might <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> a trap, Patrick pressed forward as the natives withdrew, engaging them in a running battle. [...] After about one mile (1.6km) Brant sprung his trap, and Patrick's company was engulfed by Brant's larger force. [...] Both Patrick and his second in command were killed in the battle, as was about half of their force. [...] Brown organized the remaining forces into a fighting retreat back into the settlement. [...] Five men took refuge in the house of George Warner which the attackers set on fire, killing all five men.

IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us a whole lot to process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs {{to do a better job}} of biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> itself out to be a slow-burning character study in the context of a zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E
500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and doing {{something}} else, you should do something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; it just seems to <b>be</b> <b>setting</b> Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would <b>be</b> <b>setting.</b> So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
