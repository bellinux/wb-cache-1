25|$|Rex Goodwin is {{the leader}} of the Yliaster cell working in New Domino City and the Director of Sector Security. He, {{alongside}} his brother Roman, was an assistant to Professor Fudo during the Zero Reverse accident. With his elitism, he transformed the city into a hierarchical society. He shows interest in the Signers, and he explains their significance to Jack prior to holding the Fortune Cup to gather the remaining Signers and awaken their powers. Rex is shown to be aggressive if necessary, but he usually has a calm demeanor. A legendary Turbo Duelist, Goodwin lost his left arm around the time he didn't finish Daedalus Bridge (the only means for the Satellite to be connected with New Domino City) and had it replaced with a cybernetic one which doubles as his duel disk. He additionally possesses his brother's severed arm with the head part of the Mark of the Dragon. In the dub he claims to be the fifth signer, but it is not actually so. But after the deaths of the Dark Signers, Rex reveals himself to have <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> during a duel with Roman, having the condor birthmark on his back and control of the Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca. Furthermore, he integrates his brother's arm onto himself to gain the power of a Signer as part of his plan to use both the Earthbound Immortals and the Crimson Dragon to recreate the world in his image. He is defeated by the joint efforts of Yusei, Jack and Crow, and passes onto the afterlife with Roman. His ace is the Synchro Monster Sun Dragon Inti and the Dark Synchro Monster Moon Dragon Quilla.|$|E

In the series, set on 19th-century Earth, Walker is a {{teenager}} who joins the Black Order (a {{group of soldiers}} known as Exorcists). As an Exorcist, Allen uses a mysterious object (Innocence) to fight the demons known as Akuma. Allen's Innocence, which initially assumes {{the form of a}} giant left arm, evolves to give him new abilities. Allen uses these powers to fight the Millennium Earl (who created an army of Akuma to destroy the world) and his superhuman followers, the Noah Family. He learns that he is connected to the Noah, and might <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

The Son attacks Mulder but is subdued. Mulder and Kristen try to escape using a car parked in the garage, but the Unholy Spirit jumps onto the car hood and attacks them. Kristen drives into her, impaling her on a wooden peg on the wall. Kristen tricks Mulder into running outside of the house while she goes back inside and pours gasoline around herself and The Son. Kristen lights a match, blowing up the house and taking her own life in order to kill the other vampires. Firefighters and police find four bodies in the wreckage while Mulder stares at Scully's cross necklace.|$|E

50|$|Initially, many {{of these}} plays were {{organized}} by the church, but the people soon {{set up their own}} theaters, where the humor of the taverns survived. The rowdy, often illegal stagings were no place for sophisticated plot lines or character development, and the carpa ("tent") theater relied heavily on stock characters who could deliver the audience quick laughs.

2500|$|Frustrated by the {{futility}} of one-on-one conversions, and following the advice of an uncle in Chicago, Weber decided to take up acting about 1904, and moved to New York City, where she took some singing lessons. Weber later explained her motivation: [...] "As I was convinced the theatrical profession needed a missionary, he suggested {{that the best way}} to reach them was to <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> so I went on the stage filled with a great desire to convert my fellowman".|$|E

He was once a diligent, mature student at Harvard University, with an {{extremely}} wealthy father (Victor Buono), but one bite of a drug-laden brownie was enough to get him hooked and send him into a downward spiral. (His last name had been Caldwell; he changed it to Ignatowski, thinking that the backward pronunciation of that name was [...] "Star Child".) In a particularly memorable episode, the cabbies help him pass a written exam to <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He occasionally exhibits unexpected talents, such as the ability to play the piano masterfully, much to his own surprise. TV Guide placed Ignatowski 32nd on its list of the 50 greatest TV characters.|$|E

60|$|I often {{wonder about}} {{this line of}} descent. I, the modern, am incontestably a man; yet I, Big-Tooth, the primitive, am not a man. Somewhere, and by {{straight}} line of descent, these two parties to my dual personality were connected. Were the Folk, before their destruction, {{in the process of}} becoming men? And did I and mine carry through this process? On the other hand, may not some descendant of mine have gone in to the Fire People and <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them?</b> I do not know. There is no way of learning. One thing only is certain, and that is that Big-Tooth did stamp into the cerebral constitution of one of his progeny all the impressions of his life, and stamped them in so indelibly that the hosts of intervening generations have failed to obliterate them.|$|E
60|$|Ormsgill's {{forehead}} was furrowed, and the perspiration {{stood in}} beads on it. The love that had driven {{him out to}} win his spurs {{in the land of}} shadow still in some degree, at least, remained with him; but he was conscious of the change in him which the girl with her upbringing might well shrink from. He had lived with the outcasts until he had <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> a hater of conventional formulas and shams, while there had crept into his nature a trace of the somberness of the dark land. What, he wondered, would the sunny-tempered English girl he had left make of such a man. Still, as the priest had said, his duty was clear, and, what was perhaps more, his inclination marched with it. He straightened himself suddenly with a little resolute jerk of his shoulders.|$|E

60|$|A hot denial trembled on Jimmy's tongue. Never {{had he been}} so misjudged. And {{then the}} thought of Ann checked him. He must do nothing that would {{interfere}} with Ann's plans. Whatever the cost, he must conciliate this little man. For a moment he mused sentimentally on Ann. He hoped she would understand {{what he was going}} through for her sake. To a man with his ingrained distaste for work in any shape the sight of those wage-slaves outside there in the outer office had, as he had told Mr. Pett, been stimulating: but only because it filled him with a sort of spiritual uplift to think that he had not got to do that sort of thing. Consider them in the light of fellow-workers, and the spectacle ceased to stimulate and became nauseating. And for her sake he was about to <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them!</b> Had any knight of old ever done anything as big as that for his lady? He very much doubted it.|$|E

[...] It was [...] "mate" [...] now--and a fine and hearty word, with a tingle to it, and a warmth and gladness, which the other term does not possess. Governor!

It would probably, also, be to the advantage of your people if any such idea as this resulted in successful action on your part.

Even now there are grave doubts as to the validity of the transaction. When nothing was heard of you, and we all concluded that you were dead, I ventured to take back what I honestly believed to be my own.

6000|$|... 164. Also {{this study}} will be useful to you, in showing how entirely effects of light depend on delineation, and {{gradation}} of spaces, and not on methods of shading. And {{this is the second}} great practical matter I want you to remember to-day. All effects of light and shade depend not on the method or execution of shadows, but on their rightness of place, form, and depth. There is indeed a loveliness of execution added to the rightness, by the great masters, but you cannot obtain that unless you <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Shadow cannot be laid thoroughly well, any more than lines can be drawn steadily, but by a long-practised hand, and the attempts to imitate the shading of fine draughtsmen, by dotting and hatching, are just as ridiculous as it would be to endeavour to imitate their instantaneous lines by a series of re-touchings. You will often indeed see in Lionardo's work, and in Michael Angelo's, shadow wrought laboriously to an extreme of fineness; but when you look into it, you will find that they have always been drawing more and more form within the space, and never finishing for the sake of added texture, but of added fact. And all those effects of transparency and reflected light, aimed at in common chalk drawings, are wholly spurious. For since, as I told you, all lights are shades compared to higher lights, and lights only as compared to lower ones, it follows {{that there can be no}} difference in their quality as such; but that light is opaque when it expresses substance, and transparent when it expresses space; and shade is also opaque when it expresses substance, and transparent when it expresses space. But it is not, even then, transparent in the common sense of that word; nor is its appearance to be obtained by dotting or cross hatching, but by touches so tender as to look like mist. And now we find the use of having Lionardo for our guide. He is supreme in all questions of execution, and in his 28th chapter, you will find that shadows are to be [...] "dolce e sfumose," [...] to be tender, and look as if they were exhaled, or breathed on the paper. Then, look at any of Michael Angelo's finished drawings, or of Correggio's sketches, and you will see that the true nurse of light is in art, as in nature, the cloud; a misty and tender darkness, made lovely by gradation.|$|E
60|$|Saturday. It {{was the day}} {{on which}} he had promised to pay his landlady. He had been expecting {{something}} to turn up all through the week. He had found no work. He had never been driven to extremities before, {{and he was so}} dazed {{that he did not know}} what to do. He had at the back of his mind a feeling that the whole thing was a preposterous joke. He had no more than a few coppers left, he had sold all the clothes he could do without; he had some books and one or two odds and ends upon which he might have got a shilling or two, but the landlady was keeping an eye on his comings and goings: he was afraid she would stop him if he took anything more from his room. The only thing was to tell her that he could not pay his bill. He had not the courage. It was the middle of June. The night was fine and warm. He made up his mind to stay out. He walked slowly along the Chelsea Embankment, because the river was restful and quiet, till he was tired, and then sat on a bench and dozed. He did not know how long he slept; he awoke with a start, dreaming that he was being shaken by a policeman and told to move on; but when he opened his eyes he found himself alone. He walked on, he did not know why, and at last came to Chiswick, where he slept again. Presently the hardness of the bench roused him. The night seemed very long. He shivered. He was seized with a sense of his misery; and he did not know what on earth to do: he was ashamed at having slept on the Embankment; it seemed peculiarly humiliating, and he felt his cheeks flush in the darkness. He remembered stories he had heard of those who did and how among them were officers, clergymen, and men who had been to universities: he wondered if he would <b>become</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> standing in a line to get soup from a charitable institution. It would be much better to commit suicide. He could not go on like that: Lawson would help him when he knew what straits he was in; it was absurd to let his pride prevent him from asking for assistance. He wondered why he had come such a cropper. He had always tried to do what he thought best, and everything had gone wrong. He had helped people when he could, he did not think he had been more selfish than anyone else, it seemed horribly unjust that he should be reduced to such a pass.|$|E
