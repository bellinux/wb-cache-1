General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.Yet another structure available is λ/2 open-circuit stubs across the line coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers.

Three point {{bending fatigue}} tests {{were carried out}} to {{investigate}} the influence of <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> on fatigue behavior of medium carbon steel with chromium nitride film. The substrate material of the specimens was JIS S 45 C medium carbon steel. The chromium nitride films were coated at two different <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> (VB =- 20 V,- 300 V) for fatigue test by arc ion plating method.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the use of}} the Transverse Field Detector (TFD) as a device for {{multispectral}} image acquisition is proposed. The TFD is a color imaging pixel capable of color reconstruction without color filters. Its basic working principle is based on the generation of a suitable electric field configuration inside a Silicon depleted region by means of <b>biasing</b> <b>voltages</b> applied to surface contacts. With respect to previously proposed methods for performing multispectral capture, the TFD has a unique characteristic of electrically tunable spectral responses. This feature allows capturing an image with different sets of spectral responses (RGB, R'G'B', and so on) simply by tuning the device <b>biasing</b> <b>voltages</b> in multiple captures. In this way no hardware complexity (no external filter wheels or varying sources) is added with respect to a colorimetric device. The estimation of the spectral reflectance of the area imaged by a TFD pixel is based in this work on a linear combination of six eigenfunctions. It is shown that a spectral reconstruction can be obtained either (1) using two subsequent image captures that generate six TFD spectral responses or (2) using a new asymmetric biasing scheme, which allows the implementation of five spectral responses for each TFD pixel site in a single configuration, definitely allowing one-shot multispectral imaging...|$|E
