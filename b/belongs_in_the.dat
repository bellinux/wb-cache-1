5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} of mitochondrial small-subunit rDNA sequences suggests that B.nobilissimus, which <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hymenochaetoid clade, {{is closely related}} to the genera Oxyporus and Schizopora.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tricholomataceae family. However, the analysis does show it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L.decorosa does not belong in the family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E
5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, {{that may or may}} not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E

50|$|Byssoporia is a fungal genus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Albatrellaceae. The genus is monotypic, {{containing}} the single widespread corticioid species Byssoporia terrestris. There are several varieties: sartoryi, lilacinorosea, aurantiaca, sublutea, and parksii. These differ in bruising reaction, presence of clamp connections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hyphae, or hyphal morphology. It was breviously thought to <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atheliaceae, but a molecular phylogenetics {{found it to}} <b>belong</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Albatrellaceae.|$|R
5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Miralles {{and others}} {{reviewed}} the taxon maculata {{and concluded that}} the animal now known as Trachylepis maculata also <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> African clade, but they were unable {{to determine whether or not}} it is indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata. Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T.tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.|$|E
5|$|Now {{recognised}} as {{a member}} of the family Spinosauridae, Baryonyx affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Apart from the type species (B. walkeri), some researchers have suggested that Suchomimus tenerensis <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same genus and that Suchosaurus cultridens is a senior synonym; subsequent authors have kept them separate. Baryonyx was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile Iguanodon. The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. Baryonyx lived near water bodies, in areas where other theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs have also been found.|$|E

During Lesnar's promo on the August 1 Raw, Orton appeared and delivered an RKO to Lesnar. The following night, Lesnar attacked Orton during his match on SmackDown, delivering an F-5 to Orton. At SummerSlam, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout after a series of elbows, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required 10 staples.|$|E

25|$|Further {{evidence}} {{indicating that}} the aye-aye <b>belongs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> superfamily Lemuroidea can be inferred from the presence of petrosal bullae encasing the ossicles of the ear.
