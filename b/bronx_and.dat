5|$|Manhattan Island is loosely {{divided into}} Downtown (Lower Manhattan), Midtown (Midtown Manhattan), and Uptown (Upper Manhattan), with Fifth Avenue {{dividing}} Manhattan's {{east and west}} sides. Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River {{to the west and}} the East River to the east. To the north, the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> the mainland United States.|$|E
5|$|North of Kingsbridge, I-87 {{generally}} {{follows a}} northeastern alignment, {{passing through the}} center of Van Cortlandt Park as it connects to Mosholu Parkway and Jerome Avenue. Mosholu Parkway also links I-87 to the Henry Hudson and Saw Mill River parkways, which run parallel to the Major Deegan Expressway through the western <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> Manhattan. Past Jerome Avenue, the freeway gains a pair of service roads and heads north to the New York City–Yonkers border.|$|E
5|$|The Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} at Harding Avenue in the <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> connect {{into the}} Court Street station in Brooklyn as a two-track and four-track line. A yard {{would have been}} constructed to store the line's equipment. The first phase would end the line at East 139th Street. The Main Line and its connections to other subway lines was to have cost $213,950,000, while the future Bronx extension would have cost $130,160,000.|$|E

5|$|The Triborough System was a {{proclamation}} for new subway {{lines to}} the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> Brooklyn. These lines are the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, IRT Pelham Line, and IRT Jerome Avenue Line.

5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within the bounds of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E
5|$|One {{neighborhood}} of New York County is contiguous with the U.S. mainland. Marble Hill {{at one time}} was part of Manhattan Island, but the Harlem River Ship Canal, dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River, separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> the remainder of Manhattan. Before World War I, {{the section of the}} original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in, and Marble Hill became part of the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Van Cortlandt Park's sports {{facilities}} include two {{golf courses and}} several miles of paths for running, as well as smaller facilities for swimming, baseball, soccer, tennis, horseback riding, cross-country running, and cricket. The park also contains five major hiking trails and other walking trails. Its natural features include Tibbetts Brook; Van Cortlandt Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Bronx; old-growth forests; and outcrops of Fordham gneiss and Inwood marble. Contained within the park is the Van Cortlandt House Museum, the oldest surviving building in the <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> the Van Cortlandt Golf Course, the oldest public golf course in the country.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but {{he would not be able}} to do the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E

5|$|In December 1934, at {{the insistence}} of the Automobile Club of New York, several {{numbered}} routes were extended and signed within New York City, with NY22 being one of these routes. NY22 was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along White Plains Road, then it shifted via East 233rd Street to Webster Avenue until Fordham Road (US1). From Fordham Road, it continued south along the Grand Concourse (overlapped with NY100), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the 145th Street Bridge. In Manhattan, the NY22/100 pair continued south along Lenox Avenue, 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, 96th Street, and Park Avenue, ending at Houston Street (NY1A). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January1, 1970, the NY22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US1 at its current southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), and the NYC & Company water travel {{initiative}} NYHarborWay, {{worked with}} the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to release a Comprehensive Citywide Ferry Study, in which it examined over 40 potential locations for a ferry system in New York City. The study was commissioned {{in order to examine}} transport alternatives for neighborhoods along New York City's shores. It also discussed the East River Ferry, which was set to enter service later that year. The study identified potential ferry routes to western Manhattan and Riverdale; eastern Manhattan, the South <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> Co-op City; the northern Brooklyn and Queens shorelines; the South Shore of Staten Island; and southwestern Brooklyn, southern Brooklyn, and the Rockaways.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{initially}} did not mark numbered routes {{within its}} limits. In 1932, the New York Automobile Club drafted a plan establishing alignments for several routes through the city. In this plan, NY9A went south through the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> into Manhattan on Broadway while US9 used Riverdale Avenue north of 230th Street. As a result, the two routes {{would have had}} a short concurrency across Spuyten Duyvil Creek. NY9A would have split to the south on Tenth Avenue at 218th Street in order to join the Harlem River Drive via Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street. From there it would head west on 155th Street to Amsterdam Avenue, where it would head south to 79th Street, heading west there to rejoin US9 at Riverside Drive. US9 would have continued south through lower Manhattan to Staten Island via the Staten Island Ferry; however, it is unclear whether NY9A would have continued south with US9 to lower Manhattan.|$|E

5|$|On January 19, 1959, {{the library}} moved to its fifth {{location}} and first permanent home, the former Briarcliff Manor station originally on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). The station {{had been built}} in 1906 by village founder Walter W. Law in the Tudor Revival style, {{as a replacement for}} a smaller station, which was moved to nearby Millwood. In its later operation as a station, the building was rarely used, and only four trains stopped there each day. Due to the railroad's tracks ending in the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> requiring a transfer to continue on to Manhattan, many Briarcliff Manor residents would drive to Pleasantville or Scarborough, which had stations along lines ending in Manhattan, and more trains ran along those lines. The passenger railroad, then known as the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad, discontinued service in 1958, freeing up use of the building for the library.|$|E
5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E
5|$|The New York Automobile Club {{released}} another plan in 1933. This plan made {{no changes}} to NY9A; however, US9 {{was changed to}} use Broadway {{all the way through}} the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> to travel to New Jersey by way of the Holland Tunnel. In the final plan implemented in mid-December 1934, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive–Amsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, NY9A used what had been planned as US9, splitting at Broadway and Dyckman Street. NY9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on Riverside Drive and the West Side Elevated Highway (detouring around an unfinished section via 57th Street, Eleventh Avenue and 48th Street) to end at the entrance and exit plazas of the Holland Tunnel. US9 was shifted northward to enter New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the <b>Bronx</b> <b>and</b> Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland per capita than many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile New Yorkers, advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new parks in the <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city refused to make a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future parks in the 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion of the Bronx that is west of the Bronx River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in the Bronx, comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans {{such as a}} line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the <b>Bronx,</b> <b>and</b> other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E
