40|$|Slavery and {{the cult}} of true womanhood {{established}} disparate punitive structures from the early colonial period. Sex and race, as well as status and class, determined both the types of behavior labeled criminal and the mode of punishment individuals received.

The constructed notions of race, gender, and class created a multiple jeopardy that remains <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} sheep scab is briefly {{discussed}} {{since it was}} first mentioned in 180 BC.

We begin with Saffman’s first work on fluid mechanics in Cambridge, England, in the mid- 1950 s and then describe the evolution of his ideas and research, over many diverse areas in fluid mechanics until his final paper in 2002. It is argued that Saffman brought a unique perspective to our interpretation of fluid mechanics as a broad scientific discipline that remains <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today...</b>|$|R

50|$|His {{emphasis}} on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative statistical analysis, and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship {{between theory and practice}} is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA, the Shewhart cycle). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.|$|R
