The sages legally defined future equinox times by instituting the 28-year cycle, to protect the Hebrew dating against future change, and to leave a remembrance to what they had done.|$|E
25|$|Ghulam Ahmad went to Delhi, {{which was}} at the time {{considered}} a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding {{the life and death of}} Isa (Jesus), particularly Maulana Syed Nazeer Husain (1805–1901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and that the debate should be on the subject of the death of Jesus.|$|E

[...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation.

[...] In a separate interview Travolta commented on the perceived similarities between Battlefield Earth and Scientology: [...] "Well, they are kind of synonymous… L. Ron Hubbard is very famous for Scientology and Dianetics. On the other hand, he's equally as famous in the science fiction world.

500|$|Of greater concern, Gunson says, is the [...] "deliberate {{blurring}} {{of responsibility for}} the coup". The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed, [...] "leaving a total power vacuum". However, the high command's senior figure, General Lucas Rincón (who announced Chávez's resignation on television), {{was not part of the}} coup and remained in the government after April 2002. The petition draws the conclusion, [...] "(1) either General Rincón stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole country... or (2) General Rincón lied, because he was an accomplice... that seems not to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> because he [...]" [...] Only one of the high command joined Carmona's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support. The military leaders shown withdrawing their support for Chávez were not the high command, and Vice-Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the head of the navy, as the film claims. Gunson says, [...] "With one solitary exception, these generals and admirals had not 'fled abroad' after the Carmona government collapsed." [...] Although Bartley and ÓBriain accept that Rincón said Chávez [...] "had agreed to resign", they reiterate that [...] "elements in the military [...] force in the effort to make Chávez resign"; the filmmakers say it is [...] "irrelevant" [...] that the whole military did not join the coup, as this [...] "is the case with most coups". General Rincón's announcement was omitted because they felt it was [...] "supplementary to the main, key fact of the story", that no documentary evidence of the resignation exists.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{lost all}} of her {{endorsements}} too, Suzuki was faced {{with the problem of}} production companies refusing to sign her and tried to make a comeback {{in the next two years}} with little to no success. Her relationship with her producer, Tetsuya Komuro, also ceased. Sony also took {{all of her}} singles and albums released up to that point off CD shelves. Many people were convinced that her chances for making a comeback were nil. In 2003, Suzuki finally negotiated an out-of-court agreement with Sony. Her contract with the label was scheduled to end in December 2004. Eiji Yamada was subsequently fined for his role in the tax evasion. Government officials linked to the scandal included former Education Minister Takashi Kosugi and two other legislators, who allegedly received 34 million yen in unofficial payments for referring AG Communication and other clients seeking tax evasion.

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker.

The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round.

2500|$|Huxley {{expanded}} his lectures for working men {{into a book}} titled Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, published in 1863. His intention was expressed {{in a letter to}} Charles Lyell which referred to the Monkeyana poem of 1861: [...] "I do not think you will find room to complain of any want of distinctness in my definition of Owen's position touching the Hippocampus question. I mean to give the whole history of the business in a note, so that the paraphrase of Sir Ph. Egerton's line 'To which Huxley replies that Owen he lies', shall be unmistakable." [...] Darwin exclaimed, [...] "Hurrah the monkey book has come". A central part of the book provides a step by step explanation suitable for newcomers to anatomy of how the brains of apes and humans are fundamentally similar, with particular reference to both having a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. The chapter concludes that this close similarity between apes and mankind proves that the original definition by Linnaeus of the biological Order of Primates was correct to include both, and mentions that an explanation of humans originating from apes is provided by Darwin's theory. The book also includes six pages of small print giving [...] "a succinct History of the Controversy respecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes" [...] describing how Owen had [...] "suppressed" [...] and denied what Huxley had now shown to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> regarding the hippocampus minor, posterior horn, and posterior lobe, describing this as reflecting on Owen's [...] "personal veracity". Reviewers regarded the book as a polemic against Owen, and a majority of them sided with Huxley.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Arthur wins a large cash prize in a {{sweepstakes}} and uses it to take the whole family on a holiday to Egypt. After they return, Arthur thinks that Harry should know (what he [...] then believes to <b>be)</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about Sirius Black. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry's abuse {{at the hands of}} the Dursleys until he witnesses what they think about Harry and the Wizarding world and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mr Weasley is a member of the Order, and accompanies Harry to his visit in the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to see this in a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers. Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for Order of the Phoenix she planned to kill Arthur. She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. However, as she [...] "wanted to kill parents", she spared Arthur's life in exchange for Lupin's and Tonks's.
