5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler <b>blobs.</b> The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling <b>blobs,</b> the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, <b>Blobs</b> and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic <b>blobs</b> of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Lifespans {{range from}} three to over thirty years. Ripe gametes (ova or sperm) float from the gonads into the main coelom and then exit into the mantle cavity. The larvae of inarticulate brachiopods are {{miniature}} adults, with lophophores that enable the larvae to feed and swim for months until the animals become heavy enough to settle to the seabed. The planktonic larvae of articulate species do not resemble the adults, but rather look like <b>blobs</b> with yolk sacs, and remain among the plankton {{for only a few}} days before leaving the water column upon metamorphosing.|$|E

50|$|De <b>Blob</b> 2 is a {{platform}} puzzle video {{game and the}} sequel to the Wii-exclusive 2008 video game de <b>Blob.</b> As with its predecessor, de <b>Blob</b> 2 was developed for home consoles by the now-defunct Blue Tongue Entertainment and published by THQ. Unlike de <b>Blob,</b> however, de <b>Blob</b> 2 was also released for other consoles other than the Wii; the game was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DS, with the latter version having been developed by Halfbrick Studios and taking place between de <b>Blob</b> and de <b>Blob</b> 2.|$|R

5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink <b>blobs.</b> They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes {{exists in}} four {{distinct}} versions. The original two-plinth Xerxes (1985) was discontinued after about eight years' production, after the Touraj Moghaddam Signature (TMS) was launched. On the 10th {{anniversary of the}} company (1995), Roksan reprised the entry-level Xerxes turntable with a 3-plinth design named Xerxes.X. Its top plinth houses the tonearm and the main bearing, and is isolated from the base by five <b>Blobs,</b> which also allow the plinth to be adjusted in two planes – parallel and perpendicular to the motor and main bearing. The motor is driven by XPS V Reference motor drive, which receives power from DS1.5 Reference Power Supply.|$|E
5|$|The plutons in {{the park}} are Jurassic and Cretaceous aged and are located toward the park's western margin {{where they can be}} seen from {{unimproved}} roads. One of these relatively small granitic plutons was emplaced 6787 Ma and spawned one of the more profitable precious metal deposits in the Death Valley area, giving rise to the town and mines of Skidoo. In the Death Valley area these solidified <b>blobs</b> of magma are located under much of the Owlshead Mountains and are found in the western end of the Panamint Mountains. Thrusted areas can be seen at Schwaub Peak {{in the southern part of}} the Funeral Mountains.|$|E
50|$|Beware! The <b>Blob</b> (alternately titled as Beware the <b>Blob,</b> Son of <b>Blob,</b> Son of the <b>Blob</b> or The <b>Blob</b> Returns) is a 1972 (copyrighted 1971) {{sequel to}} horror science fiction film The <b>Blob.</b> The film was {{directed}} by Larry Hagman. The screenplay was penned by Anthony Harris and Jack Woods III, based on a story by Jack H. Harris and Richard Clair. The film originally earned a GP rating from the MPAA, though it is now unrated.|$|R
50|$|If a piece {{lands on}} a square with a playing {{piece of the}} same colour then {{this is known as}} a <b>blob</b> and is {{basically}} a barrier. An opposing piece is not allowed to jump over them, but friendly pieces can. The two ways an opposing piece can get by a <b>blob</b> is to destroy it, or by using an adjacent friendly <b>blob</b> to jump over it. A player can destroy the barrier by landing on an opponent's <b>blob</b> with a <b>blob</b> of their own or to six the <b>blob</b> off. To do this they will need to have a playing piece adjacent to the <b>blob</b> and then on their turn throw X + 1 six where X = the number of playing pieces forming the <b>blob.</b> Note that if the <b>blob</b> is on its own colour doorstep, then an additional six (i.e. X + 2 sixes) must be thrown to remove the <b>blob</b> and exit the homebase.|$|R
30|$|When a {{possible}} occlusion exists, the maximal possible {{growth for the}} possibly occluded <b>blob</b> bounds is determined. First, {{in order to establish}} an initial limit for the possible <b>blob</b> bounds, the largest maximum dimensions of expected objects are considered at the <b>blob</b> position, and those who exceed the dimensions of the analysed <b>blob</b> are enlarged. If all possible largest expected objects do not impose a larger bound to the <b>blob,</b> the hypothesis of possible occlusion is discarded. Next, the obtained limits of growth for <b>blob</b> bounds are adjusted for static context objects, by analysing the hidden faces of the object polygon which possibly occlude the <b>blob,</b> and extending the <b>blob,</b> until its 3 D ground projection collides the first hidden polygon face.|$|R
5|$|The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and <b>blobs</b> of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinder around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Edziza's cinder cones have bowl-shaped craters at their summits and rise {{more than a hundred}} metres above their surroundings. Cinder cones are widespread in British Columbia as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{coronagraph}} on the Subaru {{telescope in}} Hawaii in 2005, astronomers {{were able to}} further constrain {{the size of a}} planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5–10 times the mass of Jupiter. The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric. No evidence was found of the <b>blobs</b> reported earlier, casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet. The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow-up observations by Hughes et al. (2012) and the Herschel Space Telescope.|$|E
5|$|LocoRoco {{is divided}} into 5 worlds each {{consisting}} of 8 levels. In each level, {{the goal is to}} reach the end point of the level, with the player scored on the number of LocoRoco found, the time to complete the level, and other factors. There are six varieties of LocoRoco in the game, identified by their color, appearance, and musical voice, but outside of the first yellow one (Kulche), the rest are unlocked as the player completes the levels. The player can then opt which LocoRoco they want to use for a level, however, this selection has no fundamental gameplay effects and only changes the songs used. LocoRoco act as <b>blobs</b> of gelatin, deforming from their normally round shape when demanded by the environment. Certain beings in the world can change the default shape of the LocoRoco into other forms, such as squares or triangles, which lasts until they wash off in water or they encounter another similar being.|$|E
30|$|The <b>blob</b> intersects with {{exactly one}} cluster: if the {{rectangle}} overlying <b>blob</b> B intersects with the rectangle {{of a single}} cluster C, the <b>blob</b> is associated to this cluster, as shown in Figure  15, where I is the intersection rectangle. The result, shown in Figure  15, has {{the shape of the}} <b>blob</b> and the velocity vector of the cluster starting from the geometric center of the <b>blob.</b>|$|R
50|$|If one {{succeeds in}} {{knocking}} the <b>blob</b> off, then the single playing piece used {{to attack the}} <b>blob</b> is moved to the square that the <b>blob</b> was on and the pieces forming the <b>blob</b> are returned to the base. Play then continues to the next player.|$|R
30|$|The <b>blob</b> intersects {{with several}} clusters: if the {{rectangle}} overlying <b>blob</b> B intersects {{with more than}} one cluster, as shown in Figure  16 in which <b>blob</b> B intersects with clusters C 1 and C 2, then the <b>blob</b> is associated to the cluster with the largest intersection area. In the example shown in Figure  16, area I 1 is greater than I 2; therefore, <b>blob</b> B is associated to cluster C 1.|$|R
5|$|When flux tubes {{loaded with}} the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a {{reconnection}} process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma. The former returns to the inner magnetosphere {{in the form of}} flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of plasmoids—large <b>blobs</b> of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo probe, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days. The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere. The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped <b>blobs.</b> These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
25|$|The idents for the channel, {{designed}} by Lambie-Nairn, {{are the same}} as at launch and consist of yellow <b>blobs,</b> the opposite to the green <b>blobs</b> launched with the CBBC Channel with a much younger feel, as befits the target audience. The yellow <b>blobs</b> were also seen in BBC Kids' current idents. They directly oppose the CBBC <b>blobs,</b> as these <b>blobs</b> are gentle in their actions and to look at, whereas the green CBBC <b>blobs</b> looked more outgoing and violent—one of the CBBC idents at the time involved karate.|$|E

50|$|An {{amorphous}} green <b>blob</b> with a dopey grin, the <b>Blob</b> may {{not look}} like a skilled fighter at first glance. In actuality, <b>Blob</b> is a master of morphing, transforming his body into cannons, sledgehammers, boxing gloves, and many other weapons. <b>Blob</b> also has an appetite for living clay, and thinks nothing of gobbling up a downed opponent for a quick snack. <b>Blob</b> has also been in all three games in the series. In previous games, the <b>Blob</b> had a high-pitched voice and a sadistic grin, but for this outing he's been given a Quasimodo-like voice and a dopey expression.|$|R
30|$|The <b>blob</b> {{does not}} {{intersect}} with any cluster: when the rectangle covering <b>blob</b> B does not intersect with any cluster, the nearest cluster is considered. If {{the distance between}} the <b>blob</b> and cluster does not exceed a certain threshold, <b>blob</b> B is associated to this cluster; otherwise, the <b>blob</b> is discarded and not associated to any cluster. The example in Figure  17 shows <b>blob</b> B not intersecting with any cluster, but being close to clusters C 1 and C 2, so the distances to both clusters d 1 and d 2 are calculated. As the minimum distance is d 2 and does not exceed the maximum threshold, the <b>blob</b> is associated to cluster C 2, as shown in Figure  17.|$|R
25|$|Git stores each {{revision}} of a file {{as a unique}} blob. The relationships between the <b>blobs</b> can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using zlib compression.
