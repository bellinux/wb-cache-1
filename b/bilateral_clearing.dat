50|$|The {{system of}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>clearing</b> {{agreements}} on which Soviet-Finnish trade was based required that {{any increase in}} Finnish imports from the Soviet Union {{be accompanied by a}} corresponding increase in exports to the Soviet Union {{in order to maintain the}} bilateral trade balance. At the beginning of the 1980s, Finland increased its imports of Soviet oil, which allowed it to increase its exports to the Soviet Union. This procedure accounted for the steady growth in Soviet-Finnish trade into the late 1980s. By 1988 about 90 percent of Soviet exports to Finland consisted of oil. Because the Finns imported more oil than they could consume domestically, they reexported it to other Scandinavian and West European countries. The Finns complained in late 1987 and early 1988 of a decline in Soviet ship orders and delinquent payments. The share of Finland's exports to the Soviet Union, which had previously been as high as 25 percent, dropped to 15 percent in 1988.|$|E

50|$|Gaitskell thought {{balance of}} {{payments}} problems should be solved not by realignments of currencies but by asking surplus countries like the USA and Belgium to inflate their economies (so they would import more).

Dell argues that Gaitskell did not realise that other countries had their own domestic problems. In September 1950, with Britain’s {{balance of payments}} now in surplus, Gaitskell negotiated British membership of a European Payments Union, meaning that instead of <b>bilateral</b> <b>clearing,</b> European currencies were to be convertible against one another even if not against the US dollar. Previously dollars had been needed for trade within Europe.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this article deals with some basic {{questions}} concerning the transition from a planned to a market economy in the C. S. F. R., Hungary, and Poland. Forty years of a centrally planned system have shaped the attitudes of economic agents, and the capacity of enterprises as well as of administration officials to act in conformity with market rules has been greatly impaired. Thus, the experiences of Western Europe in the post-war period can be transferred to Eastern Europe only to a limited extent. If the external sector of the Eastern economies is to flourish, convertibility of the currencies must be implemented quickly; this in turn will require a massive devaluation, supported by supplementary commercial policy measures. Even though the foreign trade of the Eastern economies should be redirected toward the West, trade relations with other Eastern countries should not be neglected; in the transition phase these traditional trade relations need to be stimulated through counter trade, <b>bilateral</b> <b>clearing</b> (in trade with the U.

In this policy brief, he explains why only a wholesale reform of the international financial architecture can adequately address these countries' concerns. As a blueprint for reform, Kregel recommends a radical proposal advanced in the 1940 s, most notably by John Maynard Keynes. Keynes {{was among those who}} were developing proposals for shaping the international financial system in the immediate postwar period. His clearing union plan, itself inspired by Hjalmar Schacht's system of <b>bilateral</b> <b>clearing</b> agreements, would have effectively eliminated the need for an international reserve currency. Under Keynes's clearing union, trade and other international payments would be automatically facilitated through a global clearinghouse, using debits and credits denominated in a notional unit of account. The unit of account would have a fixed conversion rate to national currencies and could not be bought, sold, or traded - meaning no market for foreign currency would be required. Clearinghouse credits could only be used to offset debits by buying imports, and if not used within a specified period of time, the credits would be extinguished, giving export surplus countries an incentive to spend them. As Kregel points out, this would help support global demand and enable a shared adjustment burden. [ [...] . ...|$|E

Not only does it place the agreement into the broader context {{of social and political}} developments in Jewish Palestine before World War II, but also it seeks to explain the economic and political importance of the agreement to the Nazi regime. This is most notable in the years between 1933 and 1936, when Nazi power remained weakest and when Reich authorities pursued every opportunity for financial advantages leading to rapid economic recovery. The deal established the basis for renewed and augmented trade between the Third Reich and Palestine.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} implosion and regionalization {{of international}} trade during the 1930 s has often been blamed on the trade and foreign exchange policies {{that emerged in the}} interwar period. We provide new evidence on the impact of trade and currency blocs on trade flows from 1928 - 38 that suggests a blanket indictment of interwar trade policies and payments arrangements is not warranted. Discriminatory trade policies and international monetary arrangements had neither a uniformly favourable nor unfavourable implication for world trade; instead the balance of trade-creating and trade-diverting effects depended on the motivations of policy-makers, and hence on the structure of their policies. We find, for example, that British Commonwealth tariff preferences affected trade more significantly than the sterling-bloc currency area, but both promoted within-group trade without diverting trade away from non-members. Exchange controls and <b>bilateral</b> <b>clearing</b> arrangements enacted by Germany and Central and East European countries, by contrast, dominated other commercial policies in altering trade patterns, but curtailed trade with non-members with no offsetting trade-creating effects. We also find support for Ragner Nurkse's famous hypothesis that exchange rate volatility in the interwar period diminished trade. Our results speak to the emerging regional trade and currency areas of today, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the EC's Single Market and European Monetary System, and suggest that their impact lies not in the regional or global character of the policy initiative, but in the structure and design of the underlying policies.

Patients and methods: This was a prospective study in which <b>bilateral</b> <b>clear</b> lens extraction was performed on 40 eyes of 20 patients, to correct high myopia. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group A underwent supracapsular phacoaspiration; group B were the contralateral eyes of the same patient. These patients were operated on with endocapsular phacoaspiration with the divide and conquer (D and C) technique. Preoperative ocular examination data were recorded and tested for significance. Intraoperative difficulties and complications such as nucleus cracking, capsule rupture and vitreous loss, and repeated chamber collapse were recorded. Postoperative examination data were recorded. Results: Mean age was 35. 65 &plusmn; 5. 85 years. Mean follow-up time was 17. 1 &plusmn; 8. 56 months. In group A mean myopia was - 17. 3 &plusmn; 5. 07 diopters; in group B myopia was - 17. 9 &plusmn; 4. 20 diopters. Mean preoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 0. 04 &plusmn; 0. 0167, while the mean postoperative UCVA was 0. 435 &plusmn; 0. 1442. There {{was a significant difference}} in pre and postoperative BCVA within both groups, but not between the two groups. In both groups endothelial cell count (ECC) showed a significant difference between pre- and postoperative data; however, there was no statistically significant difference between both groups in postoperative ECC. The effective phacoaspiration time for group A was 4. 6 &plusmn; 1. 6 seconds, and for group B 9. 90 &plusmn; 2. 27 seconds (P &lt; 0. 005). No cases of capsule rupture occurred in group A, but 3 cases occurred in group B (15 %) (not significant, P = 0. 231). Nucleus cracking did not occur in group A, but in group B 13 cases occurred (65 %). Chamber collapse occurred in 4 cases (20 %) in group A and 5 cases (25 %) in group B (not significant, P = 1. 000). Three cases of moderate postoperative iritis were recorded in group B in (15 %), in which posterior capsular rupture also occurred.
