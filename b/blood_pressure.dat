5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (HBP), is a {{long-term}} medical condition in which the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in the arteries is persistently elevated. High <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{and mechanical}} ventilation {{may be used}} to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure),</b> which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Failing to maintain <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is decreased {{not due to}} dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>pressures</b> were {{measured}} using standard techniques on {{a random sample}} of 961 rural and 1073 urban women chosen from North Arcot District in Tamilnadu State of south India. The mean (SD) systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> (mm Hg) were 101. 4 (10. 5) in the rural women and 105. 3 (14. 1) in the urban. The mean (SD) diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> were 65. 9 (9. 9) in the rural women and 68. 0 (10. 8) in the urban. For both systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures,</b> the urban values were significantly higher than those in the rural. The correlations of <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> with selected socioeconomic, obstetric, and maternal factors were examined.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Current {{hypertension}} guidelines {{stress the}} importance to assess total cardiovascular risk but do not describe precisely how to use ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> in the cardiovascular risk stratification. METHOD: We calculated here global cardiovascular risk according to 2003 European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology guidelines in 127 patients in whom daytime ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> were recorded and carotid/femoral ultrasonography performed. RESULTS: The presence of ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> >or = 135 / 85 mmHg shifted cardiovascular risk to higher categories, as did the presence of hypercholesterolemia and, even more so, the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. CONCLUSION: Further studies are, however, needed to define the position of ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> {{in the assessment of}} cardiovascular risk...|$|R
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E
40|$|Four {{hundred and}} thirty one {{subjects}} aged from 40 to 60, were studied. They were 237 males and 194 females and their occupations were either farmers, fishermen, or stone-cutters. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressures</b> rose with, age in both sexes, males showed higher <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> than females. Subjects with family history of hypertension or stokes were more in hypertensives than in normotensives and borderline hypertensives.

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{incidence}} of high-salt diet in <b>blood</b> <b>pressures,</b> renal 2 -adrenoceptor subtypes distribution, and gene expression in salt-sensitive (SBH) and salt-resistant (SBN) Sabra rats. Comparisons have been made between SBH and SBN rats submitted to a normal or a high-salt diet for 6 weeks. Only 2 B-adrenoceptors are detected in kidneys of SBH rats, whatever the diet. In contrast, mRNA corresponding to 2 A-and 2 B-subtypes are found in this substrain. In these rats, high-salt diet increases <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> and up-regulates gene expression and density of only 2 B-adrenoceptors. Inversely, 2 A- and 2 B-adrenoceptors and corresponding mRNA are found in kidneys of SBN rats. In these rats, a high-salt diet does not affect <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> but increases gene expression and densities of both 2 A- and 2 B-adrenoceptors. If the up-regu...|$|R

Four boys whose mothers had taken methyldopa for more than 150 days had significantly lower systolic and diastolic pressures than those in whom the treatment had been of shorter duration. Significant findings from multiple regression analyses were: positive associations between boys' systolic and diastolic pressures and current weight, and diastolic pressure and maternal weight; negative associations between boys' systolic and diastolic pressures and birthweight; and a positive association between girls' systolic pressure and current weight...|$|R
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in people with hypertension.|$|E

Localization and determination of capillary and postcapillary vessels were ascertained anatomically before pressure measurements. Capillary pressure was 33. 2 +/- 1. 5 (SE) mm Hg in lips of subjects seated upright. Repeated micropunctures of the same vessel gave an average coefficient of variation of 0. 072.

5|$|If the {{systolic}} <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below 90 mmHg {{within days}} of the injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E

40|$|Variants of {{the human}} {{angiotensinogen}} gene have been linked in some studies to increased circulating angiotensinogen levels and essential hypertension. To test for direct causality between genotypes at the angiotensinogen locus and <b>blood</b> <b>pressures,</b> we have studied mice carrying zero, one, two, three, or four functional copies of the murine wild-type angiotensinogen gene (Agt) at its normal chromosomal location. Plasma angiotensinogen levels increase progressively, although not linearly, from zero in the zero-copy animals to 145 % of normal in the four-copy animals. Mice of all genotypes are normal at birth, but most zero-copy animals die before weaning. The kidneys of the zero-copy animals show pathological changes as adults, but the kidneys are normal in the other genotypes. One adult zero-copy male tested was fertile. The <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> of the one-copy through four-copy animals show significant and almost linear increases of approximately 8 mmHg per gene copy despite their normal compensatory mechanisms being intact.
