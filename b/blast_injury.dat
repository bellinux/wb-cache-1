5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a <b>blast</b> <b>injury),</b> or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E

25|$|For {{statistical}} purposes, {{injuries are}} classified as either intentional such as suicide, or unintentional, such as a motor vehicle collision. Intentional injury is a common cause of traumas. Penetrating trauma is caused when a foreign body such as a bullet or a knife enters the body tissue, creating an open wound. In the United States, most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in urban areas and 80% of these deaths are caused by firearms. <b>Blast</b> <b>injury</b> is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, and also may {{be accompanied by a}} burn injury. Trauma also may be associated with a particular activity, such as an occupational or sports injury.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to blunt trauma, penetrating trauma can cause pulmonary contusion. [...] Contusion resulting from penetration by a rapidly moving projectile usually surrounds the path along which the projectile traveled through the tissue. The pressure wave forces tissue {{out of the}} way, creating a temporary cavity; the tissue readily moves back into place, but it is damaged. [...] Pulmonary contusions that accompany gun and knife wounds are not usually severe {{enough to have a}} major effect on outcome; [...] penetrating trauma causes less widespread lung damage than does blunt trauma. An exception is shotgun wounds, which can seriously damage large areas of lung tissue through a <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> mechanism.|$|E

This is because people, being naturally inquisitive, would instead run to windows {{to try to}} locate {{the source of the}} immensely bright flash generated at the instant of the explosion. During this time, unbeknownst to them, the slower moving blast wave, would be rapidly advancing toward their position, only to arrive and cause the window glass to implode, shredding onlookers.

2500|$|During {{the early}} stages of an incident, first {{responders}} may be overwhelmed by the scope of patients and injuries. One valuable technique is the Patient Assist Method (PAM). [...] The responders quickly establish a casualty collection point (CCP) and advise, either by yelling, or over a loudspeaker, that [...] "anyone requiring assistance should move to the selected area (CCP)". This does several things at once, it identifies patients that are not so severely injured, that they need immediate help, it physically clears the scene, and provides possible assistants to the responders. As those who can move, do so, the responders then ask, [...] "anyone who still needs assistance, yell out or raise your hands"; this further identifies patients who are responsive, yet maybe unable to move. Now the responders can rapidly assess the remaining patients who are either expectant, or are in need of immediate aid. From that point the first responder is quickly able to identify those in need of immediate attention, while not being distracted or overwhelmed by the magnitude of the situation. [...] Using this method assumes the ability to hear. [...] Deaf, partially deaf, or victims of a large <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> {{may not be able to}} hear these instructions.|$|E

50|$|In general, primary <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> are {{characterized}} {{by the absence of}} external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary <b>blast</b> <b>injuries.</b> Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is {{the most common cause of}} death among people who initially survive an explosion.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>injuries</b> to {{the hand}} {{are not just}} a wartime {{phenomenon}} but also quite common in rural communities throughout northern California. The {{purpose of this study}} is to review our experience with <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> in the community and review the most common patterns in an attempt to identify the pathomechanics of the hand injury and the reconstructive procedures that are required. This is a retrospective study of <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> to the hand treated between 1978 and 2006. Medical records, X-rays, and photos were reviewed to compile standard patient demographics and characterize the injury pattern. Explosives were classified based on their rate of decomposition. Reconstructive solutions were reviewed and characterized based on whether damaged tissues were repaired or replaced. Sixty-two patients were identified with <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> to their hand. Patients were predominantly male (92 %) with an average age of 27  years. Firecrackers were the most commonly encountered explosives. Thirty-seven patients were identified as holding a low explosive in their dominant hand and were used for characterization of the injury pattern. The apparent pattern of injury was hyperextension and hyperabduction of the hand and digits. Common injuries were metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joint hyperextension with associated soft tissue avulsion, hyperabduction at the web spaces with associated palmar soft tissue tears, and finger disarticulation amputations worse at radial digits. Given the mechanisms of injury with tissue loss, surgical intervention generally involved tissue replacement rather than tissue repair. <b>Blast</b> <b>injuries</b> to the hand represent a broad spectrum of injuries that are associated with the magnitude of explosion and probably, the proximity to the hand. We were able to identify a repetitive pattern of injury and demonstrate the predominant use for delayed tissue replacement rather than microsurgical repair at the acute setting...|$|R

30|$|The {{death and}} woundings took place {{due to the}} direct blast or blast {{reflection}} and the primary and secondary fragmentation effect. In addition to the fragmentation/shrapnel effect, broken windows and concerete etc. are the causes for severely wounding and deaths too. The shrapnels from the grenade body and the secondary fragments from environment travel at air by the effect of detonation blast and give fatal damages. Glass causes many of the secondary <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> (up to 50 % of all <b>blast</b> <b>injuries).</b> Victims that are peppered with glass are often difficult to distinguish from victims that are peppered with glass and have penetrating injuries (White et al., 2008; Wong et al., 1997).|$|R

50|$|Until the mid-1990s, EOD suits {{consisted}} of Kevlar and/or armor plates to stop projectiles. However, the suits {{did not offer}} much protection against the blast wave itself.

In the mid-1990s, research conducted in the U.K. showed that textile and rigid plate armor by themselves do not protect the lungs from <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> It was found that a layer with high acoustic impedance with a backing of a softer, low acoustic impedance layer (such as low density foam) would protect from <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> However, it was also shown {{that it is important to}} understand the frequency content of the applied blast wave and to experimentally test the way materials are put together to make sure they are effective.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>injuries</b> {{can cause}} hidden sensory and brain damage, with {{potential}} neurological and neurosensory consequences. It {{is a complex}} clinical syndrome caused by the combination of all blast effects, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary blast mechanisms. It is noteworthy that <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> usually manifest in a form of polytrauma, i.e. injury involving multiple organs or organ systems. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, {{reducing the amount of}} the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue or organs also contributes significantly to blast-induced neurotrauma.|$|R
