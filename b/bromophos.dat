40|$|In a {{continuation}} of the World Health Organization's collaborative scheme for testing new insecticides against malaria vectors, field trials were carried out during 1965 in the forest belt of Western Nigeria near Lagos and in the Guinea savanna belt of Northern Nigeria near Kaduna, using <b>bromophos</b> residual spray and cheesecloth impregnated with Bayer 39007; Schering 34615 was applied as a residual spray in Lagos. Although <b>bromophos</b> appeared to be effective for at least five months after spraying in the Lagos area, the desired control was obtained for only one month in the Kaduna area; these differences appear to be due to differences in environmental conditions and to the ecology of Anopheles gambiae. Schering 34615 was also effective for up to five months in Lagos and was definitely superior to <b>bromophos.</b> Cheesecloth impregnated with Bayer 39007 gave good control of mosquitos for two and for three months in Kaduna and Lagos, respectively, but because the walls of the treated huts were only partly covered, some mosquitos avoided contact with the cloth. It is suggested that, because of the reduced toxic hazards, cheesecloth treatments may be feasible with potentially effective insecticides that are too toxic to spray...|$|E

The results showed by the author indicate that diazinon and <b>bromophos</b> were the most effective materials tested. Both insecticides protected well the dead trunks {{for at least two}} weeks. Dieldrin (both doses) although less efficient than diazinon, was also effective in preventing the development of great numbers of fly larvae. The treatment with methomyl apparently did not prevent the larvae from developing, as they were observed two weeks after the material was applied.

EBp is 24 -fold more toxic (LD 50 = 91 ± 14 mg/kg body wt) than Bp (LD 50 = 2218 ± 195 mg/kg body wt) and only EBp produced characteristic tremors and lacrimation. In vivo cholinesterase inhibition was in the order plasma> eryth-rocytes> brain. Experiments with equitoxic and equimolar doses showed that EBp is a more potent anticholinesterase compound than Bp. Since ICSO values for the brain AChE were similar for both OPs, the target enzyme sensitivity was not {{a major factor in}} their differential toxicity. In vitro reactivation of serum ChE was significantly higher in the case of EBp than that of Bp. AChE in the brain regions showed differential inhibition in vivo. The brain stem AChE inhibition was least by Bp, whereas it was highest in the case of EBp. Both the OPs produced high AChE inhibition in the hippocampus. Differential inhibition of AChE in the brain regions and its consequent effects may be important factors in the differential neurotoxicity of OPs. © 1996 society of Toxicology <b>Bromophos</b> [0, 0 -dimethyl- 0 -(2, 5 -dichloro- 4 -bromophe-nyl) phosphorothioate] (Bp) and ethylbromophos [O, O-dethyl- 0 -(2, 5 -dichloro- 4 -bromophenyl) phosphorothioate] (EBp) are nonsystemic insecticides effective against biting and sucking insect pests.

40|$|In a Belgian {{pilot study}} honey bee wax combs from ten hives were {{analyzed}} {{on the presence}} of almost 300 organochlorine and organophosphorous compounds by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. Traces of 18 pesticides were found and not a single sample was free of residues. The number of residues found per sample ranged from 3 to 13, and the pesticides found could be categorized as (1) pesticides for solely apicultural (veterinary) application, (2) pesticides for solely agricultural (crop protection) application, (3) pesticides for mixed agricultural and apicultural (veterinary) application. The frequencies and quantities of some environmental pollutants bear us high concerns. Most alarming was the detection of lindane (gamma-HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (including its breakdown product dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), two insecticides that are banned in Europe. The present comprehensive residue analysis, however, also reveals residues of pesticides never found in beeswax before, i. e. DEET, propargite and <b>bromophos...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Boophilus decoloratus, {{resistant}} to fenvalerate, {{was subjected to}} larval immersion, adult immersion and stall tests using the following classes of ixodicides : organochlorines, organophosphates, a diamidide and pyrethroids. A susceptible reference strain of B. decoloratus was used for comparative purposes. The results indicated {{a high level of}} resistance to DDT and camphechlor, slight tolerance to dioxathion, chlorfenvinphos and pirimiphos ethyl, full susceptibility to <b>bromophos</b> ethyl and amitraz, but marked resistance to cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and flumethrin. This marked resistance in the strain therefore appears to be widespread within the pyrethroid group of chemicals and may have developed as a result of organochlorine cross-resistance.

The most toxic compounds and their estimated median lethal doses in nanograms per fly by topical application in solution to teneral Glossina austeni were: resmethrin 4, fenthion 8, dieldrin 10, propoxur 12, chlorfenvinphos 12, tetrachlorvinphos 20, and dichlorvos 20. There was little variation in the susceptibility of teneral male and female flies, young fed flies, and fed stud males with all the compounds tested (dieldrin, resmethrin, tetrachlorvinphos, <b>bromophos,</b> and propoxur) and increased tolerance in old fed pregnant flies occurred only with dieldrin and resmethrin.

Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti were compared with susceptible reference strains treated simultaneously. A low, but significant, resistance to <b>bromophos</b> (4. 6 x), chlorpyrifos (5. 7 x), fenthion (2. 4 x), fenitrothion (5. 0 x), temephos (4. 3 x) and permethrin (2. 1 x) was found in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus, and to malathion (1. 5 x), temephos (2. 3 x), permethrin (1. 8 x) and propoxur (1. 7 x) in Ae. aegypti. Cx. p. quinquefasciatus was shown to possess over-produced esterases A 2 and B 2, which {{are known to be}} involved in resistance to OPs in other countries. Ae. polynesiensis was less resistant than the Ae. aegypti reference strain to all insecticides except temephos (1. 8 x) and permethrin (6. 7 x). To determine whether Ae. polynesiensis had developed resistance to these insecticides in Tahiti, a geographical survey covering 12 islands of the Society, Tuamotu, Tubuai, Marquesas, and Gambier archipelagoes was undertaken with three insecticides (temephos, deltamethrin, and permethrin).

40|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} from chemically-contaminated soil and the isolates were screened for glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression by spraying with monochlorobimane. The isolate {{with the most}} promising GST activity was later identified as Acinetobacter calcoacticus Y 1 based on its 16 S rRNA gene sequence. By using affinity chromatography, A. calcoaceticus Y 1 putative GST (AcGST) was successfully purified and expressed GST subunit with molecular weight estimated at 23 kDa when analysed on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified protein was then further analysed by using two-dimensional electrophoresis where two putative GST isozymes were identified and designated as AcGST- 1 and AcGST- 2. Upon isoelectric focusing, AcGST- 1 and AcGST- 2 {{were found to be}} in pI values of 4. 5 and 6. 2 respectively. AcGST- 1 and AcGST- 2 were purified by using carboxylmethyl (CM) and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) ion exchange chromatography respectively. AcGST- 1 was reactive towards ethacrynic acid (EA) (24. 99 ± 1. 24 μmol/min/mg), hydrogen peroxide (3. 93 ± 0. 32 μmol/min/mg), 1 -Chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (0. 61 ± 0. 12 μmol/min/mg), 2, 4 -heptadienal (0. 11 ± 0. 03 μmol/min/mg), trans- 2 -octenal (0. 08 ± 0. 02 μmol/min/mg), and hexadienal (0. 04 ± 0. 003 μmol/min/mg) whereas AcGST- 2 was reactive towards EA (15. 87 ± 2. 54 μmol/min/mg), CDNB (0. 54 ± 0. 13 μmol/min/mg), 2, 4 -heptadienal (0. 08 ± 0. 01 μmol/min/mg), and trans- 2 -octenal (0. 09 ± 0. 01 μmol/min/mg). The substrate specificities of both putative GST isozymes were different and therefore suggesting they were of two existing homodimers. For AcGST- 1, the Vmax for EA and GSH were estimated as 3. 74 ± 1. 40 μmol/min and 1. 46 ± 0. 02 μmol/min, Km for EA and GSH were estimated as 0. 28 ± 0. 02 mM and 0. 01 ± 0. 0003 mM. Whereas for AcGST- 2, the Vmax for EA and GSH were estimated as 8. 41 ± 1. 08 μmol/min and 1. 35 ± 0. 01 μmol/min, Km for EA and GSH were estimated as 0. 28 ± 0. 002 mM and 0. 02 ± 0. 003 mM. From thin layer chromatography to determine the reactivity of both putative GST isozymes towards Isoproturon, Fenoxaprop-ethyl, Propoxur and Clodinafop-propargyl, only AcGST- 2 showed conjugation activity towards Isoproturon, a pesticide. Disc diffusion test indicated that <b>Bromophos,</b> Malathione, DDT, Propoxur, Permethin, Chlorpyrifos, Fenitrothion did not affect the propagation of A. calcoaecticus Y 1 but hydrogen peroxide inhibited the propagation of A. calcoaceticus Y 1.
