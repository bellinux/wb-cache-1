5|$|The film {{opens with}} a sexually charged, flirtatious online chat between 14-year-old Hayley Stark and Jeff Kohlver, a 32-year-old photographer. Jeff and Hayley meet at a coffeehouse, and he takes her back to his house. Hayley makes them both {{screwdrivers}} and asks him to take photographs. Before he can, Jeff gets dizzy, his vision <b>blurs,</b> and he {{falls to the floor}} unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer <b>blurs</b> the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} heavy product placement, with American Airlines, Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels all featured prominently. Competing brands {{are displayed}} as <b>blurs</b> in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms in dialogue. However, the brands {{did not pay}} for the exposure; rather, they waived the fees for the producers to shoot on location, such as at AA's airport areas and inside Hilton hotels. Reitman expressed his desire to use actual brands as he finds them less distracting.|$|E
40|$|A new {{restoration}} algorithm for partial <b>blurred</b> image {{which is}} based on <b>blur</b> detection and classification is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new <b>blur</b> detection algorithm is proposed to detect the <b>blurred</b> regions in the partial <b>blurred</b> image. Then, a new <b>blur</b> classification algorithm is proposed to classify the <b>blurred</b> regions. Once the <b>blur</b> class of the <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed, the structure of the <b>blur</b> kernels of the <b>blurred</b> regions is confirmed. Then, the <b>blur</b> kernel estimation methods are adopted to estimate the <b>blur</b> kernels. In the end, the <b>blurred</b> regions are restored using nonblind image deblurring algorithm and replace the <b>blurred</b> regions in the partial <b>blurred</b> image with the restored regions. The simulated experiment shows that the proposed algorithm performs well...|$|R
30|$|The <b>blur</b> metric {{is useful}} for <b>blurred</b> images. For example, JPEG 2000 based on a wavelet {{transform}} may produce <b>blurring</b> artifacts. Several NR <b>blur</b> metrics have been proposed to measure smoothing or smearing effects on sharp edges [9 – 13]. Also, a <b>blur</b> radius estimated using a Gaussian <b>blur</b> kernel has been proposed to measure <b>blurring</b> artifacts [14, 15].|$|R
40|$|One of {{the long-standing}} {{challenges}} in photography is motion <b>blur.</b> <b>Blur</b> artifacts are generated from relative motion between {{a camera and}} a scene during exposure. While <b>blur</b> can be reduced by using a shorter exposure, this comes at an unavoidable trade-off with increased noise. Therefore, it is desirable to remove <b>blur</b> computationally. To remove <b>blur,</b> we need to (i) estimate how the image is <b>blurred</b> (i. e. the <b>blur</b> kernel or the point-spread function) and (ii) restore a natural looking image through deconvolution. <b>Blur</b> kernel estimation is challenging because the algorithm needs to distinguish the correct image– <b>blur</b> pair from incorrect ones that can also adequately explain the <b>blurred</b> image. Deconvolution is also difficult because the algorithm needs to restore high frequency image contents attenuated by <b>blur.</b> In this dissertation, we address a few aspects of these challenges. We introduce an insight that a <b>blur</b> kernel can be estimated by analyzing edges in a <b>blurred</b> photograph. Edge profiles in a <b>blurred</b> image encode projections of the <b>blur</b> kernel, from which we can recover the <b>blur</b> using the inverse Radon transform. This method is computationally attractive and is well suited to images with many edges. <b>Blurred</b> edge profiles can also serv...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour <b>blurs</b> the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which <b>blurs</b> {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blur</b> {{has been}} studied with {{isolated}} contours, but natural scenes are composed of occlusions at a range of depths giving rise to retinal images with broad distributions of <b>blur.</b> We have reported that observers are efficient at integrating wide distributions of <b>blur</b> with limited bias toward sharp or highly <b>blurred</b> elements in naturalistic, but highly controllable dead leaves patterns (Taylor & Bex, 2011 Journal of Vision 11 (15) 13). To extend these findings to natural scenes, we asked observers to match the local perceived <b>blur</b> in a natural image to the perceived <b>blur</b> in a dead leaves stimulus. The dead leaves patches had <b>blurred</b> five different levels of Gaussian <b>blur</b> (? = 2, 4, 8, 16, 64 cy/image) and the observers' traced regions in the natural image whose <b>blur</b> matched that of the dead leaves patch on each trial. We developed a measure of local <b>blur</b> to relate perceived <b>blur</b> in natural images to the Gaussian <b>blur</b> in dead leaves stimuli. We found that our measure in regions traced by observers correlated well with the image <b>blur</b> in the dead leaves patch, indicating that the measure of perceived <b>blur</b> captures how <b>blur</b> is perceived in natural scenes. Further analyses revealed that the skew and kurtosis of <b>blur</b> distributions in traced regions was {{not significantly different from}} a Gaussian distribution, indicating that observers do not rely on overly sharp/blurred regions to judge perceived <b>blur.</b> Thus, the distribution of local image <b>blur,</b> rather than the global image <b>blur</b> or the <b>blur</b> of single items, determines perceived optical and image quality...|$|R
40|$|Motion <b>blur</b> occurs {{due to the}} fact,that during {{exposure}} time there is movement of object or camera or both. Removing of <b>blur</b> is always challenging for image processing field because one has to estimate the motion <b>blur</b> which can spatially differ over image. Motion <b>blur</b> is simply an undesired effect. Restoration of <b>blur</b> image {{is very important in}} many of the cases like identification of criminal face in <b>blurred</b> image. In restoration of motion <b>blur</b> the knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) plays a vital role. This paper present a novel approach towards estimation of parameters like motion <b>blur</b> angle and the motion <b>blur</b> length which defines the PSF. Both of these parameters are used to restore the <b>blurred</b> image. Furthermore paper discusses the comparative study of different restoration techniques. The experimental result shows estimated <b>blur</b> angle and <b>blur</b> length are very close to theoretical value and the <b>blur</b> images with natural and artificial noise are successfully restored...|$|R
40|$|NoThe {{purpose of}} this article is to {{determine}} whether <b>blur</b> adaptation influences <b>blur</b> sensitivity and <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds in young adult myopes and emmetropes. In addition, to determine whether there is a differential effect of <b>blur</b> adaptation on <b>blur</b> sensitivity and discrimination between refractive error groups. Proximal and distal <b>blur</b> sensitivity thresholds and <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds were measured under cycloplegia with a Badal optometer in 24 young adult subjects (8 emmetropes [EMM], 8 early-onset myopes [EOM], and 8 late-onset myopes [LOM]). Adaptation to 1 D of myopic refractive <b>blur</b> was then undertaken for 30 minutes. <b>Blur</b> sensitivity and discrimination thresholds were then remeasured. After <b>blur</b> adaptation, <b>blur</b> sensitivity, and <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds were found to be elevated. <b>Blur</b> adaptation had a significant effect on distal <b>blur</b> sensitivity threshold, with the largest effect being observed in the EOMs. Mean changes in distal <b>blur</b> sensitivity thresholds were EMMs + 0. 03 ± 0. 14 D, EOMs + 0. 30 ± 0. 21 D, and LOMs + 0. 08 ± 0. 13 D. Adaptation to a degraded stimulus modifies the <b>blur</b> detection mechanisms of the visual system in young adults. Depth of focus is expanded by prolonged exposure to defocus.

5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight <b>blurs</b> the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E
5|$|In The Tempest, Shakespeare {{presents}} {{two powerful}} sorcerers, Prospero and Sycorax, who have both controlled the island. Initially {{it appears that}} the two characters are a contrasting pair: the benevolent Prospero and the rapacious Sycorax. However, upon closer analysis, {{the differences between the two}} characters disappear and the similarities grow. For example, Prospero, like Sycorax, coerces Ariel into doing his bidding, using the sprite to regain his inheritance as a Duke, and tortures Caliban with magic the way Sycorax tortured Ariel. Also, both Prospero and Sycorax were exiled from their respective homelands and both have children, which was possibly the reason why they were both spared being executed. The fine line between Sycorax's black magic and Prospero's white <b>blurs</b> even further during his renunciation of magic in Act V, a speech which has strong parallels to one given by the dark witch Medea in the Metamorphoses. In comparing himself to Medea, Prospero is implicitly comparing himself to Sycorax. Emphasizing the relationship between Prospero and Sycorax demonstrates the ambiguity of Prospero's supposedly benevolent character.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Digital {{photos are}} massively {{produced}} while digital cameras are becoming popular, however, not every photo has good quality. <b>Blur</b> {{is one of}} the conventional image quality degradation which is caused by various factors. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect <b>blurred</b> images and classify them into several different categories. The <b>blur</b> detector uses support vector machines to estimate the <b>blur</b> extent of an image. The <b>blurred</b> images are further classified into either locally or globally <b>blurred</b> images. For globally <b>blurred</b> images, we estimate their point spread functions and classify them into camera shake or out of focus images. For locally <b>blurred</b> images, we find the <b>blurred</b> regions using a segmentation method, and the point spread function estimation on the <b>blurred</b> region can sort out the images with depth of field or moving object. The <b>blur</b> detection and classification processes are fully automatic and can help users to filter out <b>blurred</b> images before importing the photos into their digital photo albums. ...|$|R
40|$|Perceived <b>blur</b> is an {{important}} measure of image quality and clinical visual function. The magnitude of image <b>blur</b> varies across space and time under natural viewing conditions owing to changes in pupil size and accommodation. <b>Blur</b> is frequently studied in the laboratory {{with a variety of}} digital filters, without comparing how the choice of filter affects <b>blur</b> perception. We examine the perception of image <b>blur</b> in synthetic images composed of contours whose orientation and curvature spatial properties matched those of natural images but whose <b>blur</b> could be directly controlled. The images were <b>blurred</b> by manipulating the slope of the amplitude spectrum, Gaussian low-pass filtering or filtering with a Sinc function, which, unlike slope or Gaussian filtering, introduces periodic phase reversals similar to those in optically <b>blurred</b> images. For slope-filtered images, <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds for over-sharpened images were extremely high and perceived <b>blur</b> could not be matched with either Gaussian or Sinc filtered images, suggesting that directly manipulating image slope does not simulate the perception of <b>blur.</b> For Gaussian and Sinc <b>blurred</b> images, <b>blur</b> discrimination thresholds were dipper-shaped and were well-fit with a simple variance discrimination model and with a contrast detection threshold model, but the latter required different contrast sensitivity functions for different types of <b>blur.</b> <b>Blur</b> matches between Gaussian and Sinc <b>blurred</b> images were used to test several models of <b>blur</b> perception and were in good agreement with models based on luminance slope, but not with spatial frequency based models. Collectively, these results show that the relative phases of image components, in addition to their relative amplitudes, determines perceived <b>blur...</b>|$|R

25|$|Gaussian {{blurring}} {{is commonly}} used when reducing {{the size of an}} image. When downsampling an image, it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the image prior to resampling. This is to ensure that spurious high-frequency information does not appear in the downsampled image (aliasing). Gaussian <b>blurs</b> have nice properties, such as having no sharp edges, and thus do not introduce ringing into the filtered image.|$|E
40|$|A novel local <b>blur</b> {{estimation}} method {{is presented in}} the paper.
