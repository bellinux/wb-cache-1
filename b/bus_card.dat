50|$|Level C was a {{card cage}} and S-100 <b>bus</b> {{expander}} <b>card.</b> This card would plug {{into one of}} the S-100 bus sockets on the motherboard. You could then plug up to five more S-100 <b>bus</b> <b>cards</b> into the expander card. One of the two original slots on the motherboard was still available for use, giving the Level C Explorer 85 a capacity of six S-100 <b>bus</b> <b>cards.</b> The card cage held all of the cards in place. In 1982 the Level C upgrade sold for $39.95, and $4.85 for each S-100 bus connector.|$|R

The TUVISA <b>bus</b> <b>cards</b> are also valid. The ticket pricing {{is not based on}} zone-based rules, as there's a unique price for the whole network.

40|$|So far, {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to observe travel behavior of people in detail for transportation planning and ITS. One of the promising tools is IC card carried by people. The IC <b>cards</b> as <b>bus</b> tickets (<b>bus</b> smart <b>cards)</b> were introduced in March 2007 in Kanto area in Japan, and the <b>bus</b> smart <b>cards</b> have been in widespread use. The records of the <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data are more than 38 million a month, and can represent the travel behavior of people. In this study, system of the <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data collection in Japan is introduced, and the enormous <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data is visualized for grasping the current transportation situation in the area of interest. In order to establish application of the <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data to transportation planning, plausible analysis methods with the detailed travel behavior of people acquired by the <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data are developed. For utilization of the <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data, a method of converting <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data to travel time and bus trip data is developed. The converted empirical data is applied to origin-destination analysis, and average of bus travel time estimation. By using the average bus travel time, relationship between the travel time and traffic congestion are analyzed. Additionally, an integration method of the <b>bus</b> smart <b>card</b> data with probe data is investigated. The integrated empirical data is applied to traffic monitoring, and extraction of obstructive factor for traffic flow. 1...|$|R

5000|$|WiNRADiO is {{the name}} of a {{manufacturer}} of radio communication equipment as well as a brand name applied to computer-based radio receivers, software, antennas and accessories. WiNRADiO is based in Melbourne, Australia. The name WiNRADiO is in fact just a brand name, or trading name, of the company, whose real name is Radixon Group. This trading name was adopted as a result of market success of the company's first product, the [...] "WinRadio Card". This was an ISA <b>bus</b> <b>card</b> which transformed a Windows-based computer into a wide-coverage communications receiver, making it possible to receive point-to-point communications (ham radio, utilities, police, space research, etc.) on an ordinary PC.|$|E
50|$|For an {{internal}} array controller configuration, the array controller is generally a PCI <b>bus</b> <b>card</b> situated inside the host computer. As {{shown in the}} diagram, the PCI array controller would contain an encryption unit where plaintext data is encrypted into ciphertext. This separate encryption unit is utilized to prevent and minimize performance reduction and maintain data throughput. Furthermore, the Key Management Client will generally be an additional service within the host computer applications where it will authenticate all keys retrieved from the Key Server. A major disadvantage {{to this type of}} implementation would be that encryption components are required to be integrated within each host computer and therefore is redundant on large networks with many host devices.|$|E

50|$|Early ISA bus soundcards were half-duplex, {{meaning they}} couldn't record and play {{digitized}} sound simultaneously, mostly due to inferior card hardware (e.g., DSPs). Later, ISA cards like the SoundBlaster AWE series and Plug-and-play Soundblaster clones eventually became full-duplex and supported simultaneous recording and playback, {{but at the}} expense of using up two IRQ and DMA channels instead of one, making them no different from having two half-duplex sound cards in terms of configuration. Towards the end of the ISA bus' life, ISA soundcards started taking advantage of IRQ sharing, thus reducing the IRQs needed to one, but still needed two DMA channels. Many Conventional PCI <b>bus</b> <b>cards</b> do not have these limitations and are mostly full-duplex. It {{should also be noted that}} many modern PCI <b>bus</b> <b>cards</b> also do not require free DMA channels to operate.|$|R

50|$|Bob Marsh, Lee Felsenstein and Gordon French started {{designing}} the Sol-20 between April and July 1975. The Sol-20 utilized the Intel 8080 8-bit microprocessor chip, running at 2 MHz. A {{major difference between}} the Sol-20 and most other machines of the era was its built-in video driver, which allowed it to be attached to a composite monitor for display. The Sol-20 consisted of a main motherboard (PCB) mounted {{at the bottom of}} the case, and a five slot S-100 <b>bus</b> <b>card</b> cage. The main PCB consisted of the CPU, memory, video display, I/O circuits. Inside the case included power supply, fan, and keyboard. The case was painted 'IBM blue' and the sides of the case were made of solid oiled walnut originally salvaged from a gun stock manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Use of the Bus Rapid Transit System costs one yuan (or, if a Changzhou <b>Bus</b> <b>Card</b> is used, either {{three or}} six jiao {{depending}} on the type of card) and provides access throughout Changzhou. The BRT has the following specifications: separate bus lanes or bus-only roadways, a vast network of routes and corridors, high capacity buses operating both outside and inside these corridors, greater passenger volume as compared to that in mixed traffic lanes (-3000 pphpd), enhanced station environments (not just simple bus shelters), automated pre-boarding fare collection and fare verification, street level boarding and alighting, low emission vehicle technology (Euro III or higher), weather protection on station platforms, centralized system controls, real-time next bus information display, a distinctive marketing identity, high-quality passenger service at bus stations, segregated bike lanes along main corridor(s) as well as station access for disabled persons. The BRT is also located in the following cities: Beijing, Chongqing, Dalian, Guangzhou, Jinan, Hangzhou, Hefei, Kunming, Xiamen, Zhengzhou. and Wulumuqi. A metro network is nevertheless in planning stage.|$|E
50|$|The wind {{controller}} {{part of the}} EWI has a silicone mouthpiece with sensors for {{air pressure}} (volume control) and teeth pressure (vibrato). The EWI keys do not move, but work through electrical capacitance, sensing the positioning of the fingers by body capacitance; this allows for very fast playing. The octave is determined {{by a set of}} rollers operated by the left thumb, and portamento by a touch plate next to the rollers. Pitch bending is handled by two touch plates operated by the right thumb. The EWI {{can also be used to}} control a synthesizer. While earlier EWIs have to be attached to a specific synth module, the EWI4000s model can connect to any synthesizer using a standard MIDI output connector, while the EWI USB has only a USB connector which allows it to connect directly to any computer that has USB ports. The EWI4000s can be connected to a computer either indirectly, through a synthesizer module (connected to a computer) to which it is already connected via MIDI, or directly, by means of a MIDI-to-USB interface box or <b>bus</b> <b>card.</b> Once an EWI is connected to a computer, it can be used to play any software synthesizer that is installed.|$|E
