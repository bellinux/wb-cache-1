5|$|<b>But</b> <b>how,</b> <b>it</b> may be asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance {{that the more}} diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} how all {{peptides}} that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> enters the brain {{is not clear}}. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.|$|E
25|$|Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily {{served as}} {{outposts}} of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy. Venice's close mercantile {{links to the}} Byzantine empire resulted in the architecture of that city and its vicinity being a blend of Byzantine and northern Italian influences, although nothing from the ninth and tenth centuries has survived except for {{the foundations of the}} first St. Mark's Basilica. This building was presumably similar to Justinian's Church of the Holy Apostles based on its layout, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was roofed is unknown. That southern Italy was reconquered and ruled by a Byzantine governor from about 970 to 1071 explains the relatively large number of small and rustic Middle Byzantine-style churches found there, including the Cattolica in Stilo and S. Marco in Rossano. Both are cross-in-square churches with five small domes on drums in a quincunx pattern and date either to the period of Byzantine rule or after. The church architecture of Sicily has fewer examples from the Byzantine period, having been conquered by Muslims in 827, but quincunx churches exist with single domes on tall central drums and either Byzantine pendentives or Islamic squinches. Very little architecture from the Islamic period survives on the island, either.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. The Guardian published three separate reviews. Gareth McLean stated [...] "rare is the returning British drama {{that gets you}} giddy but, back for its seventh series and resolving last year's big cliffhanger, Spooks returns triumphant," [...] adding [...] "it's no secret that Ros is back, Adam is leaving and new boy Lucas North has been rescued from a Russian prison, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all plays out is a delight." [...] Vicky Frost from the media blog Organgrinder felt that although the storyline was decent, [...] "it did seem to be about three different episodes stuffed into one." [...] She also noted the it was generally [...] "ridiculous, but it isn't nearly as ridiculous - or ridiculously bad - as its spin-off [...] was." [...] Leigh Holmwood however, believed [...] "it was good to see the spy drama return for a seventh series with a high octane episode mixing Islamic terrorism and Russian counter espionage, {{even if it did}} overdo the 'for Queen and country' bit." [...] Holmwood also stated he was [...] "tempted to watch the second episode," [...] which was broadcast a day after the first episode on BBC One.|$|E
500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives, and that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to relieve the stress of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E

Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> did not exist in reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.|$|E

2500|$|Realism is {{an attempt}} to create a {{depiction}} of actual life; a novel does not simply rely on what it presents <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> presents it. In this way, a realist narrative acts as framework by which the reader constructs a world using the raw materials of life. Understanding both realism and magical realism within the realm of a narrative mode is key to understanding both terms. Magical realism [...] "relies upon the presentation of real, imagined or magical elements as if they were real. It relies upon realism, but only so that it can stretch what is acceptable as real to its limits".|$|E
2500|$|Antarctic krill is the {{keystone}} {{species of the}} Antarctic ecosystem beyond the coastal shelf, and provides an important food source for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, crabeater seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other species of birds. Crabeater seals have even developed special teeth as an adaptation to catch this abundant food source: its unusual multilobed teeth enable this species to sieve krill from the water. Its dentition looks like a perfect strainer, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> operates in detail is still unknown. Crabeaters are the most abundant seal in the world; 98% of their diet {{is made up of}} [...] E. superba. These seals consume over 63 million tonnes of krill each year. Leopard seals have developed similar teeth (45% krill in diet). All seals consume 63–130 million tonnes, all whales 34–43 million tonnes, birds 15–20 million tonnes, squid 30–100 million tonnes, and fish 10–20 million tonnes, adding up to 152–313 million tonnes of krill consumption each year.|$|E
2500|$|Copeau, in his {{attempts}} to [...] "Naturalise" [...] the actor decided to use mask to liberate them from their [...] "excessive awkwardness". In turn, Copeau's work with masks was taken on by his students including Etienne Decroux and later, via Jean Daste, Jacques Lecoq. Lecoq, having worked as movement director at Teatro Piccalo in Italy, {{was influenced by the}} Commedia tradition. Lecoq met Amleto Satori, a sculptor, and they collaborated on reviving the techniques of making traditional leather Commedia masks. Later, developing Copeau's [...] "noble mask", Lecoq would ask Satori to make him masques neutre (the neutral mask). For Lecoq, masks became an important training tool, the neutral mask being designed to facilitate a state of openness in the student-performers, moving gradually on to character and expressive masks, and finally to [...] "the smallest mask in the world" [...] the clown's red-nose. One highly important feature of Lecoq's use of mask, wasn't so much its visual impact on stage, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> changed the performers movement on stage. It was a body-based approach to mask work, rather than a visually led one. Lecoq's pedagogy has been hugely influential for theatre practitioners in Europe working with mask and has been exported widely across the world. This work with masks also relates to performing with portable structures and puppetry. Students of Lecoq have continued using masks in their work after leaving the school, such as in John Wright's Trestle Theatre.|$|E
