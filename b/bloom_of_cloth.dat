40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to woven-cloth simu-lation in order to generate persistent wrinkles and folds.

Our interpretation of the measurement indicates that persistent wrinkles and folds develop in part from the hyste-resis <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> and its associated energy loss. Thus, we establish an adaptive energy model which takes stiffness coefficients and rest posture values not as constants but as variables over time and behavior. As stiffness coefficients and rest posture values change in proportion to the amount of the energy loss, they appear as persistent wrinkles and folds. Consequently, the clothes simulated by our method bring more realism with respect to visual identi-fication for past behaviors <b>of</b> <b>cloth...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cloth {{animation}} is {{an important}} area of computer graphics due to its numerous applications. However, so far an animation <b>of</b> fast moving <b>cloth</b> with multiple wrinkles {{has been difficult to}} make because <b>of</b> the <b>cloth</b> clump problem. Cloth clumps are the frozen areas where cloth pieces are clustered unnaturally- an obstacle in making a realistic cloth animation. Hence we present a novel cloth collision resolution algorithm which prevents clump formation during fast cloth motions. The goal of our resolution algorithm is to let cloth move swiftly without having any frozen cloth clumps, while preventing any cloth-cloth and rigid-cloth penetrations at any moment of a simulation. The non-penetration status <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> is maintained without the formation <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> clumps regardless <b>of</b> the speed <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> motion.

In this paper, the bounding box technique in addition to ordinary pre-checking for collision detection is used to avoid self-collision. Instead of avoiding self-collision <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> triangles, we relax to avoid the collision of the bounding boxes <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> triangles. Some constraints are enforced on the vertices <b>of</b> the <b>cloth</b> triangles to prevent their bounding boxes from penetrating in the direction of collision. The experimental results show that the relaxed self-collision avoidance method can create realistic cloth behavior and wrinkling formation processes. Since the types of interaction between bounding boxes are simple, our method is simple but robust in avoiding self-collisions. # 199...|$|R
40|$|Objects {{handled by}} robots are {{normally}} rigid objects. There are many soft and flexibleindustrial objects, {{but there are}} few examples of processes in which soft objects are handledonly by robots. Many soft objects are encountered in everyday life; therefore, it is necessaryfor life support robots to effectively and reliably handle these soft objects. Robots in the formof a human, as typified by domestic robots, are being investigated extensively. However, ifthese domestic robots are to become practical, {{they should be able}} to handle soft objects. The purpose of this study is to develop the technology for automatic handling <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> andassociated system by automating the functions of a human hand for handling cloth (separationof the fabric, gripping the fabric, movement, determining position, etc.). This is done bydeveloping a sensing function to observe the nature of the object to be handled and a robotichand to handle cloth. The hand should have a finger structure capable of handling diverse anddelicate soft objects, which can perform key operations such as separation, movement,application, and positioning of one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth.</b> The proposed method for handling cloth was tested, and its effectiveness was checked andevaluated. Further, the conditions for success in the separation of one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> wereconsidered from the experimental and theoretical viewpoints, and a criterion was applied as anempirical rule. Sewing clothing is a typical industry in which cloth is handled as a soft object. This industryis labor intensive, and its survival in Japan is under threat. Therefore, it is essential to automatevarious processes in the industry. Many types of automatic sewing machines have beenproposed, and sewing machine and transport technology is advanced. However, reliablyseparating and picking one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> from a stack <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> and placing it in automaticsewing or pressing machines still relies mostly on manpower. Moreover, there are practicallyno commercial, highly reliable, practical machines for manipulating cloth. If the technologyfor handling cloth with robotic hands can be advanced, it will contribute not only to automaticsewing but also to the development of robotic technology for handling soft objects. In Section 1, the necessity of handling soft objects by robots, the characteristics andproperties <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> as soft objects, issues requiring attention in handling, the objectives of thepresent research, and the structure of this paper are described. In Section 2, handling <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> in the sewing industry, its automation, and the automatedtasks are described. Further, a comparison is made between a robotic hand and a conventionaldevice for picking one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth.</b> In Section 3, the operations of picking and placing cloth performed by a prototype twofingered robotic hand are described. A series of operations are performed by the novel robotichand, and methods for separating one sheet from a stack <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> and placing the picked clothin an arbitrary position, which was difficult with conventional technology, are proposed. Theresults of the tests are described. Tests were conducted to evaluate the proposed methods for measuring the thickness of clothby the robotic hand and for separating one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> from a stack <b>of</b> <b>cloth.</b> The minimumthickness <b>of</b> one sheet that can be separated using the robotic hand was 0. 2 mm. In caseswhere it was not possible to properly grip the cloth, it was possible to improve theperformance of separating one sheet by either repeating the same operation or automaticallychanging the height of the finger inserted into the <b>cloth.</b> A method <b>of</b> separating one sheet ofmeshed fabric cut by a knife was proposed and tested. It was possible to separate woven andknitted fabric, but the reproducibility of separating a sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> with adhesive interliningwas low. A method <b>of</b> placing <b>cloth</b> on a flat surface was proposed, and placement on a horizontalsurface and a 45 ° sloping surface was tested. In the tests for evaluating the placement on the 45 ° sloping surface, the ends <b>of</b> the <b>cloth</b> were placed within a tolerance of 1 mm or less, and itwas possible to limit the amount of slip of the fabric to 3 mm. The tension in the cloth was controlled with the combination of an arm and a hand. It wasconfirmed that by controlling the tension at high frequency by the hand and the coordinationaction of the arm, it was possible to track the fluctuations in the tension in the cloth within thetarget value of tension. The two fingered robotic hand described in Section 3 was specialized for pick and placeoperations; it was difficult to achieve the wide range <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> handling operations that a humanhand is capable of. Therefore in Section 4, a prototype three fingered robotic hand having apalm mechanism resembling the hand of a human is described. The prototype three fingeredrobotic hand has several functions. A 3 -D simulator with a teaching function simulating therobotic hand was constructed, and various finger operations were simulated. These operationswere performed with the actual robotic hand. Further, the task of picking up a sheet of clothwith two fingers, which was similar to that performed by human fingers, was selected. Amethod for separating one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> from a stack <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> was proposed, and theconditions for ease of pick up when separating one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> were investigated. A methodfor forming a crease and holding a sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth,</b> and a method for lifting the sheet of clothwere proposed and implemented, and separation of one sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> was achieved. Investigations on the position from which the sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> must be held to easily form acrease showed that it is desirable to move the edge of the sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> in the direction ofmovement of the finger by half the “bending length” of the sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth.</b> In Section 5, a method <b>of</b> unfolding folded <b>cloth</b> onto a flat surface by sight and touch isdescribed, and the feasibility of achieving this is demonstrated by tests. In Section 1, thenecessity for coordination between visual and tactile sensing was described. As an example ofthis, unfolding <b>of</b> polygonal shaped <b>cloth</b> onto a flat plane was investigated. From the visualinformation, information on the outline of the sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> was obtained and the angle of thefold in the sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth</b> was inferred. Further, the tactile information helps to get a suitablegrip and confirms the direction of the fold. This was the first prototype robotic system thatunfolds a sheet <b>of</b> <b>cloth.</b> In the concluding Section 6, each section is summarized and future tasks are stated. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
