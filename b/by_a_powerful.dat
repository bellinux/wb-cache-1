5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> state or group of interests.|$|E

The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E

5|$|Charles obliged the Kőszegis {{to renounce}} their last fortresses {{along the western}} borders of the kingdom in 1339 or 1340. He divided the large Zólyom County (now in Slovakia), which had been {{dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> local lord, Donch, into three smaller counties in 1340. The following year, Charles also forced Donch to renounce his two fortresses in Zólyom in exchange for one castle in the distant Kraszna County (in present-day Romania). Around the same time, Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia, invaded Sirmium and captured Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in Canada, a 'runway plough', {{assembled}} in Scotland, survives at Eglinton Country Park. It {{was purchased by}} the army in World War II to rip up aerodrome runways and railway lines if an invasion took place as means of causing disruption, making them useless to the occupying forces. It was used at the old Eglinton Estate, which had been commandeered by the army, to provide its army operators with the necessary experience. It was hauled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Foden Trucks tractor, possibly via a pulley and cable system.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, Beckham resumed his legal {{practice}} in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927.

5|$|She {{was soon}} retaken, and re-entered service under Hugh Downman, who {{captured}} {{a number of}} privateers between 1795 and 1799 and fought off an attack by the large French privateer Papillon on 3February 1798. His successor, Jahleel Brenton, fought a number of actions against Spanish forces off Gibraltar. Her last captain, Lord Cochrane, forced the surrender {{of a much larger}} Spanish warship, the Gamo. Speedy was finally captured <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> French squadron in 1801 and donated to the Papal Navy by Napoleon the following year. She spent five years with them under the name San Paolo, but was struck around 1806.|$|E

5|$|The World of Continent {{is a large}} {{land mass}} ruled by three kings in {{constant}} war for control of their world. They each carry an object needed to open the tower's entrance. The World of Ocean consists of various small islands surrounded by water, each connected by small caves. Pirates roam the sea of this world, forbidding travel by ship. The World of Sky contains large land masses suspended in clouds, and is ruled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> dictator from his flying castle. The World of Ruins is a technologically advanced cityscape, reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland by constant monster attacks.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, produced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E

5|$|Aside from a {{tropical}} disturbance in August, the season began later than usual, the fourth consecutive season to do so. At {{the time it}} had the 4th latest start on record for the first named storm. Only about 20% of seasons have their first storm form after the middle of December, and the first named storm of this season, Ando, did not become {{a tropical}} storm until early January. However, January was active with three tropical cyclones, two of which became intense tropical cyclones, due to the active phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). February returned to a period of inactivity, and generally there was minimal convection across the basin due to unusually dry air. This was spread <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and persistent ridge that extended eastward from Madagascar, {{as well as an}} inactive phase of the MJO. Drought conditions occurred on Réunion {{due to the lack of}} rainfall. After three weeks of no tropical cyclones developing worldwide, an event unseen since 1995, the tropics became active again in early April.|$|E
5|$|Built at Frindsbury, near Rochester in Kent, Bellerophon was {{initially}} laid up in ordinary, briefly being commissioned during the Spanish and Russian Armaments. She entered service with the Channel Fleet on {{the outbreak of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, and took part in the Glorious First of June in 1794, the first of several fleet actions of the wars. Bellerophon narrowly escaped being captured by the French in 1795, when her squadron was nearly overrun <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> French fleet, but the bold actions of the squadron's commander, Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, caused the French to retreat. She played a minor role in efforts to intercept a French invasion force bound for Ireland in 1797, and then joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir John Jervis. Detached to reinforce Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson's fleet in 1798, she took part in the decisive defeat of a French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. She then returned to England and went out to the West Indies, where she spent the Peace of Amiens on cruises and convoy escort duty between the Caribbean and North America.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{came to the}} Kingdom of Hungary {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. AndrewIII died on 14January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus Kán, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27November 1308, but his rule remained nominal {{in most parts of}} his kingdom even after he was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27August 1310.|$|E

5|$|Charles counted his regnal {{years from}} this coronation, but Hungary had {{actually}} disintegrated into {{about a dozen}} independent provinces, each ruled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> lord, or oligarch. Among them, Matthew Csák dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary (which now form the western territories of present-day Slovakia), Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands, Ivan Kőszegi ruled Transdanubia, and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania. Most of those lords refused to accept Charles's rule and proposed the crown to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's son and namesake, Wenceslaus, whose bride, Elisabeth, was AndrewIII's only daughter. Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár, the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, put the crown on Wenceslaus's head, although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Force One {{departed}} the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 30 March, {{three days}} after JW 58 had sailed from Loch Ewe in Scotland. Force Two departed separately later that day. The convoy comprised 49 merchant ships escorted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> force of 33 warships, including two escort carriers. German reconnaissance aircraft located JW 58 on 30 March, {{and all of the}} U-boats in the Norwegian Sea were directed to intercept it. The German aircraft did not conduct wider-ranging sorties in search of the convoy's battleship covering force or other Allied ships. A total of 17 U-boats attacked JW 58 between 1 and 3 April without success; none of the Allied ships suffered any damage, and the escorts sank four U-boats and shot down six German aircraft during the convoy's voyage from Scotland to the Soviet Union. JW 58 reached its destination at Kola Bay on 6 April. While several Allied aircraft were lost during the voyage, mostly to flying accidents, all of the ships arrived unscathed.|$|E
5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and Sherry from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with a sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base.
