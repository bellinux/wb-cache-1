500|$|Fan {{reaction}} was largely positive, though certain fans {{complained that the}} game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato {{were aware of the}} changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever [...] "really got through to them". He continued, [...] "Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say, thank you for falling in love with Trigger so much." [...] Tanaka added, [...] "Of course, the fans of the original are very important, but what innovation can come about when you're bound to the past? I believe that gameplay should evolve with the hardware." ...|$|E
500|$|Torres {{made his}} return for Liverpool on 8 November 2008 after coming on as a 72nd-minute {{substitute}} in a 3–0 victory against West Bromwich Albion. He {{said he would}} be interested in returning to former club Atlético eventually, saying, [...] "I don't know if I will retire there, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go back and finish some things that are left to do." [...] He was ruled out of action for two to three weeks following Liverpool's 1–0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League in November, where he picked up a hamstring strain, which was later extended to at least four weeks by specialists. He was named on the shortlist for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in December, and eventually came in third place behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2–0 win over Preston North End, his first in the FA Cup. He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009. Despite having spent {{a year and a half}} at the club, Torres was chosen as number 50 in The Timess list of [...] "The 50 greatest Liverpool players", reinforcing the impact he had made at Liverpool in such a short period of time.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 May 2007, Carter {{presented}} a lecture {{and participated in}} a discussion relating to the book {{in conjunction with the}} Center for the Study of Democracy and Model United Nations, in association with the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, Department of Political Science, at the University of California, Irvine. According to Carter's lecture transcript the former president, in answering a question on whether conflict between pro and anti-Israel student groups obstructs chances of peace, said, [...] "I think an altercation or debate or sometimes even an uncomfortable confrontation on a college campus in America is a good move in the right direction. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see the leaders of those two groups form a combined group that would take advantage of my invitation to go to Palestine and see what’s going on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, of course, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> a sail {{back in a}} pilot-boat," [...] said Scott, and Harry Alden {{agreed with}} him. Tom Myers and his brother George {{wanted to go back}} right away.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2003, the New York Times {{published}} {{a letter from}} the Anti-Defamation League citing Blocher, who had been convicted for anti-Semitic libel by a Zürich court in 1999, for making anti-Semitic remarks in relation to claims for restitution of Nazi-seized assets that were hidden in Swiss banks. Blocher declared that Jews [...] "were only interested in money." [...] The letter also reported that in 1997, Blocher had stated the following that had resulted in his 1999 conviction: [...] "They (the Jews) could blackmail banks, you can blackmail governments, you can blackmail national banks, you can force them to give in. [...] (<b>But)</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see if they can blackmail an entire people at the ballot box. [...] They have to get through the eye of this needle, and I will do my utmost that we do not yield." ...|$|E
2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sorry to hear that. Perhaps {{his opinion}} may change {{when he sees}} the inside of our store. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> him to stay about the fort as a hunter, Moses; he seems a first-rate man. Ask him if he will consent to stay for a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|While the men floated on the lake, casting {{for black}} bass, the women {{prepared}} lunch and yawned.

50|$|Bush: It {{seems to}} me all very good. Chirac knows the reality perfectly. Their {{intelligence}} services have explained it to him.
