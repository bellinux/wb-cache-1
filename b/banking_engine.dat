50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was placed}} in service as a <b>banking</b> <b>engine,</b> working heavy coal trains between Estcourt and Highlands on the Natal mainline. This section was about 28 mi long with a gradient of nearly 1 in 30 (3⅓%) uncompensated throughout, which made it, in effect, equivalent to a gradient of about 1 in 25 (4%).|$|E
50|$|When a train {{formation}} includes two locomotives double-heading the service, they are commonly distinguished {{by the terms}} pilot engine for the leading locomotive, and train engine for the second locomotive. This {{should not be confused}} with the totally different procedure of adding a <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> to the rear of a train to assist up a hill or away from a heavy start.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{the good}} {{operating}} experience with the series 651 more powerful locomotives arose at the MÁVAG in Budapest from 1914 on, which were especially provided for the line from Karlstadt (today: Karlovac, Croatia) to Fiume (today: Rijeka). By utilisation of the permitted axial load of 16,5t a locomotive was developed, which alone could move freighttrains uphill even on the steep line in the croatian karst without a <b>banking</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before radios, engines used {{whistles}} {{to communicate}} with each other which was obviously not possible if the cab was filled with scalding steam and, even more to the point, if the steam whistle is not functional. Thus the crew of the <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> at the rear of Driver Axon's train remained unaware of the problems at the front and unfortunately kept pushing Driver Axon's train towards Dove Holes summit.|$|E
50|$|St. Bedes Junction {{lies between}} Jarrow and Bede Metro {{stations}} {{on what was}} the North Eastern Railway line between Newcastle upon Tyne and South Shields. From the junction, a mineral line descends on a gradient of 1 in 100 to Tyne Dock Bottom. On 17 December 1915, {{in the early morning}} in fog, a goods train ran out onto the main line past St Bedes signalbox having been banked in the rear up the incline by a six-coupled tank engine. The <b>banking</b> <b>engine,</b> uncoupled, dropped away from the goods train and came to a stand on the up main line, but was not seen by the signalman. Shortly afterwards, the signalman accepted the 07:05 passenger train from South Shields to Newcastle on the up line and the 06:58 empty stock train from Hebburn to South Shields. The passenger train collided with the rear of the <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> at 30 mph, telescoping the two leading coaches. Almost immediately the empty stock train collided with the wreckage, killing the fireman. The gas-lit passenger coaches were consumed by fire, killing 18.|$|E

50|$|The four rack {{locomotives}} {{were all}} shedded at Waterval Onder. When working a train up to Waterval Boven, a 32 Tonner would be coupled {{to the rear}} end of a train as <b>banking</b> <b>engine.</b> When working a descending train, the order of assembly was reversed, with the train's locomotive at the rear end and the rack locomotive in front to act as brake. Loads of 120 to 140 lt t could be handled in this manner.|$|E

50|$|The Midland {{shaped the}} {{subsequent}} LMS locomotive policy until 1933. Its locomotives (which it always {{referred to as}} engines) followed a corporate small engine policy, with numerous class 2F, 3F and 4F 0-6-0s for goods work, 2P and 4P 4-4-0s for passenger work, 0-4-4T and 0-6-0T tank engines. The only exceptions to this were its 0-10-0 <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> for Lickey Incline on its Bristol-Birmingham line, and the 7F 2-8-0 goods engines built by the Midland at their Derby locomotive works for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, The Mortehoe {{banks were}} much harsher. Northbound {{there was a}} 3½ mile {{continuous}} climb of 1 in 41, from Heddon Mill Crossing to Mortehoe. While southbound, from Ilfracombe to Mortehoe, the climb was 1 in 36 for 2½ miles, with severe S-curves past Lower Slade making the journey even harder. <b>Banking</b> <b>engines</b> were kept at Braunton and Ilfracombe, to assist when required. Mortehoe station provided a number of sidings for stabling the <b>banking</b> <b>engines</b> after assisting with the climb.|$|R

50|$|In {{countries}} where buffers-and-chain couplers are used, <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> often cannot {{be added to}} the front of the train due to the limited strength of the couplers; In the case of standard UIC couplers and a maximum grade of 28‰ (which is common e.g. for lines through the Alps), the limit is a train weight of 1400 tons; if a train is heavier, <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> have to be added in the middle or to the end of the train in order not to exceed the maximum load for any coupler.|$|R
50|$|The signalman's {{failure to}} notice that the goods train had been banked was {{the primary cause of}} the disaster. But also at fault was the driver of the <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> who stood for 17 minutes before obeying Rule 55 and sending his fireman back to the signalbox, by which time {{it was too late to}} avert the accident. The {{continued}} use of gas-lighting also contributed to the severity of the accident and a circular was sent to all railway companies stressing the importance of replacing gas with electric lighting.|$|E
50|$|During 2003 the DWP {{commenced}} {{the use of}} Post Office {{accounts for}} the payment of benefits, a process fully operational {{at the beginning of}} the financial year in 2005. The accounts are licensed and the electronic benefits transfer <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> are provided by the company JP Morgan Europe. Prior to these services the banking facility were provided by Citibank. As of 2012, the payment system for benefits is being streamlined, and all payments will now be made into bank, building society or Post Office accounts, and the use of Girocheques will be phased out by early 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The tunnel {{was on the}} [...] "Bath Extension" [...] line of the Somerset & Dorset Railway, {{built in}} 1874. The {{extension}} effectively bankrupted the independent company. The extension line was later made double-track northwards from Evercreech Junction to the viaduct at Midford, but the substantial civil engineering works associated with the tunnel and the steep approach into Bath, including the shorter Devonshire Tunnel, caused the northernmost section to remain single-track throughout its working life. Freight trains heading south from Bath were often banked (assisted in rear) by a locomotive that detached itself from the train {{at the entrance to}} Combe Down tunnel, and then returned down the gradient to Bath. This operation was a very rare example of two trains being permitted to run within a single-line section at once, although the train engine carried an electric tablet and the <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> a staff, both of which had to be returned to their appropriate signalling instruments before other trains could be dispatched into the section. Sometimes the <b>banking</b> <b>engine</b> would be conveying additional goods vehicles for Bath Co-op Siding (situated within the single line section), so the bank engine (carrying the bank staff) would shunt the siding on its way back to Bath Junction whilst the main train (with the single-line tablet) would continue on its way to Midford. This unusual method of working operated right up to the closure of the S&D in 1966.|$|E
