The revolutionary advancement of Information and Communication technologies bring the world close together. A pile of information in different formats is just a click away. Which motivate the organizations to get more internet bandwidth to consume and publish the information over exploding cloud of Internet. The standard router redundancy protocol is used to handle <b>backup</b> <b>links</b> however it cannot aggregate them. Whereas the link standard aggregation protocol can aggregate the link but it support only Ethernet technology. In this research paper a concept of Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) is proposed. RLA can aggregate and handle <b>backup</b> <b>links</b> with main links regardless of carrier technology. Furthermore a data forwarding mechanism Odd Load Balancing (OLB) is also proposed for RLA scheme. For the sake of performance evaluation, Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) is compared with Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The simulation result reveals that Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) can cover the bandwidth demand of the network in peak hours by consuming <b>backup</b> <b>links</b> as well which with Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) cannot. It is further noted that Odd Load Balancing (OLB) feature {{can be used to}} save the cost in terms of money per annum. Comment: 8 Pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of a hybrid control plane have already been extensively discussed in the literature. This paper examines to what extent hybrid SDN/OSPF can solve the IP traffic matrix and related monitoring problems, inherent to the IP layer. The problem persists in hybrid networks, as the required SDN byte counters for a complete traffic matrix may not be sufficiently implemented (or even not at all), or the deployed SDN nodes may be too few, or not adequately located in the network. For such cases, we propose to augment the SDN traffic statistics with SNMP-based measurements on IP <b>backup</b> <b>links.</b> We address implementation and network function virtualization aspects of the required hybrid monitoring infrastructure and discuss the timing issues of the measurements based on hands-on experiences in our lab.

50|$|In {{terrestrial}} {{point to}} point microwave systems ranging from 11 GHz to 80 GHz, a parallel <b>backup</b> <b>link</b> can be installed alongside a rain fade prone higher bandwidth connection. In this arrangement, a primary link such as an 80 GHz 1 Gbit/s full duplex microwave bridge may be calculated to have a 99.9% availability rate over the period of one year.

A secondary lower bandwidth link such as a 5.8 GHz based 100 Mbit/s bridge may be installed parallel to the primary link, with routers on both ends controlling automatic failover to the 100 Mbit/s bridge when the primary 1 Gbit/s link is down due to rain fade.

Moreover, no contribution has been made on the backup resource sharing among multiple VNs arriving simultaneously when node survivability is taken into consideration. For example, the 1 -redundant method and the K-redundant method introduced in [31] can realize working and <b>backup</b> <b>link</b> resource sharing when mapping backup nodes and links, although they only apply for a single VN. Meanwhile, the working and <b>backup</b> <b>link</b> resource sharing can be achieved among multiple VNs arriving spontaneously when at most one physical node fails at a certain time.

With the varied survivability concept, only a varied portion of the primary flow is guaranteed to be recovered in failure situations.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the issues}} that {{constrains}} the use of GMPLS protocol in DWDM links is the slow rerouting provided by GMPLS over DWDM networks. The 1 + 1 protection mechanism is an approach to solve it, where a <b>backup</b> <b>link</b> is employed as mirror to provide an immediate fault recovery. However, such solution is costly since a given channel must exclusively be allocated. Intelligent agents can execute the task of monitoring an optical link of a network, and aiming to predict anomalous situations, so that pro-active measures can be taken before faults occur. Thus, this paper presents a set of tools for generating such intelligent agents using Artificial Neural Networks. The use of intelligent agents leads to an algorithm for fault prediction with few computation resources and low complexity. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Pre-congestion {{notification}} (PCN) {{is a new}} packet marking scheme {{based on}} which simple measurement-based admission control (AC) and flow termination (FT) are implemented. FT is useful for traffic management in unexpected events, e. g., when admitted flows lead to overload on a link after rerouting which {{may be due to}} a link or node failure. While AC is a classic flow control function, FT is new and only little understood so far. The limited literature on FT focuses mainly on a single overloaded link. However, when a link or node fails, redirected traffic is likely to cause overload on multiple <b>backup</b> <b>links</b> (bottlenecks) at the same time. As the packet marking probability for flows traversing multiple bottlenecks is larger than for flows traversing only the most severe bottleneck, more traffic is possibly terminated than needed, i. e. overtermination occurs. This paper quantifies potential overtermination in case of multiple bottlenecks for different FT mechanisms which are currently discussed by the IETF. I...|$|R
