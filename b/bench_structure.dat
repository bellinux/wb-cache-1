40|$|Highly stable {{structures}} that are destined for space use {{are vulnerable to}} dimen-sional stability loss due to random vibration loads experienced during launch and ground testing. Small movements at structural interfaces and non-recoverable strains induced in me-tering elements can have negative implications for optical performance on-orbit. Often the dimensional stability aspects of optical <b>bench</b> <b>structures</b> are verified by environ-mental tests on Engineering or Protoflight Model instruments. It is proposed that {{a better understanding of}} vibration-induced structural dimensional stability loss could enable the as-sessment of stability loss through analysis at an early stage. To this end, several tests have been developed at RAL to assess dimensional stability loss in materials and joints in a controlled manner under random vibration. One test has been used to assess Al alloy and CFRP material samples in a 4 -point bending configuration, and anoth-er has been used to assess micron-level slipping at a bolted interface. The aim of these tests was to provide useful material data, and also to assess the feasibility of predicting stability loss caused by random vibration events. It was found that the classical frequency domain random vibration Finite Element Analysis commonly performed to assess safety margins against structural failure on space structures is probably insufficient to predict instability. This is because the results are highly dependent on non-symmetry in the stress response (ie, due to gravity, pre-stress, or non-linear response). However a good correlation with test results was achieved with a time domain FEA model which incorporates nonlinear kinematic hardening rules in the materials...|$|R

40|$|The GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF) is an echelle {{spectrograph}} {{with precision}} radial velocity (PRV) capability {{that will be}} a first light instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). G-CLEF has a PRV precision goal of 40 cm/sec (10 cm/s for multiple measurements) to enable detection of Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zones of sun-like stars. This precision is a primary driver of G-CLEF’s structural design. Extreme stability is necessary to minimize image motions at the CCD detectors. Minute changes in temperature, pressure, and acceleration environments cause structural deformations, inducing image motions which degrade PRV precision. The instrument’s structural design will ensure that the PRV goal is achieved under the environments G-CLEF will be subjected to as installed on the GMT azimuth platform, including: • Millikelvin (0. 001 °K) thermal soaks and gradients • 10 millibar changes in ambient pressure • Changes in acceleration due to instrument tip/tilt and telescope slewing Carbon fiber/cyanate composite was selected for the optical <b>bench</b> <b>structure</b> in order to meet performance goals.

40|$|Low-cost Earth-imaging {{instruments}} typically require {{high performance}} structures {{to ensure that}} critical alignments of optical components are maintained between the assembly phase, and the on-orbit operational phase. There {{are a number of}} threats to structural dimensional stability, including thermal cycling, moisture desorption and launch vibrations. This last area {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The main aim of the research described here is to better understand the effects of random vibration on the dimensional stability of precision structures. The first part of this research considered the degree to which random vibration is a problem - this was assessed by comparing its effects on dimensional stability with those of other typical environmental stressors. This was accomplished by performing a series of environmental tests on an optical breadboard structure, and measuring the dimensional stability throughout. These tests showed that random vibration could indeed pose a significant threat. The second part of the research aimed to better understand the dimensional stability response of specific structural elements - namely materials and bolted joints - to random vibration. This required the development of novel test setups and metrology techniques. Controlled tests were performed in both these structural areas, and a number of useful conclusions were drawn. The final part of the research was to investigate the empirical results using FEA methods. A significant challenge was to develop a modelling technique that is capable of predicting dimensional stability responses to random vibration. In the case of the material tests, the response of the test samples was correctly predicted using FEA with cyclic plasticity properties and parameters identified from static tests. This research has produced a number of relevant findings for spacebased stable optical <b>bench</b> <b>structures.</b> These have been condensed into a series of recommendations for design, analysis, testing, metrology and bedding-in vibration for future optical payload projects...|$|R

The basic construction of the facilities will first be described, setting the scene for the major challenges that 1970 s' thinking posed for decommissioning engineers. The tendency then to use large and heavy items of equipment supported upon massive steel <b>bench</b> <b>structures</b> produced a series of major problems that had to be overcome. The means of solving these problems by utilization of relatively simple and inexpensive equipment will be described. Later, a further set of challenges was experienced to decontaminate the interior surfaces to allow man entries to be undertaken at acceptable dose rates. The paper will describe the types of tooling used and the range of complementary techniques that were employed to steadily reduce the dose rates down to acceptable levels. Some explanations will also be given for the creation of realistic dose budgets and the methods of recording and continuously assessing the progress against these budgets throughout the project. Some final considerations are given to the commercial approaches to be adopted throughout this major project by the decommissioning engineers. Particular emphasis will be given to the selection of equipment and techniques that are effective so that the whole process can be carried out in a cost-effective and timely manner.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{perforated}} bench {{is to reduce the}} air humidity beneath the plant canopy without excessive energy consumption. A bench heating system with heating pipes under a perforated bench with skirts creates an airflow through the bench openings due to buoyancy forces. Because the heated air is relatively dry compared to the surrounding air, it has a moisture absorbing and transporting capacity. The moisture transporting capacity will be decrease, thereby reducing the advantages of the perforated bench, if airflow rate is impeded by the <b>bench</b> <b>structure,</b> plant shape or leaf area index. Thus the airflow rate is of importance for the performance of a perforated bench. In an experimental setup the airflow rate was determined for different perforated bench designs with and without plants. Measurements were carried out with five different plant types on four bench designs. It was found that the airflow rate was effected by the design of the perforated bench, but on the same type of bench the effect of plant type and leaf area index was insignificant.

The instrument will perform imaging spectroscopy of the Galilean System in the visible and near infrared ranges. This work is focused on the design of the optical head of the instrument, a quite critical task considering that the optical bench must support, in addition to the optics, about 5 kg of radiations shielding required because of the tough radiative environment.

In overburden dumps, the availability of water and oxygen is strongly controlled by the physical structure of the dump, as well as the surface climate and geochemical reaction within the dump. In this study, a series of field investigations, physical and geochemical laboratory characterization were conducted in order to evaluate internal physical structure and geochemical characteristics of coal mine overburden dumps.

40|$|Refractive optics in astronomical {{instruments}} are potentially sensitive to temperature gradients and temperature transients. This sensitivity arises from thermally dependent refractive indices, lens spacings, and lens dimensions. We have therefore undertaken a detailed thermal analysis of Binospec, a wide-field optical spectrograph under {{development for the}} converted MMT. Our goals are to predict the temperature gradients that will {{be present in the}} Binospec optics and structure under realistic operating conditions and to determine how design choices affect these gradients. We begin our analysis by deriving thermal time constants for instrument subassemblies. We then generate a low-resolution finite difference model of the entire instrument and high-resolution models of sensitive subassemblies. This approach to thermal analysis is applicable to a variety of other instruments. We use measurements of the ambient temperature in the converted MMT's dome to model Binospec's thermal environment. During moderate conditions we find that the Binospec lens groups develop 0. 14 C axial and radial temperature gradients and that lens groups of different mass develop 0. 5 C temperature differences; these numbers are doubled for the extreme conditions. Internal heat sources do not significantly affect these results; heat flow from the environment dominates. The instrument must be periodically opened to insert new aperture masks, but we find that the resulting temperature gradients and thermal stresses in the optics are small. Image shifts at the detector caused by thermal deflections of the Binospec optical <b>bench</b> <b>structure</b> are approx 0. 1 pixel/hr. We conclude that the proposed Binospec design has acceptable thermal properties, and briefly discuss design changes to further reduce temperature gradients.

40|$|The {{increment}} of bandwidth {{required for}} new services offered to users make necessary {{the use of}} optical fibres in data transmission. Glass optical fibres are widely used in long distance communications, {{and there are many}} devices implemented for using in these networks, but these technologies are sometimes expensive for their used in local loops. Different systems implemented over the established technology are used for increasing local loops bandwidth, but more services are demanded at home. Those applications require more bandwidth than the offered by the usual twisted copper pair. Multimode fibres (both silica and polymer) with larger core diameters and numerical aperture, allows for large tolerance on axial misalignments, which results in cheaper connectors as well as associated equipment, but with a bandwidth penalty with regards to their singlemode counterparts, mainly due to the introduction of modal dispersion. On the other hand, polymer optical fibre (POF) offers several advantages over conventional multimode optical fibre over short distances (ranging from 100 m to 1000 m) such as the even potential lower cost associated with its easiness of installation, splicing and connecting. This {{is due to the fact}} that POF is more flexible and ductile, making it easier to handle. Consequently, POF termination can be realized faster and cheaper than in the case of multimode silica fibre. Therefore, the number of applications that use POF is quickly increasing. POF is being used in video transmission in medical equipment, or in multimedia applications for civil aviation and high range cars, in-home and access networks, wireless LAN backbone or office LAN, and in intrinsic optical sensor networks among others. Even greater channel capacity can be available using a specific type of POF, perfluorinated Graded-Index POF (PF GIPOF), having low attenuation and large bandwidth from 650 nm to 1300 nm. Link lengths for in-building/home scenarios are short (less than 1 km), and thus the loss per unit length is of less importance. Transmission of 10 Gbps data over 100 m and transmission of 1. 25 Gbps Ethernet over 1 km have been experimentally demonstrated with PF GIPOF. On the other hand, combiners and multiplexers are basic elements in POF networks using Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) and there are not that many already developed. It is important to have low losses devices and reconfiguration can be an additional feature in those networks. On the other hand, reconfigurable optical networks in critical applications demand devices able to have different functionalities, including switching. This work has focused in the development of different optical switches for a wide range of optical networks. Different switching technologies are available. Liquid crystals are widely used as displays, but they are also employed in telecommunications. Other common technology used in data routing is integrated optics. In this case, light propagates by means of a waveguide and the modification of its parameters makes possible switching operation. Micro-Electromechanical Mechanisms, MEMs, based in small mobile mirrors that can change the direction of the incident light when required are an important optical switching technology. The objective of the present work is the proposal of several optical switches using different technologies depending on the final application. Some of these structures have been experimentally tested whereas others have been simulated. Most of the presented switches use liquid crystals, having different functionalities and broadband operation range, so allowing wavelength division multiplexing. To these respect it has been developed an optical multiplexer/combiner and an advanced multifunctional optical switch (AMOS), both implemented with Nematic Liquid Crystal technology. It has also been developed a multiplexer/combiner based on Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals. The third kind of switches proposed are micro ring-resonators combined with liquid crystals. Micro ring-resonators consist of a circular waveguide attached to one or two straight waveguides acting like input and output ports. Light that passes through the structure can be filtered according to the ring resonator characteristics: ring length, coupling ratio, losses… The use of liquid crystal makes possible the tuning of the ring resonator filtering properties. The last proposed switch is made of a passive splitter and a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. This kind of devices makes use of integrated optics and interference for switching purposes. The variation of the optical properties influencing the two light beam interference can be done in different ways: thermally, electrically… Finally, an automated optical characterization bench has been implemented in order to make easy the measurements. It is composed by a three axis translation stage with three actuators, several linear translation stages that allows the user to modify the <b>bench</b> <b>structure</b> for adapting it to his experiment, and different machinery for mounting the optics.

40|$|Banded landscapes are {{comprised}} of alternating bands of vegetation and bare ground aligned along the contours in arid and semi-arid regions (50 - 750 mm rainfall), on very gentle and uniform slopes (0. 2 - 2 %), Vegetated bands can be {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the dominant wind, or more frequently of the slope. Under given climatic conditions, slope gradient is the controlling factor of the type of pattern ('spotted', 'broadly' or 'typically' banded). For a given slope gradient, mean annual rainfall determines the contrast between the vegetated and bare phase, as well as the band length and the interband width:band width ratio. A typical transect through such two-phase mosaic includes a dynamic succession of surface crusts which generates a run-off-run-on system. This favours the capture of limited water resources and thus a biomass production greater for banded patterns than spotted patterns or uniformly scattered vegetation. Moreover, vegetated bands act as natural <b>bench</b> <b>structures</b> that greatly limit soil erosion. As suggested by modelling, banded vegetation patterns can equally be derived from nearly bare areas or from dense vegetation patterns. Because banded vegetation patterns have often been considered as a form of degradation of previous continuous vegetation cover, many attempts have been made by foresters to restore this initial cover by reforestation of the bare interbands. However the numerous failures of reforestation of the bare interbands illustrate the key role of these mosaic components in the maintenance of the tiger bush ecosystem. Banded vegetation patterns are more resilient to climate change than to human disturbances. The loss of landscape patchiness due to the clearing of the bands either for fuelwood or for ephemeral cropping induces a rapid decline in soil fertility and water infiltration potential. Long-term monitoring shows that the interband width:band width ratio adapts to rainfall variations that are intrinsic of semi-arid zones. Moreover, climatic changes might also induce a change in the type of patterning, suggesting that banded vegetation pattens are highly self-sustainable. The ecological differences between the pioneer and the decaying edges of the vegetated bands, the temporal/spatial succession of soil crusts, as well as other indices such as the spatial distribution of soil organic matter and termite nests suggest the upslope migration of the bands. Nevertheless field evidence of such a shift remains scarce. Profound lessons can be learnt from the study of banded landscapes in terms of ecosystems functions. When designing water-harvesting systems, or restoring degraded arid and semi-arid land, banded vegetation patterns should be imitated to optimize biomass production and limit land degradation.

40|$|Abstract- The {{advent of}} new Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems {{has made the}} use of AM {{technology}} to expand its domain into many difficult to manufacture sectors. However, with such expansion, there always exists a need for {{better understanding of the}} limitations of these systems. The work in the paper shows an attempt being made to demonstrate the effect of varied temperature on dimensional stability of the <b>Bench</b> Mark (BM) <b>structure</b> fabricated by Scan based Microstereolithography process (SµSL). The BM includes multiple geometric features used to study the intensity of temperature effect with change in size and shape of the structure. The SµSL system will be evaluated for dimensional and geometrical accuracy for change in room temperature. Keywords- Scan based Microstereolithography, Bench Mark...|$|R
50|$|The Ballcourt is on {{the north}} side of the West Plaza. It runs north-south and {{measures}} 18 m long by 4.8 m wide. The sides of the ballcourt measure approximately 4 m high. These side structures supported rectangular stone <b>benches.</b> The west <b>structure</b> has been damaged by a looters' trench and originally had a stairway that climbed the west side. Sculpted blocks of stone were found on the benches of both side structures and once decorated the aprons of the ballcourt. The four surviving blocks bear geometric designs and parts of sculpted figures deity masks. The stucco floor at the south end of the ballcourt was found to be well preserved. The ballcourt has been dated to the Late Classic Period.|$|R
500|$|Structure A-16 {{is located}} on the {{northeast}} side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a rectangular structure measuring , running north-south and facing to the west. The remains of the structure stand [...] high. The western side of the building had been damaged by looters prior to archaeological investigation. The looters' trench measured [...] by [...] deep and cut through the <b>structure's</b> floor, <b>bench</b> and rear wall but did not uncover any burials or offerings. Fallen limestone blocks and slabs reveal that the structure once had a corbel-vaulted chamber. Fragments of stucco were also recovered, they once made up a colourful frieze above the front of the building that included modelled human figures. The stucco still had traces of orange, green and yellow paint. The building was a palace-type structure with perhaps six rooms, three on the west side and three on the east, and it was originally roofed in stone. The interior had an L-shaped <b>bench.</b> The <b>structure</b> was built of finely cut limestone blocks and the walls were coated with stucco painted orange and turquoise. It is believed that the building was part of a Terminal Classic royal palace with architectural features {{similar to those of the}} temple StructureA-3.|$|R
