5|$|To secure phenol for aspirin production, and at {{the same}} time {{indirectly}} aid the German war effort, German agents in the United States orchestrated what became known as the Great Phenol Plot. By 1915, the price of phenol rose to the point that Bayer's aspirin plant was forced to drastically cut production. This was especially problematic because Bayer was instituting a new <b>branding</b> <b>strategy</b> in preparation of the expiry of the aspirin patent in the United States. Thomas Edison, who needed phenol to manufacture phonograph records, was also facing supply problems; in response, he created a phenol factory capable of pumping out twelve tons per day. Edison's excess phenol seemed destined for trinitrophenol production.|$|E

40|$|In the {{increasingly}} competitive service industry, service innovation {{is an important}} driver of a service firm’s success and survival. While service innovation has often been couched {{in the notion of}} new service development, there exists a lack of clarity regarding the extent that a service firm introduces a service innovation to the market through service branding. Achieving superior new service performance is a challenging task for managers, as they need to formulate an appropriate <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> that supports the pursuit of new service development, as well as deploy distinctive operational resources and capabilities to successfully implement <b>brand</b> <b>strategy.</b> Without the proper deployment of resources and capabilities, the translation of <b>brand</b> <b>strategies</b> into the superior new service performance-outcomes can be lost. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} explore the role of <b>brand</b> <b>strategies</b> (i. e. new <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> and <b>brand</b> extension <b>strategy)</b> in the relationships between service innovations, market knowledge, market orientation, branding capability and new service performance. Specifically, this study focuses on the extent that service firms achieve higher new service performance when they deploy an appropriate service innovation (exploratory vs. exploitative service innovation) regarding their <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> type. The current study seeks to offer four important contributions to the current literature. First, it will contribute to the literature by arguing that exploratory and exploitative service innovations are driven by specific market knowledge dimensions (market knowledge depth and breadth), regarding the type of <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> (new <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> vs. <b>brand</b> extension <b>strategy).</b> This study shows that <b>brand</b> <b>strategies</b> moderate the relationship between market knowledge dimensions and service innovations. Second, this study contributes to the literature by arguing that market orientation helps service firms to acquire and develop an appropriate market knowledge dimension regarding their <b>brand</b> <b>strategy.</b> It will show that <b>brand</b> <b>strategies</b> affect the relationship between market orientation and market knowledge depth and breadth. Third, this study contributes to the literature by arguing that users of both <b>brand</b> <b>strategies</b> benefit from applying the branding capability to increase new service performance. Fourth, this study contributes to the literature by arguing that service innovations, specifically exploratory and exploitative service innovations, affect new service performance regarding the <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> type. It shows that <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> moderates the relationship between exploratory and exploitative service innovation and new service performance. In addition, this study contributes more generally to the literature by examining the interaction role of service innovations, market knowledge, market orientation, branding capability and <b>brand</b> <b>strategies</b> in the service context of Australia as a developed economy. Given the growing importance of the service industry in Australia, scant attention has been paid to the role of service branding in the service industry. Therefore, understanding the role of service branding in new service development in the service industry and extending the theory to new context is worthy of investigation. Overall, the findings of this study reveal that service firms using new <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> need greater exploratory service innovation than exploitative service innovation to achieve higher new service performance. In addition, new <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> users need greater market knowledge breadth than market knowledge depth to deploy exploratory service innovation. Furthermore, <b>brand</b> extension <b>strategy</b> users need greater market knowledge depth than market knowledge breadth to deploy exploitative service innovation. The findings of this study are contributing to the service branding literature, providing a fuller understanding of the extent to which service firms formulating new <b>brand</b> <b>strategy</b> or <b>brand</b> extension <b>strategy</b> need to understand and invest in appropriate service innovation, market knowledge dimensions, market orientation and branding capability in order to optimise the implementation of their <b>brand</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

25|$|Branding and {{publicity}} efforts have revolved primarily around flight crew, {{in contrast to}} most other airlines, who tend to emphasise aircraft and services in general. In particular, the promotion of its female flight attendants known as Singapore Girls has been widely successful and is a common feature {{in most of the}} airline's advertisements and publications. This <b>branding</b> <b>strategy</b> aims to build a mythical aura around the Singapore Girl, and portray her as representative of Asian hospitality and grace and the airline's training program for both cabin and technical flight crew complement this objective. This is similar to the tactics that Pan Am used as they also tried to promote their stewardesses as a big attraction to flying on the airline.|$|E

In 1982, law changes allowed Conrail to shed its commuter rail operations {{in order to}} focus on its more profitable freight operations. On January 1, 1983, public operators (including Metro-North Railroad, New Jersey Transit, and SEPTA Regional Rail) took over Conrail commuter rail systems in the Northeast. MDOT began paying Amtrak to run the ex-PRR Washington-Baltimore service. On October 1983, with low patronage and largely duplicated by the MDOT-subsidized service, the Chesapeake was discontinued. In 1984, the SRA renamed its three subsidized lines as MARC (Maryland Rail Commuter) as a <b>branding</b> <b>strategy.</b> Operations remained the same, but public-facing elements like schedules and crew uniforms were consolidated under the new name. MARC soon began calling its three lines the Penn Line, Camden Line, and Brunswick Line.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, most phenol used by American manufacturers was imported from the United Kingdom. It was used to produce, among other things, Thomas Edison's [...] "Diamond Disc" [...] phonograph records (which were not made from shellac like other disc records of the time), the salicylic acid used to make aspirin, and the high explosive trinitrophenol. British phenol was soon being used almost exclusively for making explosives for the war effort, leaving little for export.

Thomas Edison was also facing phenol supply problems; in response, he built a factory near Johnstown, Pennsylvania capable of manufacturing twelve tons of phenol per day.

50|$|Multiproduct <b>branding</b> <b>strategy</b> is when {{a company}} uses one name across all their {{products}} in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding {{is also known as}} corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are Microsoft, Samsung, Apple, and Sony as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name. Other examples of multiproduct <b>branding</b> <b>strategy</b> include Virgin and Church & Dwight. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the Arm & Hammer family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct <b>branding</b> <b>strategy</b> has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct <b>branding</b> <b>strategy</b> makes product line extension possible.|$|E
