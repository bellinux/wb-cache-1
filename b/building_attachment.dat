40|$|In this thesis, I {{examine the}} notion of “betwixt and between,” or rather the concept of how first-generation African {{immigrants}} constantly travel across cultures. More first-generation African immigrants {{are living in the}} Pittsburgh community than ever before. In this emerging diaspora community, we are able see their cross-cultural flows between their homeland and hostland cultures. I argue that being betwixt and between allows the first-generation immigrant to flow amid materials, habits, and languages to find belonging and attachment. The flow between cultures is transnational – it is an exchange of space and materials, images, ideas and values that moves across nation-state boundaries. The flow of betwixt and between is set in motion by the search for social capital, which allows the first-generation immigrant to simultaneously hold on to the old – the ways of the home country – while <b>building</b> <b>attachment</b> to the new – the host country. My work is qualitative and ethnographic, using in-depth interviews and observations and is drawn from a sample of six nationalities, both genders, and diverse educational and socio-economic backgrounds that create the quilt of immigrant African society in Pittsburgh. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{to study the}} {{feasibility}} of using river water from Gavleån in the cooling system of University of Gävle. The project is proposed by the campus service manager Akademiska Hus AB which intended to replace the current cooling production system with the water cooling system to reduce the electricity cost in cooling production. The river by direct distance is 600 meters from the university, the river water is to be extracted from the river via a pump house, flow through pipeline buried underground and delivered to the equipment house of Akademiska Hus.   Most water source cooling prefer water body with decent depth which contain low temperature water to use as free cooling source, but the issue that limits the practice is, the decent depth {{is not a very}} common feature of most water body near or within urban area. Like Gavleån which has an average depth of not over five meters while the sufficient depth is over 50 meters for the least or 70 meters to 100 meters often. So study the potential of using rather high temperature water from shallow water body can be of high interest for most cooling consumers.   The thesis progressed through the work in five parts. To introduce cooling in general starting with literature review, the concept, the mechanism, the device for end use and production, the demand of cooling and the reason behind it. Followed by case studies of water source cooling projects worldwide, which is mostly deep water source cooling, and another case of the local hospital cooling system that extract water from Gavleån, demonstrate the use of shallow water body in assisting cooling production, it gives some insights how the potential if similar system is to be implemented in the campus, which is mounted on the same river. Several tours to the hospital were taken to acquire data and understanding of the system.   Then the water temperature measurement from Gavleån in 2014 summer is presented. The measurement was carried out at a small dock by the river side during July to September of 2014. The measurements show the temperature of river water has been increasing which limits free cooling throughout the year, additional refrigerator is required to produce chilled water. The river water, in the hot seasons is used as cooler for the refrigerator and in cold season can be used for free cooling directly. Simulation of IDA-ICE gives the cooling demand of modelled building blocks, the output of cooling production season (consistent with the hot seasons) matches the cooling consumption data from Akademiska Hus by an error of 1 % (414743 kWh of simulated result to 415270 kWh in documentation of Akademiska Hus).   To meet the demand of cooling and select more cost-effective refrigerator type, consumption and COP (COP: Coefficient of Performance) are calculated for compressor chiller and absorption chiller with basic cooling cycle for both. The results shown compressor chiller has much better performance but also higher consumption in electricity, while absorption chiller has rather low COP value in comparison but the need of energy input is much less given by its major consumption of energy is heat from hot water, already a purchased item by the university from district heating network. Cost-effectiveness wise speaking absorption chiller is a more optional choice. Reasonable values of assumption are largely employed in the calculation to select the better candidate and bring certain errors, which is then exam in sensitivity analysis to weigh the alternative parameter and the outcome from it.   The last part is to estimate the cost of chillers and pipeline, for the concern of minimizing errors due to uncertainty the operation cost, labor cost and future energy price are not included. As the calculation turns out the payback year of the new system can range from 7 to 12 years by different refrigerator setup and pipeline routine design, which is considered within the life time of the chiller and pipeline, also lower than the current cooling cost of the university and therefore concluded as promising investment.   Discussion and conclusion exam and finalize the whole thesis work. For the uncertainties of the calculation, the lack of information and data, which are improvements, can be done in future work. Also the improvements in other perspectives noted in terms of better load management for the cooling production units so the cost of equipment can be reduced, changes in <b>building</b> <b>attachment</b> and cooling device to reduce the demand of cooling, etc. But mostly draw the conclusion that with proper system configuration shallow water body can be helpful in reducing cooling consumption, and be a promising option for cities that have access to such water body. ...|$|E

The framework was tested in a study investigating consumer coping responses to marketing relationship transgressions. Secure consumer attachment increases the likelihood of utilizing constructive (voice, loyalty) and decrease the likelihood of utilizing destructive coping strategies (exit, neglect). Study results also support that the effects of consumer attachment on coping strategies are mediated by attributional and emotional response patterns triggered by transgression experiences. Securely attached consumers tended to construe transgression experiences in ways that minimized their negative impact and limited their importance for broader issues of relationship stability...|$|R

Although sensitive responsiveness in every day interaction {{is an essential part}} of <b>building</b> the <b>attachment</b> relationship, the way parents respond to infants during times when they are distressed may represent an especially important part of attachment development. Parents??? adult attachment state of mind is the strongest predictor of attachment in mother-child dyads (van Ijzendoorn, 1995). In the current study, a group of mothers from a high-risk sample were evaluated for sensitivity to distress using a 5 -point scale during two stressful events, including the Strange Situation (Ainsworth, 1978) and a child finger prick episode. The results of this study showed that caregivers with autonomous states of mind were more sensitive than non-autonomous mothers during the finger prick, but were not significantly different from non-autonomous mothers in sensitivity during the Strange Situation. This finding is important because it suggests that maternal responsiveness and sensitivity are related to adult attachment state of mind, such that mothers with autonomous state of mind are more sensitive than nonautonomous mothers during situations in which their children are experiencing pain.

This study seeks to explain conditions that support place identity and place dependence development in Tanzania. The study proposes a testable destination choice model of international visitors to Tanzania. Design/Methodology/Approach – The proposed order of the model is that perceived constraints and satisfaction depend on expectation and travel motivation and that these two may further predict place identity and place dependence. These measures capture our research questions. Visiting tourists to Tanzania were confronted at airport. During August and September of 2010, 700 filled questionnaires were gathered and 504 was usable for further analysis. Final questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS and SEM (AMOS).

40|$|Even though {{advertisements}} {{represent a}} world of its own, they are an inevitable part {{of different kinds of}} media. The purpose of advertising is not only to promote a product but also to transfer messages, values and ideas in order to make emotional connections with brands. By <b>building</b> emotional <b>attachment,</b> advertisers increase and strengthen consumers’ responses. The promoting of the advertisements’ images becomes much more important than promoting the product itself. Nowadays, an increasing interest in representing a human body along with different kinds of products and services has become a commonplace among advertisers. Representation of the body is a socially constructed phenomenon. In other words, social processes shape perceptions of our bodies and these perceptions (re) create human experiences of the body. The authors’ approach includes qualitative discourse analysis of advertisements. The objective was to identify the relationship between the human body and textual messages as integral components of the advertised item taken in consideration, as well as {{the ways in which they}} interact with the reader’s overall experience. For this purpose, different advertisements that contain visual and textual messages representing human bodies have been analysed. They were all published in the following lifestyle magazines: Cosmopolitan, Playboy, Men’s Health, during 2012 and 2013.

40|$|Extant {{research}} has promoted {{the importance and}} seeking to establish {{a deeper understanding of}} brand loyalty. However, it still remains elusive and uncertain. A study with more than 1, 500 CEOs worldwide believes that creating a bond with consumers and continuing to learn how to strengthen the bond are essential for realizing strategies and delivering on shareholder expectations. Not surprisingly, firms and researchers are seeking ways to build a stronger connection with consumers, because such attachment acts as a key requisite in a firm’s success. Consequently, understanding how marketers can intensify the attachment is important.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} the Self-Brand Connections (SBC) construct is that when brand associations are used to con-struct one’s self or to communicate one’s self to others, a strong connection is formed between the brand and the consumer’s self identity (Escalas, 2004). In a similar manner, brand resonance suggests a profound consumer brand relationship {{that is based on}} loyalty, attachment, and an enduring sense of communal kinship or affiliation. This relationship is so strong that members of that brand community are willing to make investments of their personal resources to remain connected to the brand (Keller 2001). First, it is predicted that brand resonance should be signifi-cantly related to Self-Brand Connections and that respondents should respond in a similar manner to both constructs. Second, as a test of the SBC construct, it is expected that consumer fans who identify with a specific in-group organization (the home team) will report significantly higher SBCs and stronger brand resonance scores than those who support the out-group or rival team. Third, no gender differences are expected to occur in response to a gender neutral brand like college football. More specifically, females will resonate and connect with a brand only when that brand is perceived as gender relevant. Fourth, brand resonance and self-brand connec-tions are especially capable of <b>building</b> deep <b>attachments</b> and evoking strong emotions (Keller 2003; Escalas 1996). Emotions are known to influence consumer attitudes (Edell and Burke 1987). Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the effects that self-brand connections and brand resonance may have on attitudes will be mediated by the emotions that consumers express...|$|R

The {{relationship between the}} brand and the consumer {{is one of the}} key dimensions of customer-based brand equity, and brand personality provides substance to that relationship. A problem is how best to position the personality of the brand in order to leverage consumer relationships with the brand. Although a substantial amount of research has examined the constructs of brand personality, there is limited research that examines how the broad spectrum of brand personality traits impact consumer relationships with the brand. This research examined the impact of brand personality on consumer relationships by studying four brands that brought a broad spectrum of personality traits. The author aimed to determine the relationship between brand personality, trust, attachment, commitment to the brand and intent to purchase. The questionnaire was developed using construct scales from previous researchers, and the constructs were validated for reliability and validity.

In this work we draw ideas from machine learning and natural language processing to introduce intelligent email and define it as intelligent systems for supporting email interfaces. Our interfaces are information driven, enabling users to make faster, smarter and less error prone decisions in processing email. ^ We develop intelligent email in several stages. First, we examine the common problem of the forgotten <b>attachment</b> by <b>building</b> an <b>attachment</b> prediction system, which can support different user interfaces for this problem. Next, we explore the task of email triage, the process of managing large amounts of email. We propose a reply management system supported by a reply predictor, automatically labeling messages that need a reply. To enable cross-user learning, we develop a shared set of deictic features with user specific extraction based on social network analysis of email. We then explore new representations for message content based on latent concept models. Next, we develop a system for email activity classification to support email activity management interfaces. Finally, we extend the popular tool of faceted browsing to email by developing automatic facet rankers to select the most useful facets for display to the user. A large scale evaluation and user survey demonstrates the effectiveness of intelligent email applications in real world settings. ^ We also consider new learning methods useful for intelligent email: Confidence-Weighted (CW) learning. CW learning is a family of online learning algorithms where online updates are confidence sensitive, favoring larger updates to rarer features. Incorporating language sensitivities improves performance {{on a number of}} NLP applications, including important learning settings for intelligent email. We consider how to scale learning in the Email setting to very large data environments through parallel training. To reduce the cost labeling email by users, we consider active learning.
