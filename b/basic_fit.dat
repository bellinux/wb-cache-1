40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} {{approximation}} behavior {{of some of}} the best-known polynomial-time approximation algorithms for bin-packing under an approxima-tion criterion, called differential ratio, informally the ratio (n − λ(I)) /(n − β(I)), where n is the size of the input list, λ(I) is the size of the solution provided by an approximation algorithm and β(I) is the size of the optimal one. This measure has originally been introduced by Ausiello, D’Atri and Protasi and more recently revisited, in a more systematic way, by the first and the third authors of the present paper. Under the differential ratio, bin-packing has a natural formulation as the problem of maximizing the number of unused bins. We first show that two <b>basic</b> <b>fit</b> bin-packing algorithms, the first-fit and the best-fit, admit differential approxi-mation ratios 1 / 2. Next, we show that slightly improved versions of them achieve ratios 2 / 3. Refining our analysis we show that the famous first-fit-decreasing and best-fit decreasing algorithms achieve differential approximation ratio 3 / 4. Finally, we show that first-fit-decreasing achieves asymptotic differential approximation ra-tio 7 / 9. ...|$|E

Eighty-one blood {{samples were collected}} during routine clinic visits for the measurement of plasma zalcitabine concentrations by radioimmunoassay (1. 84 ± 1. 24 samples/patient; range, 1 to 6 samples/patient). These data, along with dosing information, age (38. 6 ± 7. 13 years), sex, weight (79. 1 ± 15. 0 kg), and estimated creatinine clearance (89. 1 ± 21. 5 ml/min), were entered into NONMEM to obtain population estimates for zalcitabine pharmacokinetic parameters (4). The standard curve of the radioimmunoassay ranged from 0. 5 to 50. 0 ng/ml. The observed concentrations of zalcitabine in plasma ranged from 2. 01 to 8. 57 ng/ml following the administration of doses of either 0. 375 or 0. 75 mg. A one-compartment model best fit the data. The addition of patient covariates did not improve the <b>basic</b> <b>fit</b> of the model to the data. Oral clearance {{was determined to be}} 14. 8 liters/h (0. 19 liter/h/kg; coefficient of variation [CV] = 23. 8 %), while the volume of distribution was estimated to be 87. 6 liters (1. 18 liters/kg; CV = 54. 0 %). We were also able to obtain individual estimates of oral clearance (range, 8. 05 to 19. 8 liters/h; 0. 11 to 0. 30 liter/h/kg) and volume of distribution (range, 49. 2 to 161 liters; 0. 43 to 1. 92 liters/kg) of zalcitabine in these patients with the POSTHOC option in NONMEM. Our value for oral clearance agrees well with other estimates of oral clearance from traditional pharmacokinetic studies of zalcitabine and suggests that population methods may be a reasonable alternative to these traditional approaches for obtaining information on the disposition of zalcitabine...|$|E

In agreement with Tully & Verheijen, we find that the distribution of near-infrared disk central surface brightnesses is bimodal with an F-test confidence of 80 %. There is also strong evidence for a local minimum in the luminosity function at M_K' ~ - 22.

40|$|A set of robust biomass {{equations}} {{was developed}} for European beech (Fagus sylvatica), using a large database made of trees from three different European countries. Models were calibrated on the French control dataset, including {{a broad range of}} tree size, age and geographical conditions. Their independent validation on Belgian, German unfertilized, German and French fertilized stands gave very promising unbiased results for all of the main tree compartments. The <b>basic</b> <b>fitted</b> allometric equation (biomass = beta x (d(2) h) (gamma)) allowed us to work with biologically meaningful parameters, where beta encompasses both the form of the tree and the wood density, and gamma is the allometric exponent that indicates the proportionality between the biomass and volume relative increments. The allometric parameters were found to vary with stand age (decreasing for the crown and increasing for the bole), and introducing these parameters to the equations significantly improved the performance of all aboveground biomass equations. This age effect was related to changes in both stem form and wood density for the trunk and to changes in hydraulic conductance for the crown. We argue that introducing stand age into the predictive parameters is the key for the accuracy of our equations. Management options and stand fertility stand for the low residual variations around this relationship. To confirm this result, we were able to homogenize most of the published biomass equations by accounting for the stand age given in each original paper. We noticed that our results were consistent with and matched the patterns that were observed for Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus). This could mean that species with similar wood properties and crown architecture may exhibit similar biomass equation structures...|$|R

40|$|This article calls {{attention}} to the basics m ethnographic fieldwork and points out how they fit together to form the ethnographic method in sociology. The various requirements that must be met to achieve {{reliability and validity of}} fieldwork data are discussed. They include adequate and appropriate sampling procedures, systematic techniques for gath-ering and analyzing data, validation of data, avoidance of observer bias, and documen-tation of findings. The article shows the novice and reminds the experienced field-worker that the ethnographic method is a singularly dynamic and fruitful way of studying the human scene, offering, as it does, unique investigative, substantive, and theoretical contributions to social research. Several versions of this article have been written since the early 1970 s to try to explain ethnographic reports to sponsors of environmental impact assessment projects and to social and other scientists involved in these projects who found it difficult to understand qualitative social research and even more difficult to accept it as scientific. In recent years, as more and more sociologists and their students have become comfortable with the idea of ethnography and with its procedures and findings, the original purpose of this article to serve as a largely project-specific, defensive primer on ethnog-raphy has changed. Now that ethnography has found a place in the disci-pline’s methodological comfort zone, it is time for this article to take this change into account. 1 Accordingly, the present version continues to be a primer, but it is now addressed to all who have occasion to read about and/or use ethnography’s tools.

40|$|The main {{question}} {{addressed in this}} thesis is what happens between {{the moment when the}} sperm enters the egg and the fusion of the male and the female pronuclei. Orientation of the apposing pronuclei most likely plays a decisive role in the polarity of the developing embryo. The migration and the dependence between the pronuclei have been investigated through three different measures of correlation. It was concluded that a measure based on the projection of the movement onto the axis between the pronuclei’s centres was preferred. Two mathematical models that describe the pronuclei dynamics have been constructed in the form of stochastic differential equations. The models concern pronuclei migration {{from the time of the}} sperm entry to the fusion and spatial orientation of this fusion. First, a basic model was created. This was then developed into a refined model. The methodology consists of using stacks of confocal microscopy time-lapse images of the pronuclei migration together with statistical methods to identify realistic parameters in the models. Given different angles between the sperm entry and the position of the second polar body, the final models are then used to produce distributions of orientations of the meeting positions between the pronuclei. However, the main result is the suggested models themselves which describe the main features of the migration. The <b>basic</b> <b>fitted</b> model is based on two forces of attraction. Migration is directed towards the centre but also towards the other pronucleus. Parameter values corresponding to the size of these forces are estimated from data of both eggs treated with a microtubule inhibitor and untreated eggs. The refined model is also based on centring and attraction to the other pronucleus, but the centring is modelled into two mechanisms of pushing and pulling of the microtubule exerted forces. Simulated distributions from the models could for instance be used as initial value distributions for future models of egg cleavage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: When fitting a {{generalized}} liner model (GLM) to a development triangle {{is discussed in}} the existing actuarial literature, reference is usually made to statistical packages for accomplishing this task. This paper presents a practical discussion of how to use Visual <b>Basic</b> to <b>fit</b> a GLM to a triangle with special emphasis {{on how to deal}} with incomplete data. Interested readers can contact the author to request a copy of an MS Excel application that implements the algorithms discussed in this paper. The application of GLMs to incomplete development triangles is motivated by translating judgments of practicing actuaries (e. g., use last n diagonals) into a rigorous regression framework. The key original contribution of this paper is the discussion of how graph theory can be used to analyze the topology of an arbitrary selection of triangle cells, and how to use the information gained to set up a regression model that is suitable for projecting future development. Once properly specified, fitting a GLM using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is straight forward, and we describe how this can be accomplished from a practical point of view in Visual Basic. To round off our discussion of model fitting, we briefly describe the standardization of residuals, and how to plot them for graphically evaluating goodness of fit. Finally we briefly discuss how the described class of GLMs for development triangles compares to some other stochastic models proposed in the actuarial literature...|$|R
