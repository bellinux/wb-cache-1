5|$|It is {{probable}} that the sarcophagus was installed on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains to say a daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> the tomb.|$|E

5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural styles date to {{the last}} period of the site's occupation in the Late Classic.

5|$|Epiacum is in {{some ways}} a typical Roman fort: inside the wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E

50|$|Because of block scheduling, most of {{the classes}} only take a half of a year to complete. Full credit classes will be a full <b>block</b> <b>for</b> a half of a year, and a half credit class will be a period for a half of a year. Some {{exceptions}} to this rule are the AP Sciences, which both run a full <b>block</b> <b>for</b> the entire year, Band and Chorus, which run a half a <b>block</b> <b>for</b> the entire year, and Edge classes, which also run a half a <b>block</b> <b>for</b> the entire year.|$|R

5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Marc Isambard Brunel {{established}} the world's first mass production line at Portsmouth Block Mills making pulley <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> rigging on the navy's ships. The first machines were installed in January 1803 {{and the final}} set for large blocks in March 1805. In 1808, the mills produced 130,000 blocks. By {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the town had the largest industrial site in the world with a workforce of 8000 and an annual budget of £570,000.|$|E
5|$|N'Diaye {{finished}} the 2013–14 season with averages of 7.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 0.2 assists, 3.1 blocks, and 1.7 turnovers per game. Following the year, he was labeled a future top prospect by Kevin Pelton of ESPN.com, strongly {{due to his}} performance against Washington, in which he broke the school record for <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> a single game. UC Irvine lost 58-64 {{in the first round}} of the 2014 National Invitation Tournament against SMU. They fell to Cal Poly in the 2014 Big West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament shortly before.|$|E

5|$|The Tales {{series is}} {{classified}} as a role-playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS for short). Considered {{as one of the}} mainstays and building <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> every main entry in the series, it undergoes multiple incremental changes and alterations from one installment to the next. Introduced in Phantasia, it is a real-time fighting system similar to a brawler, as opposed to the majority of RPGs at the time of Phantasias release, which primarily used turn-based battle systems.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Bewick (c. 11 August 1753 – 8 November 1828) was an English {{engraver}} {{and natural}} history author. Early {{in his career}} he took {{on all kinds of}} work such as engraving cutlery, making the wood <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> advertisements, and illustrating children's books. He gradually turned to illustrating, writing and publishing his own books, gaining an adult audience for the fine illustrations in A History of Quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which {{was a source of}} tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the Hellenic Navy on 19 October 1916 (see Noemvriana and National Schism). Kilkis was reduced to a skeleton crew and had the breech <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed. Ultimately, a pro-Entente government replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. Kilkis, however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies, and instead was used solely for harbor defense {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was filmed}} at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on {{location}} in Shanghai and Spain. The filmmakers searched across Asia {{in an attempt to}} find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some old enough to remember the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of the {{continuous}} park blocks {{was not without}} dispute, however. After Lownsdale died without a will, and then his wife Nancy died, his estate challenged that his plat didn't require the central section to be dedicated to public use since Nancy had not signed over legal title to the land. The courts agreed in 1865. Benjamin Stark reneged on the donation of two north central park blocks to the city, instead offering to sell them for $138,000. Captain John H. Couch deeded his section, which became the North Park Blocks to the city on January 25, 1865, only ten days after receiving the federal patent for the land. Six of the South Park Blocks were lost to private parties in the 1870s, and elected city officials were unwilling to spend the asking price of $6,000 per block to purchase them so soon after the city had bought the land for Washington Park. Only a year later, a proposal to acquire the six <b>blocks</b> <b>for</b> $92,000 was brought by the city council, showing the increase in prices in that year.|$|E
