5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily.

Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E

(Chocolate Synthesizer era) by David Katznelson, then A&R VP of Warner Bros.

He landed on North Island near Georgetown, South Carolina, on 13 June 1777.|$|E
5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the <b>boredom</b> and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt {{him when he was}} working, and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E

5|$|We {{all feel}} as {{sensitive}} to satisfaction at times. We can look outside us and {{see nothing but}} destruction, avarice, and <b>boredom.</b> So we look to find that love where we can find it. Some people look to Hollywood, some people look to Blackpool and {{the bright lights of}} Blackpool. That's probably where I would look.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France.

Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. <b>Boredom</b> among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of <b>boredom</b> at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, {{at the age}} of 26, Chatwin was {{promoted}} to a director of Sotheby's, a position to which he had aspired. To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board. This disappointment, along with <b>boredom</b> and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby's, including the sale of objects from the Pitt-Rivers museum collection, led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby's post in June 1966.|$|E

His sister's name is Candace Flynn, who tries to reveal their outrageous creations, but to no avail.

5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of <b>boredom</b> or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
