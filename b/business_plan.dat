40|$|A {{great amount}} of {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} establish a relationship between <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and perceived SMEs performance. However, a number of these studies have been conducted only on large enterprises in Western and developed Asian countries. But in recent times, many articles in academic publications as well as practitioner-oriented journals have appreciated the impact of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> in SMEs performance. However, literature shows that little empirical work has been done {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and organizational performance among SMEs in African developing countries. To fill this research gap, this study is an attempt to assess the relationship between <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and performance having taken a sample of owners of tourism and hospitality SMEs in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. The study was also designed to identify factors that hinder <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> efforts among SMEs. Lastly, it was further designed to propose <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> related strategies that need to be adopted in order to enhance SMEs performance. The study revealed that there exist a positive and significant relationship between <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and performance of SMEs. Inadequate <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> knowledge and skill in SMEs, poor record keeping, personal and non-economical motivations pursued by owners of SMEs, lack of employees' participation in <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> process, size of the enterprise, inadequate <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> experts and higher consultancy fees charged by a few available business consultants were found to be factors that hinder <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> in SMEs. finally, findings also indicated that training in <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and proper record keeping were the best strategies that needed to be adopted in order to encourage <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> practice in SMEs to enhance performance. The study argued that SMEs should be encouraged in order to encourage employees and business consultants to participate in planning process as a strategy to improve business performance. Furthermore, the findings indicated that owners of SMEs should be sensitized on costs and dangers of operating <b>businesses</b> without proper <b>planning.</b> They should also be sensitized on benefits of operating <b>businesses</b> with proper <b>planning</b> because it enhances performance...|$|R

40|$|Problem: The {{development}} of new ventures has been an issue of keen interest to the society. This {{is due to the}} fact that it enhances the socio-economic {{development of}} the society by creating jobs and also filling the gaps in the market. However, it is of interest to note that most people do not follow a <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> process when they are starting up a new venture. This may be due to the fact that they do not have any knowledge in a <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> process at the period of business initiation. Purpose: The aim of this thesis is to give an individual or an organization a clear direction of a <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> process in a new venture development. Method: A qualitative research method with a deductive approach was used to conduct this research. A primary and secondary data was collected from 4 organizations and were used to find out the possible steps of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> process. Frame of Reference: The theoretical spheres that were utilized in this thesis consisted of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> process from authors that had a sequential approach to <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> for a new venture development.

40|$|In recent years, {{the value}} of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> for new <b>business</b> ventures and small firms {{has been the subject}} of debate amongst {{entrepreneurship}} researchers (Brinckmann et al 2010 : 24). Drawing on institutional theory, a number of writers suggest that <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> is primarily used to confer symbolic legitimacy on businesses seeking investment and engagement from external stakeholders (Karlsson & Honig 2009; Zimmerman & Zeitz 2002; Delmar & Shane 2004). In this sense, <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> may not have any significant effects on firm learning, but may be used as evidence of good business operations in order to attract external resources. Meta-evaluation of the available empirical literature contests this proposition, finding that both the symbolic and organisational learning effects of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> influence small firm performance (Brinckmann et al 2010 : 36) While social enterprise - which we define as organisations that exist for a public or community benefit and trade to fulfill their mission - the study of social enterprise is a nascent and pre-paradigmatic area of inquiry (Nicholls 2010). As a consequence, there has been relatively little empirical analysis of the nature or effects of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> amongst social enterprises (for two exceptions, see exploratory studies by Hynes 2009 and Bull & Crompton 2006). In this paper, we examine <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> practices amongst Australian social enterprises. Drawing on a survey of 365 social enterprises conducted in 2010 and in-depth interviews with 11 social entrepreneurs and managers from eight social enterprises, we find that social enterprises report being more actively engaged in <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> activities than their mainstream business counterparts. Our exploratory research suggests that both legitimacy and learning drive <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> amongst social enterprises, although legitimacy is the stronger driver. Our results also suggest that, as multi-stakeholder businesses led by mission, <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> can serve unique communicative and relational functions for this business type...|$|R

5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003.

Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable <b>business</b> <b>plan.</b> During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E

There, Ells observed {{the popularity of the}} taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he learned in San Francisco and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue, near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father. Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and <b>business</b> <b>plan,</b> raising an additional $1.8 million for the company. Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E

5|$|That {{game was}} Computer Space, {{developed}} by Bushnell and Ted Dabney. They {{had found the}} Data General Nova, a US$4,000 computer that they thought would be powerful enough to run four games of Spacewar at once; the computer turned out to not actually be powerful enough for the project. While investigating the concept of replacing some of the computer with purpose-built hardware, however, the pair discovered that making a system explicitly for running such a game, rather than general programs, would be much less expensive: as low as $100. By 1971 when Bushnell met with Pitts and Tuck, a prototype version had been successfully displayed {{for a short time}} in August 1971 in a local bar, the design was nearly finished, and the pair had founded a company around it called Syzygy. Bushnell had also found a manufacturer for the game, Nutting Associates, who would make the final game cabinets and sell them to distributors. Bushnell felt that Galaxy Game was not a real competitor to Computer Space, due to its high price. Pitts and Tuck believed, however, that despite the economic argument their game was superior, as they felt that Galaxy Game was a true expansion of Spacewar, while Computer Space just a pale imitation. Some players at the time, however, believed Galaxy Game to actually be just a version of Spacewar!. Galaxy Games prototype installation was very popular, though at a low price-per-game, and the pair developed a second version to display at the same location; they were never able to enter production, though, as they eventually had to abandon the idea after spending US$65,000 developing it due to the high cost and lack of <b>business</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|The series {{production}} of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be more}} suitable for mass production. The {{production of the}} T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. The <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E
