50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of the sputtering process {{are that the}} process {{is more difficult to}} combine with a lift-off for structuring the film. This is because the diffuse transport, characteristic of sputtering, makes a full shadow impossible. Thus, one cannot fully restrict where the atoms go, which can lead to contamination problems. Also, active control for layer-by-layer growth is difficult compared to pulsed laser deposition and inert sputtering gases are built into the growing film as impurities. Pulsed laser deposition is a variant of the sputtering deposition technique in which a laser beam is used for sputtering. Role of the sputtered and resputtered ions and the <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> is fully investigated during the pulsed laser deposition process.|$|E
5000|$|Sputter {{deposition}} is {{a physical}} vapor deposition (PVD) method of thin film deposition by sputtering. This involves ejecting material from a [...] "target" [...] that is a source onto a [...] "substrate" [...] such as a silicon wafer. Resputtering is re-emission of the deposited material during the deposition process by ion or atom bombardment.Sputtered atoms ejected from the target have a wide energy distribution, typically up to tens of eV (100,000 K). The sputtered ions (typically {{only a small fraction}} of the ejected particles are ionized — on the order of 1%) can ballistically fly from the target in straight lines and impact energetically on the substrates or vacuum chamber (causing resputtering). Alternatively, at higher gas pressures, the ions collide with the gas atoms that act as a moderator and move diffusively, reaching the substrates or vacuum chamber wall and condensing after undergoing a random walk. The entire range from high-energy ballistic impact to low-energy thermalized motion is accessible by changing the <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> pressure. The sputtering gas is often an inert gas such as argon. For efficient momentum transfer, the atomic weight of the sputtering gas should be close to the atomic weight of the target, so for sputtering light elements neon is preferable, while for heavy elements krypton or xenon are used. Reactive gases can also be used to sputter compounds. The compound can be formed on the target surface, in-flight or on the substrate depending on the process parameters. The availability of many parameters that control sputter deposition make it a complex process, but also allow experts a large degree of control over the growth and microstructure of the film.|$|E

This is followed by results from a technique that estimates the plasma expansion time and the dependence on the magnetic field of this expansion. Further, we have carried out measurements of τ’s dependence on B when the internal geometry of the trap is perturbed. We summarize the results and draw conclusions based on the results.|$|R

40|$|We {{record the}} {{two-dimensional}} laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) on multiple plasma constituents in a YBiO 3 plasma. This {{allows us to}} directly link the influence of oxygen present in the <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> during pulsed laser deposition to the oxidation of plasma species {{as well as the}} formation of epitaxial YBiO 3 films. With spatiotemporal LIF mapping of the plasma species (Y, YO, Bi, and BiO) in different <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> compositions, we find that little direct chemical interaction takes place between the plasma plume constituents and the <b>background</b> <b>gas.</b> However, a strong influence of the <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> composition can be seen on the YBO film growth, as well as a strong correlation between the oxygen fraction in the <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> and the amount of YO in the plasma plume. We assign this correlation to a direct interaction between the <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> and the target in between ablation pulses. In an O 2 background, an oxygen-rich surface layer forms in between ablation pulses, which provides additional oxygen for the plasma plume during target ablation. This differs from our previous observations in STO and LAO plasmas, where species oxidation primarily takes place during propagation of the plasma plume towards the substrate...|$|E
30|$|For {{the growth}} of {{continuous}} thin films, fabricated by fs-PLD, {{it is necessary to}} include some sort of <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> to widen the plasma plume and therefore evenly deposit over a substrate surface.

A <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> decreases the kinetic energy of the ablated particles and causes gradual changes in their trajectory with subsequent collisions. One foreseeable consequence of the addition of a <b>background</b> <b>gas</b> is the agglomeration of ablated particles. This however is not observed for the present study because the effective temperature of the ablated material is too high, and the strong positive ionisation of many of the particles would inhibit the formation of aggregates.
