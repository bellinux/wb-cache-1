5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. A {{year before the}} disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> black officer. In the months following the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense race relations {{in the armed forces}} at the time.|$|E

25|$|This {{feature is}} extraordinary. Animal {{communication}} systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> is modality-independent. No vocally impaired whale, dolphin or songbird, for example, could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, {{in the case}} of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from intrinsic properties of the signal.|$|E

25|$|Because both MOV and MP4 {{containers}} can use {{the same}} MPEG-4 codecs, they are mostly interchangeable in a QuickTime-only environment. MP4, being an international standard, has more support.

25|$|Researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore have contested the {{pharmacological}} {{activity of}} antidepressants in {{the relief of}} depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active placebos. Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a Freedom of Information Act request. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> that is clinically significant. In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.|$|E
25|$|As head of Naval Reactors, Rickover's {{focus and}} {{responsibilities}} were dedicated to reactor safety rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training. However, this extreme focus {{was well known}} during Rickover's era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities. One way by which this was addressed after the admiral retired was that only the very strongest, former at-sea submarine commanders have held Rickover's now unique eight-year position as NAVSEA-08, the longest chartered tenure in the U.S. military. From Rickover's first replacement, Kinnaird R. McKee, to today's head of Naval Reactors, James F. Caldwell, Jr., all have held command of nuclear submarines, their squadrons and ocean fleets, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> has been a long-term Engineering Duty Officer such as Rickover.|$|E
50|$|The general {{principle}} was, when the Sun {{is to the}} right or left of one's course one can check <b>one's</b> course <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one's</b> distance to the destination. When the Sun is ahead or behind one's course one can check the distance to <b>one's</b> destination <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one's</b> course. So he planned his final approach to follow a line of position directly to his destination. This technique allowed him to find tiny islands in the Pacific. He was awarded the inaugural Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators Johnston Memorial Trophy for this trip. Chichester then decided to circumnavigate the world solo; {{he made it to}} Japan but at Katsuura, Chiba he collided with an overhead cable, sustaining serious injuries.|$|R

25|$|Even though Sandridge had {{no formal}} {{training}} or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards {{caught the attention}} of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an outdoor sign company, Sandridge painted a realistically, eye-catching image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14ft x 48ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction to the men who were captivated by his work. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> to sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards his work ethic and creative abilities, he soon left that company.|$|E
25|$|Split: If {{the first}} two cards of a hand have the same value, the player can split them into two hands, by moving a second bet equal to the first into an area outside the betting box. The dealer {{separates}} the two cards and draws an additional card on each, placing one bet with each hand. The player then plays out the two separate hands in turn; {{except for a few}} restrictions, the hands are treated as independent new hands, with the player winning or losing their wager separately for each hand. Occasionally, in the case of ten-valued cards, some casinos allow splitting only when the cards have the identical ranks; for instance, a hand of 10-10 may be split, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> of 10-king. However, usually all 10-value cards are treated the same. Doubling and further splitting of post-split hands may be restricted, and an ace and ten value card after a split are counted as a non-blackjack 21. Hitting split aces is usually not allowed. Non-controlling players may follow the controlling player by putting down an additional bet or decline to do so, instead associating their existing wager with one of the two post-split hands. In that case they must choose which hand to play behind before the second cards are drawn. Some casinos do not give non-controlling players this option, and require that the wager of a player not electing to split remains with the first of the two post-split hands.|$|E

500|$|Sifton was {{selected}} Premier {{in an effort}} to restore party unity, and his first cabinet reflected that. [...] There were three ministers in addition to Sifton. [...] Charles R. Mitchell had been, like Sifton, a judge during the scandal, and was therefore unattached to either side. [...] Duncan Marshall had been a Rutherford cabinet minister, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> identified strongly with its railway policy. [...] Archibald J. McLean had voted with the rebels, but not been a leader among them. [...] The cabinet thus included members of both factions, but none of those who inspired such strong opinions as to be overly divisive.|$|E

500|$|However, not all {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} album was positive. Neil Arnold from Metal Forces was disappointed by the album's musical direction, because he felt that Mustaine [...] "has reverted back to a more simple, less furious sound". In a brief review for Spin, Jon Young commented on several of the album's tracks, saying [...] "Public Enemy No. 1" [...] and [...] "Guns, Drugs & Money" [...] were [...] "deceptively melodic hard rock not far from Alice Cooper's early classics" [...] but also said they lack {{the same sense of}} humor. However, Young stated that [...] "We the People" [...] should be on [...] "the apocalypse's official soundtrack". BBC Music's Ian Winwood said the album [...] "is something of an unremarkable affair.

500|$|In its {{review of}} the book's fourth edition, {{published}} in 1919, The Bookman observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. [...] "It has had many imitators... <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away". The reviewer recommended the book's [...] "quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony". In Canada, Queen's Quarterly magazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted {{with that of the}} New York Times nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that [...] "It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent". [...] The literary critic D. B. Wyndham Lewis summarised the Pooters as [...] "warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads".|$|E
500|$|Ginia Bellafante, {{a critic}} for The New York Times, proclaimed the drama gave the {{audience}} [...] "innocent faces and heaving breasts, hyperbolizing the sex that always lurks {{beneath the surface}} of Austen's astringent presence." [...] She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was more fun than the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand wrote [...] "Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful and attentive adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed [...] "Northanger Abbey was a perfectly acceptable costume drama – <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> that ever really caught fire." [...] Simon Hoggart, writing for The Spectator, commented that Davies's adaptation of Northanger Abbey [...] "was much bolder and more confident than Mansfield Park the week before." ...|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} convention, Mason {{wanted to see}} a more {{powerful}} central government than under the Articles, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> that would threaten local interests. He feared that the more numerous Northern states would dominate the union, and would impose restrictions on trade that would harm Virginia, so he sought a supermajority requirement for navigation acts. As was his constant objective, he sought to preserve the liberty he and other free white males enjoyed in Virginia, guarding against the tyranny he and others had decried under British rule. He also sought a balance of powers, seeking thereby to make a durable government; according to historian Brent Tarter, [...] "Mason designed his home [...] so that no misplaced window or missing support might spoil the effect or threaten to bring down the roof; he tried to design institutions of government in the same way, so that wicked or unprincipled men could not knock loose any safeguards of liberty".|$|E
