40|$|Mn based self-aligned {{diffusion}} {{barriers are}} promising for incorporation in the copper interconnects {{designed for the}} ≤ 22 nm technology node. However, in the current metallization scheme of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), the processing of these barrier lines presents a specific challenge, which {{is rooted in the}} intrinsic corrosion characteristics of the Cu-Mn <b>bimetallic</b> <b>couple.</b> Since the Mn component of the self-aligned barrier film is electrochemically active compared to its adjacent Cu lines, the Cu-barrier interface of such a device tends to galvanically corrode in the chemical slurries used for CMP. Employing electrochemical techniques and a model galvanic system of polycrystalline Mn and Cu electrodes, the present work focuses on developing a strategic chemical approach to controlling this corrosion. The results demonstrate that, in the alkaline slurry environment (pH = 9 – 12, frequently used for barrier-CMP), a relatively low concentration (0. 5 mM) of salicylaldehyde can minimize the galvanic corrosion of Mn while maintaining the latter’s CMP-specific surface activity. The underlying mechanisms of these effects are probed with open circuit potential measurements, voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|Au/Cu {{thin film}} <b>bimetallic</b> <b>couples</b> {{containing}} well defined tilt grain boundaries have been annealed in situ {{to observe the}} phenomenology and kinetics of DIGM and DIR. The discontinuous nature of the migration process has been directly observed and correlated with changes in the mobility of the grain boundaries with misorientation. The variations in the phenomenology of DIGM/DIR with increasing temperature are discussed, and some results of other workers reinterpreted {{in the light of}} new concepts of the nucleation process of DIR, and the possibility of high temperature DIGM. © 1985...|$|R

The aim of this work was to conduct the model research describing the mechanism of connection zone formation at the aluminum-nickel contact. Al-Ni samples were annealed at temperatures below the melting point of aluminum for a specified periods of time. In the sample annealed at 640 °C for 48 hours Frenkel porosity occurrence has been observed. Maximum pore surfaces share {{in this area is}} 35 ÷ 40 %. Diffusion influences in this case can be divided into three zones differing values of component elements concentrations.

40|$|Wafer bending is {{a severe}} problem that limits the {{application}} of silicon carbide films in both electronic and MEMS applications. Photolithography may be impossible and in severe cases the wafer can shatter. Additionally, compressive stresses can {{make it difficult to}} form membranes from the SiC film. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the causes of wafer distortion. The origins of the wafer distortion that have been proposed so far are: (i) Misfit strain arising from different thermal expansion of the silicon and SiC film (ii) Misfit strain due to the different lattice parameters of Si and SiC. However, estimates of the magnitude of the bending that one might suggest that neither of these mechanisms can account for the magnitude of the curvature. Another phenomenon that can cause distortion is interdiffusion [1]. These diffusion phenomena and the associated effects, deformation, strain and voids, are related to the Kirkendall effect, commonly observed in metal couples. In the case of silicon carbide a single component diffuses towards the free surface leaving vacancies in the substrate, in a manner similar to the formation of oxide scales. Jaenicke et al [2] present various possible regimes of stress and subsequent bending that can be present at a surface reacting with ambient oxygen. One such case is presented in Fig. 2 where the upper layer of the substrate is under tension bending the substrate and forcing the growing film under compression. Interdiffusion induces large plastic deformations and could easily account for the bending. Si diffuses out of the substrate to react with the carbon during the initial stages of growth and as proceeds a large number of vacancies may be created in the substrate which, in some cases, condense to form voids. Stresses may then be generated in the substrate in where bowing is concave but the SiC film under compression. Clearly, when the system is complex the stress may have different signs in different regions and other mechanisms may come into play, such as thermal mismatch. However, the similarities between the growth features of SiC on silicon and those observed during diffusion in <b>bimetallic</b> <b>couples</b> and surface scales are compelling. This novel mechanism of wafer warp will be illustrated with examples from growth experiments and the processes leading to the plastic deformation of the wafer will be discussed. References 1.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of phase, group, and front velocities introduced by Sommerfeld will be reviewed, {{and applied to}} superluminal phenomena, with {{a brief review of}} optical experiments that evince superluminal group velocities. We shall discuss the special case of "instantaneous superluminality" in the case of electrons. In particular, the charge transfer of electrons through a Fermi sea of electrons from the interior to the exterior of a normal metal will be discussed in connection with an ongoing experiment to measure the time it takes for this charge transfer process to take place in a long aluminum bar, in a generalization of Faraday's original "ice-pail" experiment. Also, the speed of the charge transfer of Cooper pairs through a <b>bimetallic</b> superconducting island, <b>coupled</b> via an input and an output Josephson junctions, will be discussed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{compound}} MnNi(NO 2) 4 (en) 2, en = ethylendiamine, {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a ferromagnetically <b>coupled</b> <b>bimetallic</b> chain (Jshort parallel chain not, vert, similar 2 – 3 K). Further, for this material, a finite inter-chain coupling triggers an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition below TN = 2. 3 K. Here, we present a susceptibility study of MnNi(NO 2) 4 (en) 2 under pressure. From our data, we derive the pressure response of the antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN. Even up to highest pressure of 8. 2 kbar we find a very modest increase of TN by only not, vert, similar 0. 1 K. Independently, from a pressure study of the lattice parameters of MnNi(NO 2) 4 (en) 2, we calculate the bulk module of the material to not, vert, similar 8. 8 GPa. Combining the data TN(p) with the bulk module yields an anomalously low Grüneisen parameter Γmag of only 0. 5 (5). We discuss possible scenarios accounting for such a low Grüneisen parameter...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} reactions {{induced by}} vacuum furnace annealing and {{rapid thermal annealing}} in sequentially deposited Al/Ni <b>bimetallic</b> thin-film diffusion <b>couples</b> have been investigated with MeV 4 He+ backscattering spectrometry, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. Upon annealing, NiAl 3 is the first aluminide phase to grow. In uncontaminated samples, the NiAl 3 growth proceeds in uniform planar fashion, governed by diffusion-limited kinetics. The kinetics data fit well with those for NiAl 3 growth on large-grained Al substrates, yielding a common kinetics law of x 2 =kt, where x is {{the thickness of the}} NiAl 3 grown at the interface, t is the annealing duration, and k is the growth constant, which is given by k= 2. 24 (cm 2 /s) exp(− 1. 5 ± 0. 1 eV/kBT), in which T is the annealing temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Microscopic examination reveals slight nonuniformity at the Al/NiAl 3 interface resulting from shallow local protrusions of NiAl 3 grains into the Al layer at grain boundaries. When either the Al film or the Al/Ni interface is purposely contaminated during sample preparation, the roughness at this Al/NiAl 3 interface becomes very pronounced, and the reaction rate is significantly reduced. Meanwhile, Ni motion becomes appreciable as NiAl 3 grains and/or Ni severely penetrate the Al layer. In contrast, the NiAl 3 /Ni interface remains sharp in all samples. The irregular morphology and nonuniform reaction cannot be attributed uniquely to the presence of grain boundaries in the Al film, but rather are a combined effect of impurities and Al grain boundaries. Short-term rapid thermal annealing at elevated temperatures appreciably alleviates the nonuniformity at the Al/NiAl 3 interface in contaminated samples...|$|R
