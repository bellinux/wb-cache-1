In the higher areas there are forests of pines and holm oak, and tropical forests in the lower elevations. The area was declared a <b>biological</b> <b>reserve</b> and contains about 1,700 species of plants, some endemic only to the area.

2500|$|The Persian Gulf is {{also home}} to many migratory and local birds. There is great {{variation}} in color, size, and type of the bird species that call the gulf home. One bird in particular, the kalbaensis subspecies of the collared kingfishers is at the brink of extinction due to real state development by cities such as Dubai and countries such as Oman. Estimates from 2006 showed that only three viable nesting sites were available for this ancient bird, one located [...] from Dubai, and two smaller sites in Oman, all of which {{are in the process of}} becoming real estate developments. Such expansion would prove devastating and could cause this species to become extinct. Unfortunately for the kingfisher, a U.N. plan to protect the mangroves as a <b>biological</b> <b>reserve</b> was blatantly ignored by the emirate of Sharjah, which allowed the dredging of a channel that bisects the wetland and construction of an adjacent concrete walkway. Environmental watchdogs in Arabia are few, and those that do advocate the wildlife are often silenced or ignored by developers of real estate, most of whom have royal family connections and huge energy profits to invest. The end result has been sacrifice of a beautiful yet delicate ecology that has been in harmony for hundreds of years, for structures that are erected only a few years, yet will have a lasting detrimental effect.|$|E
