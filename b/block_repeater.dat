50|$|Around 1900, {{electromechanical}} signalling {{and safety}} equipment was introduced. It has two essential controls. First is the lever frame at its base. This houses the levers used {{to change the}} positions of the points and signals. Second, and above the lever frame, are the indicator panels. These hold the electric <b>block</b> <b>repeaters</b> that maintain communication with the main control frame in the stationmaster's office, from which route orders for trains are despatched. The stationmaster's and the signalmen's apparatus is interlocked to ensure that mistakes cannot occur.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a <b>repeater</b> <b>block</b> {{planning}} algorithm for interconnect-centric floorplanning. We introduce the concept of independent feasible regions for repeaters and derive an analytical formula for their computation. We develop a routability-driven repeater clustering algorithm to perform <b>repeater</b> <b>block</b> planning based on iterative deletion. The goal is to obtain a high quality solution for the <b>repeater</b> <b>block</b> locations so that performance-driven interconnect synthesis at the routing stage {{can be carried out}} with ease, while minimizing the chip area. Experimental results show that our method increases the percentage of all global nets that meet their target delays from 67. 5 % in [1] to 85 %. Moreover, our approach minimizes the expected routing congestion, making it easier for performance-driven routers to synthesize global nets that require the insertion of repeaters to meet timing constraints...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{solution}} to the problem of <b>repeater</b> <b>block</b> planning under both delay and signal transition time constraints for a given floorplan. Previous approaches have considered only meeting the target delay of a net. However, it has been observed that the repeater planning for meeting the delay target can cause signals on long interconnects to have very slow transition rates. Experimental results show that our new approach satisfies both timing constraints for an average of 79 % of all global nets for six MCNC benchmark floorplans studied (at 1 GHz frequency), compared with an average of 22 % for the <b>repeater</b> <b>block</b> planner in [11]...|$|R
40|$|Entanglement {{between a}} single photon and a quantum memory forms the {{building}} <b>blocks</b> for quantum <b>repeater</b> and quantum network. Previous entanglement sources are typically with low retrieval efficiency, which limits future larger-scale applications. Here, we report {{a source of}} highly retrievable spinwave-photon entanglement. Polarization entanglement is created through interaction of a single photon with ensemble of atoms inside a low-finesse ring cavity. The cavity is engineered to be resonant for dual spinwave modes, which thus enables efficient retrieval of the spinwave qubit. An intrinsic retrieval efficiency up to 76 (4) % has been observed. Such a highly retrievable atom-photon entanglement source will be very useful in future larger-scale quantum repeater and quantum network applications. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{memories}} for light are the building <b>blocks</b> of quantum <b>repeaters</b> {{which would allow}} to extend the distance of quantum communication schemes far beyond what is feasible today. The implementation of a quantum memory at telecommunication-wavelength is of great interest in this context. A proof of principle experiment of such a device showing the storage and retrieval of light at the single photon level in an erbium doped solid was successfully carried out. Furthermore, important steps towards {{the implementation of a}} quantum memory with a high temporal multimode capacity and very long storage times were made. Besides the realization of light storage experiments, a study of the absorption structure of the rare-earth-ion-doped materials used was made and a spectral holeburning techniques were developped, allowing for memory experiments...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{includes}} {{a series of}} experiments exploring the potential of using rare-earth ion-doped crystals as a light-matter quantum interface using different quantum states of light as a probe resource. We start with the realization of an elementary quantum <b>repeater</b> <b>block,</b> implementing quantum teleportation of a polarization qubit into a solid-state quantum memory based on a yttrium-orthosilicate crystal doped with neodymium ions. The storage of an hyperentangled state of light compatible with long-distance quantum communication was demonstrated to show the potential of using this quantum memory for quantum purification techniques. To explore the temporal multiplexing capability of atomic frequency combs in atomic ensembles we performed temporal multimode storage of multi-photon entangled state of light. Such a temporal multimode capacity together with the developed novel theoretical techniques allowed us to show the storage {{of more than one}} bit of entanglement (ebit) using multi-photon and multi-dimensional entangled photon states...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{repeaters}} rely on an interfacing {{of flying}} qubits with quantum memories. The most common implementations include a narrowband single photon matched in bandwidth and central frequency to an atomic system. Previously, we demonstrated the compatibility of our versatile source of heralded single photons, {{which is based}} on parametric down-conversion in a triply-resonant whispering-gallery mode resonator, with alkaline transitions [Schunk et al., Optica 2, 773 (2015) ]. In this paper, we analyze our source in terms of phase matching, available wavelength-tuning mechanisms, and applications to narrow-band atomic systems. We resonantly address the D 1 transitions of cesium and rubidium with this optical parametric oscillator pumped above its oscillation threshold. Below threshold, the efficient coupling of single photons to atomic transitions heralded by single telecom-band photons is demonstrated. Finally, we present an accurate analytical description of our observations. Providing the demonstrated flexibility in connecting various atomic transitions with telecom wavelengths, we show a promising approach to realize an essential building <b>block</b> for quantum <b>repeaters.</b> Comment: 18 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{the domain}} of quantum communication, {{one of the main}} {{challenges}} is the distribution of entanglement over long distances. A scheme, the so-called quantum repeater, has been proposed in order to overcome the problem of channel losses. In this thesis we adresse different problems related to quantum repeaters, both theoretically and experimentally. We present an alternative scheme of quantum repeater based on atomic ensembles and linear optics. It is based on the use of a qubit amplifier and two photon interference. The main features of the protocol are that the distributed entangled state does not need post selection and the entanglement distribution rates approach the optimal rates one might expect from quantum repeaters using probabilistic swapping. An important concern of the whole class of quantum repeaters based on one photon interference is the phase stability in the communication channels. We performed an experiment evaluating the realistic phase noise in installed optical fibers in the Geneva urban area. We found fluctuations of order of 0. 1 rad on the time scale of order of 100 $mu$s. The feasibility of the phase stabilization is discussed. One of the essential building <b>blocks</b> of quantum <b>repeater</b> is a quantum memory. We focus our attention on quantum memories based on solid state atomic ensembles and photon echo like techniques. In particular, we show, that the atomic coherence in eryso can be controlled to a very high degree using an external electric field. This allowed us to implement the CRIB protocol in this material and realize the first storage of light at the single photon level at telecommunication wavelength. A necessary step for the implementation of CRIB and AFC storage protocols, in order to achieve long storage times and unit efficiencies, is the use of control light pulses. We developped a numerical Maxwell-Bloch simulator allowing us to study a coherent control of atomic excitations. In particular, we investigate the use of adiabatic chirped pulses in the context of AFC protocol. We study the relationship between the pulse characteristics and the echo properties. The comparison with the conventional $pi$ pulses and the impacts on the multimode capacity of the AFC protocol are also discussed...|$|R
