5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle that can <b>be</b> <b>recharged</b> from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity {{stored in the}} rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} brings one materia {{into the}} party when they join, carrying one spell {{that can be used}} in combat. Materia have a limited number of uses before they must <b>be</b> <b>recharged</b> at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, materia gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a maximum level of nine. Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E
5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not <b>be</b> <b>recharged</b> from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can <b>be</b> <b>recharged,</b> allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|In combat, {{players can}} use {{long-range}} weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotgun. Players can scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. Players can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment {{such as health}} kits and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can <b>be</b> <b>recharged</b> {{through the use of}} health kits..|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of the Fates slows time, {{but this does not}} affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving that can not be achieved in normal game time. The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to <b>be</b> <b>recharged</b> (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.|$|E

50|$|Groundwater <b>is</b> <b>recharged</b> {{naturally}} by {{rain and}} snow melt {{and to a}} smaller extent by surface water (rivers and lakes). <b>Recharge</b> may <b>be</b> impeded somewhat by human activities including paving, development, or logging. These activities can result in loss of topsoil resulting in reduced water infiltration, enhanced surface runoff and reduction in recharge. Use of groundwaters, especially for irrigation, may also lower the water tables. Groundwater <b>recharge</b> <b>is</b> an important process for sustainable groundwater management, since the volume-rate abstracted from an aquifer {{in the long term}} should be {{less than or equal to}} the volume-rate that <b>is</b> <b>recharged.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the Lower Colima extends for approximately 230km2 and that the Upper Colima spreads over approximately 170km2. The Upper Colima aquifer <b>is</b> <b>recharged</b> from the Barva and La Libertad aquifers by vertical percolation. The Upper Colima also receives a large part of its recharge from rain infiltration in those areas where there are no overlying smaller aquifers. The Lower Colima <b>is</b> <b>recharged</b> from the Upper Colima by vertical percolation and from surface water where the Upper Colima is absent.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to <b>be</b> <b>recharged.</b> To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first have to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E

The battery pack is capable of about 3 hours of gameplay before needing to <b>be</b> <b>recharged.</b> On July 25, the company {{released a}}n improved battery pack for the Wii U GamePad. In contrast to the standard 1500mAh battery bundled with the console, the new 2550mAh battery pack increases longevity to between five and eight hours before needing to <b>be</b> <b>recharged.</b>|$|E
50|$|Water is {{available}} from a Cretaceous period aquifer. Three springs are {{in the vicinity of}} the buttes: Nelson Ranch (1 mile km north), old Linglebach Homestead (1 mile km south), and an arroyo (0.51 mile km west). The main access to the aquifer is by windmill pumps. The aquifer <b>is</b> <b>recharged</b> from the west and flows eastward. There are Tertiary and Quaternary aquifers which <b>are</b> <b>recharged</b> by precipitation and seepage from streams. The Brule Formation, where available provides a large quantity of water.|$|R

The charging frequency was derived from field trial results taken from the BMW ActiveE and MINI E vehicles in Asia, Europe and the U.S., whereby the typical commuting use between the pilot users' homes and workplaces was calculated.|$|E
25|$|The active {{material}} on the battery plates changes chemical composition on each charge and discharge cycle; {{active material}} may be lost due to physical changes of volume, further {{limiting the number of}} times the battery can <b>be</b> <b>recharged.</b> Most nickel-based batteries are partially discharged when purchased, and must be charged before first use.

This means Mars need not be warm (i.e., above freezing) in its early history, in accordance with current climate models.|$|E
