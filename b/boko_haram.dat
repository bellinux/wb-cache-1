5|$|People {{from the}} North-West and South-West provinces, {{which used to}} be a part of British Cameroons, are largely Protestant. The French-speaking regions of the {{southern}} and western regions are largely Catholic. Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African animist beliefs, or a syncretic combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices. Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence. The Islamist jihadist group <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.|$|E
25|$|In October 2016, the {{government}} negotiated {{a deal with}} the terrorist group, <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> which secured the release of 21 Chibok girls. By December 2016, {{the government}} had recovered much of the territories previously held by <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> and after the capture of Sambisa Forest, Buhari announced that <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> has been technically defeated. The insurgency displaced about 2 million people from their homes and the recapture of the towns now present humanitarian challenges in health, education and nutrition.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Eyre, Nigeria {{researcher}} for Amnesty International stated: [...] "The {{attack on}} Baga and surrounding towns, {{looks as if}} it could be <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> deadliest act in a catalog of increasingly heinous attacks carried out by the group. If reports that the town was largely razed to the ground and that hundreds or even as many as two thousand civilians were killed are true, this marks a disturbing and bloody escalation of <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> ongoing onslaught against the civilian population." ...|$|R
25|$|On 14 May 2013, Jonathan {{declared}} a state of emergency in three northeastern Nigerian states, Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa, to curtail the activities of <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram.</b> Although initially offering amnesty, by June 2013 he ordered a 20-year jail term for anyone found to be in support of <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> kidnapped Europeans for the Ransom {{their governments}} would pay {{in the early}} 2010s.

25|$|On 26 July, {{more than}} 50 {{people were killed}} and several dozen were injured in Bauchi when a gun-battle erupted as a police station was {{attacked}} by 70 Nigerian <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> sect members who possessed grenades and guns. One government soldier and 32 <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> militants were killed {{in the aftermath of the}} initial attack. The government claimed that 39 militants had been killed, and confirmed the death of a soldier. The attack was initiated by <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> after their leaders were detained by the police. Security forces retaliated by raiding the neighbourhoods where the group was entrenched.|$|E

50|$|<b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> {{attacks have}} {{intensified}} in 2014. In February, the group {{killed more than}} 100 Christian men in the villages of Doron Baga and Izghe. Also in February, 59 boys {{were killed in the}} Federal Government College attack in Yobe State.|$|R
40|$|Although most of <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram’s</b> {{terrorist}} activity is focused, for the moment, on Nigerian territory, this Research Note {{argues that it}} is already an important international jihadist organisation. The watershed that marks <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram’s</b> passage from a purely Nigerian phenomenon to an international jihadist actor is its attack on the United Nations Headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital, on August 26, 2011. The bulk of BH’s membership, the indiscriminate and cruel characteristic of its attacks, {{the complexity of the}} Nigerian religious and ethnic context, the sheer weight of the Nigerian state in an instable neighborhood - Cameroun, Niger, Chad, Mali - and its proximity to the jihadist battle front in the Sahel convert it into an immediate and infectious regional threat. </div...|$|R
25|$|The {{restored}} Alpha Jet force {{have been}} routinely employed in combat air patrols, and has conducted multiple {{air strikes against}} <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> militants {{over a number of}} years. In September 2014, multiple Alpha Jets conducted a large number of aerial bombardment missions over and around the area of Bama, Borno State, during the fight to regain the city following the withdrawal of friendly ground forces. In early October 2014, <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> released a video containing the decapitation of who they claimed was a captured Nigerian Air Force pilot of a downed Alpha Jet. In March 2016, attacks performed by Nigerian Alpha Jets had reportedly dislodged <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> fighters from Sambisa Forest, Borno State.|$|E
25|$|Jonathan's {{administration}} was heavily criticized for {{its failure to}} bring back the over 200 schoolgirls abducted by <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram.</b> Many demonstrations called for the government to be more responsive; Jonathan asked that demonstrators focus on blaming <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> itself for the abductions. Jonathan initially denied that there had been any abduction at all, but then later signaled his government would do a prisoner release in exchange for the kidnapped girls. Discussions then took place in Paris with foreign ministers from France, Britain, the United States and Israel, where he agreed no deals should be struck with terrorists. He then called off the exchange at the last minute on 24 May 2014. This about-turn reportedly enraged <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> leaders.|$|E

25|$|In December 2014, Buhari {{pledged to}} enhance {{security}} in Nigeria, {{if he wins}} the general elections on 14 February 2015, which were later rescheduled for 28 March 2015. Since this announcement, Buhari's approval ratings reportedly have skyrocketed amongst the Nigerian people (largely due to the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan's apparent inability to fight <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> brutal insurgency). Buhari has now made internal security and wiping out the militant group {{one of the key}} pillars of his campaigning.|$|R
25|$|A gun-battle lasting {{several hours}} {{took place in}} Potiskum. <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram</b> militants set a police station on fire using fuel-laden motorcycles.

5000|$|According to one survivor, {{the attackers}} {{drove into the}} college in two double-cabin pickup {{all-terrain}} vehicles. Some were wearing Nigerian military uniforms. A survivor said that nearly all of those killed were Muslims, as is {{the majority of the}} student body. This attack followed a 6 July 2013 attack at Mamudo outside Damaturu that killed 29 students and a teacher, some by burning alive, which left many schools in the area closed, and other attacks in the week following killed 30 more civilians. <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> name means [...] "Western education is sinful".|$|R
50|$|After its {{founding}} in 2002, <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> increasing radicalization led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was summarily executed. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against soft targets, and progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings of police buildings and the United Nations office in Abuja. The government's establishment {{of a state of}} emergency at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of Nigeria, led to an increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks.|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to the Nigerian extremist group <b>Boko</b> <b>Haram's</b> Quranic justification for kidnapping and enslaving people, [...] and ISIL's religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women as spoils of war as claimed in their digital magazine Dabiq, 126 Islamic scholars from around the Muslim world, in late September 2014, signed {{an open letter to}} the Islamic State's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rejecting his group's interpretations of the Qur'an and hadith to justify its actions. The letter accuses the group of instigating fitna - sedition - by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the anti-slavery consensus of the Islamic scholarly community.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{installment}} of Riad Sattouf's ongoing strip [...] ("The {{secret life of}} youths")—based on youth conversations Sattouf has overheard—a French Arab youth discusses the shooting on his cellphone and declares he [...] "couldn't give a fuck about Charlie [...] ", but that people should not be killed for what they say.
