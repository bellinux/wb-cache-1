5|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>air</b> supply {{can come}} {{directly}} from a high-pressure <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of <b>breathing</b> <b>air.</b> Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breathing</b> <b>air</b> is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5000|$|Hypostomus {{species are}} well known for the ability to <b>breathe</b> <b>air.</b> This is {{achieved}} through a slightly modified stomach that is larger and thinner than in non-air breathers. To <b>breathe</b> <b>air,</b> Hypostomus must orient itself vertically.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic Elves or Sea Elves (Alu-Tel'Quessir): Aquatic elves {{are also}} known as sea elves. They live beneath the waves of Faerûn and can breathe water as easily as their cousins on land <b>breathe</b> <b>air.</b> They can also <b>breathe</b> <b>air</b> but for {{a very short period}} of time.|$|R
50|$|Lungfish (Dipnoi): Six species , have limb like fins, and can <b>breathe</b> <b>air.</b> Some are obligate air breathers, {{meaning they}} will drown if not {{given access to}} <b>breathe</b> <b>air.</b> Some species will bury in the mud when the body of water they live in dries up, {{surviving}} {{up to two years}} until water returns.|$|R
5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to <b>breathing</b> <b>air,</b> then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>breathing</b> {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air {{breathers}} and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must <b>breathe</b> <b>air</b> periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only <b>breathe</b> <b>air</b> if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most <b>air</b> <b>breathing</b> fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|R
50|$|Air-breathing is {{well known}} among many loricariids; this ability is {{dependent}} on the risk of hypoxia faced by a species; torrent-dwelling species tend to have no ability to <b>breathe</b> <b>air,</b> while low-land, pool-dwelling species, such as those of Hypostomus, have a great ability to <b>breathe</b> <b>air.</b> Pterygoplichthys is known for being kept out of water and sold alive in fish markets, surviving up to 30 hours out of water. Loricariids are facultative air breathers; they will only <b>breathe</b> <b>air</b> if under stress and will only use their gills in situations when oxygen levels are high. The dry season is a likely time for this; there would be little food in the stomach, which would allow its use for <b>air</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|R

25|$|It is however, {{critical}} to diver safety that the compressor {{is suitable for}} <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> delivery, uses a suitable oil, is adequately filtered, and takes in clean and uncontaminated air. Positioning of the intake opening is important, and {{may have to be}} changed if the relative wind direction changes, to ensure that no engine exhaust gas enters the intake. Various national standards for <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> quality may apply.|$|E
25|$|The {{most urgent}} {{emergencies}} specific to scuba diving generally involve loss of breathing gas: Gas supply failures, situations where <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> {{is likely to}} run out before the diver can surface, or inability to ascend, and uncontrolled ascents.|$|E
25|$|The first {{intentional}} saturation dive {{was done}} on December 22, 1938, by Edgar End and Max Nohl who spent 27 hours <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> at 101 feet (30.8m) in the County Emergency Hospital recompression facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Their decompression lasted five hours leaving Nohl with a mild case of decompression sickness that resolved with recompression.|$|E

5000|$|Whales and {{dolphins}} <b>breathe</b> <b>air,</b> but {{live in the}} water, {{meaning they}} must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{labyrinth}} fish, {{the moonlight}} gourami {{has a special}} lung-like organ that allows it to <b>breathe</b> <b>air</b> directly. Because of this labyrinth organ, {{it is not unusual}} to see it go to the surface and gulp air. The ability to <b>breathe</b> <b>air</b> allows the moonlight gourami to survive in very low oxygen situations. In fact, if it remains moist it can actually survive out of water for up to several hours.|$|R
25|$|About 98.5% of {{the oxygen}} {{in a sample}} of {{arterial}} blood in a healthy human, <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> at sea-level pressure, is chemically combined with hemoglobin molecules. About 1.5% is physically dissolved in the other blood liquids and not connected to hemoglobin. The hemoglobin molecule is the primary transporter of oxygen in mammals and many other species.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this would be <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses into the skin quickly, while the {{nitrogen}} diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Breathing gases for use at ambient {{pressures}} {{below normal}} atmospheric pressure are usually air enriched with oxygen to provide sufficient oxygen to maintain life and consciousness, or to allow {{higher levels of}} exertion than would be possible using air. It is common to provide the additional oxygen as a pure gas added to the <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> at inhalation, or though a life-support system.|$|E

50|$|Woolly sculpin (Clinocottus analis): Found in tide pools {{along the}} Pacific coast, these {{sculpins}} will leave water if the oxygen levels get low and can <b>breathe</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce the {{decompression}} problems resulting from the high partial pressures of nitrogen the diver is exposed to when <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> at depth, oxygen may be added as a substitute for some of the nitrogen. The resulting mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is known as nitrox. The traces of argon and other atmospheric gases are considered to be unimportant.|$|E
25|$|Diving {{mask squeeze}} {{enclosing}} {{the eyes and}} nose: The main risk is rupture of the capillaries of the eyes and facial skin because of the negative pressure difference between the gas space and blood pressure, or orbital emphysema from higher pressures. This can be avoided by <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> into the mask through the nose. Goggles covering only the eyes are not suitable for deep diving as they cannot be equalised.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the book gills are usually interpreted to be for aquatic breathing, while the Kiemenplatten are supplementary for temporary breathing on land. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} two systems alone could not have supported an organism the size of Eurypterus. Both structures might actually have been for <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> and the true gills (for underwater breathing) of Eurypterus have yet to be discovered. Eurypterus, however, were undoubtedly primarily aquatic.|$|E

25|$|A pneumofathometer supply valve, which {{supplies}} gas to the pneumofathometer for the diver. This valve {{is usually}} near the main supply valve {{but with a}} different handle. It is usually a needle type valve as it must be finely adjustable, but {{it must also be}} large enough to allow a fairly high flow rate, as the air may be used as an alternative <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> source, or to fill small lift bags.|$|E
25|$|This {{principle}} {{was applied}} as a pressure ratio of total ambient pressure {{and did not}} take into account the partial pressures of the component gases of the <b>breathing</b> <b>air.</b> His experimental work on goats and observations of human divers appeared to support this assumption. However, in time, this was found to be inconsistent with incidence of decompression sickness and changes were made to the initial assumptions. This was later changed to a 1.58:1 ratio of nitrogen partial pressures.|$|E
25|$|Superficial ICD (also {{known as}} Steady State Isobaric Counterdiffusion) {{occurs when the}} inert gas breathed by the diver diffuses more slowly into the body than the inert gas {{surrounding}} the body. An example {{of this would be}} <b>breathing</b> <b>air</b> in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses into the skin quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E
