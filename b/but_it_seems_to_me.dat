At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his hand you may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E

Hindus are generally conservative <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that in ancient India, they even celebrated sex as an enjoyable part of procreation, where priests were invited for ceremonies in their home to mark the beginning of the process ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May 2013, Hutchison Port Holdings group {{managing}} director John Meredith {{published an article}} in several Chinese-language newspapers said the strike was jeopardising Hong Kong's entrepot status. [...] "The union and its leaders said they would protect the livelihood of workers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that they are more}} concerned about the political bargaining chip they have gained," [...] he said. Meredith accused Lee Cheuk-yan for ignoring such facts, saying that Lee's [...] "Cultural Revolution-style" [...] banners targeted tycoon Li Ka-shing and even Hutchison businesses, stating making politicised and exaggerated gestures do not help. Lee slammed the company for resorting to delaying tactics and neglecting the problems of pay rises and working conditions.|$|E

Authorities in Strasbourg and organisations based there also refer to Strasbourg as the [...] "capital" [...] of Europe and Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg are also {{referred}} to as the joint capitals of Europe. In 2010, Vice President of the United States Joe Biden, while speaking to the European Parliament, said: [...] ""As you probably know, some American politicians and American journalists refer to Washington, D.C. as the 'capital of the free world.' <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that in this great city, which boasts 1,000 years of history and which serves as the capital of Belgium, the home of the European Union, and the headquarters for NATO, this city has its own legitimate claim to that title." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mack was {{somewhat}} more guarded in his investigations and {{interpretations of the}} abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that [...] "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go." [...] In a 1994 interview, [...] Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed [...] "inclined to take these [...] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying [...] "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't {{have a way to}} account for them." [...] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, [...] "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [...] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it invites a deeper, further inquiry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and American philanthropist Cleveland Dodge, head of {{the board}} of Robert College, wrote to Wilson asking him not to declare war on Bulgaria, saying that it would have no effect on the war, but would harm the work of American missionaries, {{educational}} institutions, and American citizens in Bulgaria and Turkey. Wilson agreed to reconsider his proposal. [...] In his final message to Congress delivered on December 4, Wilson called for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but said, [...] "The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They too, are tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our proposed actions. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that we should go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others." [...] After holding hearings on the subject, Congress accepted Wilson's argument and declared war on Austria-Hungary, but not on Bulgaria or Turkey.|$|E
