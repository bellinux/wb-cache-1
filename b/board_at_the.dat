5|$|Metro also {{encountered}} {{significant problems}} estimating {{the number of}} riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).|$|E
5|$|An {{accident}} occurred aboard K-152 Nerpa at 8:30 PM {{local time}} on 8 November 2008, during an underwater test {{run in the}} Pacific Ocean.

Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued {{a little girl who}} died on the way to hospital.

5|$|Creutz {{became a}} professor, {{the head of}} the Physics Department, and the head of Nuclear Research Center at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1948.

In addition to his work on nuclear physics, he cultivated flowers and orchids at his home. He published eight papers on floral species, and named three varieties of violets after his children. One 1966 paper, published in the New York Botanical Garden Journal was on Apetahia raiateensis, a rare flower found only on the island of Raiatea in French Polynesia. He travelled to Polynesia many times, and translated Grammar of the Tahitian language from French into English. His family served as hosts for a time to two young people from Tahiti and Samoa.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water. The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|E

5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway <b>Board.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March 1983, Hadjoin finally {{completed}} {{the purchase of}} NBN, officially delisting the company. It had cost Parry A$6.76 per share to acquire 1,285,289 shares. Michael Wansey resigned from the <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the year}} as a result. In 1984, plans for a second independent station in Newcastle had failed. During that time, NBN and ABC Newcastle were asked to leave the VHF band to accommodate FM radio. NBN would have been on UHF channel 51, and ABC on UHF channel 48, however this did not eventuate. A proposal to launch a radiated subscription television service with community broadcasting during the daytime hours had also failed that year.|$|E
5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, {{against the advice of}} many of his peers. This experience was a poor one, as Brady was extremely difficult to work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft <b>Board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of 1918. His experience there was not much better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E

5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in active command of the blockade and on no account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the blockade and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the blockade squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
5|$|During 1938 and 1939, {{with war}} anticipated, an {{increasing}} part of Pick's {{time was spent}} in planning for the approaching conflict. The Railway Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1938 {{to act as a}} central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement {{with other members of the}} LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior management structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Ferraro co-founded the National Organization of Italian American Women, {{which sought}} to support the {{educational}} and professional goals of its members and put forward positive role models in order to fight ethnic stereotyping, and was still a distinguished member of its <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of her death. Ferraro was connected with many other political and non-profit organizations. She was {{a board member of}} the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She became president of the newly established International Institute for Women's Political Leadership in 1989. In 1992, she was on the founding board of Project Vote Smart. By 1993, she was serving on the Fordham Law School Board of Visitors, as well as on the boards of the National Breast Cancer Research Fund, the New York Easter Seal Society, and the Pension Rights Center, and was one of hundreds of public figures on the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Board of Advocates. In 1999, she joined the board of the Bertarelli Foundation, and in 2003, the board of the National Women's Health Resource Center. During the 2000s she was on the board of advisors to the Committee to Free Lori Berenson.|$|E

5|$|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially {{launched}} the bid {{process for the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. All then 203 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were invited to submit {{the name of a}} city within their jurisdiction until September 13, 2007. On September 14, the IOC recognized seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo—which had been put forward by their respective NOCs to bid. On October 1, 2007, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid the required fee of USD 150,000 to the IOC and signed the Candidature Acceptance Procedure. Soon after, from October 15 to 19, Rio officials attended the 2016 Applicant cities' Seminar organized by the IOC at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, where they learnt more about technical areas that would be analyzed throughout the application process. On January 14, 2008, the seven Applicant cities returned documents, known as the Application Files, containing the answers and guarantees requested by the 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure, which provided to the IOC an overview of each city's project. The responses were studied by the IOC Working Group for months and served as the basis to the shortlist of Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid on June 4, 2008, becoming Candidate cities during a meeting of the IOC Executive <b>Board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2008 SportAccord Convention in Athens, Greece.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord opened December with a {{home game}} against PSV. The {{visitors}} took an early lead but Boëtius scored an equalizer {{in the first half}} stoppage time. Pellè added a penalty goal in the second half; several minutes later he got another attempt which he missed. Pellè later added another goal to the tally for a 3–1 Feyenoord win. The team moved back into fourth place in the league table after the first 15 games of the season. On 8 December Feyenoord played SC Heerenveen on the road. Feyenoord scored twice within the first quarter of an hour; Boëtius opened the score and Immers doubled the lead. The game ended as a 2–1 win after Heerenveen got on the <b>board</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stroke of half-time. The win kept Feyenoord in fourth place in the Eredivisie standings. On 15 December, Feyenoord played FC Groningen at home. Pellè scored the lone goal of the game in the seventh minute of play. This third consecutive win kept Feyenoord in fourth place at the halfway mark of the season with 30 points from 17 matches. Feyenoord played their fourth round KNVB cup match in Almelo against Heracles Almelo on 18 December. Pellè scored after 11 minutes, Heracles equalized midway through the first half. Three minutes into extra time De Vrij received a second yellow card; Feyenoord kept the 1–1 score throughout extra time with ten men. In the penalty shootout all initial ten shooters scored. Clasie scored the sixth Feyenoord penalty before Heracles' Rienstra missed, sending Feyenoord to the quarter-finals of the KNVB Cup. Feyenoord's last game of 2013, at home against PEC Zwolle, marked their 2000th professional league game. They won the game 3–0 due to two first half goals in a seven-minute span by Immers and an early second half goal by Boëtius. This marked the last game before the winter break. Their five-game winning streak led them to fourth place in the league and the quarter-finals of the cup heading into the new year.|$|E
