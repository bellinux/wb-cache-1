5|$|Einstein {{contributed to}} these {{developments}} by linking {{them with the}} 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the <b>blackbody</b> curves at different temperature {{to be derived from}} one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which {{form the basis}} of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a <b>blackbody</b> spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E

The emissivity of these devices is usually inferred from return-loss experiments which may introduce at least 10 separate types of calibration errors.

The most overlooked errors are related to the geometry adapted in constructing refer- ence loads and to the effects of conduction or convection. Target shape and design can create an imbalance in the probabilities of absorption and emission. This leads to loss of radiative equilibrium, despite the presence of a thermodynamic steady state. Heat losses or gains, through conduction and convection, compensate for this unexpected physical condition.

The uncertainties in lamp-illuminated integrating spheres, a principal calibration artifact, ranging from 2 % to 3 % in the visible to near-infrared and 3 % to 5 % in the short-wave infrared, do not meet either current or future uncertainty requirements.

40|$|Abstract. Hot {{optically}} thick plasmas in {{the temperature}} range 10 5 <Teff < 10 6 K emit soft X-rays (∼ 0. 1 − 1 keV). The spectra are in zero order often approximated with <b>blackbodies.</b> Considering LTE-atmospheres as a better first order approximation Heise et al. (1994) show that these atmospheres are more efficient X-ray emitters than <b>blackbodies.</b> In this paper we study {{the assumption of}} Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) and present calculations of unblanketed, hot, high-gravity Non-LTE (NLTE) model atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium. The range of temperatures is chosen such that they emit significantly in the soft X-ray range (0. 1 − 2. 0 keV). The gravitational fields of g = 10 7. 5 − 10 10 cm s − 2 are applicable to massive white dwarfs. It appears that NLTE spectra are comparable to LTE spectra if log g ≥ 9, i. e. for the most massive white dwarfs (M ≥ 0. 6 M⊙).

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} counter-intuitive {{mechanism}} of constructing an ultrathin broadband transparent device with two perfect <b>blackbodies.</b> By introducing hybridization of plasmon modes, resonant modes with different symmetries coexist in this system. A broadband transmission spectrum {{in the near}} infrared regime is achieved through controlling their coupling strengths, which is governed by the thickness of high refractive index layer. Meanwhile, the transparency bandwidth {{is found to be}} tunable in a large range by varying the geometric dimension. More significantly, from the point view of applications, the proposed method of achieving broadband transparency can perfectly tolerate the misalignment and asymmetry of periodic nanoparticles on the top and bottom, which is empowered by the unique dual of coupling-in and coupling-out processes within the pair of <b>blackbodies.</b> Moreover, roughness has little influence on its transmission performance. According to the coupled mode theory, the distinguished transmittance performance is physically interpreted by the radiative decay rate of the entire system. In addition to the feature of uniquely robust broadband transparency, such a ultrathin seamless nanostructure (in the presence of a uniform silver layer) also provides polarization-independent and angle-independent operations. Therefore, it may power up a wide spectrum of exciting applications in thin film protection, touch screen techniques, absorber–emitter transformation, etc...|$|R

As a result, these spectra can be used to detect, identify and quantify information about the atoms and molecules. Spectroscopy is also used in astronomy and remote sensing on Earth.

25|$|Similar {{considerations}} apply {{whenever the}} energy level spacing {{is much larger}} than the thermal energy. For example, this reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of <b>blackbody</b> radiation. The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kBT, there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container. However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ν goes to infinity; moreover, Planck's law of black body radiation, which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.|$|E

Here, we estimate the photometric distance of 44 transiting exoplanetary systems. Parallaxes for seven systems confirm our methodology. Combining those measurements with fluxes obtained while planets were occulted by their host stars, we compose colour-magnitude diagrams in the near and mid-infrared. When possible, planets are plotted alongside very low mass stars and field brown dwarfs, who often share similar sizes and equilibrium temperatures. They offer a natural, empirical, comparison sample. We also include directly imaged exoplanets and the expected loci of pure <b>blackbodies.</b> Irradiated planets do not match blackbodies; their emission spectra are not featureless. For a given luminosity, hot Jupiters' daysides show a larger variety in colour than brown dwarfs do and display an increasing diversity in colour with decreasing intrinsic luminosity. The presence of an extra absorbent within the 4. 5 μm band would reconcile outlying hot Jupiters with ultra-cool dwarfs' atmospheres. Measuring the emission of gas giants cooler than 1000 K would disentangle whether planets' atmospheres behave more similarly to brown dwarfs' atmospheres than to <b>blackbodies,</b> whether they are akin to the young directly imaged planets, or if irradiated gas giants form their own sequence.
