We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E
500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

We got to the game <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the name. We realized we were making something that had a lot of cops in it and was really interesting to us, so we thought what can we call this? Eventually we thought this actually fits quite well with Hot Pursuit and went with it." ...|$|E

And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."

I commend First bank of Nigeria for their trail-blazing action. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to First Bank, we had approached a number of banks, but their concern was primarily and solely the profit motif. It is, therefore, a major achievement that First Bank, as the leading bank, truly, agreed to our proposal. This gesture from First Bank is one laced with patriotic zeal, as it {{had the potential to}} revolutionise the operations of small scale industrialists, and by extension the economy of Nigeria as a whole. The current Group managing Director of the bank: Mr. Bisi Onasanya, gave unqualified support to the project. Onasanya saw it as a key corporate social responsibility activity with multipier effects on the economy.|$|E
2500|$|Otis Redding {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding {{claimed that he}} did not know the lyrics of the song. [...] "I use a lot of words different than the Stones' version," [...] he noted. [...] "That's because I made them up." [...] Of that session, Steve Cropper said, [...] "...if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a piece of paper and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." [...] Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.|$|E
2500|$|In the group's early {{experimental}} demos, {{the band}} created {{a sound that}} {{was different from the}} many death-metal groups that were performing in Las Vegas at the time. The band signed a recording contract without having performed a live show. [...] "We never went out and played shows <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> signed because the music scene in Las Vegas is so bad. There's not a lot going on," [...] Smith said. [...] "In our practice space, there were something like 30 bands, and every day we'd walk into that room and hear the exact same death-metal bands. So it kind of influenced us to be different. And to get out of Las Vegas." [...] Urie began working at Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Summerlin to afford rent for the band's new practice space. The four left their educations behind to concentrate on music; Ross had a falling out with his father when he dropped out of college, and when Urie {{dropped out of high school}} his parents kicked him out of the house. He stayed with friends until he could afford to rent an apartment.|$|E
60|$|In our own love-sick days {{we often}} used to go and relate to various people all the {{touching}} conversations that took place between our lady-love and ourselves; but our friends never seemed to get excited over it.

But when Eerie came in with that galloping bass-line, it all kind of fell into place. It has a lot of energy to it and was probably one of the best songs on that album.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> what we wanted." ...|$|E

"This path {{will lead}} you to the brook," [...] he said; [...] "follow its {{northern}} bank until {{you come to a}} fall; and mount the hill on your right, and you will see the fires of the other people. There you must go and demand protection; if they are true Delawares, you will be safe. A distant flight with that gentle one, just now, is impossible.

We had been told that there was plenty of game on the river, and that most gentlemen who took the trip carried guns. Rectus wanted to get two rifles, but I thought one was enough.
