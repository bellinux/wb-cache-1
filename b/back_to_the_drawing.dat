He {{lost his}} first title try, when Robinson won {{a decision in}} 15 rounds. <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board, he beat Rocky Castellani, the then lightweight world champion Beau Jack, and Laurent Dauthuille (the latter of whom fought Gavilan in Montreal, Canada). All of them were beaten by decision in ten. In 1950, he went 10-4-1, beating Billy Graham, Sonny Horne, Robert Villemain, Eugene Hairston, and Tony Janiro among others.|$|E

The new prototype G-AMAV first flew from Brooklands on 28 August 1950, {{and served as a}} development aircraft for the type for several years. In late August 1950, BEA placed an order for 20 aircraft; further orders would come in the following year from operators such as Air France, Aer Lingus and Misrair. In 1953, the basic cost given for a Viscount was £235,000.|$|E
25|$|Mir was {{expected}} to face Cain Velasquez on May 25, 2012, at UFC 146. However, on April 20, 2012, Dana White announced that Mir would face Brazilian Junior dos Santos for the UFC Heavyweight Championship, replacing kickboxer Alistair Overeem. On May 11, 2012, UFC Primetime returned to promote the fight between Mir and dos Santos, and concluded on May 25. In their fight, Dos Santos {{was able to use}} superior foot work to strike in and out before Mir could mount any significant offense. Mir lost the fight via TKO in the second round and has since said he will go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and continue his career.|$|E
25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was {{that the only way}} in and out was through the top – {{there was no way to}} escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and came up with a new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E

25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board to do further experimenting with his secret lead pencil paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Surrey may 'drop its opposition' after BAA offered to fund £11 million of transport improvements and a vote to provisionally drop their opposition was passed by the county's cabinet on 28 September 2010. This decision was due to be finalised by the full council in December 2010 but was deferred. The move was the subject of an 'extraordinary outburst' from Philip Hammond, the local MP, who at the time happened to be the Secretary of State for Transport. Hammond criticised the council for 'grabbing a bribe', a payment of £11 million towards mitigating some traffic problems in Egham entirely unconnected to Airtrack and went on to demand a more comprehensive solution, saying 'no solution, no scheme' and urging BAA to 'get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board'. BAA had made a significant compromise in offering this payment as it had previously been consistent in arguing that traffic problems caused by Airtrack were not its responsibility, using the fact that Network Rail has no legal obligation to open level crossings at all or to consult on changes.|$|E

[...] The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, [...] " [...] if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board." [...] In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as Wii U.|$|E
500|$|Vicious Cycle went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> {{board and}} {{produced}} a new concept that they felt was darker and better suited to an older audience. [...] The [...] "head-switching" [...] game mechanic had been praised by the potential publishers and was kept, {{but this time the}} cartoonish, childlike Geo was replaced by an angry, vengeful private detective named Fred Neuman. [...] The world of Prime was replaced with the bleak, film noir-esque city of Hope Falls, where Fred would seek revenge against those who had wronged him. [...] Vicious Cycle presented the new project to Sony, who promptly approved the game for the PSP, despite it not having secured a publisher. [...] Shortly afterwards, the project was picked up by D3Publisher.|$|E

500|$|Supporters' {{groups have}} {{fought against the}} club moving to a new stadium twice. In 2007 a group was {{established}} called Keep Everton in Our City (KEIOC) whose aim is to keep Everton FC inside the city of Liverpool. The KEIOC attempted to prevent the club moving to a new stadium in Kirkby, just outside the city limits. The supporters' groups have argued {{that it is possible}} to expand Goodison Park, despite the odd shaped landlocked site being surrounded by housing, local authority buildings, and have produced image renders, architectural drawings and costings for a redeveloped Goodison Park. The then Liverpool City Council leader Warren Bradley stated in November 2009 that a redevelopment of Goodison Park was his favoured option, and that relocation of the homes, infrastructure and businesses in streets adjoining the ground is [...] "not a major hurdle". [...] The current Council leader Joe Anderson stated, [...] "the setback for Everton was an opportunity for both clubs to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{successful}} tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The minelayer Ord laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable. [...] The USS O'Brien was fitted with receiving equipment {{and attempted to}} follow the cable out of the Channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where {{a break in the}} cable prevented the signal from continuing. [...] The break in the cable was repaired, but {{over the course of the}} winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable. [...] Going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable.

During this time in 1994 they recruited Taka Hirose via an advert in Loot, which Taka placed himself. The band then changed their name to Feeder, named after Grant's pet goldfish. They won their recording contract with Echo after sending a demo tape, and then completed the deal after an employee from the label witnessed one of the band's gigs. A track called [...] "Don't Bring Me Down", which featured on the demo appeared as a b-side on the [...] "Day In Day Out" [...] single, albeit a different version to the demo recording. After signing with The Echo Label in 1994, the group toured with Scarborough band B.l.o.w. who at the time, recently formed {{from the ashes of}} Little Angels.

500|$|To {{proceed with}} the project, which Asus code-named [...] "Project A-Team", the company sent a design team to Google's {{headquarters}} in Mountain View, California, while Google sent seven engineers to Asus' headquarters in Taiwan. Having employees working in both locations allowed the engineering team to have a 24-hour development cycle, although Shih later needed to add 40 people to the project to meet Google's requests. The design for the Nexus7 {{was based on a}} tablet that Asus had showcased at International CES that year, the Eee Pad MeMO ME370T. An official explained, [...] "While the base design and setup was completed in the 370T to meet a certain price point and option list, the efforts required to get that design to $199 meant going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and starting over on just about every aspect of the unit." [...] Among the component modifications were a new motherboard, revised system on a chip (SoC), laminated display, and rear casing with a grippier material.

On January 9, 2006, GameSpot {{reported}} that Electronic Arts had renewed its trademark protection on the System Shock name, leading to speculation that System Shock 3 might be under development. Three days later, Computer and Video Games reported a reliable source had come forward and confirmed the title's production. Electronic Arts UK made no comment when confronted with the information. PC Gamer UK stated the team behind [...] (EA Redwood Shores) was charged with its creation. Ken Levine, when asked whether he would helm the third installment, replied: [...] "that question is completely out of my hands". He expressed optimism {{at the prospect of}} System Shock 3, but revealed that EA had not shown interest in his own proposal for a sequel, and was not optimistic with regards to their abilities. Electronic Arts did not confirm a new title in the series and allowed the System Shock trademark registration to lapse. Redwood Shores' next release was 2008's Dead Space, a game with noted similarities in theme and presentation to the System Shock series. According to Dead Space designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell, their project was originally intended to be System Shock 3, before the release of Resident Evil 4 inspired them to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board and develop it into something more along those lines, eventually becoming Dead Space.|$|E
