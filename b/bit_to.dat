5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By the autumn of 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the Williams tube from one <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that {{it was able to}} store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.|$|E
25|$|Side reins {{are usually}} used for more {{advanced}} horses. They give the horse something {{to take contact}} with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help develop self-carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too low. Side reins may be attached from the <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the surcingle rings, or from the <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the billets of the girth.|$|E
25|$|Dravid's {{early years}} in {{international}} cricket mirrored his international debut. While he straightaway {{made a name for}} himself in Test cricket, he had to struggle quite a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> make a mark in ODIs.|$|E
50|$|The first dollar {{consisted}} of various cut or holed Spanish dollars and other Spanish colonial coins. The dollar was subdivided into bits (worth 9 pence). Before 1813, there were 11 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the holed dollar (12½ <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> an unholed dollar). After 1813, there were 16 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the holed dollar (18 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> an unholed dollar). In 1842, sterling was established {{as the official}} currency of the island.|$|R
2500|$|Because E is {{an integer}} {{in the range}} 0 to 1023, up <b>to</b> 10 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> {{the left of the}} radix point are needed to {{represent}} the integer part of the logarithm. [...] Because M falls in the range , the value of [...] will fall in the range [...] so at least 52 <b>bits</b> are needed <b>to</b> the right of the radix point to represent the fractional part of the logarithm. [...] Combining 10 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the left of the radix point with 52 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the right of the radix point means that the significand part of the logarithm must be computed to at least 62 bits of precision. [...] In practice values of M less than [...] require 53 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the right of the radix point and values of M less than [...] require 54 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the right of the radix point to avoid precision loss. [...] Balancing this requirement for added precision {{to the right of the}} radix point, exponents less than 512 only require 9 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the left of the radix point and exponents less than 256 require only 8 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> the left of the radix point.|$|R
30|$|In essence, the {{transformation}} technique corrects {{the problem of}} non-uniform intensity, where too much <b>bits</b> belong <b>to</b> high intensities and too few <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> low intensities.|$|R
25|$|A bit {{consists}} of two basic components, the bit mouthpiece that goes inside the horse's mouth, and the bit rings of a snaffle bit or shanks of a curb <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> which the bridle and reins attach.|$|E
25|$|Subtract {{the partial}} product {{resulting}} from the MSB (pseudo sign bit) instead of adding it like the other partial products. This method requires the multiplicand's sign <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> be extended by one position, being preserved during the shift right actions.|$|E
25|$|Some of the Russian locals played along, in a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> ensure {{cultural}} survival. Among {{the latter}} was actor Vasily Vronsky (Vasile Vronschi), who knew Pântea from Chișinău, and who received permission to establish the Russian-language Vronsky Theater; granted Romanian citizenship, he gave speeches denouncing Soviet agitprop.|$|E
2500|$|The DEC Alpha {{processor}} divides memory into [...] pages. [...] After a TLB miss, low-level firmware {{machine code}} (here called PALcode) walks a three-level tree-structured page table. [...] Addresses are broken down as follows: 21 bits unused, 10 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> index the root {{level of the}} tree, 10 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> index the middle level of the tree, 10 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> index the leaf level of the tree, and 13 bits that pass through to the physical address without modification. [...] Full read/write/execute permission bits are supported.|$|R

25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to use all four privilege levels, because the current Operating Systems like Windows, Linux, etc. mostly are using Paging mechanism and Paging only has one <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> specify the privilege level which is either Supervisor or User (U/S Bit). Windows NT uses the two-level system.|$|E
25|$|Pirin is {{also home}} to two small glaciers, {{remnants}} from the last Ice Age. Snezhnika is located in the deep Golemiya Kazan cirque at the steep northern foot of Vihren and is the southernmost glacier in Europe. Banski Suhodol Glacier is larger and situated a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the north below Koncheto Ridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} useful in {{simplifying}} the implementation of arithmetic on computer hardware. Adding 0011(3) to 1111(1) at first seems to give the incorrect answer of 10010. However, the hardware can simply ignore the left-most <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> give the correct answer of 0010(2). Overflow checks still must exist to catch operations such as summing 0100 and 0100.|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{one-dimensional}} quantizer design, some papers focus on assigning a varying number of quantization <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> each feature. So far, several bit allocation principles have been proposed: fixed bit allocation (FBA) [10, 11, 17] simply assigns a fixed number of <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> each feature. On the contrary, the detection rate optimized bit allocation (DROBA) [19] {{and the area}} under the FRR curve optimized bit allocation (AUF-OBA) [20], assign a variable number of <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> each feature, according to the features' distinctiveness. Generally, AUF-OBA and DROBA outperform FBA.|$|R

25|$|Lipped shipwright's adze - A {{variation}} of the shipwright's adze. It features a wider than normal bit, whose outside edges are sharply turned up, so that when gazing directly down the adze, from <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> eye, the cutting edge resembles an extremely wide and often very flat U. This adze was mainly used for shaping cross grain, such as for joining planks.|$|E
25|$|Une Larme du diable (1839) ("The Devil's Tear") {{was written}} shortly after Gautier's trip to Belgium in 1836. The work is {{considered}} an imitation of a Medieval mystery play, a type of drama popular in the 14th century. These plays were usually performed in churches because they were religious in nature. In Gautier's play God cheats a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> win a bet with Satan. The play is humorous and preaches both in favour and against human love.|$|E

50|$|The {{successor}} of the 701 was {{the index}} register-equipped IBM 704, introduced 4 {{years after the}} 701. The 704 was not compatible with the 701, however, as the 704 increased the size of instructions from 18 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> 36 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> support the extra features. The 704 also marked the transition to magnetic core memory.|$|R

25|$|Yet they cannot boil it all, for – first, fuel is very scarce; {{that which}} is {{supplied}} weekly would not cook a meal a day…and they have to search the already bare kopjes for a supply. There is hardly a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> be had. Second, they have no extra utensil to hold the water when boiled. I propose, therefore, to give each tent a pail or crock, and get a proclamation issued that all drinking water must be boiled.|$|E
25|$|Drawbridges are {{mentioned}} in 1318, {{and the general}} urban code from the mid 14th century prescribes six cities around Lake Mälaren - Arboga, Enköping, Sigtuna, Strängnäs, Västerås and Uppsala - to share the costs of maintenance with Stockholm, thus indicating the bridge wasn't merely {{of interest to the}} city, but {{a vital part of the}} regional road system. These neighbouring cities gradually came to question this obligation however, and during the 16th and 17th centuries Stockholm was, bit by <b>bit,</b> <b>to</b> take charge of the bridge alone.|$|E
25|$|The First Test was, I {{honestly}} think, the dullest {{and most}} depressing I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The answer is that the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> spare.|$|E
25|$|The Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE), {{which extends}} the {{physical}} address size from 32 <b>bits</b> <b>to</b> 40 <b>bits,</b> was added <b>to</b> the ARMv7-A architecture in 2011.|$|R

25|$|Very high {{rotational}} speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this {{translates to}} a reasonably fast linear {{speed of the}} cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, particularly if {{the angle of the}} <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practicable, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.|$|E
25|$|In mid-March 2013, both {{countries}} began to withdraw their {{forces from the}} border area in a <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> creating a demilitarised buffer zone and resume South Sudanese oil production for export through Sudan. In early April South Sudanese oil started to flow through pipelines in Sudan again. Though Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir threatened to cut oil transit through his country from South Sudan, South Sudanese President Salvar Kiir accused him of mobilising for war {{and said that he}} would not go to war over the oil transit issue.|$|E
25|$|A router may {{be mounted}} {{upside down in}} a router table or bench. The router's base plate is mounted to the {{underside}} of the table, with a hole allowing the <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> protrude above the table top. This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and makes some router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|E
