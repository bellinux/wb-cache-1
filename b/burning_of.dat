40|$|In this study, <b>burning</b> {{velocities}} <b>of</b> hydrogen-carbon monoxide (H 2 -CO) mixtures, {{which are}} primary constituents of syngas fuels, are measured. The effect of different burner systems, H 2 concentration, and different measurement techniques on the <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -CO mixtures is also discussed. The <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -CO mixtures increase {{with the increase}} in H 2 content in the mixture. When compared with different burner systems using different methods, the burning velocity data almost coincide in the lean condition, but at rich condition the data stray away from each other. The <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> actual syngas compositions (based on different sources of coal) are then measured and analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} diluents on the <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> syngas mixtures. As diluents, carbon dioxide (CO 2) plays a dominating role on the burning velocity when compared to nitrogen (N 2). Finally, the <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -methane (CH 4) mixtures are measured to determine the effect H 2 on the <b>burning</b> velocities <b>of</b> H 2 -CH 4 mixtures. ...|$|R

5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts are inconsistent {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread <b>burning</b> <b>of</b> heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{disagreement}} in the published {{data on the}} effect of pressure on the <b>burning</b> velocity <b>of</b> laminar flames a general study was undertaken at the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory to determine the variation <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> velocity with pressure by the burner-area method. This report is a portion of that study. The mixtures utilized for this investigation were ethylene-air, isobutylene-air, propylene-oxygen-nitrogen, and propylene-air. Expressing the pressure dependence <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> velocity as p[superscript n], the value found for n is ? 0. 13 for ethylene-air, - 0. 186 for isobutylene-air, - 0. 153 for propylene-oxygen-nitrogen, and ? 0. 132 for propylene-air. The results compare reasonably well with the experimental findings of Pardee (10), Cullen (6), and Culshaw and Garside (5). At atmospheric pressure the values <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> velocity <b>of</b> the mixtures studied in this report are in close agreement with several experimental investigators. Also investigated was the effect on the <b>burning</b> velocity <b>of</b> a mixture of acetylene-oxygen with the addition of helium. The trend found is that the <b>burning</b> velocity <b>of</b> an acetylene-oxygen mixture increases with the addition of helium up to a maximum at a certain percentage of helium and then decreases as more helium is added...|$|R
