50|$|The horse {{training}} methods {{shown are}} not entirely without controversy. While Brannaman was the on-site technical consultant, {{he did not have}} creative control. The constraints of film-making required a number of sequences to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>length,</b> thus not showing some critical training elements that would normally be used. A few basic safety problems in the film include Redford kneeling in front of a horse known to charge humans in one scene, and wearing a large ring on his finger while training in another, a risky practice in the real world when simultaneously handling a dangerous horse and a rope.|$|R

For unknown reasons, the mixing of several cues are executed with gain levels so high that it causes distortion. This is noticeable particularly during the action cues and the reprise of the love theme in track 14, [...] "One Last Shot". It is also noted that besides the first two cues, the tracks' generic names were unrelated to their contents. According to the official website of composer Geoff Zanelli, this was because the production [...] "schedule was so short that they had to decide on the track names for the album packaging before the score was even written!" ...|$|R

500|$|The chase {{scene at}} the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne {{throughout}} the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said [...] "we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax". Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher, two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some <b>were</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>length</b> and pacing, but none were cut altogether.|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulties}} of K- 12 education have become familiar to {{citizens of the}} metroscape, but they are usually viewed {{through the lens of}} urban and suburban schools, with their problems of multi-ethnic populations, crowded classrooms, strained budgets, and the like. Metroscape® was curious about the struggles and triumphs of the schools in the rural areas of the region, so we sent our interviewer, Susan Wilson, a Portland freelance writer, to Willamina to talk to a small town education leader in hopes of glimpsing the realities of schooling kids in that often overlooked setting. A small-town principal is a versatile member of a close-knit community. When Tim France rolls up his sleeves to get to work, he might be chairing a committee meeting to discuss fundraising efforts, or he might be in a huddle on the football field coaching his team through a winning season. He leads an entirely different kind of team in his full-time job as principal at Willamina High School, a job requires that energetic leadership and a game plan all its own.

40|$|In this two part {{article we}} reflect upon the {{experience}} of writing-dancing with audiences and artists {{in the context of}} our installation work skript (commissioned by Dance 4, Nottingham, 2013). Part one considers how skript engages embodied, felt sense, improvisational and collaborative modalities in relation to the act of writing. As such we consider {{the ways in which the}} particular interface of language and embodiment, which is the focus of skript, might allow a knowing of ‘something’ otherwise – be that something a sense of our own bodies, a dance work, a performance experience or perhaps just that moment in time. In part two we share extracts of some of the writings that were collaboratively generated as part of skript. We focus on the work of three performance/movement artists: Guy Dartnell, Miguel Pereira and Rosalind Crisp. These dance-writings are published as they were written in real time, in the moment of engagement. They <b>are</b> <b>edited</b> only <b>for</b> <b>length</b> and at times to correct typographical errors (but only if the errors seemed to disturb the flow of the ideas) rather than to simply ‘tidy’ the text or the grammar. The writings are relational, improvisational and at times fragmentary. For more writings see: www. writing-dancing. blogspot. com...|$|R

Content was also sometimes altered; mating scenes in particular were often removed from the US version. Animal Planet US occasionally changed the names of meerkats and episode titles.

De la Soul (named for the rap group of the same name), one of the sisters who started the Starsky group, was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to actress Whoopi Goldberg, an early fan of the series. Animal Planet US has also renamed some of Flower's pups born in season three to honour two other famous fans of the show, Elizabeth Taylor and Denis Leary. Several episodes were renamed: the title of the final episode of the second series was changed from [...] "The Killing Fields" [...] to [...] "The Quiet Fields".
