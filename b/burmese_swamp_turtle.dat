50|$|Acanthochelys is a genus of <b>turtles,</b> the spiny <b>swamp</b> <b>turtles,</b> in {{the family}} Chelidae, {{subfamily}} Chelinae, found in South America.

50|$|The smaller {{members of}} the family include the Macleay river turtle (Emydura macquarii) at around 16 cm, twist-necked turtle (Platemys platycephala) at 18 cm and the western <b>swamp</b> <b>turtle</b> (Pseudemydura umbrina) at 15 cm, whereas the larger species such as the mata mata (Chelus fimbriata) and the white-throated {{snapping}} turtle (Elseya albagula) both exceed 45 cm in shell length.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{specimen}} {{of the western}} <b>swamp</b> <b>turtle</b> was collected by Ludwig Preiss in 1839 and sent to Vienna Museum. There it was labelled [...] "New Holland" [...] and was named Pseudemydura umbrina 1901 by Seibenrock. No further collection of specimens was recorded until 1953. Glauert in 1954 named these specimens Emydura inspectata, but in 1958, Ernest Williams of Harvard University showed them to be synonyms of P. umbrina, collected by Preiss.|$|R

Some of the important birds found here are the sea eagle, osprey, golden eagle, common merganser, eagle owl, black stork, black woodpecker, and corn crake. <b>Swamp</b> <b>turtles</b> also live in Obra's waters. Over 40 species of mammals roam the area around the Obra, including beaver, river otter, deer, badgers, hare, and wild boar. Fish species found in Obra include catfish, river trout, grayling, lake trout, powan, barbel, and salmon.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>swamp</b> <b>turtle</b> aestivates {{to survive}} hot summers in the ephemeral swamps it lives in. It buries itself in various media which change {{depending}} on location and available substrates. Because {{the species is}} critically endangered, the Perth Zoo began a conservation and breeding program for it. However, zookeepers were unaware {{of the importance of}} their aestivation cycle and during the first summer period would perform weekly checks on the animals. This repeated disturbance was detrimental {{to the health of the}} animals, with many losing significant weight and some dying. The zookeepers quickly changed their procedures and now leave their captive turtles undisturbed during their aestivation period.|$|R

50|$|The colour of {{the western}} <b>swamp</b> <b>turtle</b> varies {{dependent}} on age and the environment where it is found. Typical coloration for hatchlings is grey above with bright cream and black below. The colour of adults varies with differing swamp conditions, and varies from medium yellow-brown in clay swamps to almost black with a maroon tinge in the black coffee-coloured water ofsandy swamps. Plastron colour is variable, from yellow to brown or occasionally black; often there are black spots on a yellow background with black edges to the scutes. The legs are short and covered in scale-like scutes and the feet have well-developed claws. The short neck is covered with horny tubercles and {{on the top of}} the head is a large single scute. It is the smallest chelid found in Australia.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rich}} wetland {{habitats}} of Akyatan, hylidae, marsh frog and European green toad {{can be observed}} in large numbers. There are also records of observed European otter. The area is also rich with reptiles; the common species are green turtle and loggerhead turtle. Green turtle is a globally endangered species and in the Mediterranean, the species is considered as critically endangered (IUCN 2000) with only 200-300 nesting females remaining, 43% of all nests being at Akyatan, making it the most significant breeding areas of green turtles at the Mediterranean. Adding Kazanlı and Samandağ beaches, Çukurova region holds 62% of the Mediterranean nesting population. Caspian <b>turtle</b> and <b>swamp</b> <b>turtle</b> is common at the fresh water ponds and canals. Tortoise is seen often at the dunes.

5000|$|Clark's {{reports about}} the finds rekindled {{interest}} in the bird. Sir Richard Owen and Alfred Newton both wanted to be first to describe the post-cranial anatomy of the dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in Memoir on the Dodo in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on the Edwards's Dodo painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton moved his focus to the Réunion solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums. In 1889, Théodor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the [...] "historical souvenirs" [...] of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes.

Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.Louis Etienne Thirioux, an amateur naturalist at Port Louis, also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations. They included the first articulated specimen, which is the first subfossil dodo skeleton found outside the Mare aux Songes, and the only remains of a juvenile specimen, a now lost tarsometatarsus. The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near Le Pouce mountain, and is the only known complete skeleton of an individual dodo. Thirioux donated the specimen to the Museum Desjardins (now Natural History Museum at Mauritius Institute). Thrioux's heirs sold a second mounted composite skeleton (composed of at least two skeletons, with a mainly reconstructed skull) to the Durban Museum of Natural Science in South Africa in 1918. Together, these two skeletons represent the most completely known dodo remains, including bone elements previously unrecorded (such as knee-caps and various wing bones). Though some contemporary writers noted the importance of Thrioux's specimens, they were not scientifically studied, and were largely forgotten until 2011, when sought out by a group of researchers. The mounted skeletons were laser scanned, from which 3-D models were reconstructed, which became the basis of a 2016 monograph about the osteology of the dodo. [...] In 2006, explorers discovered a complete skeleton of a dodo in a lava cave in Mauritius. This was only the second associated skeleton of an individual specimen everfound, and the only one in recent times.|$|R
