40|$|This paper {{presents}} two computational {{techniques for}} determining the structural capability of <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> systems, which are typically used in launch vehicle applications. Both techniques utilize three-dimensional finite element models (3 D FEM) and consider contact between all {{the components of the}} <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system. One technique models the full circumference of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> structure, while the other technique models a circumferential slice of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system and uses cyclic symmetry. The analytical predictions for the full 3 D model show reasonable agreement with test data. The cyclic symmetry model underestimates the capability of the hardware to withstand applied loads. Numerical studies were also performed to investigate how physical parameters, such as friction and band pre-tension, affect the structural capability of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system. I. Description of a <b>Clamp</b> <b>Band</b> System A <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> is a type of joint that does not require the use of mechanical fasteners or adhesives on either of the components that are being mated, Figure 1. <b>Clamp</b> <b>band</b> systems are used extensively on systems that require remote separation of the components, and <b>clamp</b> <b>bands</b> are suitable since they are typically released via pyrotechnic devices. This characteristic makes <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> systems an obvious choice for spacecraft deployment and they are used for...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> {{system is}} a typical locked and {{separated}} device of the launch vehicle (LV) / the spacecraft (SC), and its release-separation process {{is one of the}} important factors that affect the LV/SC separation movement. A nonlinear spring-damper model was employed to describe the contact-impact behavior between the V-segment of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> and the LV/SC interface, and lumped mass method was used to depict the <b>clamp</b> <b>band.</b> By using ADAMS, a dynamic model of the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system was established. The simulation results show that the impulse of the explosive bolts and the stiffness of lateral-restraining springs have significant effects on the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> dynamic envelope. The shock of the satellite-vehicle separation is very vulnerable to the <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> pretension and the friction coefficient between the V-segment and the LV/SC interface...|$|R

40|$|Modern turbochargers {{typically}} {{comprise a}} body in three parts; the turbine and compressor housings and the bearing housing.

40|$|Previous work on {{the elastic}} {{deformation}} of flat-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> has been extended to account for plastic deformation of the band material. Both finite element analysis using a multilinear plastic model and a classical approach using a continuous plastic equation are reported. The excellent agreement between {{the results of these}} two approaches provides a high level of confidence in the models. The finite element approach was found to be extremely time consuming owing to the combination of changing contact non-linearity and material non-linearity. The classical approach provided a much faster solution method when used with the iteration schemes proposed here. The classical method of analysis was used to determine the response to a range of conditions. This analysis showed that there might be some advantage in driving flat-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> into the partially plastic state. In this state the coefficient of friction has far less impact on the variation in circumferential stress, and hence radial clamping force, around the ban...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{torsional}} load capacity of three sizes of V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> when assembled onto rigid flanges by comparing experimental data with a developed theoretical model. This {{mode of failure}} {{is of particular interest}} for turbocharger applications where, in use, they are subjected to torsional loading via thermal and vibrational effects. The theoretical model developed allows the impact on torsional load capacity of a number of joint parameters to be investigated and good correlation of the results, incorporating variations in coefficients of friction and dimensions, has been shown for the two larger band sizes. For smaller diameter bands, the experimental data suggests that as the band is tightened, contact with the flange is localised rather than being over the full circumference of the band. The coefficients of friction, in particular that between the flanges, and the position of the contact point between band and flange have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} the theoretical torsional load capacity of V-section <b>band</b> <b>clamps...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The oval-section {{fuselage}} was a frameless monocoque shell {{built in}} two vertically-separate halves formed over a mahogany or concrete mould. Pressure was applied with <b>band</b> <b>clamps.</b> The shell sandwich skins comprised birch three-ply outers, with cores of Ecuadorean balsa. In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core. The main {{areas of the}} sandwich skin were only [...] thick. Together with various forms of wood reinforcement, often of laminated construction, the sandwich skin gave great stiffness and torsional resistance. The separate fuselage halves speeded construction, permitting access by personnel working in parallel with others, as the work progressed.|$|R

Several of these modifications were based upon Colt's contract model 1861, known as the [...] "Colt special". 273,265 Type I variants were manufactured in 1863.|$|R
40|$|In small spacecraft, the {{proximity}} of sensitive components to release systems {{has led to the}} need for lowshock spacecraft release systems. Marmon band systems are often desirable for their flight history, structural capability, and reliability. Until recently, only pyrotechnically released <b>clamp</b> <b>bands</b> were readily available. The <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system described in ths paper reduces shock in two ways: it eliminates shock typically associated with pyrotechnic release devices as well as utilizing a release device that reduces the shock associated with the rapid release of the preload strain energy. Patented Fast Acting Shockless Separation Nut (FASSN) technology is utilized to convert strain energy stored in the system into rotational energy of a flywheel. Early FASSN devices were designed for discrete point applications and were somewhat large and massive. Additional development of the FASSN device has reduced the size and weight to enable the use of the technology in a medium sized (12 to 24 inch diameter) <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> system. This paper describes the overall design, performance, and initial test results for the FASSN-based, non-pyrotechnic, low-shock <b>clamp</b> <b>band</b> release system...|$|R
50|$|The oval-section {{fuselage}} was a frameless monocoque shell {{built in}} two halves being formed to shape by <b>band</b> <b>clamps</b> over a mahogany or concrete mould, each holding {{one half of}} the fuselage, split vertically. The shell halves were made of sheets of Ecuadorean balsawood sandwiched between sheets of Canadian birch, but in areas needing extra strength— such as along cut-outs— stronger woods replaced the balsa filler; the overall thickness of the birch and balsa sandwich skin was only 7/16 in. This sandwich skin was so stiff that no internal reinforcement was necessary from the wing's rear spar to the tail bearing bulkhead. The join along the vertical centre line greatly aided construction as it allowed technicians easy access to the fuselage interior.|$|R

Despite the wide application of V-band clamps, their behaviour is not fully understood and the ultimate axial strength is currently only available from physical testing. This physical testing has indicated that the ultimate strength is determined by {{two different types of}} structural deformation, an elastic deformation mode and a plastic deformation mode. Initial finite element analysis work has demonstrated that analysis of this class of problem is not straightforward. This paper discusses the difficulties encountered when simulating this type of component interaction where contact is highly localised and contact pressures are high and therefore presents a finite element model to predict the ultimate axial load capacity of V-band clamps...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{advantages}} of using of external active confinement to improve the compression load capacity of concrete cylinders using mild steel <b>band</b> <b>clamps.</b> For this, passive and actively pre-stressed steel bands have been attached to concrete cylinders to mimic real structural columns which may otherwise have to be removed and replaced due to poor strength performance. The experimental programme included compression load testing a number of unreinforced concrete cylindrical specimens to establish the effect the confinement had on the compressive load-carrying capacity and the stress-strain behaviour. A number of parameters were investigated in the study including the effect of varying the band spacing, volumetric ratio and passive and active confining forces. It was found that confining the concrete did produce an increase in compressive strength. However, the different levels of pre-stress used had no significant effect on strength but did influence the confined concrete stress-strain behaviour with greater lateral stresses at peak strength observed. Ductility increases were observed for confined specimens and significant axial strains achieved with noticeable peak strength enhancements. However, due to initial misfit between the bands and the concrete in the passive confinement state, confining forces generated only contained the cracked specimens. The actively pre-stressing confinement yielded an increase in load capacity of 53 % as the bands were fully activated...|$|R
