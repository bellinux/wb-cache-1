5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are a multiple of x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this <b>base</b> <b>number</b> include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E

A third way to indicate a plural is the (untranslatable) particle jijná'an, which can be placed before or after verbs, pronouns, or nouns.|$|E

2500|$|Canadian born Australian {{touring car}} driver Allan Moffat was {{instrumental}} in bringing Mazda into the Australian touring car scene which ran to Group C regulations unique to Australia. Over a four-year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the 1983 Australian Touring Car Championship, {{as well as a}} trio of Bathurst 1000 podiums, in 1981 (3rd with Derek Bell), 1983 (second with Yoshimi Katayama) and 1984 (third with former motorcycle champion Gregg Hansford). Privateer racer Peter McLeod drove his RX-7 to win the 1983 Australian Endurance Championship, while Moffat won the Endurance title in 1982 and 1984. Australia's adoption of international Group A regulations, combined with Mazda's reluctance to homologate a Group A RX-7 (meaning that a <b>base</b> <b>number</b> of 5,000 had to be built, plus another 500 [...] "evolution" [...] models), ended Mazda's active participation in Australian touring car racing {{at the end of the}} 1984 season.

[...] Bailey iron bench planes were designated by number respective to the length of the plane. [...] This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. [...] A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. [...] A typical smoothing plane (approx. nineinches) is usually a No. 4, jack planes at about fourteeninches are No. 5, an eighteen inch foreplane will be a No. 6, and the jointer planes at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8 respectively. [...] A designation, such as No. 4½ indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation, such as 5-1/2 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation, such as 5-1/4 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3).
