25|$|Direct {{extrusion}}, {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing the <b>billet</b> in a heavy walled container. The <b>billet</b> is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the <b>billet</b> to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the <b>billet</b> is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the <b>billet</b> to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the <b>billet</b> is used up. At the end of the <b>billet</b> the force greatly increases because the <b>billet</b> is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the <b>billet</b> (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.|$|R

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of <b>billets</b> in civilian housing.|$|E

5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium <b>billets</b> {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|In June, {{during a}} brief period away from the line in <b>billets,</b> the battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Brigade, was {{reviewed}} by the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes near Fleurbaix. Following this, although several units from I Anzac Corps took part in a number of raids against the German line during late June and early July, the 2nd Battalion was not involved and as such, apart from experiencing some enemy shelling, the 2nd Battalion's first significant action came at Pozières in July 1916. The battalion entered the line on the night of 19/20 July as the 1st was sent forward to relieve the British 68th Brigade along with the 3rd Brigade; just after midnight the 2nd Battalion, after an approach march over which they had endured gas attack, arrived at its position opposite the south-western side of the village.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. United States Readiness Command (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, {{did not appear to}} have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General James Lindsay, had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the Secretary of Defense that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide <b>billets</b> and facilities for USSOCOM. President Ronald Reagan approved {{the establishment}} of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC).

The change {{rules of}} the <b>billet</b> {{temperature}} field and extrusion load are the significant basis for the optimal design of the needle piercing extrusion process based on ingot <b>billet</b> for the manufacture of large-diameter thick-walled tube. Taking the needle piercing extrusion process of a 7075 aluminum alloy tube with sizes of Φ 500 mmx 400 mm/ 6000 mm as study object, we developed a precise FE model for the process under DEFORM- 2 D environment, then numerically revealed the distributions and evolution {{rules of the}} <b>billet</b> temperature field, and obtained {{the effects of the}} extrusion speed and initial <b>billet</b> temperature on the <b>billet</b> temperature filed and extrusion load. The results show that the peak extrusion load decreases linearly with the increase of initial <b>billet</b> temperature but is insensitive to the extrusion speed, and that the peak temperature rises with the increase of the extrusion speed and initial <b>billet</b> temperature, and always locates {{on the surface of the}} initially extruded tube close to the exit of the cavity die...|$|R

5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty <b>billets,</b> which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} 51st Army joined the North Caucasian Front at Kuban. In July, Marshal Budenny received orders {{to combine the}} Southern Front and North Caucasian Front into a single formation retaining the title of North Caucasian Front, and 51st Army joined the 'Don group' of that front under General Lieutenant Rodion Malinovsky, along with the 12th Army and the 37th Army. On 22 July, army commander Major general Nikolai Trufanov was relieved of command. As part of the Stalingrad Front (from 1–5 August), then briefly with the Southeast Front (from 6 August until 27 September), and then back with the Stalingrad Front it {{took part in the}} Battle of Stalingrad. On 31 July when it came under Stalingrad Front control it was so worn down by its previous rough handling that it was only 3,000 men strong. It was attacked on the same day by the 4th Panzer Army, which was able to break through. During Operation Uranus, the counterattack from Stalingrad, the 4th Mechanized Corps began its attack from the 51st Army's sector. In early December, 51st Army was deployed to cover the Kotelnikovo approaches against German relief attempts by the LVII. Panzerkorps. On 24–25 December 1942, the commander of 51st Army, Major-General N.I. Trufanov, organized a local offensive operation on the right flank with the forces of three rifle divisions, and moved to the north bank of the Aksav River, {{on the eve of the}} Kotelnikovo offensive operation, which eventually defeated the German efforts made as part of Operation Winter Storm to relieve the Sixth Army in Stalingrad. On 30 January 1943, the Luftwaffe's Kampfgeschwader 51 destroyed the 51st Army's Headquarters, near Salsk. Dropping 100– 250kg bombs, a wave of Junkers Ju 88s and Heinkel He 111s destroyed the communications center, working offices of the chief-of-staff, the operational headquarters and the offices of the operational duty officer. Up to 20 buildings and personnel <b>billets</b> were also destroyed. Casualties among personnel were also very high.|$|E
