5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E

5|$|By 1904, Crawford {{dominated}} the Repton team. He scored 759 runs and his 75 wickets {{were more than}} the combined total {{of all the other}} bowlers in the team. He was particularly effective in the school's most important fixtures. The report in Wisden described him as possibly the best amateur bowler in England that year: he bowled medium-paced off spin, although he varied the speed of his delivery from slow to fast. Surrey County Cricket Club took an interest in Crawford almost immediately, calling him to a trial in 1903. Following his achievements in 1904, he was invite to play for the county. The county club {{was in the midst of}} a spell of uncertainty; several men captained the team, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> handful of matches each. The composition of the side continually changed, and the team performed poorly, causing unrest among supporters accustomed to success. Crawford was just one of many players brought in as an experiment, albeit one of the most successful. He made his first-class debut against Kent. Taking three wickets and top-scoring in Surrey's first innings with 54, Crawford did well enough to retain his place for another seven games, and was praised in the press for his performances. Against Gloucestershire, he took seven wickets for 43 runs in the second innings, and a total of ten wickets in the match. In the season as a whole he took 44 first-class wickets at an average of 16.93 to top the county's bowling averages, and scored 229 runs at an average of 16.35.|$|E

25|$|Over time, senior editors can {{be granted}} {{additional}} privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community. The most straightforward are editall privileges, which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory. Meta privileges additionally allow editors to perform {{tasks such as}} reviewing editor applications, setting category features, and handling external and internal abuse reports. Cateditall privileges are similar to editall, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single directory category. Similarly, catmod privileges are similar to meta, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single directory category. Catmv privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories. All of these privileges are granted by admins and staff, usually after discussion with meta editors.|$|E

25|$|Anyone {{travelling}} to or {{from the}} Islands would originally have travelled on a trading vessel, faster sailing ships designed to carry the post and passengers were introduced before paddle steamers began to arrive in the 1820s, forcing the post to change to paddle steamer, even so it went bankrupt in 1836 This was followed in 1850 with iron screw steamers, with the first SS Sarnia and SS Caesarea operating, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few months.|$|E
25|$|The new realms {{were not}} long at peace. Soon after coming into power, George II of Kakheti {{launched}} an expedition against Kartli, intending to depose King David X and conquer his kingdom. David's brother Bagrat successfully defended the kingdom {{and managed to}} capture George II in an ambush. Peace didn't linger in the west either, as David X faced incursions from Alexander II of Imereti, who was somewhat less successful than his Kakhetian counterpart. In 1513 the Kingdom of Kartli conquered Kakheti <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time â€“ the Kingdom of Kakheti was restored {{with the support of}} local nobles by Levan of Kakheti, son and heir of George II, in 1520.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{financial}} backing of then-owner Sir Jack Hayward {{during the next}} decade, {{they were unable to}} regain a place in the top flight until 2003, when manager Dave Jones ended their nineteen-year exile <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> solitary Premier League season. The club returned for a three-year stay at the top level after Mick McCarthy led them back as Football League Championship champions in 2009, but his dismissal in 2012 preceded relegation back to the Championship. The following season saw two further managers dismissed as the club then suffered a second relegation, ending up in League One. However, in the following season they gained promotion back to the Championship where they currently reside. In July 2016, the club was taken over by the Chinese investment group Fosun International.|$|E

60|$|Again the {{two boys}} faced each other. <b>But</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. With a savage cry Baxter sprang upon Dick as if to fairly tear him apart. One blow landed upon Dick's arm and a second on his chest.|$|R
25|$|After {{leaving the}} service, Hogan {{returned}} to the film industry, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time. In 1947 he appeared in a featured role in Blaze of Noon, starring Anne Baxter and William Holden. In 1948 he was featured in two more films: Beyond Glory, starring Alan Ladd and Donna Reed; and Shed No Tears, starring Wallace Ford and June Vincent. Even though {{it was the first}} film he worked on in 1948, his final on-screen performance was in Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. In it, Hogan played the crucial role of David Kentley, the erstwhile friend who is strangled {{at the beginning of the}} picture and whose body is hidden in a chest while the murderers' guests have dinner in the same room. Hogan's final acting appearance was on the Broadway stage, in the unsuccessful comedy, Time for Elizabeth, which ran for only 8 performances at the Fulton Theatre in Septemberâ€“October 1948.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a single}} brief event is {{monitored}} by an oscilloscope, {{such an event}} will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome {{by the use of}} a direct view storage cathode ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a dielectric layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.|$|E
25|$|The faster {{a vessel}} travels, the more energy it uses. Reaching high speed {{requires}} energy which a human-powered vessel {{is incapable of}} producing. Oar system generate very low amounts of energy for propulsion (only about 70 W per rower) and the upper limit for rowing in a fixed position is around 10 knots. Ancient war galleys of the kind used in Classical Greece are by modern historians {{considered to be the}} most energy efficient and fastest of galley designs throughout history. A full-scale replica of a 5th-century BC trireme, the Olympias was built 1985â€“87 and was put through a series of trials to test its performance. It proved that a cruising speed of 7-8 knots could be maintained for an entire day. Sprinting speeds of up to 10 knots were possible, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes and would tire the crew quickly. Ancient galleys were built very light and the original triremes are assumed to never have been surpassed in speed. Medieval galleys are believed to have been considerably slower, especially since they were not built with ramming tactics in mind. A cruising speed of no more than 2-3 knots has been estimated. A sprint speed of up to 7 knots was possible for 20â€“30 minutes, but risked exhausting the rowers completely.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>an</b> {{instant the}} horses {{seemed to take}} notice of the lady's voice, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant; then they went on as fast as ever, around another bend, and down a rocky stretch, lined on either side with trees and bushes.|$|R

60|$|<b>For</b> <b>an</b> {{instant the}} scene was ludicrous; <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.|$|R
25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{a mirror}} {{is determined by the}} percentage of reflected light per the percentage of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum will reflect 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but is a poor reflector of infrared wavelengths longer than 800 nm. Gold is up to 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000 nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600 nm (yellow). Silver has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal, and can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000 nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> narrow range of wavelengths. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. In mirrors with low tolerances, the coating thickness may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{prepared}} {{to attack the}} American defenses, cannon and musket fire was exchanged between the opposing sides. The British moved across the bridge, advancing in solid columns, and the Americans all fired together. The British fell back, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. The British charged the bridge again, but were driven back by cannon fire. The British charged one final time, but the Americans fired canister shot this time, and the British lines were raked with fire. One soldier said, [...] "The bridge looked red as blood, with their killed and wounded and their red coats." ...|$|E
500|$|The station {{applied for}} and {{received}} a construction permit on August 9, 1958, to increase its broadcasting power from 250 to 1,000 watts, both day and night. The [...] FCC approved the application in January 1961 <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> daytime power increase. In 1959, WINC engineer Philip Whitney designed a CONELRAD alarm device for FM stations. The CONELRAD system allowed for early nationwide warnings {{in the event of}} possible enemy attack during the Cold War. Whitney is also credited with creating many of the remote control systems used by radio stations, including the microwave remote control system. The National Association of Broadcasters presented Whitney with its annual Engineering Award on April 7, 1970, for his work.|$|E
