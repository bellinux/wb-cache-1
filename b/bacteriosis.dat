40|$|A bacteriose causada pela Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae provoca grandes prejuízos em algumas regiões da cafeicultura brasileira, como Paraná, São Paulo e Minas Gerais, principalmente em lavouras novas, podadas e expostas ao vento. Com este trabalho, objetivou-se estudar nas plantas F 2 do cruzamento entre os genótipos IAPAR- 59 e Catuaí Erecta a associação entre as características vigor vegetativo e ângulos de inserção das ramificações plagiotrópicas sobre a intensidade de ocorrência da bacteriose. Avaliaram-se, em outubro de 2001, 316 plantas F 2 plantadas no IAPAR de Londrina em outubro de 1998. A escala de notas de avaliação da incidência de bacteriose adotada foi de 1 a 5, sendo 1 = plantas sem lesão e 5 = plantas com muitas lesões. As notas de vigor vegetativo adotadas foram de 1 a 5, sendo 1 para folhas de coloração verde-claras e 5 para folhas verdeescuras. Para a inserção dos ramos plagiotrópicos sobre os ortotrópicos, as notas variaram de 1 a 3, sendo 1 = normal (45 a 70 º), 2 = semi-ereta (25 a 40 º) e 3 = ereta (5 a 20 º). Estimou-se o coeficiente de correlação de Pearson para verificar a associação entre as características vigor vegetativo e do ângulo de inserção das ramificações plagiotrópicas com a intensidade de ocorrência da bacteriose nos cafeeiros. A correlação estimada entre a intensidade da bacteriose com o ângulo de inserção dos ramos plagiotrópicos foi de r = + 0, 2087 **. Não houve correlação significativa entre a bacteriose e o vigor vegetativo. Assim, plantas com ramificação plagiotrópica ereta são predispostas a uma maior incidência de bacteriose. <b>Bacteriosis</b> {{caused by}} Pseudomonas syringae pv garcae causes {{significant}} damage in important brazilian coffee regions, mainly affecting young and pruned coffee plants and plants {{exposed to the}} wind.

40|$|Efficiency of {{the sugar}} {{production}} from sugar beets is close connected with quality of the raw material which uses for the processing. Quality of the raw material depends on complex impact of number of factors, like natural, climatic, agritechnical, and varietal. Currently, there are some negative factors, like decreasing of soil fertility, increasing of soil's infectious background, prevalence of the foreign hybrid sorts of sugar beets which are vulnerable for local pathogens. These factors cause the increase of the diseases of sugar beets' root system – fusarium decay and vascular <b>bacteriosis.</b> The explorations of sugar beets' crops {{for many years in}} different areas of Central-Chernozem region have revealed high damage for yield from these diseases. In some years the loss of yield was up to 50 %. The determination of impact of bacterial infections on the processes of forming of the chemical composition of sugar beets' roots and the accumulation of sugar in sugar beets' roots is the very important task for science and production. The researches have been done in the laboratory of store and production raw materials, in the Laboratory of immunity, in the department of biotechnology of the FSTSO “All-Russian research institute for sugar beet and sugar named after A. L. Mazlumov”, and in the department of technology of fermentation and sugar productions of the Voronezh state university of engineering technologies. Was revealed, that increasing the level of the disease of sugar beets by vascular <b>bacteriosis</b> causes the rise amount of dry substances from 26. 04 % (healthy roots) up to 32. 75 % (damage of roots is 5 scores). And the sugar content decreases from 18. 77 % up to 16. 83 %. Proportion of sucrose in dry substances also decreases from 72. 08 % (healthy roots) up to 51. 39 % (damage of roots is 5 scores), because part of sucrose is utilized by bacteria in affected roots. Content of reducing substances increases by a factor of 1. 2 – 4. 9.

In vitro, inhibition of CFTR promotes MIP- 2 production in LPS-stimulated neutrophils; however, lipoxin A 4 could dose-dependently suppress this effect. In LPS-induced acute lung inflammation, blockade of PSGL- 1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1) or P-selectin, antagonism of PAF by WEB 2086, or correction of mutated CFTR trafficking by KM 11060 could significantly increase plasma lipoxin A 4 levels in F 508 del relevant to wildtype mice. Concurrently, F 508 del mice had higher plasma platelet activating factor (PAF) levels and PAF-AH activity compared to wildtype under LPS challenge. Inhibiting hydrolysis of PAF by a specific PAF-AH (PAF-acetylhydrolase) inhibitor, MAFP, could worsen LPS-induced lung inflammation in F 508 del mice compared to vehicle treated F 508 del group. Particularly, depletion of platelets in F 508 del mice could significantly decrease plasma lipoxin A 4 and PAF-AH activity and deteriorate LPS-induced lung inflammation compared to control F 508 del mice.

40|$|Vibrio species {{comprise}} {{the most frequently}} encountered bacterial pathogens of cultivated shrimp, and V. harveyi is amongst the most virulent. Most V. harveyi strains are luminescent on agar media and also in infected shrimp that are suffering from luminescent disease or luminous <b>bacteriosis.</b> However, not all isolates of V. harveyi are highly virulent. Some can be injected at high dose (10 - 7 - 10 5 cells per g shrimp body weight) without causing shrimp mortality, while other isolates are lethal at 10 - 3 per g shrimp body weight or less. In addition, virulence is often lost upon continuous subculture. Simple differentiation of virulent and avirulent isolates has not been successful, although virulence factors including various enzymes (e. g., proteases and lipases), siderophores and proteinaceous toxins have been identified. Because of this and the genetic diversity of V. harveyi, {{it has been suggested}} that virulence is acquired via mobile genetic elements. Indeed, recent work has suggested that 2 quite different bacteriophages, one from the family Myoviridae and the other from the family Siphoviridae, can change the phenotype of V. harveyi isolates from non-virulent to virulent. The host range for both bacteriophages is relatively narrow. A similar phenomenon occurs in V. cholerae, where conversion to virulence is mediated by a filamentous phage (Inovirus) from the family Inoviridae. Altogether, the current information suggests that there may be diverse groups of phages and complementary Vibrio hosts that could mediate virulence in V. harveyi and make the process quite complex. It also suggests that virulence of other Vibrio pathogens of shrimp may be influenced by bacteriophages. Thus, the use of bacteriophages for biological control of pathogenic Vibrio species in aquaculture should include environmental impact studies on the potential for transfer of virulence or antibiotic resistance genes. ...|$|E

Product of the vital activity of microorganisms is dextran, which is synthesized from sucrose as a result of dextrany or mucous fermentation and leads to significant technological problems in processing of infected beet. Improving the efficiency of sugar production is connected with decrease in loss of quality of raw material preparation, storing and processing of sugar beet. At sugar plants use a variety of drugs that suppress the growth of pathogenic microflora, but there comes a rapid adaptation of microorganisms, therefore {{there is a need to}} implement new products to prevent damage to roots and improve the quality of produced sugar. To resolve this problem experimentally selected bactericidal drug, defined its rational concentration and conditions for the use in sugar beet production. The use of antibacterial drug in the process of extraction allows to increase the purity of diffusion juice 1. 3 %, reduce the protein content in it (12. 5 %); with the purity of the pure juice increases by 1. 1 %, its color index is reduced by 44. 7 %...|$|E
40|$|La <b>bacteriosis</b> {{vascular}} de yuca producida por la bacteria Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam) es una enfermedad limitante para la producción de yuca. Dentro de los primeros factores de patogenicidad identificados en esta bacteria se encuentra el gen PthB. La proteína PthB pertenece a la familia de efectores PthA/AvrBs 3, que se caracterizan por presentar dominios NLS (Nuclear Localization Signal) y un dominio AAD (Acidic Activation Domain), lo cual sugiere que estas proteínas actúan como factores de transcripción. La identificación de las proteínas de yuca que interactúan con PthB permitiría dar luces sobre la función de esta proteína en la patogenicidad de esta bacteria. En este trabajo se clonó PthB en una fusión traduccional con el BD (Binding Domain) del factor de transcripción GAL 4. Después de transformar este constructo en una cepa de levadura, se observó autoactivación de los genes reporteros, incluso a concentraciones altas de 3 -AT. La eliminación del primer, segundo o de los dos NLS y del AAD no eliminaron la capacidad de autoactivación de los genes reporteros mediada por PthB. Estos resultados indican la imposibilidad de su utilización en un tamizaje de una librería de ADNc de yuca para identificar las proteínas que interactúan con PthB. Cassava bacterial blight {{disease is}} caused by the gram-negative bacteria Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam), and constitutes {{one of the most important}} constraints for cassava production. One of the first determinants of pathogenicity identified in this bacterium is the PthB gene. The PthB protein belongs to the PthA/AvrBs 3 family, characterized by the presence of Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) and Acidic Activation (AAD) domains, suggesting that these proteins are transcription factors. The identification of cassava proteins interacting with PthB could give insights about the function of this protein in the pathogenicity of this bacterium. In this work we cloned PthB in the yeast two hybrid expression vector pLAW 10, generating a fusion protein with the Binding Domain (BD) of the transcription factor GAL 4. In this work, PthB was cloned in a translational fusion with Gal 4 -BD (DNA Binding Domain). After transforming this construct into a yeast strain, autoactivation of the reporter genes was observed, even at the highest concentrations of 3 -AT. The deletion of the first, second or both NLS and the AAD did not eliminate the ability of autoactivation of PthB. These results show the impossibility of using PthB to screen a cassava cDNA library to identify the proteins interacting with PthB...|$|E

El control biológico es una estrategia útil para combatir este tipo de microorganismos. El objetivo de esta investigación consistió en evaluar el antagonismo {{in vitro}} de Trichoderma sp. y Bacillus subtilis contra tres de los principales patógenos del ajo: Sclerotium cepivorum, Penicillium sp. y Pseudomonas marginalis. Las especies mencionadas se aislaron e identificaron con pruebas bioquímicas y claves taxonómicas respectivamente y se determinó su actividad antagónica y efecto inhibitorio utilizando el crecimiento en platos duales. La cepa de B. subtilis mostró un potencial con valores bajos de PICR: 14, 087 ante S. cepivorum y 3, 328 ante Penicillium sp., por lo que se clasifica como un mal biocontrolador. Por su parte, Trichoderma presentó un potencial muy alto, con valores de PICR de 40, 210 frente a S. cepivorum y de 45, 034 ante Penicillium sp., lo que indica que es un muy buen controlador. Los resultados apoyan el potencial de las cepas de Trichoderma sp. como agentes de control biológico frente a la pudrición causada por Penicillium del ajo, la <b>bacteriosis</b> por P. marginalis y la pudrición blanca por S. cepivorum. No así Bacillus subtilis, pues la cepa aislada demostró poco potencial como biocontrolador. The production {{and quality of}} the cultivate garlic field (Allium sativum) is limited by diverse fungal diseases and bacteria that lead the producer to implement the application of chemical control strategies and in some cases the abandonment of the activity by an increase in losses. Biological control is a useful strategy to combat these types of microorganisms. The objective of this research was to evaluate the in vitro antagonism of the Trichoderma sp. and Bacillus subtilis against three major pathogens of garlic: Sclerotium cepivorum, Penicillium sp. and Pseudomonas marginalis. The species mentioned were isolated and identified by biochemical and taxonomic keys respectively and tested for antagonistic activity and inhibitory effect on growth using dual plates. Strain B. subtilis showed a low potential with low values of PICR, 14, 087 against S. cepivorum and 3, 328 against Penicillium sp., this is bad biocontrol. Regarding Trichoderma sp, it presented a very high potential, with values of 40, 210 PICR against S. cepivorum and 45, 034 against Penicillium sp. The valuation classifies it as a very good biocontrol. The results obtained in these studies support the potential of the strains of Trichoderma sp as biological control agents against Penicillium sp garlic rot, P. marginalis bacteria and white rot by S. cepivorum. This is not the case with B. subtilis, as the isolate proved otherwise...|$|E

Los ensayos se condujeron durante los ciclos primavera-verano 2008 y otoño-invierno 2008 - 2009. Se realizaron análisis de conjunto y por ensayos de temporal y de riego en forma independiente. Diferentes enfermedades atacaron al cultivo a través de los sitios de prueba; bajo temporal, las de mayor distribución fueron la <b>bacteriosis</b> común (Xanthomonas campestris pv phaseoli) y la mancha angular (Phaeoisariopsis griseola); mientras que la antracnosis (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) y el mildiú velloso (Phythohpthora phaseoli) mostraron un fuerte ataque en Calera, Zacatecas y Celaya, Guanajuato, respectivamente. El ambiente de mayor rendimiento promedio fue Celaya bajo riego (4. 15 t ha- 1) y el menor se obtuvo en Texcoco bajo temporal (0. 90 t ha- 1). El análisis conjunto detecto diferencias significativas (p The 'Flor de Mayo' bean type {{is highly}} demanded by consumers in Central Mexico, its production {{takes place at}} the semiarid, El Bajio and the central plateau regions. The aim was to test a set of 14 bred lines plus two checks across 10 rainfed locations and four irrigated sites on the basis of seed yield, 100 -seeds weight and disease reaction. Trials were conducted in the spring-summer season 2008 and fall-winter season 2008 - 2009. Data analyses were conducted including all test sites, and independently rainfed and irrigated sites. Different diseases attacked the crop across test sites; those widely distributed were common bacterial blight (Xanthomonas campestris pv phaseoli) and angular leaf spot (Phaeoisariopsis griseola); whereas anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) and downy mildew (Phythohpthora phaseoli) show a strong attack at Calera, Zacatecas and Celaya, Guanajuato, respectively. Average from the genotypes, the highest yield (4. 15 t ha- 1) was obtained in Celaya under irrigated conditions and the lowest at Texcoco under rainfed conditions (0. 90 t ha- 1). The overall analysis indicated highly significant effect (p< 0. 0001) of environment, genotype and interaction, but the largest contribution to the observed variation was due to location (91 %) and the lowest to genotype (1 %). The analyses on rainfed data show a lower effect of location (72 %) and an increase in the effect of the interaction (25 %) and in lower degree that of the genotype (3 %).

40|$|International audienceIn France, 60, 000 {{neonates}} {{are born}} preterm every year (7. 4 %), {{half of them}} after the spontaneous onset of labor. Among preventable risk factors of spontaneous prematurity, only cessation of smoking is associated with decreased prematurity (level of evidence [LE] 1). It is therefore recommended (Grade A). Routine screening and treatment of vaginal <b>bacteriosis</b> is not recommended {{in the general population}} (Grade A). The only population for which vaginal progesterone is recommended is that comprising asymptomatic women with singleton pregnancies, no history of preterm delivery, and a short cervix at 16 - 24 weeks of gestation (Grade B). A history-indicated cerclage is not recommended for women with only a history of conization (Grade C), uterine malformation (professional consensus), isolated history of preterm delivery (Grade B), or twin pregnancies for primary (Grade B) or secondary (Grade C) prevention of preterm birth. A history-indicated cerclage is recommended for a singleton pregnancy with a history of at least 3 late miscarriages or preterm deliveries (Grade A). Ultrasound cervical length screening is recommended between 16 and 22 weeks for women with a singleton previously delivered before 34 weeks gestation, so that cerclage can be offered if cervical length < 25 mm before 24 weeks (Grade C). A cervical pessary is not recommended for the prevention of preterm birth in a general population of asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies (Grade A) or in populations of asymptomatic women with a short cervix (professional consensus). Although the implementation of universal screening by transvaginal ultrasound for cervical length at 18 - 24 weeks of gestation in women with a singleton gestation and no history of preterm birth can be considered by individual practitioners, this screening cannot be universally recommended. In cases of preterm labor, (i) {{it is not possible to}} recommend any one of the several methods (ultrasound of the cervical length, vaginal examination, or fetal fibronectin assay) over any other to predict preterm birth (Grade B); (ii) routine antibiotic therapy is not recommended (Grade A); (iii) prolonged hospitalization (Grade B) and bed rest (Grade C) are not recommended. Compared with placebo, tocolytics are not associated with a reduction in neonatal mortality or morbidity (LE 2) and maternal severe adverse effects may occur with all tocolytics (LE 4). Atosiban and nifedipine (Grade B), unlike beta-agonists (Grade C), can be used for tocolysis in spontaneous preterm labor without preterm premature rupture of membranes. Maintenance tocolysis is not recommended (Grade B). Antenatal corticosteroid administration is recommended for all women at risk of preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation (Grade A). After 34 weeks, the evidence is insufficiently consistent to justify recommending systematic antenatal corticosteroid treatment (Grade B), but a course of this treatment might be indicated in clinical situations associated with high risk of severe respiratory distress syndrome, mainly in case of planned cesarean delivery (Grade C). Repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids are not recommended (Grade A). Rescue courses are not recommended (Professional consensus). Magnesium sulfate administration is recommended for women at high risk of imminent preterm birth before 32 weeks (Grade A). Cesareans are not recommended for fetuses in vertex presentation (professional consensus). Both planned vaginal and elective cesarean delivery are possible for breech presentations (professional consensus). Delayed cord clamping may be considered if the neonatal or maternal state allows (professional consensus). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito do silÃÂcio (Si), aplicado via foliar em videiras cv. Syrah para o controle do mÃÂldio (Plasmopara vitÃÂcola) e ameixeiras cv. Pluma 7 no controle da bacteriose (Xanthomonas arborÃÂcola pv. pruni), {{mariposa}} oriental (Grapholita molesta) e pulgÃÂo verde (Myzus persicae), bem como no desenvolvimento das plantas. Para todos os ensaios foi utilizado o produto comercial AgriSilÃÂ (98 % de SiO 2). Em dezembro de 2010 foi realizado o teste de germinaÃÂÃÂo de esporos de P. viticola, no laboratÃÂrio de Fitopatologia do CEDETEG. Os experimentos de campo foram conduzidos no pomar experimental do departamento de Agronomia da Unicentro, por dois ciclos consecutivos (2010 / 2011 e 2011 / 2012), nos quais foram avaliadas concentraÃÂÃÂes crescentes de Si. No primeiro ciclo de estudos os tratamentos foram 0, 1, 2, 4 e 8 g L - 1 de Si, tanto para a videira quanto para a ameixeira. As aplicaÃÂÃÂes foram quinzenais intercaladas com pulverizaÃÂÃÂo de produtos utilizados no sistema orgÃÂnico (calda bordalesa, extrato de neem, extrato de cinamomo, ÃÂleo vegetal). No segundo ciclo de avaliaÃÂÃÂes foram mantidos os mesmos procedimentos do primeiro ciclo para a ameixeira. PorÃÂm, para a videira, foram suspensas as pulverizaÃÂÃÂes com os produtos do sistema orgÃÂnico, mantendo-se apenas a calda bordalesa, e foram utilizadas as doses de 0, 2, 4, 8 ou 16 g L- 1 de SiO 2. A severidade da doenÃÂa em folhas de videira foi determinada por meio de avaliaÃÂÃÂes visuais, pela escala diagramÃÂtica e posterior determinaÃÂÃÂo da ÃÂrea abaixo da curva de progresso da doenÃÂa (AACPD). O comprimento e o diÃÂmetro dos ramos da videira e da ameixeira foram medidos nos dois anos do experimento, para avaliar o desenvolvimento das plantas. No final do segundo ano foi determinada a massa seca (MS) de parte aÃÂrea e de raÃÂzes da videira e o teor de Si foliar da videira e da ameixeira. Para avaliar a severidade da bacteriose foram feitas avaliaÃÂÃÂes quinzenais coletando-se 10 folhas por planta. A infestaÃÂÃÂo pela mariposa oriental foi avaliada fazendo-se a porcentagem de ponteiros atacados, e para a infestaÃÂÃÂo por pulgÃÂes foi feita a contagem de indivÃÂduos nos ramos marcados. Houve efeito quadrÃÂtico das doses de SiO 2 (0, 1, 2, 4 ou 8 g L- 1) sobre a germinaÃÂÃÂo de P. viticola, ÃÂs 12 e 24 horas apÃÂs o inÃÂcio da incubaÃÂÃÂo dos esporÃÂngios, sendo que as doses de 2 e 4 g L- 1, apresentaram as maiores porcentagens de germinaÃÂÃÂo, respectivamente. No campo, nos dois ciclos de avaliaÃÂÃÂes, a aplicaÃÂÃÂo de Si nÃÂo apresentou efeito significativo sobre a AACPD do mÃÂldio da videira, tendo havido efeito de reduÃÂÃÂo apenas para a aplicaÃÂÃÂo de calda bordalesa no segundo ciclo. Da mesma forma, o comprimento dos ramos do ano tambÃÂm nÃÂo apresentou diferenÃÂa significativa, porÃÂm, para o diÃÂmetro dos ramos, observou-se reduÃÂÃÂo nas plantas tratadas com Si associado ÃÂ calda bordalesa. A MS apresentou efeito cÃÂbico em funÃÂÃÂo das doses de silÃÂcio nos tratamentos com calda bordalesa, tanto para a parte aÃÂrea quanto para as raÃÂzes, com destaque para a dose 2 g L- 1 de Si, que apresentou maior MS. Nos tratamentos sem calda bordalesa, verificou-se efeito linear positivo tanto para parte aÃÂrea quanto para as raÃÂzes. Quanto ÃÂ bacteriose da ameixeira observou-se reduÃÂÃÂo da doenÃÂa para todas as doses utilizadas, apresentando efeito quadrÃÂtico pela anÃÂlise de regressÃÂo. Verificou-se que o progresso da doenÃÂa nas plantas em que se aplicou o silÃÂcio na concentraÃÂÃÂo de 1 g L 1 foi 48 % menor do que na testemunha, enquanto que os tratamentos com 2, 4 e 8 g L- 1 de silÃÂcio reduziram, respectivamente, 71, 5 %, 72, 1 % e 79, 5 % em relaÃÂÃÂo ÃÂ testemunha. Nas avaliaÃÂÃÂes da infestaÃÂÃÂo por mariposa oriental e pulgÃÂo, assim como o crescimento e desenvolvimento das plantas de ameixeira o Si nÃÂo apresentou diferenÃÂa significativa entre as doses utilizadas. Os teores foliares de Si aumentaram linearmente em funÃÂÃÂo das doses utilizadas tanto para a videira como para a ameixeira. The aim of {{this study}} was evaluate the effect of foliar silicon applied in grapevine cv. Syrah for control of downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) and plum cv. Plume 7 in the control of bacterial (Xanthomonas arborÃÂcola pv. pruni), oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta), and greenbug (Myzus persicae) {{as well as in the}} plants development. For all experiments was used a commercial product called AgriSil ÃÂ (98 % SiO 2). In December 2010 was tested the germination spores of P. viticola in the Phytopathology laboratory of CEDETEG. Field experiments were conducted at the experimental orchard of Agronomy Department of Unicentro for two consecutive cycles (2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012), which were evaluated the increasing concentrations of Si. In the first cycle the treatments were 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 g L- 1 of Si, both to grapevine as for plum. The applications were interspersed with fortnightly sprays of products used in the organic system (Bordeaux mixture, neem extract, cinnamon extract, vegetable oil). In the second cycle evaluations for the plum were kept the same procedures as the first cycle. However, for the vine were suspended spraying with products of organic, [...] . and doses were used 0, 2, 4, 8 or 16 g L- 1 SiO 2. In the second cycle evaluations for the plum were kept the same procedures as the first cycle. However, for the vine were suspended spraying with products of organic and doses were used 0, 2, 4, 8 or 16 g L- 1 SiO 2. The severity of disease in vine leaves was determined by visual evaluations by diagrammatic scale, and subsequent determination of the area under the curve progression of the disease (AUDPC). The length and diameter of the branches of the vine and plum were measured at two-year experiment to evaluate plant development. At the end of the second year was determined, dry matter (DM) of shoots and roots of the vine and the Si content of grapevine leaf and plum. To evaluate the severity of <b>bacteriosis</b> two assessments were made every two weeks by collecting 10 leaves per plant using diagrammatic The oriental fruit moth attack was evaluated by doing the percentage of pointers attacked and the aphid infestation was made by counting individuals in the fields that were marked. For the development of plants was measured the length and the diameter of the branches marked. To test the germination of P. viticola the quadratic effect was observed as a function of concentrations of SiO 2 (0, 1, 2, 4 or 8 g L- 1) at 12 and 24 hours after the onset of incubation the sporangia. In the field, the two assessment cycles, did not affect the control of downy mildew by the application of Si. In the same way, the length and the diameter of shoots did not show significant results. For MS cubic effect was observed in both treatments with Bordeaux mixture used in the shoot and in the roots, especially the dose 2 g L- 1 of Si with the highest MS and Bordeaux mixture when no effect was found for both linear shoot as to the roots. For the plum <b>bacteriosis,</b> a reduction of the disease for all doses was used, with quadratic regression analysis. It was found that the progress of disease in plants where silicon was applied at a concentration of 1 g L 1 was 48 % lower than in the control, whereas treatment with 2, 4 and 8 g L- 1 silicon reduced, respectively, 71. 5 %, 72. 1 % and 79. 5 % compared to the control. For the attack of oriental fruit moth and aphids, as well as to the growth and development of plants plum Si showed no significant difference between the doses used.
