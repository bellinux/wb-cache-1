500|$|... "Progressive pop" [...] was {{originally}} termed for progressive rock music. The latter genre {{was influenced by}} the [...] "progressive" [...] pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies, and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. In December 1966, Melody Maker attempted to define the recent developments in pop. In this article, titled [...] "Progressive Pop", Chris Welch categorised artists using terms previously associated with jazz; in the most advanced of these, [...] "Avant-Garde", he placed the Beatles, Cream, Love, the Mothers of Invention, Pink Floyd and Soft Machine, while [...] "Modern", the next category, comprised the Byrds, Donovan and the Small Faces.

Bill Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper's transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: [...] "Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock." [...] In the aftermath of Sgt.

The same [...] "principle of variation" [...] would influence [...] "every species of plant, whether growing in a forest or a meadow". He came to his ideas as the result of experiments in plant and animal breeding, some of which he outlined in an unpublished manuscript, the Elements of Agriculture.

2500|$|Many police {{departments}} require that defendants facing felony charges wear at least handcuffs {{regardless of the}} nature of the crime they are accused of. The defendant taken to court is usually brought in through an entrance from a public area such as the street or sidewalk, often escorted by plainclothes police officers (who may <b>be</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have investigated the case and made the arrest, especially if multiple agencies were involved) and sometimes accompanied by his or her attorney. Those areas are accessible to all, including the media. It is there that they may take still or moving images of the defendant, and often ask questions of him or her. In high-profile cases, with major media interest, such as a crime which has received considerable public attention or in which the defendant is a celebrity, measures such as barricades or extra uniformed officers will be present to ensure there is space to get the defendant and escorting officers into the building.

2500|$|The church {{teaches that}} at birth, a {{pre-existing}} spirit enters a mortal body. Upon death, the spirit {{goes to a}} [...] "spirit world" [...] to await {{the resurrection of the}} dead. There, a preliminary judgment, based in part on whether a person has had a baptism by the authority of the priesthood and received their confirmation, either in this life or after death by proxy, places the spirit in either a state of paradise (has completed all the saving ordinances) or spirit prison (those who have not had the saving ordinances). Those in [...] "prison" [...] will be visited by spirits from paradise and given the chance to learn of the teachings of Jesus Christ and to accept the accompanying saving ordinances. The church teaches that all persons, wicked or righteous, will be resurrected and receive an immortal, physical body. The nature of that body, however, will depend on the result of the Last Judgment, at which Jesus will assign each soul to one of three degrees of glory (heavenly kingdoms): the celestial kingdom {{in the presence of the}} Father and the Son for those who accept Jesus Christ and receive all LDS saving ordinances, either as a mortal or by proxy; the terrestrial kingdom, a place of glory in the presence of Christ for righteous persons who refuse to receive the saving ordinances and for those who do not keep the covenants they commit to; and the telestial kingdom for the unrepentant wicked. A further destination, called outer darkness, is reserved for Satan, his devils, and those mortals who commit the unpardonable sin and thereby become the sons of perdition. Those who are ultimately destined for the telestial kingdom will <b>be</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> suffer for their sins in hell; however, these persons remain in hell only the 1000 years during the millennial reign of Christ, after which they will exit hell and be resurrected with an immortal body into a state of peace. The church also teaches that all animals have souls and, having been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, will be resurrected, along with every human child who died before the age of accountability.|$|E
