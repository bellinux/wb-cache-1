50|$|In September 1954 {{the car was}} re-branded as the Singer Hunter with a {{traditional}} radiator grille and fibreglass <b>bonnet</b> <b>lid.</b> The Hunter was well equipped with twin horns and screenwash as standard. A horse-head mascot was fitted over the radiator. 4772 Hunters were made.|$|E
5000|$|That {{critical}} kink in {{the road}} put the car on a direct trajectory toward the packed terraces and grandstand. The car landed onto the earthen embankment between the spectators and the track, bounced, then slammed into a concrete stairwell structure and disintegrated. The momentum of the heaviest components of the car - the engine, radiator and front suspension - hurtled straight on into the crowd for almost 100 m, crushing all in their path. The <b>bonnet</b> <b>lid</b> scythed through the air, [...] "decapitating tightly jammed spectators like a guillotine." [...] Spectators who had climbed onto ladders and scaffolding {{to get a better}} view of the track, and those crowding to use the underpass to get to the pits, found themselves in the direct path of the lethal debris.|$|E
5000|$|The G30's body {{is made of}} {{a mixture}} of deep-drawing, {{multiphase}} and ultra-high-strength steels, and aluminium. BMW said weight of the body has been reduced by [...] compared to the F10's. The G30's <b>bonnet,</b> boot <b>lid,</b> roof and doors are constructed from aluminium. As {{a result of these}} and other weight-saving measures, BMW says the G30 weighs up to 100 kg less than its predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|For 1969, the Mark II {{range was}} given subtle revisions, with {{separate}} [...] "FORD" [...] block letters {{mounted on the}} <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lids,</b> a blacked out grille and chrome strips on top and below the taillights running the full width of the tail panel marking them out.|$|R
5000|$|All {{models were}} {{equipped}} with an inline-six cylinder engine with multi-port fuel injection. The <b>bonnet,</b> trunk <b>lid,</b> door skins and tonneau cover were made of aluminum to reduce weight. The comparatively short and wide chassis, combined with an excellent suspension, powerful brakes and radial tires gave the W 113 superb handling for its time. The styling of the front, with its characteristic upright Bosch [...] "fishbowl" [...] headlights and simple chrome grille, dominated by the large three-pointed star in the nose panel, paid homage to the then already legendary 300 SL roadster.|$|R
50|$|Superscale is Top Gear's {{venture into}} the 1:24 scale market where larger {{versions}} of Australian cars are handmade containing over 200 pieces. These models include opening doors, <b>bonnets</b> and boot <b>lids,</b> working steering. Some models even have working window winders allowing the door windows to be wound up or down.|$|R
50|$|These {{were blue}} {{with a white}} line painted around them. In 1967, the Dunbartonshire force bought two Hillman Imps (subsequently nicknamed Pinky and Perky) for escort duties on the A82 road; one blue and one white. The boot <b>lids,</b> <b>bonnets,</b> and doors were then swapped to create a panda car style scheme.|$|R
50|$|Chassis {{construction}} {{was similar to}} most Italian supercars of that era, with square and rectangular tubing connecting the steel body to the frame. Though the 4-inch (100 mm) tubular chassis allowed both coupé and convertible versions to be rigid, the design was intricate and prone to rust. The <b>bonnets</b> and boot <b>lids</b> were fabricated from aluminum.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a limited}} (5 units) version of SLS AMG GT3 commemorating the 45th anniversary of AMG brand. It {{included}} designo magno graphite matte body colour, a seat shell in a high-strength carbon-fibre safety cell on the co-driver's side, carbon fibre reinforced plastic doors, <b>bonnet,</b> mudguards, boot <b>lid,</b> rear wings, front and rear apron, front splitter and rear diffusor.|$|R
50|$|This {{facelift}} of the Clio 172 included redesigned {{front and}} rear bumpers, the front bumper falling {{in line with the}} style of the face-lifted Clio II. The rear bumper was now less rounded and featured a strip of ABS plastic effectively splitting the bumper into two. The lights, <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lid</b> were also matched to the face-lifted Clio II.|$|R
50|$|Production of the 3500 GT {{started in}} late 1957; {{eighteen}} cars were built that year, the first handful leaving the factory before Christmas. All 3500 GTs had leather interior and Jaeger instruments.A first Touring convertible prototype was {{shown at the}} 1958 Turin Motor Show.But it was a proposal by Carrozzeria Vignale (designed by Michelotti) shown at the 1959 Salon de l'Auto in Paris that went into production as 3500 GT Convertibile. The Convertibile did not feature Touring's Superleggera construction, but rather a steel body with aluminium <b>bonnet,</b> boot <b>lid</b> and optional hard top; it was also built on an 10 cm shorter wheelbase, and weighed 1380 kg. Front disc brakes and limited slip differential became optional in 1959, and were standardized in 1960; rear discs became standard in 1962.|$|R
5000|$|Engine <b>bonnet,</b> boot <b>lid</b> and {{the fixed}} hard top are fibreglass, painted matt black, {{the rear window}} is perspex and the doors aluminium. Front and rear bumpers were deleted and {{replaced}} by simple rubber bumperettes. A single matte black wing mirror was fitted.Matte black wheel arch extensions house 185/70 VR 13 Pirelli CN 36 tyres on 5.5 J × 13" [...] four-spoke alloy wheels.Inside centre console, rear occasional seats, and glovebox lid were eliminated; while new features were anodised aluminium dashboard trim, a small three-spoke leather-covered Abarth steering wheel, and Recaro corduroy-and-leather bucket seats as an extra-cost option.The car carries Fiat badging front and rear, Abarth badges and [...] "Fiat Abarth" [...] scripts on the front wings, and Abarth wheel centre caps.Only three paint colours were available: Corsa red, white, and light blue.|$|R
50|$|The first roadsters, hand-built with {{aluminium}} {{bodies on}} ash frames mounted on modified Jaguar Mark V chassis, were constructed between late 1948 and early 1950. To meet demand, and {{beginning with the}} 1950 model year, all subsequent XK120s were mass-produced with pressed-steel bodies. They retained aluminium doors, <b>bonnet,</b> and boot <b>lid.</b> The DHC and FHC versions, more luxuriously appointed than the roadsters, had wind-up windows and also wood veneers on the dashboard and interior door caps.|$|R
5000|$|Coupé 1.3 S Montecarlo: 1972-73. Special edition {{based on}} the 1.3 S, commemorating Lancia's victory at the 1972 Monte Carlo Rally. The livery resembled the works car, with matte black <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lid</b> bearing Monte Carlo rally plate-style stickers. This version used his own {{bodyshell}} with flared wheel arches, similar to but different from the 1.6 HF bodyshell. Other accoutrements included 1.6 HF Lusso interior fittings such as bucket seats with headrests, rectangular front fog lamps, no bumpers and black single wing mirror; 4.5J steel wheels of the standard Coupé were fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "L" [...] in the {{designation}} meant leicht (light), unlike in other BMW designations, where it meant lang (long). The lightness {{was achieved by}} using thinner steel to build the unit body, deleting the trim and soundproofing, using aluminium alloy doors, <b>bonnet,</b> and boot <b>lid,</b> and using Perspex side windows. The five hundred 3.0 CSLs exported to the United Kingdom were not quite as light as the others, as the importer had insisted on retaining the soundproofing, electric windows, and stock E9 bumpers on these cars. The CSL was never sold in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Most Trax {{models are}} cast in 1:43 scale and are replicas of Australian vehicles. Details are {{accurately}} rendered. The standard Trax car range, normally labeled as [...] "Trax Australian Motoring History" [...] on the boxes, includes GM Holden (FJs, Monaros, Toranas, Commodores, etc.), Ford (early Fairlanes, but mostly Falcon variations), and Chryslers (mostly Valiants and Valiant Chargers). Early models were often more sporty vehicles but later the company became quite prolific, making saloons, utes, race cars, taxis, {{and all sorts}} of liveried vehicles. Top Gear also produces the 1:43 scale Opal Series which features vehicles with opening doors, opening <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lid.</b> Opal models come in premium packaging.|$|R
2500|$|The 1948 car {{featured}} radial tyres, {{which had}} just been commercialised; front-wheel drive; {{rack and pinion steering}} mounted inside the front suspension cross-tube, away from a frontal impact; rear fender skirts (the suspension design allowed wheel changes without removing the skirts); bolt-on detachable front and rear wings; detachable doors, <b>bonnet</b> (and boot <b>lid</b> after 1960), by [...] "slide out" [...] P-profile sheet metal hinges; flap-up windows, as roll up windows were considered too heavy and expensive.; and detachable full length fabric sunroof and boot lid, for almost pickup-like load-carrying versatility. Ventilation in addition to the sunroof and front flap windows was provided by an opening flap under the windscreen. The car had load adjustable headlights and a heater (heaters were standardised on British economy cars in the 1960s).|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{exterior}} features set the Rally {{apart from other}} 128s. At the front there was a black radiator grille, carrying the round Fiat emblem typical of the marque's sports cars; split bumpers joined by a tubular steel bar; and halogen headlamps and bumper-mounted auxiliary lamps. At the rear dual round tail lamps replaced the square ones found on the regular two-door 128. [...] "Rally" [...] badging on the <b>bonnet</b> and booth <b>lid</b> and stripes along the side sills completed the look.The interior was upholstered in black leatherette, and the dashboard housed upgraded instrumentation: a tachometer was standard equipment, and water temperature and oil pressure gauges took {{the place of the}} ashtray, relocated to the centre console. Front sports seats with headrests and a two-spoke sports steering wheel replaced the standard items.|$|R
50|$|Three basic {{versions}} were produced;MkI, had {{a separate}} internal roll cage, long nose, windows hinged {{at the front}} edge. Both <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lids</b> had ribbed sections, boot lid ribs could be opened up as louvers for better air flow for the VW engine if desired.MkII went through the most changes it has a shorter removable nose section, built in roll cage on later models {{and the addition of}} a Ford-based model, longer side windows hinged from front bottom and top corners. Ford versions had the bump on the bonnet to accommodate the engine and later version had smooth boot lids with the ribs removed.MkIII, back to one piece nose, slightly higher roof, both versions now had built in steel bars to the cabin area. Side windows as MkII.|$|R

2500|$|The European-spec 2.5 V6 (2.5 6V Iniezione or 2.5QV) {{was officially}} sold only between 1985 and 1987, {{although}} {{some of them were}} not registered until 1989. Relatively few of them were sold (about 2800 units), especially when the [...] 1.8 Turbo got launched, which in some countries was cheaper in taxes because of its lower displacement. To create a bigger space between the V6 and the inline fours, the 2.5 was bored out to 2959 cc's to deliver [...] and this new engine was introduced as the 3.0 America in 1987. As its type designation suggests, the 3.0 only came in the US-specification, with the impact-bumpers and in-boot fuel tank. However, the European 'America's' were not equipped with side-markers or the door, <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lid</b> fortifications. Depending on the country of delivery, the 3.0 America could be equipped with a catalytic converter.|$|R
50|$|During early 1957 Zagato built some 30 more Appias, which {{remained}} {{somewhat similar}} to the first Cammello, but lost the humps on the <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lid,</b> donned thin vertical fins over the rear wings and Plexiglas-covered headlamps, and gained a new grille which would set the template for all future Appia Zagato. All these cars differed a lot from one another.After this first run of prototypes two models {{were more or less}} standardised and built in roughly 150 examples. These were the Appia GT, with open headlights carried over from the saloon, and the same 53 PS engine found on other coachbuilders' models; and the sportier Appia GTS, with faired in headlights, a more streamlined body, often a double bubble roof, and a tuned 60 PS engine. The interior carried over the standard car's steering wheel but added tube-framed leatherette sport seats; on the GTS a wood-rimmed steering wheel and bucket seats were optional.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} of the Giulietta SS was presented in 1957 at the Turin Motor Show. After two more prototypes were presented in car shows, the official presentation of the production version for the press was on 24 June 1959 on the Monza race track. The first 101 cars produced had [...] "low nose" [...] and 750 SS designation. 100 cars minimum were needed to homologate a car in FIA regulations. While there were some all-aluminium cars produced, {{the majority of these}} cars had steel bodies with aluminium doors, engine <b>bonnet</b> and boot <b>lid.</b> Also first cars were equipped with Weber 40 DCO3 carburettors, later changed to 40 DCOE2.The drag coefficient of the Sprint Speciale is 0.28, the same as a Chevrolet Corvette (C6), and was not surpassed for more than twenty years. Cars used the 1,290 cc Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, a design with hemispheric combustion chambers and valves controlled directly by twin overhead camshafts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first model}} was the Model [...] "T" [...] Unicar, {{designed}} by Lawrie Bond [...] and built between 1956 and 1959. It {{looked like a}} miniature two door saloon with 2+2 seating and was the cheapest car at the 1956 London Motor Show, but it was even cheaper if built as a kit when it could be had without engine for £170. A complete car cost £400. The body was made in fibreglass mounted on a steel tube chassis and had neither <b>bonnet</b> nor boot <b>lid.</b> The engine {{was placed in the}} middle of the rear seating area giving two small seats on either side of the engine. Since it had no differential for the rear wheels they were placed close together. The front suspension was independent using coil springs and struts and at the rear trailing arms were used. The brakes were mechanically operated. It was powered by a 328 cc Excelsior twin-cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke engine giving [...] and a top speed of 45 mph. Some early models had an Anzani engine. About 200 were made.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a limited}} (300 units, {{including}} 99 in US, 4 in Canada) version of Continental GT V8 S coupe inspired by the Continental GT3 race car, with 100 kg weight reduction, increased engine power to @6000rpm and 700 Nm@1700rpm, torque vectoring {{for each of the}} rear wheels, shorter gearing, recalibrated control software, all-new titanium exhaust with 7 kg weight saving and retuned acoustics, forged 21-inch alloy wheels in gloss black, Pirelli tyres, sport-focused Electronic Stability Control programme, Carbon Silicon Carbide (CSiC) braking system (420 mm front and 356 mm rear brake discs, 8-piston front calipers in green), two-seat cabin with carbon fibre, Alcantara and leather interior upholstery; bespoke sporting seats with additional side support through deeper bolsters upholstered in Beluga black leather and diamond-quilted Alcantara, upholstered steering wheel and gear shifter, centre console and fascia panels in carbon fibre, carbon fibre door casings with diamond-quilted Alcantara inner panels, rear cabin with a carbon fibre surround and upholstered in leather and Alcantara, green hide colour on the seats, instrument panel, door panels, contrast stitching throughout the seats and diamond-quilted areas; GT3-R badging at centre console, passenger-side fascia panel, sill treadplates; GT3-R stitching at seat headrests in with contrast-green stitching, carbon fibre fixed rear wing and boot <b>lid,</b> <b>bonnet</b> with two vents, Glacier White body colour with gloss carbon fibre contrasts, two-tone green graphics tracing two power lines to the side profile of the car (one leading backwards from the front wheel, the other tracing the shape of the Continental GT's rear haunch), headlamp bezels, matrix grille, window surrounds and bumper strips in gloss black. US models also included sequentially numbered GT3-R sill treadplates.|$|R
