5|$|The no-hitter {{cemented}} Holloman's spot in {{the starting}} rotation for the next month. In his next start against the Athletics, he lasted barely an inning, allowing two runs and three walks before leaving the game due to a <b>blistered</b> finger. His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians, but his third win did not come until a month later against the Boston Red Sox, where he allowed two hits in eight innings of work. Outside of the three wins, however, Holloman was ineffective; in 22 games, 10 of them starts, Holloman had a 3–7 record with a 5.23 ERA, 25 strikeouts, and 50 walks. As a result, after his final appearance on July 19, the Browns put him on waivers, and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E

40|$|Radial {{immunodiffusion}} is used {{to determine}} specific proteins in friction <b>blister</b> fluid and cantharidin <b>blister</b> fluid of human volunteers. Four proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, immunoglobin IgG and IgM) were determined in <b>blister</b> fluid pooled 2, 4 and 21 hours after <b>blistering.</b> The same proteins were also determined in cantharidin <b>blister</b> fluid from the back and palm. The concentration of a specific protein in friction <b>blister</b> fluid relative to the concentration in plasma is approximately the same for albumin, IgG and IgM while essentially no fibrinogen is found in this <b>blister</b> fluid. Relative concentrations of albumin, IgG and IgM are much larger in cantharidin <b>blister</b> fluid while {{a small amount of}} fibrinogen can be determined. This suggests that damage from cantharidin to epidermis and dermis is much more pronounced in the cantharidin <b>blister</b> than in the friction <b>blister.</b> It is also shown that fibrinogen is not destroyed by the friction <b>blister</b> fluid. Implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R

On the other hand, transferrin and IgG levels of these same six serologically positive <b>blister</b> fluids closely approached the corresponding serum levels. Conversion of C 3 proactivator was also demonstrable in the serologically positive bullous pemphigoid <b>blister</b> fluids, but not in the corresponding sera. Our studies, therefore, are suggestive of local activation of the complement sequence, by both the classical and alternate pathways, in <b>blisters</b> of serologically positive bullous pemphigold patients...|$|R

40|$|The <b>blistering</b> {{behaviour}} {{of tungsten}} surfaces exposed to very high fluxes (1 – 2  ×  1024 /m 2 /s) of low energy (38  eV) deuterium plasmas was investigated {{as a function}} of ion fluence (0. 2 – 7  ×  1026 D/m 2) and surface temperature (423 – 873  K). <b>Blisters</b> were observed under all conditions, especially up to temperatures of 873  K. The <b>blister</b> parameters are evaluated with <b>blister</b> size, <b>blister</b> density and surface coverage.

The <b>blister</b> densities are found in high magnitude of 106 blisters/m 2, with the surface coverages lower than 2 %. The formation of cracks in the sub-surface region was observed by cross-section imaging. Changes in <b>blister</b> size and shape with fluence and temperature suggest processes of predominantly nucleation and subsequent growth of <b>blisters.</b> The smaller <b>blister</b> size is considered to be caused by a combination of flux-related effects such as enhanced defect formation in the near surface region, reduced deuterium diffusivity and relatively short exposure times...|$|R

25|$|The zygote remains {{inactive}} for sometime {{but it soon}} elongates, becomes vermiform (worm-like) and motile. It is {{now known}} as ookinete. The pointed ends of ookinete penetrate the stomach wall and come to lie below its outer epithelial layer. Here the zygote becomes spherical and develops a cyst wall around itself. The cyst wall is derived partly from the stomach tissues and partly produced by the zygote itself. At this stage, the zygote is known as an oocyst. The oocyst absorbs nourishment and grows in size. Oocysts protrude from the surface of stomach, giving it a <b>blistered</b> appearance. In a highly infected mosquito, as many as 1000 oocysts may be seen.|$|E

40|$|Total {{haemolytic}} complement {{was reduced}} in <b>blister</b> fluids of four pemphigus vulgaris patients {{when compared to}} serum complement levels and other serum and <b>blister</b> fluid proteins. Complement levels in most control <b>blister</b> fluids, on the other hand, more closely approached their corresponding serum levels. Haemolytic C 1, C 4, C 2, C 3 and C 5, measured in two pemphigus sera and <b>blister</b> fluids, were not measurable in one <b>blister</b> fluid and were extremely low in the second patient. C 3 proactivator (C 3 PA) was absent from both of these <b>blister</b> fluids. Three of the <b>blister</b> fluids exhibited anti-complementary activity when tested with normal human serum. By adding one <b>blister</b> fluid to normal human serum, inhibition of haemolytic C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 5 with conversion of C 3 and C 3 PA occurred.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel theoretical model of <b>blistering</b> initiation and propagation especially useful for coating life assessment. The {{focus is on}} initially circular <b>blisters.</b> A two-part theoretical analysis of <b>blistering</b> is conducted using mesomechanics approach coupling diffusion concepts with fracture mechanics concepts. The diffusion concept is used to treat the corrosive species transport, eventually causing corrosion and <b>blistering,</b> while the fracture mechanics concept is used to treat the <b>blister</b> growth as circular crack propagation. Effects of thickness ratio and modulus ratio on <b>blistering</b> propagation are discussed. A simple criterion is identified which excludes the possibility of widespread <b>blister</b> propagation. Furthermore, a comparative study with the existing <b>blistering</b> models is carried out. Experiments are reported for <b>blistering</b> using a model coating-substrate system, chosen to allow visualisation of interface and to permit coupled (diffusion and residual) stresses in the coating over {{a full range of}} interest.

40|$|The {{penetration}} of azithromycin into the <b>blister</b> fluids of six volunteers was analyzed after a 5 -day regimen (total of 1. 5 g). Differences in drug concentrations {{in a paper}} disk and serum and in the mass of azithromycin from inflammatory <b>blister</b> chamber leukocytes and noninflammatory <b>blister</b> chamber leukocytes were significant (P < 0. 05). Skin <b>blisters</b> induced by suction can be injected with auto-logus serum to induce a local inflammatory reaction, with leukocyte (WBC) counts as high as 106 to 109 /,ul after 12 to 24 h (6, 11, 12, 15, 16). The presence of leukocytes in the <b>blisters</b> makes them more analogous to an infectious site than suction <b>blisters</b> without WBCs. We anticipated that the concentration of azithromycin would be higher in inflammatory <b>blister</b> fluid and remain elevated for a prolonged period of time than in noninflammatory <b>blister</b> fluid (4, 9). This was a multiple-dose study to ascertain the {{penetration of}} azithromycin into inflam-matory and noninflammatory <b>blister</b> fluid...|$|R

25|$|This {{investigation}} included {{over one}} hundred interviews of former students, family of former students, and former staff members of the school. The interviews confirmed {{that in addition to}} the implementation of the Individual Rating System, school administrators used corporal punishment as a tool to encourage obedience. The interviews revealed little disagreement about the way in which corporal punishment was administered. The former students were consistent in that punishment was administered by school administrators and adult staff witnesses in the building referred to as the White House. The former students were consistent in stating that a wooden paddle or leather strap was the implement used for administering punishment. The area of disagreement amongst former students was the number of spankings administered and their severity. Although some former students stated that they were “beaten” {{to the point that the}} skin of their buttocks <b>blistered</b> and bled profusely, there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring. A secondary disagreement was the former students’ perceptions of the punishment process. Some former students stated that their spankings caused them no psychological harm and that they learned from their mistakes while others stated that, mentally, they suffered greatly as a result and still do so to this day.|$|E
25|$|Massa {{drew closer}} to Kvyat and passed him {{heading into the}} Senna chicane for fourth place on 17 while Alonso overtook Sutil at the same turn to move into tenth on the same lap. At the same time, Hülkenberg made his pit stop and rejoined the track in 15th position. Hamilton's right-front tyre was <b>blistered</b> which did not hinder him {{significantly}} upon setting a new fastest lap of the race to be 2.1 seconds behind Rosberg {{at the start of}} lap 20. The reduction of the lead was that Rosberg was aware of not causing a large amount of tyre stress and partly down to Hamilton being faster than him. The two drivers pulled away from Massa. Button drove closely behind Bottas and used his DRS to establish an advantage over the close group of teammate Magnussen, Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo. Magnussen steered to the left of Grosjean and passed him for sixth on lap 23 and Alonso attempted to pass Grosjean around the outside heading into the Senna chicane on the next lap but Grosjean defended his position. Alonso tried again on the main straight and passed Grosjean before turning into the Descida do Lago turn for seventh. Vettel also moved in front of Grojean at the corner. Massa served his five-second time penalty on the 26th lap, and upon taking it, had new tyres fitted on his car.|$|E

25|$|With Hamilton's and Rosberg's pit stops completed, Hülkenberg and Kvyat {{were now}} {{the first two}} drivers {{at the front of}} the field, {{followed}} by Grosjean. Rosberg was impeded by slower traffic which gave the potential for Hamilton to attack his teammate. He was protected from being overtaken by Hamilton on the main straight because he was using DRS to protect himself as he was running close behind Grosjean and both drivers were able to pass the Lotus car. Rosberg drew nearer to Kvyat and passed him for second on lap 12. On the same lap, Button overtook Sutil for eighth place. Hamilton was instructed by his team to manage the temperature in his right-rear tyre and lost more time to Rosberg after following Kvyat in the track's middle sector. Kvyat allowed Hamilton to pass him going into the Senna S chicane while Rosberg was now close by race leader Hülkenberg. He informed his team that his front-right tyre had developed a blister and lost the lead to Rosberg who passed him driving into the Senna S chicane at the beginning of the 14th lap. Massa got ahead of Grosjean and Bottas got ahead of the latter at the Senna S chicane to move into sixth place on lap 15. With his front tyres <b>blistered,</b> Hülkenberg was passed by Hamilton who used his DRS going into the Senna S chicane on the following lap.|$|E
25|$|Rosberg {{made his}} second pit {{stop on the}} same lap, handing the lead back to Hamilton. Bottas also made a pit stop but was heavily delayed after his seat belt had undone itself and his team made {{adjustments}} to it, allowing Button into fourth and Bottas rejoined in 12th place. Hamilton began to lap faster than any other driver {{in an effort to}} move into the lead upon making his pit stop. He was asked by his team on lap 28 to make an energy recover switch to increase his car's harvesting rate but had not made a forward brake bias adjustment. When Hamilton applied his brakes for the Descida do Lado turn, his rear tyre locked and attempted to regain control of his oversteering car but went off into the corner's run-off area. He returned to the track but lost seven seconds worth of time. He made his pit stop on the same lap and emerged in second, 7.4 seconds behind teammate Rosberg. Button closed up to Kvyat and feigned a passing move on the latter but waited until the main straight to overtake Kvyat with DRS assistance heading into the Senna chicane on lap 30. Hamilton reduced the gap to teammate Rosberg to five seconds by the 35th lap despite running on <b>blistered</b> rear tyres. Räikkönen made a pit stop from third on the same lap but lost time after the front jack was lowered before his right-front tyre was installed and emerged in 13th behind Grosjean.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model for}} hydrogen induced <b>blister</b> formation in nanometer thick thin films. The model assumes that molecular hydrogen gets trapped under a circular <b>blister</b> cap causing it to deflect elastically outward until a stable <b>blister</b> is formed. In the first part, the energy balance required for a stable <b>blister</b> is calculated. From this model, the adhesion energy of the <b>blister</b> cap, the internal pressure and the critical H-dose for <b>blister</b> formation can be calculated. In the second part, the flux balance required for a <b>blister</b> to grow to a stable size is calculated. The model is applied to <b>blisters</b> formed in a Mo/Si multilayer after being exposed to hydrogen ions. From the model the adhesion energy of the Mo/Si <b>blister</b> cap was calculated to be around 1. 05 J/m 2 with internal pressures {{in the range of}} 175 - 280 MPa. Based on the model a minimum ion dose for the onset of <b>blister</b> formation was calculated to be d = 4. 2 * 10 ^ 18 ions/cm 2.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymer composites form <b>blisters</b> when galvanically {{coupled to}} metals in sea water or salt water. This <b>blistering</b> process is termed 2 ̆ 7 galvanic <b>blistering</b> 2 ̆ 7. Galvanic <b>blisters</b> nucleate and grow along the fiber/matrix interface. The <b>blisters</b> {{were filled with}} liquids with pH of 14. Carbon fiber reinforced vinyl esters, polyesters and epoxies were found to <b>blister</b> galvanically. ^ Chemical analysis revealed that the galvanic <b>blister</b> fluids were essentially aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate. Based upon these results, the following galvanic <b>blistering</b> mechanism was proposed: Galvanic coupling produces a surface charge on the fibers which results in modification of the polymer/fiber bonding. This makes possible a water clustering at the interface which starts the delamination process. Oxygen reduction takes place at these zones producing hydroxyl ions and a sodium hydroxide solution is formed. The sodium hydroxide solution creates an osmotic pressure which causes the <b>blister</b> to grow. ^ It was proved that almost certainly the oxygen reduction to hydroxyl ions occurs on carbon fibers that are cathodically polarized. The corrosion currents were limited by diffusion rates of oxygen. Time for <b>blister</b> appearance decreased with greater cathodic potentials and higher oxygen concentrations. ^ Electrochemical impedance was measured and the data was modeled using equivalent electrical circuit. Pore resistance decreases with time after application of cathodic potentials. This was due to creation of holes in the polymer layer over the fibers by rupture of <b>blisters.</b> The predicted charge transfer resistances were lower for increasing oxygen concentrations and greater cathodic potentials. ^ The effect of galvanic <b>blistering</b> on the apparent interlaminar shear strength of the composite was investigated. The results revealed little or {{no change in the}} ILSS due to galvanic <b>blistering</b> because the inner layers of the composite were protected from <b>blistering</b> by the consumption of oxygen on the surface carbon fibers. ^ A complete analytical approach to predict the galvanic <b>blister</b> rates was presented.
