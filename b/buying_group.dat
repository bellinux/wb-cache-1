5000|$|Recently, <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> {{has been}} taken online in {{numerous}} forms, although <b>group</b> <b>buys</b> prior to 2009 usually referred to the grouping of industrial products for the wholesale market (especially in China). Modern day online <b>group</b> <b>buys</b> are {{a variation of the}} tuángòu buying that occurs in China. Under tuángòu, an item must be bought in a minimum quantity or dollar amount, otherwise the seller will not allow the purchase. Since individuals typically do not need multiples of one item or do not have the resources to <b>buy</b> in bulk, <b>group</b> <b>buys</b> allow people to invite others to purchase in bulk jointly. These <b>group</b> <b>buys,</b> often result in better prices for individual buyers or ensure that a scarce or obscure item is available for sale. <b>Group</b> <b>buys</b> were, in the past, often organized by like-minded online shoppers through Internet forums. Now these shoppers have also started to leverage the <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> model for purposes of buying other consumer durables. <b>Group</b> <b>buying</b> sites are back in demand as small businesses look for ways to promote their products to budget-conscious consumers in a weak global economy. <b>Group</b> <b>buying</b> is also used for purchasing real estate properties.

The testing of these influences included two stages: focus groups interview and questionnaire. The data was collected from three focus groups and 81 customers - experts using OGB. Inconsistent with previous research results and our proposed hypotheses, the findings of research partly support the appropriateness of suggested influences for understanding customers' online <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> intentions. Results of the research show that price has {{the greatest impact on}} customers' intention to <b>buy</b> on <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> sites, while other influences have no significant effect. Besides, we identified positive relationships among customers' <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> experience (positive/negative), customers' purchase frequency in online <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> and intention to <b>buy</b> on <b>group</b> <b>buying</b> sites in the nearest future.

40|$|The {{existence}} and exploitation of buyer power {{is emerging as}} an important concern for antitrust as the public enforcement of antitrust law itself is re-emerging {{as part of the}} renewed recognition that markets require rules in order to operate efficiently and in socially desirable ways. Buyer cartels are per se illegal but <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> are subject to the 2 ̆ 2 rule of reason 2 ̆ 2 in antitrust law; yet, the two types of activity are hard to distinguish in a variety of circumstances. Moreover, neither courts nor commentators have provided very satisfactory explanations and justifications for the 2 ̆ 2 per se 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 rule of reason 2 ̆ 2 results. Indeed, in some circumstances, commentators and an occasional court have argued that buyers should be allowed to collude together simply to fix prices or allocate inputs. Conversely, many courts and commentators seem unaware of the potential risks that apparently legitimate <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> can pose to the competitive process. The goal of this Article is to explicate, evaluate, and critique the differences between buyer cartels and <b>buying</b> <b>groups</b> and the resulting antitrust liability rules. First, effective policy must identify the factors both internal to such a group as well as the external market conditions that justify alternative characterization of the entity. Second, empirical studies and reported cases both demonstrate that buyer power arises from much smaller market shares than is usually associated with seller power. Third, the economic incentives of buyer cartels require modification of the standard predictions that antitrust law uses to facilitate the inference of agreement. Fourth, and finally, legitimate <b>buying</b> <b>groups,</b> although efficient responses to the needs of their participants, can also pose real threats to the long-term competitiveness of both the supply and demand sides of the market...|$|R
