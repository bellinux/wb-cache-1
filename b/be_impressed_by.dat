5|$|The {{story is}} about three {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E
25|$|The Web {{has also}} enabled {{individuals}} and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization {{in the hope that}} visitors will <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not to <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because she wanted her son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E

Betjeman, a champion of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture, was an early admirer of Burges. In 1957 the Tower House had featured in the fifth episode of his BBC television series, An Englishman's Castle. In a radio interview of 1952 about Cardiff Castle Betjeman spoke of the architect and his foremost work: [...] "a great brain has made this place.

Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in [...] "enough electronic marginal distinction {{to feed a}} coal town for a month" [...] and to compensate for how soulless the songs are, resulting in [...] "arid" [...] art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for The Independent, [...] "For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much {{the same sort of}} emotional knots, but with better tunes.

[...] Critical reception of Girl With a Pearl Earring was mixed, with reviewers positively emphasising the film's visuals and performances while questioning elements of its story. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian, praised the film for its [...] "... sumptuous design and incredible Vermeerish appearance ..."

Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in front of me. And the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1960 a preparatory Commission for the {{upcoming}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 121, with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and Ramiz Alia. Alia later recalled that [...] "the aim of the Soviets was to ensure that our Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev, did not bring the fight out in the open, and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed. To this end, they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery." [...] Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, [...] "We are not of the same opinion as those {{who are trying to}} smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations... We are for carrying the matter through to the end. If this is not understood, it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood. It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve... we shall not allow ourselves to <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?'

2500|$|The {{decision}} of the Privy Council has been criticised in Australia {{on the basis that}} the constitutional question was one upon which the {{decision of}} the High Court should have been final and that the Privy Council should have respected the spirit of the Constitution and avoided conflict with the High Court. In 1957 a proponent for abolishing appeals to the Privy Council described it as an egregious blunder, stating [...] "Even the most fervent admirer of the erudition (sic) of the Judicial Committee, even the most ardent believer in the strength of this 'bond of empire', is hardly likely to <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the judgment delivered by Lord Halsbury {{in the name of the}} Committee. Halsbury's name is associated with a number of judgments of dubious value; but if he were responsible for preparing as well as pronouncing the statement of reasons in Webb v Outtrim, it can only be said that on this occasion even Halsbury surpassed himself in the puerility of some of his reasons and in his fantastic ignorance of the working of a federation under the Crown".|$|E
2500|$|Yezid Sayigh, {{professor}} of Middle East Studies in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, writes of Karsh's criticism, [...] "his {{is not the}} first time that Efraim Karsh has written a highly self-important rebuttal of revisionist history. He is simply not what he makes himself out to be, a trained historian (nor political/social scientist)." [...] (Karsh responds that he has an undergraduate degree in modern Middle Eastern history, and Arabic language and literature, and a doctorate in political science and international relations.) Sayigh urges academics to compose [...] "robust responses [...] that make sure that any self-respecting scholar will be too embarrassed to even try to incorporate the Karsh books in his/her teaching or research because they can't pretend they didn't know how flimsy their foundations are". Ian Lustick, {{professor of}} political science at the University of Pennsylvania, writes of Karsh's attacks on the New Historians that, [...] "however likely readers are to <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> the intensity of Karsh's pristine faith in Zionism, they are sure to be stunned by the malevolence of his writing and confused by the erratic, sloppy nature of his analysis.

2500|$|After the Japanese {{occupation}} of Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, and fearing their attack posed {{a serious threat}} to the Northwest, a strong American naval force was deployed in Alaskan waters. Some estimates had put the Japanese naval strength at four 6-inch cruisers, eight destroyers and as many as eighteen submarines in the Aleutians. Late August 1942, Prince David, Prince Henry, Prince Robert and the corvettes [...] and , were ordered to co-operate with American forces being transported to Kodiak. Operating under orders of the United States Navy, and designated as Force [...] "D", they escorted convoys between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor (now Unalaska), Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands campaign. Prince David and her sister ships made no actual contact with the enemy during their almost 3-month tour of duty in the northern waters. This was not to say, however, that the work was dull or uneventful. Seamen who were used to the open ocean seldom allow themselves to <b>be</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> anything the weather and navigational difficulties have to offer; but the men of the 'Prince' ships soon realized that whatever the perils of the North Atlantic, nothing compared with the sudden gales, erratic currents and uncharted shoals of the North Pacific.
