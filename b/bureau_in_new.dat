2500|$|Despite that, Collins {{managed to}} produce a Finance Ministry that was able to organise a large bond issue {{in the form of}} a [...] "National Loan" [...] to fund the new Irish Republic. According to Batt O'Connor, the Dáil Loan raised almost £400,000, of which £25,000 was in gold. The loan, which was {{declared}} illegal by the British, was lodged in the individual bank accounts of the trustees. The gold was kept under the floor of O'Connor's house until 1922.

2500|$|As {{early as}} June 19, the U.S. Weather Bureau began sending {{reconnaissance}} missions {{to monitor the}} developing storm in the Caribbean. The regular reports sent by the airplanes provided valuable data about {{the intensity of the}} small cyclone. [...] At 16 UTC (10:00a.m. local time) on June 23, the U.S. Weather <b>Bureau</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans advised residents from Mobile, Alabama, to Cedar Key, Florida, to prepare for gale-force winds. Areas from Tampa to Grand Isle, Louisiana, were placed under a storm warning. The center of the storm was expected to strike land early on June 24 between Mobile and Panama City, Florida. [...] As the storm intensified into a hurricane, forecasters shifted their predicted landfall point eastward; early on June 24 the Weather Bureau expected the storm to strike between Tampa and Cross City, Florida. Hurricane warnings were issued for the coastline between Tampa and Carrabelle, Florida; meanwhile, storm warnings were issued from Punta Gorda to Titusville. The city of Tallahassee prepared to receive evacuees, and evacuations were ordered for coastal communities in the Big Bend. The Florida Highway Patrol warned local residents to leave the area, and soldiers were transported out of Carrabelle. As the hurricane moved closer to the Big Bend, storm warnings were extended up the Eastern Seaboard to Savannah, Georgia. Between 300–400 military aircraft were flown out of Florida to Birmingham, Alabama. Once the storm left Florida, additional evacuations commenced between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Cape Hatteras, including the North Carolina communities of Wilmington, Morehead City, and nearby resort towns. Large-scale evacuations from the Wilmington area alone involved 5,000 people and were credited with reducing loss of life. Meanwhile, storm warnings were extended northward to Norfolk, Virginia; however, only minor impacts occurred in Carolinas and Virginia. [...] Nevertheless, the cyclone continued to parallel the East Coast, so storm warnings were eventually extended to Atlantic City, New Jersey; small watercraft in the Northeastern United States were advised to stay in port.|$|E
