40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} furnish data {{on the effect of}} tab balance on tab and control-surface characteristics. The airfoil tested had a modified NACA 65 (1) - 012 contour with a plain flap having a chord equal to 25 percent of the wing chord and with a tab having a chord equal to 25 percent of the flap chord and having several nose shapes and overhang lengths. The results of the investigation indicated that, in general, tab balance affected tab hinge-moment characteristics in much the same manner that <b>flap</b> <b>balance</b> affects <b>flap</b> hinge-moment characteristics. A moderate amount of tab balance did not seem to have any adverse effect on flap hinge-moment characteristics...|$|R
50|$|The Earth-bound Entomopter has a 15 to 18 cm wing span. A {{twin set}} of wings {{situated}} {{fore and aft}} of the RCM provide <b>balanced</b> resonant <b>flapping</b> to create not only lift and thrust, but full vehicle control. Wing flapping occurs a 35 Hz constant rate. This biologically inspired aerial robot is classified as a micro air vehicle (MAV) because of its size. Mission payloads are around 10 grams with a full gross takeoff weight (GTOW) of 50 grams. Intended use is for covert indoor reconnaissance or operation in confined human-inaccessible spaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to qualitatively explain the flow phenomena which occur on a <b>balanced</b> <b>flap</b> type control surface at supersonic speeds and to find means of calculating the pressure distributions occurring. The popular and generally useful linearized flow theory, and in fact any inviscid theory, cannot be used since viscosity plays a predominant part in {{the determination of the}} flow. It is shown that the flow often involves shock induced separation and reflection of shock waves by these separated wakes. Experimental data in the form of pressure distributions and shadowgraph pictures of the flow are used to arrive at a description of the flow. By use of the empirical results given, a method of predicting the pressure distributions for this type of surface is derived. This procedure is then used to calculate several pressure distributions which are compared with those experimentally determined. The separation effects that occur at the larger angles of attack and/or control surface deflection angles cause the control effectiveness and hinge moments to be very non-linear. It is shown that the use of a gap between the wing and control surface delays or eliminates separation {{depending on the size of}} the gap used. Data are presented for a typical control surface, in which the hinge moments were reduced by a factor of 8 or 10 by using a gap between the wing and control surface. A method is given for estimating the size gap necessary to achieve this reduction...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether or not flaps could be expected to have any beneficial effect on take-off performance, the distances required to take off and climb to an altitude of 50 feet were calculated for hypothetical airplanes, corresponding to relatively high-speed types and equipped with several types of flap. The types considered are the Fowler wing, the Hall wing, the split <b>flap,</b> the <b>balanced</b> split <b>flap,</b> the plain flap, and the external-airfoil flap. The results indicate that substantial reductions in take-off distance are possible through the use of flaps, provided that the proper flap angle corresponding to a given set of conditions is used. The best flap angle for taking off varies inversely as power loading and, to a much smaller extent, varies inversely with wing loading. Apparently, the best take-off characteristics are provided by the type of device in which the flap forms an extension to the main wing as in the case of the Fowler wing and the external-airfoil flap...|$|R

40|$|The {{flight path}} of a small parasol {{monoplane}} equipped with a special type of <b>balanced</b> split <b>flap</b> was determined {{for a series of}} glides during which the time taken to deflect or retract the flap was varied from 1 to 15 seconds in order to study the effect of the time taken to complete a flap movement on the motion of an airplane between the start of a flap movement and the attainment of steady flight with the new flap setting. For flap movements accompanied by a change of lift characteristics, and consequently of velocity, there is an appreciable delay in obtaining a desired change in glide angle even though the flap is operated instantaneously. Immediate control of the glide path is obtained only when the speed is maintained during the flap movement. When the speed is changed, the deviation from the desired path during the transition increases in proportion to the rapidity with which the flap is moved so that, with a high-lift flap, abrupt retraction at speeds less than the minimum speed with the flap retracted may be dangerous if practiced close to the ground...|$|R

The engine was revised, with power increased to [...] at 9,000 rpm, 540 Nm of torque at 6,000 rpm. Electronic systems were updated too, introducing side slip angle control (SSC) to improve car control on the limit. SSC performs instant-to-instant analysis of the carâ€™s side slip, comparing it with the target value and then optimising both torque management (via integration with F1-Trac traction control) and torque distribution between the two wheels (via integration with the E-Diff electronic differential). The weight/power ratio (1,290 kg dry, 1,395 kg at the kerb, 90 less than the standard 458) is equal to 2.13 kg/cv, sprints from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in just three seconds (0-125 mph or 0-200 km/h in 9.1 seconds with a response time of just 0.060 seconds).

A multicyclic controller is also implemented to calculate the flap control inputs for minimization of vibratory rotor hub loads. The coupled blade equations of motion are linearized by using small perturbations about a steady trimmed solution. The aeroelastic stability characteristics of trailing-edge flap rotors is then determined from an eigenanalysis of the homogeneous equations using Floquet method. The correlation studies of a typical bearingless rotor and an ultralight teetering rotor are respectively based on wind tunnel test data and simulations of another comprehensive analysis (CAMRAD II). Overall, good correlations are obtained. Parametric study identifies {{that the effect of}} actuator dynamics cannot be neglected, especially for a torsionally soft smart actuator system. Aeroelastic stability characteristics of a trailing-edge flap rotor system are shown to be sensitive to flap aerodynamic and mass balances. Key parameters of trailing-edge flap system for primary rotor control are identified as blade pitch index angle, torsional frequency, flap location, flap length, and overhang length. The swashplateless rotor is shown to achieve better rotor performance and overall more stable than the conventional configuration. Simulations of flaps performing both primary control and active vibration control are carried out, with the conclusion that trailing-edge flaps are capable of trimming the rotor and simultaneously minimizing vibratory rotor hub loads...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} EU co-funded NICETRIP {{project a}} 1 : 5 scale model was tested in the 9. 5 x 9. 5 m 2 test section of the low speed DNW-LLF wind tunnel in June-July 2013 (see Ref. 1). The model design and {{manufacturing}} was largely done by NLR, with inputs from TsAGI (fuselage shells), ONERA (rotor balances and blade design) and Eurocopter (rotor hub design). Model pre-testing, including ground vibration tests and model control in the wind tunnel, was done by DLR. The overall project was led by Agusta Westland. The test matrix consisted of 7 trimmed conditions in helicopter; conversion & aircraft mode. For each trimmed condition a comprehensive number of variations (incidence, sideslip, nacelles, tilting outboard wing angles, flaps, flaperons, rudder and elevator angles, collective and cyclic blade pitch angle settings) were performed {{in order to provide}} data for the flight dynamic model data-base. In total, over 400 different flight conditions, including an exploration towards the boundary of the conversion corridor, were measured. The model has a wing span of 3 m and two 1. 48 m diameter rotors and is heavily instrumented. Model trimming was enabled by a model-pilot interface from DLR to operate 16 (!) remote controls (Ref. 2). Total forces, rotor and tail forces were measured with 6 -component <b>balances.</b> Flaperon, <b>flap,</b> rudder and elevator moments were measured with one-component local balances. In addition various local loads and temperatures were measured and monitored for safety reasons. For each flight condition, over 800 parameters were recorded; consisting of about 50 parameters from balance loads, strain gauges and accelerometer measurements, flight control positions, power required and 678 static and 55 dynamic model pressures. The tests resulted in an extensive and valuable database for the validation of the ERICA tilt-wing/tilt-rotor concept. The relatively large rotors, placed at the wing tips and operating close to the wing leading edge, create significant wing-rotor interference effects, especially during high thrust conditions. Each blade passage over the wing leading edge not only leads to a periodic loading effect on the blade, but the blade wake and blade tip vortex passage over the wing also creates periodic loading of the wing. In turn these unsteady loadings can be a driving factor for rotor and wing vibrations. In a previous paper the unsteady rotor loads and nacelle vibration levels observed during the DNW-LLF tests have been investigated (Ref. 3). In the present paper the focus will be on the steady but particularly on the unsteady pressures measured on the outer wing and their correlation with blade passage, observed vibration levels and flaperon loadings...|$|R
