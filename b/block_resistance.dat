5000|$|Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, low-performance, the {{low-cost}} {{and most}} common {{material for the}} glue sticks (e.g., the light amber colored Thermogrip GS51, GS52, and GS53). They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60-80 °C and have low creep resistance under load. The vinyl acetate monomer content is about 18-29 percent by weight of the polymer. High amounts of tackifiers and waxes are often used; an example composition is 30-40% of EVA copolymer (provides strength and toughness), 30-40% of tackifier resin (improves wetting and tack), 20-30% of wax (usually paraffin-based; reduces viscosity, alters setting speed, reduces cost), and 0.5-1% of stabilizers. Fillers can be added for special applications. Can be formulated for service temperatures ranging from −40 to +80 °C, and for both short and long open times and {{a wide range of}} melt viscosities. High stability at elevated temperatures and resistance to ultraviolet radiation, which can be further enhanced with suitable stabilizers. High vinylacetate content can serve for formulating a hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (HMPSA). EVA formulations are compatible with paraffin. EVA was the base for the original hot melt composition. The composition of the copolymer influences its properties; increased content of ethylene promotes adhesion to nonpolar substrates such as polyethylene, while increased content of vinyl acetate promotes adhesion to polar substrates such as paper. Higher ethylene content also increases mechanical strength, <b>block</b> <b>resistance,</b> and paraffin solubility. Higher vinyl acetate content provides higher flexibility, adhesion, hot tack, and better low-temperature performance. Adhesive grade EVA usually contains 14-35% vinyl acetate. Lower molecular weight chains provide lower melt viscosity, better wetting, and better adhesion to porous surfaces. Higher molecular weights provide better cohesion at elevated temperatures and better low-temperature behavior. Increased ratio of vinyl acetate lowers the crystallinity of the material, improves optical clarity, flexibility and toughness, and worsens resistance to solvents. EVA can be crosslinked by, e.g., peroxides, yielding a thermosetting material. EVAs can be compounded with aromatic hydrocarbon resins. Grafting butadiene to EVA improves its adhesion. Its dielectric properties are poor due to high content of polar groups, the dielectric loss is moderately high. Polypropylene HMAs are a better choice for high-frequency electronics. EVAs are optically clearer and more gas and vapor permeable than polyolefins. Nearly half of EVA HMAs is used in packaging applications. Cryogenic grinding of EVAs can provide small, water-dispersible particles for heat-seal applications. EVA can degrade primarily by loss of acetic acid and formation of a double bond in the chain, and by oxidative degradation. EVA can be compounded into a wide range of HMAs, from soft pressure-sensitive adhesives to rigid structural adhesives for furniture construction.|$|E
40|$|After {{extensive}} thinning of beechwood in the Chiltern Hills, Deschampsia caespitosa {{was seen}} to have become the dominant component of the vegetation on strongly contrasting soils. At three sites selected for study, the soils {{were more or less}} well-drained and ranged from an acid mull (pH 3 · 7 - 4 · 2) through a calcimorphic brown earth (pH 7 · 0 - 8 · 0) to almost pure chalk rubble (pH 7 · 6 - 8 · 3). These soils were characterized in terms of their moisture release curves and their seasonal fluctuations in water availability were monitored during 1971; a computer-based method for the derivation of matric potential directly from gypsum <b>block</b> <b>resistance,</b> employing a polynomial regression model and a temperature correction equation, is described. The chalk soil was found to hold the most available water, but severe water stress proved to be an infrequent contingency on all three sites. However, matric potentials of the order of - 10 bar occurred in summer with no apparent ill-effect on D. caespitosa, indicating that its frequent occurrence in waterlogged habitats is not due to a high physiological requirement for water but to its manifestly broad edaphic tolerance coupled with a lack of competitive ability...|$|E

Censorship of {{information}} on the Internet has been an increasing problem as the methods have become more sophisticated and increasing resources have been allocated to censor more content. A number of approaches to counteract Internet censorship have been implemented, from censorshipresistant publishing systems to anonymizing proxies. A prerequisite for these systems to function against real attackers is that they also offer <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance.</b> Dust is proposed as a blocking-resistant Internet protocol designed to be used alone or in conjunction with existing systems to resist a number of attacks currently in active use to censor Internet communication.

Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E 292 V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F 317 V and T 315 I for dasatinib and Y 253 H, E 255 V, and T 315 I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T 315 I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels. With drug combinations maximal suppression of resistant clone outgrowth was achieved at lower concentrations compared with single agents, suggesting that such combinations may be equipotent to higher-dose single agents.

Dunny. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 120 pages, appendices I-III. Enterococcus faecalis has recently {{emerged as an}} important nosocomial pathogen. Pathogenicity of these organisms depends greatly on a few important aspect of enterococcal physiology. The ability of enterococci to form biofilms greatly enhances their virulence. Their innate resistance to many antibiotics {{and their ability to}} transfer these resistance genes through conjugation heightens their threat to human health. The work described in this thesis attempts to explain the roles of biofilm growth, conjugation, and cell communication in E. faecalis. To examine the role of biofilm growth on the E. faecalis transcriptome, RNAseq analysis was undertaken. We found that over 100 genes were measurably upregulated during biofilm growth while approximately 26 genes were downregulated. These data gives us important insights into the biology of enterococcal biofilms. In clinical settings, biofilms are likely locations for antibiotic resistance transfer events involving nosocomial pathogens such as E. faecalis. Conjugation is an important mode of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, enhancing the spread of antibiotic resistance. In this work, I demonstrate that growth in biofilms alters the induction of conjugation by a sex pheromone in E. faecalis. Mathematical modeling suggested that a higher plasmid copy number in biofilm cells would enhance a switch-like behavior in the pheromone response of donor cells with a delayed, but increased response to the mating signal. Alterations in plasmid copy number and a bimodal response to induction of conjugation in populations of plasmid-containing donor cells were both observed in biofilms, consistent with the predictions of the model. The pheromone system may have evolved such that donor cells in biofilms are only induced to transfer when they are in extremely close proximity to potential recipients in the biofilm community. These results have important implications for development of chemotherapeutic agents to <b>block</b> <b>resistance</b> transfer and treat biofilm-related clinical infections...|$|E

40|$|Proper {{irrigation}} {{of agricultural}} crops for increased production {{is becoming increasingly}} important. Automation provides a means for obtaining the irrigation efficiency need for high production without prohibitive labor requirements being involved. An integral part of an automatic irrigation system is a soil moisture sensing device. The gypsum electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> might be used as such a sensor. Before electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> {{can be used in}} this capacity, more must be understood about the factors which influence them and their operational behavior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the feasibility of using electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> as soil moisture sensors in automated irrigation systems. The specific factors studied were the nitrogen concentration of the soil solution and soil type. <b>Resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> were placed in air dry soil and different concentrations of nitrogen solution were added. Levels studied were 0, 70, 140, and 210 parts of nitrogen per million parts of distilled water. Soils used were Grundy silt loam and O’Neill loamy sand. Moisture content changes in the soil were produced by placing the soil and <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> on a ceramic plate in a pressure extractor and varying the pressures. Pressures studied were 1 / 3, 1, and 2 bars. Conclusions drawn from the results of this study were: 1) use of present day gypsum electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> as soil moisture sensors in automated systems is not feasible; 2) nitrogen concentration levels of the soil solution up to 210 ppm did not significantly influence, at the 5 % level of significance, gypsum electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> placed in Grundy silt loam and O’Neill loamy sand soils and subjected to pressure differentials of 1 / 3, 1, and 2 bars; 3) uniformity of electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> must be more strictly controlled by using proper manufacturing procedures; 4) nitrogen concentration of the soil solution affected <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> placed in O’Neill loamy sand soil more than blocks placed in Grundy silt loam soil. For blocks in O’Neill loamy sand soil, an increase in nitrogen concentration of the soil solution decreased resistance readings of the blocks. For blocks in Grundy silt loam soil, an increase in nitrogen concentration of the soil solution decreased resistance readings of the blocks except for the 70 ppm nitrogen level which increased resistance readings of the blocks.

Unstirred cell filtration was used to study fouling mechanisms and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) were used to characterize the foulant. Generally, the SMP exhibiting characteristics of higher molecular weight, greater hydrophilicity and a more reduced state showed a higher retention percentage. However, the higher retention does not always yield higher fouling effects. The UAP filtration showed the highest specific cake <b>resistance</b> and pore <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance</b> attributed to their higher percentage of low molecular weight molecules, although their retention percentage was lower than the SW and BAP filtration.

To {{estimate}} a <b>block</b> cipher <b>resistance</b> to {{the differential}} cryptanalysis and its various modifications, as a rule, {{it is necessary}} to obtain the upper bounds of the round differential average probability. Round functions of most of the modern block encryption algorithms (e. g.

The parameters of s-blocks, on which these bounds are depended, are defined and conditions, to ensure the least possible values of these parameters, are given.

40|$|The rapidly {{increasing}} emergence of antibiotic resistance amongst pathogenic bacteria {{is a major}} clinical and public health problem. The increase in resistant pathogens, accompanied with {{the small number of}} new antibiotics introduced in recent years, has limited the number of effective antimicrobials. The classical paradigm suggests that antibiotic resistance emerges by selection for pre-existing mutants in the bacterial population exposed to antibiotics. In contrast, recent data suggested that mutations evolve after cells encounter antibiotic therapy. This kind of mutation is known as adaptive mutation, which is activated by the SOS DNA repair and mutagenesis pathways. Accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) is the signal that induces the SOS response by promoting the formation of the RecA filament, which in turn activates the auto-cleavage activity of LexA and allows expression of SOS genes, including the SOS error-prone polymerases. In this project, phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid (PcTs) -based RecA inhibitors were characterized. PcTs molecules were found to potentiate the activity of bactericidal antibiotics and reduce the ability of bacteria to acquire antibiotic resistance mutations. This study highlights the ability of RecA inhibitors to potentiate the activity of antibiotics and provides a strategy for prolonging the life span of existing and newly developed antibiotics.

MKP 3 overexpression was associated with lower levels of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation in the presence of estrogen but that estrogen deprivation and tamoxifen treatment decreased MKP 3 phosphatase activity, leading to an up-regulation of pERK 1 / 2 MAPK, phosphorylated Ser 118 -ER-?, and cyclin D 1. The MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD 98059 blocked tamoxifen-resistant growth. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species was observed with tamoxifen treatment of MKP 3 -overexpressing cells, and antioxidant treatment increased MKP 3 phosphatase activity, thereby <b>blocking</b> <b>resistance.</b> Furthermore, PD 98059 increased the levels of phosphorylated c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) in tamoxifen-treated MKP 3 -overexpressing cells, suggesting an interaction between MKP 3 levels, activation of ERK 1 / 2 MAPK, and JNK signaling in human breast cancer cells. MKP 3 represents a novel mechanism of resistance, which may be a potential biomarker for the use of ERK 1 / 2 and/or JNK inhibitors in combination with tamoxifen treatment.

40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} the {{receiver}} optics plays a crucial part in the ultimate sensitivity of the ALMA array. We present some general design concepts to guide {{the development of the}} optical layout of the final receivers. Relevant properties of materials used in the optical path are examined, and various types of optical elements are discussed. General principles of high efficiency optical train designs are presented. In general, simple systems are advocated, with minimal truncation losses. The areas which have the greatest uncertainty are the windows and infrared filters where the trade-offs between the RF losses, infrared <b>blocking,</b> pressure <b>resistance</b> and gas permeability have to be carefully considered. A sample design for Band 3 is given. I...|$|R
40|$|Water {{management}} is key for profitable alfalfa {{production in the}} West. However {{it is one of}} the most difficult aspects of alfalfa production, in part because of the difficulty in monitoring and evaluating irrigation practices. The soil moisture content of several alfalfa fields was monitored over the last four years for the duration of the irrigation season using Watermark ® <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks.</b> Soil moisture content fluctuated considerably during the season; the driest periods corresponded with alfalfa harvests. Soil moisture content also varied greatly between growers reflecting differences in soil type and irrigation practices between farms. A potential area for improvement in irrigation management was observed at nearly all sites. The most common areas for improvement were over-irrigation in spring, under-irrigation in midsummer, and too late an irrigation starting date. Several years of research and recent commercial use have demonstrated the value of Watermark ® <b>resistance</b> <b>blocks</b> for monitoring soil moisture status, evaluating current irrigation practices, and for irrigation scheduling in alfalfa. Experience has demonstrated that routine soil moisture monitoring can significantly improve irrigation management...|$|R
