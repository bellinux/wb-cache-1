5000|$|<b>Cemlyn</b> is {{a village}} in Anglesey, in north-west Wales. It lies near <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because {{of these}} birds, in {{particular}} the terns, the island has been designated {{as part of the}} Ynys Feurig, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and Ynys Feurig, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. The Skerries have also been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} {{important}} for their tern colony, in particular for roseate tern, for which {{this is the most}} regular breeding site on Anglesey, although numbers of breeding pairs are low currently (2005) compared with the past. Because of this the island has been designated as part of the Ynys Feurig, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and The Skerries, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> is a bay on the {{northwest}} coast of Anglesey, North Wales, approximately 2.5 km west of Wylfa nuclear power station, within the community of Cylch-y-Garn.|$|R
5000|$|Ynys Feurig, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and The Skerries Special Protection Area, {{also known}} as the (North) Anglesey tern colonies, is a Special Protection Area {{covering}} three sites in Anglesey, North Wales which support breeding terns: ...|$|R
5000|$|Saint Rhwydrus's Church, near <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay,</b> {{was also}} {{built in the}} 12th century, but only the nave survives, {{although}} of particular interest is a doorway to the nave dating from that period. [...] It is Grade II* listed, as is Caerau, a late 17th-century house in Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy which contains original panelling.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed study of a complex hydrofracture system and host diamictons exposed within a longitudinal section through an elongate drumlin located to the west of <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay,</b> Anglesey, NW Wales. This complex, laterally extensive sand, silt and clay filled hydrofracture system was active over a prolonged period and is thought to have developed beneath the Late Devensian (Weichselian) Irish Sea Ice Stream as it overrode this part of NW Anglesey. The sediment-fill to the hydrofracture system is deformed with kinematic indicators (folds, thrusts, augen) recording a SW-directed sense of shear, consistent with the regional ice flow direction across this part of the island. The lack of any geomorphological evidence for active retreat of the Irish Sea ice across Anglesey has led to the conclusion that hydrofracturing at the <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> site occurred within the bed of the Irish Sea Ice Stream whilst this relatively faster flowing corridor of ice was actively overriding the island. Shear imposed by the overriding ice {{led to the development of}} a subglacial shear zone which facilitated the propagation of the hydrofracture system with the laterally extensive feeder sills occurring parallel to Y-type Riedel shears. Although a subglacial setting beneath the active Irish Sea Ice Stream can be argued for the <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> hydrofracture system, its relationship to the formation of the ‘host’ drumlin remains uncertain. However, evidence presented here suggests that hydrofracturing may have occurred during the later stages or post landform development in response to the migration of overpressurised meltwater within the bed of the Irish Sea ice; possibly accompanying the local thinning and shutdown of the Irish Sea Ice Stream on Anglesey...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> {{is located}} in the north east of the community, and is owned by the National Trust. It is the site of a nature reserve managed by the North Wales Wildlife Trust, which {{includes}} a lagoon separated from the sea by Esgair Gemlyn, a shingle ridge formed by longshore drift. Islands in the lagoon provide nesting sites for common and Arctic terns, and for one of the United Kingdom's largest breeding populations of Sandwich terns.|$|R
50|$|This bird is migratory and dispersive, {{wintering}} {{more widely}} through the tropical oceans. It has very marine habits compared to most terns; sooty terns are generally found inland only after severe storms. The Field Museum, for example, has a male specimen which was found exhausted on August 2, 1933 {{on the slopes}} of Mount Cameroon above Buea, about 1000 m ASL, after foul weather had hit the Gulf of Guinea. This species is a rare vagrant to western Europe, although a bird was present at <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay,</b> Wales for 11 days in July 2005.|$|R
40|$|Ice streams have an {{important}} capacity in determining the behaviour of ice sheets, taking the form of channels of fastflowing ice. Areas of fast moving ice have also been recognised draining {{the margins of the}} Late Devensian British and Irish Ice Sheet. One of the largest of these palaeo ice streams, the Irish Sea Ice Stream (ISIS) (fig 1), fed ice from its source in southern Scotland, south through the Irish Sea Basin where it merged with ice issuing from the ice caps formed over Ireland, Wales and the Lake District, reaching as far south as the Isles of Scilly. Part of the distinctive ‘footprint’ left by this palaeo ice stream are the drumlins and related bedforms found near <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay,</b> NW Anglesey, NW Wales...|$|R
40|$|Prerequisites for {{successful}} seabird reproduction are secure nesting sites, reliable food supply and reasonable weather. In late 1996, Maritime Ireland / Wales INTERREG Programme agreed {{to fund a}} three year programme focussed on research and conservation action at Roseate Tern Sterna dougallii breeding colonies in the Irish Sea under Measure 1. 3 : “Protection of the Marine and Coastal Environment and Marine Emergency Planning”. All the colonies in the area were included: Rockabill, Lady’s Island Lake, the Dalkey Islands (all in Ireland) and Ynys Feurig, Skerries, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and Inland Sea (all on Anglesey in Wales). This report reviews progress at these colonies and gives more detail on the research carried out at the core breeding population at Rockabill {{and to a lesser}} extent at Lady's Island Lake.

50|$|On islands at {{the western}} end of the lagoon, there is an {{important}} tern colony, with the only breeding Sandwich terns in Wales. The numbers of breeding Sandwich terns have increased to around 1,500 pairs in recent years, making <b>Cemlyn</b> the third-largest colony in the United Kingdom. Arctic and common terns breed here regularly in smaller numbers but roseate tern now only occasionally. For this reason <b>Cemlyn</b> has been designated as part of the Ynys Feurig, <b>Cemlyn</b> <b>Bay</b> and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, Ynys Feurig and The Skerries, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Birds interchange regularly between all three sites, and form part of a larger Irish Sea tern population together with birds at sites in Ireland such as Rockabill Island. The tern colony is wardened from May to August.|$|R
