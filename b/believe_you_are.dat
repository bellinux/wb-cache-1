2500|$|On April 11, 1873, {{after months}} of false starts and aborted meetings, Canby went to another parley, unarmed and with some hope of final resolution. Judge Elijah Steele of Yreka, California wrote later that when he warned Canby that the Modoc were {{volatile}} and he was at risk, Canby replied, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right, Mr. Steele, and I shall regard your advice, {{but it would not}} be very well for the general in command to be afraid to go where the peace commissioners would venture." [...] The peace talks were held midway between the army encampment and Captain Jack's stronghold near Tule Lake. It was discovered later that two members of Canby's party brought concealed weapons and Modoc warriors were also armed.|$|E

2500|$|Given the Democratic {{resistance}} {{coupled with}} Holsinger's lack {{of response to}} the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning, a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied. The political scientist Norman Ornstein said, [...] "It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's a big fat 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate. Even if you know or <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{not likely to be}} confirmed, the idea that you wouldn't sort of do what the committee has asked is still kind of mind-boggling." [...] The committee's Republican ranking member said Holsinger's lack of response was [...] "not helpful" [...] while the editorial board of Kentucky's Courier-Journal characterized it as [...] "disrespectful" [...] and [...] "baffling".|$|E

He left to enter law school at the University of Miami School of Law, where he received his J.D. in 1981. He worked in litigation at a number of firms, until returning to government work. From 1989 to 1993, he served in the administration of the President George H.W. Bush as general counsel to the United States Information Agency. He was later appointed three times by President Bill Clinton to the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees the Voice of America and other U.S. information services. He also worked as an Of Counsel attorney with the prominent law firm of Greenberg Traurig, at their Washington office, focusing on matters of international law. In January 1991 Mora made the final ruling of an investigation of a USIA employee where Mora stated {{at the end of the}} meeting to the individual, [...] "I have reason to <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not worthy to serve our country." [...] After six weeks of review the USIA Appeals board overturned Mora's judgement which was based on an investigation that included improper interrogations and improper use of expunged material. The individual was offered his job back at USIA after Mora was overturned for a staff investigation fraught with errors and injuring an individual due to his sexuality.|$|E
