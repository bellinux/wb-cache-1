5000|$|As {{with any}} kind of human {{psychology}} is <b>browsing</b> understood in biological, behavioral or cognitive terms on the one hand or in social, historical and cultural terms on the other hand. Marcia Bates (2007) researched <b>browsing</b> from [...] "behavioural" [...] approaches, while Hjørland (2011a+b) defended a social view. Bates found that <b>browsing</b> is rooted in our history as exploratory, motile animals hunting for food and nesting opportunities. According to Hjørland (2011a), on the other hand, Marcia Bates' <b>browsing</b> for information about <b>browsing</b> is governed by her behavioral assumptions, while Hjørland's <b>browsing</b> for information about <b>browsing</b> is governed by his socio-cultural understanding of human psychology. In short: Human <b>browsing</b> is based on our conceptions and interests.|$|R

The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can <b>browse</b> in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to <b>browse</b> on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Browsing</b> large image {{collections}} is {{a complex}} and often tedious task, due to the semantic gap existing between the user subjective notion of similarity and the one according to which a <b>browsing</b> system organizes the images. In this paper we propose PIBE, an adaptive image <b>browsing</b> system, which provides users with a hierarchical view of images (the <b>Browsing</b> Tree) that can be customized according to user preferences. A key feature of PIBE is that it maintains local similarity criteria for each portion of the <b>Browsing</b> Tree. This makes it possible both to avoid costly global reorganization upon execution of user actions and, combined with a persistent storage of the <b>Browsing</b> Tree, to efficiently support multiple <b>browsing</b> tasks. We present {{the basic principles of}} PIBE and report experimental results showing the effectiveness of its <b>browsing</b> and personalization functionalities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In this study, {{we explore}} the {{response}} to <b>browsing</b> of two co-occurring Mediterranean oaks, the evergreen Quercus ilex and the deciduous Quercus cerrioides, resprouting in areas affected by large wildfires in central Catalonia (NE Spain). We tested three hypotheses: (i) differences in the preference of browsers will cause a higher impact of <b>browsing</b> on the deciduous oak, (ii) the deciduous oak will show a lower response to <b>browsing</b> than the evergreen one, and (iii) {{the response to}} <b>browsing</b> of Q. ilex and Q. cerrioides will differ {{depending on the season}} of the year when <b>browsing</b> occurs. To test the first hypothesis, we undertook the monitoring of the degree of <b>browsing</b> on resprouting evergreen and deciduous oaks after fire, while the second and third hypothesis were tested by mean of an experiment with different intensities of simulated <b>browsing</b> in different seasons of the year. The results indicate that Q. cerrioides individuals were more heavily <b>browsed</b> than Q. ilex ones. Moreover, <b>browsing</b> matched the two species in most of the size variables considered, cancelling the advantage in height and crown projection of the deciduous oak {{at the beginning of the}} resprouting process. In the experiment of simulated <b>browsing,</b> Q. ilex and Q. cerrioides showed a similar response to the different intensities of simulated <b>browsing</b> applied, but differences between species occurred depending on the season of the year when <b>browsing</b> occurred: Q. ilex showed a higher growth rate of crown projection than Q. cerrioides when it was <b>browsed</b> in autumn and winter, while the opposite pattern was obtained when stumps <b>browsing</b> occurred in spring and summer...|$|R

5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to <b>browse</b> among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are herbivores that <b>browse</b> during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing {{during the rainy}} season when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food in times of little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and <b>browse,</b> but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Similarity <b>browsing</b> is {{a useful}} {{addition}} to any document retrieval system including web search engines. Some already provide such functionality via links called “Find-Similar ” or “Similar pages”. As a search tool, similarity <b>browsing</b> resembles the iterative use of relevance feedback. Therefore, the effectiveness of similarity <b>browsing</b> is {{compared to that of}} relevance feedback. The results show that, at best, “Find-Similar ” — one of many approaches to similarity <b>browsing</b> — improves document retrieval as much as relevance feedback does. Although similarity <b>browsing</b> is easier to implement than relevance feedback, it still requires a good <b>browsing</b> pattern and an appropriate measure for document-to-document similarity. ...|$|R
5|$|Impala <b>browse</b> {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E
