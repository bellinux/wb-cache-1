Until the study, it was generally thought the brain of Psittacosaurus would have been similar to other ceratopsians with low Encephalisation Quotients. Russell and Zhao (1996) believed [...] "the small brain size of psittacosaurs implies a very restrictive <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoire</b> relative to that of modern mammals of similar body size". However, the 2007 study dispelled this theory when it found the brain to be more advanced. There is generally negative allometry for brain size with development in vertebrates, but this was shown not to be true in Psittacosaurus. The EQ score for P. lujiatunensis is 0.31, significantly higher than genera such as Triceratops. A higher EQ correlates with more complex behaviour, and various dinosaurs have high EQs, similar to birds, which range from 0.36 to 2.98. Thus, Psittacosaurus behaviour could have been as complex as that in Tyrannosaurus, whose EQ ranges from 0.30 to 0.38.

Here we assess two methods for probing gene function by RNA interference (RNAi) in adult honeybees. Results The vitellogenin gene was chosen as target because its expression is unlikely to have a phenotypic effect until the adult stage in bees.

50|$|In 1992 the Italian child {{neuropsychiatrist}} Alessandra Piontelli (born 1945) {{published a}} study in her book ‘From Fetus to Child: An Observational and Psychoanalytic Study’. Using sonography she examined the behaviour of 11 rife fetuses. The fetuses showed a very complex <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoire</b> and were quite different concerning their forms of activities. They reacted to stimuli in complex ways. Piontelli’s study suggested that certain prenatal experiences determined later mental life. Psychological traits, f. i. enhanced oral activity, were recognizable in the prenatal phase, and also after birth. Piontelli interpreted her observations in psychoanalytical terms. Piontelli saw a remarkable continuity between pre- and postnatal mental development.

Although the mechanisms of action of EDCs are actively studied, the consequences of endocrine disruption (ED) at the population level and the adaptations evolved to cope with chronic EDC exposure have been overlooked.

40|$|Abstract: Recognising {{elements}} of a ‘modern’ mind, or complex cognition, in Stone Age archaeology is difficult and often disputed. A key question is whether, and in which way Homo sapiens thinking {{differs from that of}} other Homo species/sub-species. We argue that if {{the question of whether the}} modern mind is different from that of our ancestors or other members of the Homo family is to be fully explored, some focus should fall on technologies and behaviours unique to H. sapiens. Here we hypothesise about one such techno-behaviour, i. e., bow hunting (Fig. 1). This is different from, for example, symbolic behaviour for which there is also evidence amongst the Neanderthals (Mellars 2010). Other technologies and their associated <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoires,</b> such as the heat treatment of rocks to improve knapping properties and hunting with snares represent similar opportunities to explore the cognition of early H. sapiens (Wadley 2010, 2013) ...|$|R
5000|$|Because broiler {{chickens}} are {{the same}} species as egg laying hens, their behavioural repertoires are initially similar, and also {{similar to those of}} other gallinaceous birds. However, broiler behaviour is modified by the environment and alters as the broilers’ age and bodyweight rapidly increase. For example, the activity of broilers reared outdoors is initially greater than broilers reared indoors, but from six weeks of age, decreases to comparable levels in all groups. [...] The same study shows that in the outdoors group, surprisingly little use is made of the extra space and facilities such as perches - it was proposed that the main reason for this was leg weakness as 80 per cent of the birds had a detectable gait abnormality at seven weeks of age. There is no evidence of reduced motivation to extend the <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoire,</b> as, for example, ground pecking remained at significantly higher levels in the outdoor groups because this behaviour could also be performed from a lying posture rather than standing.|$|E

Large olfactory bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs are comparable to large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show the size of the eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they are similar to those of Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E

40|$|Abstract To perform tasks, organisms {{often use}} {{multiple}} procedures. Explaining {{the breadth of}} such <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoires</b> is not always straightforward. During house hunting, colonies of Temnothorax albipennis ants use a range of behaviours to organise their emigrations. In particular, the ants use tandem running to recruit naïve ants to potential nest sites. Initially, they use forward tandem runs (FTRs) in which one leader takes a single follower along the route from the old nest to the new one. Later, they use reverse tandem runs (RTRs) in the opposite direction. Tandem runs are used to teach active ants the route between the nests, {{so that they can}} be involved quickly in nest evaluation and subsequent recruitment. When a quorum of decisionmakers at the new nest is reached, they switch to carrying nestmates. This is three times faster than tandem running. As a rule, having more FTRs early should thus mean faster emigrations, thereby reducing the colony’s vulnerability. So why do ants use RTRs, which are bot...|$|R

We argue that promoting the reuse of virtual experiments (the in silico analogues of wet-lab or field experiments) would vastly improve the usefulness and relevance of computational models, encouraging critical scrutiny of models and serving as a common language between modellers and experimentalists. We review the benefits of reusable virtual experiments: in specifying, assaying, and comparing the <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoires</b> of models; as prerequisites for reproducible research; to guide model reuse and composition; and for quality assurance in the translational application of models. A key step towards achieving this is that models and experimental protocols should be represented separately, but annotated so as to facilitate the linking of models to experiments and data. Lastly, we outline how the rigorous, streamlined confrontation between experimental datasets and candidate models would enable a “continuous integration” of biological knowledge, transforming our approach to systems biology...|$|R

40|$|Vibratory {{communication}} in arthropods {{is a widespread}} phenomenon. Arthropods living on plants {{have been reported to}} use only dispersive bending waves in the context of prey–predator, competition, social and sexual interactions. Differences in signal structure have also been postulated to work as species recognition mechanisms and speciation agents. Using two identical laser Doppler vibrometers and a wavelet analysis, we quantified the wave propagation modes in rush stems (Juncus effusus) over the whole range of frequencies used by arthropods. A non-dimensionalized analysis shows that mechanical waves propagate not only as dispersive bending waves, but also as non-dispersive waves. Our analysis implies that an arthropod can communicate through non-dispersive bending waves by either producing signals of high frequencies or by choosing large stems, two widely different options tapping into the physiological and the <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoires,</b> respectively. Non-dispersive waves, unreported so far in insect vibratory {{communication in}} plants, present serious advantages over dispersive bending waves in terms of signal integrity and may well be much more widely used than anticipated, in particular for species recognition...|$|R

Indeed, majors are not restricted to defence, seed milling or food storage but can additionally participate to within nest activities by carrying out 69 % of the minors' <b>behavioural</b> <b>repertoire</b> including brood care.
