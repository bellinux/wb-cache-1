5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes {{and so he was}} charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall {{to the base of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly {{because of the lack}} of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E

5|$|CMLL has {{declared}} the championship vacant on two separate occasions, {{which meant that}} there was no champion for a period of time. Sometimes, a championship is vacated due to an injury to the reigning champion, or when a champion stoped working for the promotion, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, there was a storyline reason behind it being declared vacant the first time. In late 2013 the light heavyweight champion Rush was working a long-running storyline rivalry with El Terrible. When El Terrible won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, CMLL decided to enhance the rivalry by having Rush voluntarily give up the light heavyweight championship in order to receive a CMLL World Heavyweight Championship match against El Terrible. This allowed CMLL to advance the storyline as well as move the championship off Rush without having Rush lose a match, allowing Rey Escorpión to become the next champion. The second vacancy started on May 22, 2017 when CMLL fired the then-champion Máscara.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} Bodiam Castle was landscaped {{when the}} castle was built, {{to increase its}} aesthetic appeal. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam {{as one of the}} best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle. The water features were originally extensive, but only the moat survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, the moat is supplied by several springs, some of them within it, which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s. A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle's walls, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour. Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century castles of Edward I in Wales, such as Caerphilly Castle.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{withdrawing}} from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the Al-Hajar al-Gharbi Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over {{more than a dozen}} enclaves.|$|E

In this study, for solving this problem, ANN is applied for estimating responses, not the SN ratios or MSDs of responses. As Chang (Ozcelik and Erzurumlu 2006) applied ANN in dynamic multiple response experiments, factors and nuisance factors are considered as inputs for training of the neural network.|$|R
25|$|Buca, {{situated}} slightly inland like Bornova, on {{the higher}} ground that commands the southern {{shores of the}} tip of the Gulf of İzmir, started to develop as {{of the end of the}} 17th century when the French consulate in İzmir moved there following the 1676 plague and the 1688 earthquake that seriously shook İzmir's core as an international trade center. Its rich Levantine residents who acquired the surrounding vineyards typically had Latin backgrounds, as opposed to those who originally came from Britain and who preferred Bornova. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> both of Bornova and of Buca, the concentration in terms of respective backgrounds was far from having an exclusive nature.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} list {{of differences}} between the American and British editions of the books is collected at the Harry Potter Lexicon web site. The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect the different dialects and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar Briticisms. Changes of this sort are common when adapting any text from British to American editions <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the Harry Potter books, this standard practice has occasionally drawn criticism from readers who feel that the British English adds flavour to the series. Rowling herself expressed regret after changing the first book's title, as the Philosopher's Stone is a legendary alchemical substance.|$|E
25|$|There {{was another}} {{similarity}} between the two ports. As discussed, the shogunate ultimately opened the port of Kobe, rather than that of Hyōgo as was suggested by the Ansei Treaties. The port at Yokohama, similarly, was opened at the then-destitute Yokohama-mura rather than the bustling Kanagawa-juku. In Hyōgo's case the change caused little incident, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Kanagawa the shogunate proceeded with preparations to open the port at Yokohama over the strong objections of the foreign powers. In the end, the foreign powers ratified the opening of Yokohama when {{the depth of the}} water there proved it a geographically superior location for a port compared to Kanagawa.|$|E

25|$|The Hampartsoum {{notation}} uses symbols {{derived from}} an older notation called խազ khaz {{used by the}} Armenian Church. Pitch is indicated by one of forty-five symbols. There are fourteen notes per octave over a range of three octaves and a minor second; a tilde is used {{in place of a}} sharp and also to raise or lower a note an octave. All twelve notes of the Western chromatic scale are represented, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of F-sharp (fa diyez in Turkish) and B-natural (si), two enharmonic symbols are used for each, because Middle Eastern music uses microtonal intervals called commas. Above each note is written another symbol, marking its duration. Other symbols are used for rests, repeats and phrases.|$|E
25|$|One sample {{preparation}} issue with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is possible matrix effects {{due to the}} presence of background molecules. These matrix effects have been shown to decrease the signal in methods such as PI and ESI by amounts as much as 60% depending on the sample being analyzed. The matrix effect can also cause an increase in signal, producing false positive results. This can be corrected by purifying the sample as much as possible before LC is performed, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of analyzing environmental samples where everything in the sample is of concern, {{sample preparation}} may not be the ideal solution to fix the problem. Another method that can be applied to correct the issue is by using the standard addition method.|$|E
25|$|The {{means by}} which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them {{vulnerable}} to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.|$|E
