40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effect of geometric variables on the bolt load distributions of a cold-formed steel bolt connection. The study was conducted using an experimental test, finite element analysis, and an analytical method. The experimental study was performed using single-lap shear testing of a concentrically loaded bolt connection fabricated from G 550 cold-formed steel. Finite element analysis with shell elements was used to model the cold-formed steel plate while solid elements were used to model the <b>bolt</b> <b>fastener</b> for the purpose of studying the structural behavior of the bolt connections. Material nonlinearities, contact problems, and a geometric nonlinearity procedure were used to predict the failure behavior of the bolt connections. The analytical method was generated using the spring model. The bolt-plate interaction stiffness was newly proposed which was verified by the experiment and finite element model. It was applied to examine the effect of geometric variables on the single-column multibolt connection. The effects were studied of varying bolt diameter, plate thickness, and the plate thickness ratio (t 2 /t 1) on the bolt load distribution. The results of the parametric study showed that the t 2 /t 1 ratio controlled the efficiency of the bolt load distribution more than the other parameters studied...|$|E
40|$|Models {{to capture}} the physics of jointed {{structures}} have been proposed for over 40 years. These models approximate {{the behavior of the}} joint under carefully developed operating conditions. When these conditions change, the model has to be changed. Recent developments in numeric codes like finite elements have created interest in incorporating joint models into the design process but joint models need to represent the joined structure over a broader operating range. This work investigates the dynamic response of a structure with a joint. Isolation of a few dominant effects may give way to a model able to capture a broader operating range. To isolate the effects of the joint two specimens were created. A specimen that is without a joint serves as a control. The second specimen is geometrically similar and contains a double lap joint with a <b>bolt</b> <b>fastener.</b> The differences between the specimens represent the effects of the bolt. Control variables of bolt tension, excitation level and sampling time were chosen. Amplitude response and hysteresis curves were recorded. This data was used to examine the non-linear response of the bolted specimen. Qualitative observations are included. The control specimen shows little effect from non-linear behavior in the frequency response. The bolted specimen shows non-linear behavior in the frequency response. When the joint is introduced to the geometry the system drops in amplitude, drops in resonant frequency, and demonstrates a non-linear softening effect. As the initial bolt tension is reduced the magnitudes of these changes increase. In addition when the system is allowed to dwell with a single sine wave at resonance the amplitude of the response often increases. Hysteresis curves reveal that more than a softening non-linearity affects the response. The curve shows a softening affect when displacing in one direction and a hardening affect when displacing in the opposite direction. This may be affected by the geometry as the control specimen demonstrates a tri-linear stiffness. It is evident that previous joint models do not capture all of the effects observed. Additional research to link the physical cause to the observed affect will aid in adjusting or creating a joint model to be used in numeric codes...|$|E

50|$|The Europa Series 2, or Lotus Type 54, was {{introduced}} in April 1968 (approximately chassis number 0645 onwards). The S2 used the same 1470cc Renault engine and mechanical components as the earlier Series 1, but added {{a number of key}} refinements including opening electric windows, adjustable seats, a new fully carpeted interior and a polished wooden fascia panel for the dashboard. The most significant change was the switch from fully-bonded construction to the use of <b>bolt</b> <b>fasteners</b> to attach the fibreglass body to the backbone steel frame. While reducing the torsional and flexural stiffneses somewhat, the use of a separable body was welcomed by the automotive insurance industry as it greatly reduced the complexity and cost of making repairs to the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|CSU Rhodes Tower {{was built}} between 1968-71. The Brutalist {{structure}} {{was designed by}} the Cleveland architectural firm of Rode, Guenther, and Bonebrake.

It was built at a cost of $21,700,000 including the 2001 renovation. It is a steel structure, clad in white precast concrete panels. There are 2140 separate panels that make up the facing of the massive square tower. When the tower was built, there was controversy over floors shifting; the shifting was caused by bad <b>bolt</b> <b>fasteners</b> imported from Japan.

30|$|<b>Bolt</b> <b>fasteners</b> are {{frequently}} used in timber connection. Major failure in split along the wood grain always {{starts at the}} bolted hole {{because of the large}} difference in material strength and stiffness between the steel bolt and wood [4, 5]. When dealing with the fragile property of wood, compatibility between materials at the joint may be achieved by reducing the diameter of the steel fastener by using products such as self-tapping screws. Further, Bejtka and Blaß [6] suggested that a bolted joint can be further reinforced using self-tapping screws when the axial load-carrying capacity of the screw is larger than 30  % of the lateral load-carrying capacity per shear plane of each dowel. They reported an increase of the load-carrying capacity up to 80  % compared to a non-reinforced joint with ductile load-carrying behavior, and 120  % for a joint with brittle behavior.|$|R

25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used nut and <b>bolt</b> <b>fasteners,</b> the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need}} for tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|R

40|$|Results of a {{preliminary}} study investigating a simple method for detecting looseness in <b>bolted</b> <b>fasteners</b> of a steel structure are presented. Extensive research by many investigators {{demonstrates that the}} frequency response of a bolted structural member changes when one or more bolts are loosened. A simple and effective method for detecting looseness {{can be applied to}} bolted joints, using inexpensive and commonly-available equipment and software. The difference between spectrograms associated with tight and loose bolts is clearly apparent due to the presence of a tell-tale mode when one or more bolts are loosened. Further, a striking difference can be elucidated between audio signals associated with tight and loose bolts, with only minimal post processing. A time-frequency spectrogram was used to identify higher-order modes that are affected by looseness in a horizontal I-beam with bolted connections. One higher-order mode was found to be particularly sensitive to bolt loosening. Results show that the natural frequency associated with a higher-order mode provides a tell-tale acoustic response that can be elicited with an open-output impact test using a common hammer...|$|R

The paper {{presents}} the equations for {{the determination of}} the neutral axis position, when it is on the face, that is, on the bearing plate, and for the highest normal tensile stress in the fastener, {{as well as for the}} determination of highest and lowest normal compressive stress occurring on the face, that is bearing plate when the neutral axis is outside the face, that is, the bearing plate.

40|$|Non-{{pretensioned}} bolted, pretensioned bolted, and riveted lap-spliced specimens {{were tested}} to observe how the fasteners? shear strengths {{were affected by}} (1) loading type, (2) fastener type, (3) number of shear planes, and (4) joint configuration. A 200, 000 -lbf capacity dynamic loader was used to fail the specimens under a monotonic dynamic or quasi-static load. The applied force and acceleration were measured by load cells and accelerometers {{above and below the}} specimen. The test data were normalized by the number of shear planes loaded in each test, actual cross-sectional area per shear plane, and ultimate static tensile strength of the respective fastener type. A statistical analysis (ANOVA and t-test) was conducted on data sets from the 224 tests to determine the significant factors affecting the fastener shear strength. Conclusions from the analysis indicated that the loading type factor has the most significant effect on shear capacity. A fastener?s dynamic shear strength is increased by a ratio of 1. 72 to 1. 78 over its quasi-static shear capacity regardless of fastener type, when both are normalized to the fastener?s ultimate static tensile strength. The joint configuration and shear type generally did not have a practical effect from an engineering standpoint on the shear capacity of <b>bolted</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Shear type did have an effect on riveted specimens under quasi-static loadings.

50|$|This is {{the point}} where the neck meets the body. In the {{traditional}} Spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or flush joint. These joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. Recently many manufacturers use <b>bolt</b> on <b>fasteners.</b> <b>Bolt</b> on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. Some people believed that the Spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.While most traditional Spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, Fleta, a prominent Spanish builder, used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.One reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was {{to make it easier to}} repair necks.

40|$|Partially {{restrained}} (PR) bolted T-stub connections {{have been}} widely used in replacement of established fully restrained (FR) welded connections, which are susceptible to sudden brittle failure. These bolted T-stub connections can permit deformation, easily exceeding the allowable limit without any fracture because they are constructed with a design philosophy whereby the plastic deformation concentrates on <b>bolt</b> <b>fasteners</b> made of ductile steel materials. Thus, the PR bolted connections take advantage of excellent energy dissipation capacity in their moment and rotation behavior. However, a considerable amount of residual deformation may occur at the bolted connection subjected to excessive plastic deformation, thereby requiring additional costs to recover the original configuration. In this study, superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) bolts, which have a recentering capability upon unloading, are fabricated so as to solve these drawbacks, and utilized by replacing conventional steel bolts in the PR bolted T-stub connection. Instead of the full-scale T-stub connection, simplified T-stub components subjected to axial force are designed {{on the basis of a}} basic equilibrium theory that transfers the bending moment from the beam to the column and can be converted into equivalent couple forces acting on the beam flange. The feasible failure modes followed by corresponding response mechanisms are taken into consideration for component design with superelastic SMA bolts. The inelastic behaviors of such T-stub components under cyclic loading are simulated by advanced three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) analysis. Finally, this study suggests an optimal design for smart recentering T-stub components with respect to recentering and energy dissipation after observing the FE analysis results...|$|R
