60|$|The {{fishing was}} various. Soles, whiting, and haddock were the {{principal}} fish {{brought up in}} the trawls; but there was occasionally a <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> or two in the net, and these had to be handled with considerable circumspection, as they could take off a finger or two with the greatest ease with their powerful jaws and sharp teeth. These fish were always hung up in the air {{for a day or two}} before eating, as the flesh improves by keeping; the eatable portions were then cut out, and the rest was thrown overboard. These fish were for the most part eaten by the crew; the small soles, dabs, and flounders were hawked in the town, and the rest of the take sent up to London.|$|E

50|$|The female {{deposits}} {{her eggs}} in pairs on sandy or muddy flats; {{there is no}} discrete breeding season and egg-laying occurs year-round. Females may use discrete spawning beds, as large numbers of egg cases {{have been found in}} certain localized areas. The young emerge after 9 months and measure 18 - 23 cm. Female <b>big</b> <b>skates</b> mature at 1.3 - 1.4 m long and 12-13 years old, while males mature at 0.9 - 1.1 m long and seven to eight years old. The growth rate of <b>big</b> <b>skates</b> in the Gulf of Alaska are comparable to those off California, but differ from those off British Columbia.

Polychaetes and molluscs comprise a slightly {{greater percentage of}} the diet of younger individuals. A known predator of big skates is the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus); the eyespots on the skates' wings are believed to serve as decoys to confuse predators. Juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume the egg cases of the <b>big</b> <b>skate.</b> Known parasites of the <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> include the copepod Lepeophtheirus cuneifer.|$|E

5000|$|This {{species was}} {{described}} by Charles Frédéric Girard in 1855; its specific epithet binoculata {{is derived from the}} Latin bi meaning [...] "two", and oculatus meaning [...] "eyed", referring to the two prominent eyespots on its wings. Girard also described what would later be determined to be a junior synonym of B. binoculata, R. cooperi, based on notes made by James G. Cooper on a decaying <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> found ashore near the entrance of Shoalwater Bay, Washington. In some older literature, this species is placed in the genus Dipturus. In 2012, the <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> was moved from Raja to the new genus Beringraja together with the mottled skate (B. pulchra).|$|E

5000|$|Big skates are {{frequently}} caught by recreational anglers, who usually release or discard them. They adapt well to captivity {{and are often}} displayed in public aquaria. This species {{is one of the}} three most important skates fished off the coast of California, though compared to other commercial fisheries, it is of only minor importance. This species is usually taken as bycatch in bottom trawls; the pectoral fins are sold as [...] "skate wings" [...] and are eaten baked or fried, often being labeled as imitation scallops. In the 1990s, the market value of skate wings rose to US$0.40-$1.00 per pound, and catches of the <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> off California increased tenfold as the trawl fishery began marketing its skate and ray bycatch. In 2003, a targeted fishery for the <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> and the longnose skate (Raja rhina) commenced in the Gulf of Alaska. Population data following this increased exploitation are lacking, but the big skates' slow reproductive rate has led them to be assessed as Least Concern by the World Conservation Union.|$|E

2500|$|Like other skates, {{the common}} skate is a bottom feeder. Its diet {{consists}} of crustaceans, clams, oysters, snails, bristle worms, cephalopods, and small to medium-sized fish (such as sand eel, flatfish, monkfish, catsharks, spurdog, other skates). The {{size of the}} individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The <b>bigger</b> the <b>skate</b> is the more food that {{will be needed to}} sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is the more it eats. [...] The common skate does not only feed on creatures {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, as some do ascend to feed on mackerel, herring, and other pelagic fish, which are caught by rapidly moving up from the seabed to grab the prey.|$|R
50|$|The <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> (Beringraja binoculata, syn. Raja binoculata) is {{the largest}} species of skate (family Rajidae) in the waters off North America. They are found along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja California, {{typically}} from the intertidal zone {{to a depth of}} 120 m, and feed on benthic invertebrates and small fishes. They are unusual among skates in that their egg cases may contain up to seven eggs each. This species {{is one of the most}} commercially important skates off California and is sold for food.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the mottled skate {{consists}} of shrimps, cephalopods, bony fishes, and crabs. It is oviparous, with females producing egg capsules almost year-round. With the similar <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> (B. binoculata), {{it is one}} of only two skate species that regularly places multiple embryos (up to five) into a single egg case. The mottled skate is valued for food in South Korea and Japan. It is subject to heavy fishing, both intentional and otherwise, throughout its range, and its population has declined substantially since the 1980s. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|The maximum known {{length of}} a <b>big</b> <b>skate</b> is 2.4 m, though this species usually does not exceed 1.8 m and 91 kg. This species has a flattened, {{diamond-shaped}} pectoral fin disk slightly wider than it is long, with a long, moderately pointed snout. The eyes are small and placed {{just ahead of the}} large spiracles. The teeth are small with raised cusps, numbering 24-48 rows in the upper jaw and 22-45 in the lower. Two small dorsal fins are on the tail, the anal fin is absent, and the caudal fin is reduced to a simple fold. There is a weak notch in each pelvic fin.|$|E

40|$|Skates are {{in growing}} demand worldwide, and the 2008 U. S. {{landings}} of skates was [...] estimated at 65 million pounds, worth 11 million. However, many Atlantic Ocean skate stocks are collapsing. Alaska has relatively healthy skate stocks {{and there is}} increasing economic pressure to develop directed fisheries for them. Presently, the most frequently landed and exported skates in the Gulf of Alaska are the big (Raja binoculata) and longnose skates (R. rhina). These species are long-lived, possess slow growth rates and mature late in life, making them vulnerable to overfishing. A small experimental directed state fishery for <b>big</b> and longnose <b>skates</b> in Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study the feasibility of a directed skate fishery as a means of increasing the economic resilience of coastal [...] Alaskan communities.
