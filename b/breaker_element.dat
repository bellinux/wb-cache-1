40|$|International audienceHow anti-Alzheimer’s drug {{candidates}} that reduce amyloid 1 – 42 peptide fibrillization {{interact with the}} most neurotoxic species {{is far from being}} understood. We report herein the capacity of sugar-based peptidomimetics to inhibit both Aβ 1 – 42 early oligomerization and fibrillization. A wide range of bio- and physicochemical techniques, such as a new capillary electrophoresis method, nuclear magnetic resonance, and surface plasmon resonance, were used to identify how these new molecules can delay the aggregation of Aβ 1 – 42. We demonstrate that these molecules interact with soluble oligomers {{in order to maintain the}} presence of nontoxic monomers and to prevent fibrillization. These compounds totally suppress the toxicity of Aβ 1 – 42 toward SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells, even at substoichiometric concentrations. Furthermore, demonstration that the best molecule combines hydrophobic moieties, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, ammonium groups, and a hydrophilic β-sheet <b>breaker</b> <b>element</b> provides valuable insight for the future structure-based design of inhibitors of Aβ 1 – 42 aggregation...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of alien chromosome addition lines allows {{the transfer of}} useful genetic variation into elite wheat varieties from related wild species. However, some wild relatives of wheat, particularly those within the Sitopsis section of the genus Aegilops, possess chromosomes that are transmitted preferentially to the offspring when addition lines are generated. Species within the Sitopsis group possess the S genome, and among these species, Aegilops sharonensis (2 n = 14, SshSsh) carries the Ssh genome which {{is closely related to}} the D genome of hexaploid wheat. Some S genome chromosomes carry gametocidal loci, which induce severe chromosome breakage in gametes lacking the gametocidal chromosome, and hence, result in gamete abortion. The preferential transmission of gametocidal loci could be exploited in wheat breeding, because linking gametocidal loci with important agronomic traits in elite wheat varieties would ensure retention of these traits through successive generations. In this study, we have mapped the <b>breaker</b> <b>element</b> of the gametocidal locus derived from Ae. sharonensis to the region immediately proximal to a block of sub-telomeric heterochromatin on the long arm of chromosome 4 Ssh.

The biggest attention is devoted to the circuit breaker marked LPN- 16 B by the company OEZ.

40|$|International audienceThe {{extracellular}} {{deposition of}} insoluble amyloid fibrils {{resulting from the}} aggregation of the amyloid-beta (A beta) is a pathological feature of neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous small molecules {{have been reported to}} interfere with the process of A beta aggregation. Compounds containing aromatic structures, hydrophobic amino acids and/or the alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) as beta-sheet <b>breaker</b> <b>elements</b> have been reported to be effective inhibitors of A beta aggregation. We synthesized two peptides, one containing the Aib amino acid and the other including its trifluoromethylated analog (R) -alpha-Trifluoromethylalanine ((R) -Tfm-Alanine) and we evaluated the impact of these peptides on A beta amyloid formation. The compounds were tested by standard methods such as thioflavin-T fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy but also by circular dichroism, liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments to further characterize the effect of the two molecules on A beta structure and on the kinetics of depletion of monomeric, soluble A beta. Our results demonstrate that the peptide containing Aib reduces the quantity of aggregates containing beta-sheet structure but slightly inhibits A beta fibril formation, while the molecule including the trifluoromethyl (Tfm) group slows down the kinetics of A beta fibril formation, delays the random coil to beta-sheet structure transition and induces a change in the oligomerization pathway. These results suggest that the hydrophobic Tfm group has a better affinity with A beta than the methyl groups of the Aib and that this Tfm group is effective and important in preventing the A beta aggregation...|$|R

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors. Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit <b>breakers</b> as switching <b>elements.</b>|$|R

The instantaneous power dissipated for each breaking waveby the absorbing pressure is specified proportional to the dissipation in an inverted hydraulic jump of identical characteristics. These are obtained by applying a wavetracking algorithm to each calculated free surface. A maximum surface slope breaking criteria is used to identify breaking waves within the incidentwave train.

40|$|International audienceCircuit <b>breakers</b> are {{ubiquitous}} <b>elements</b> {{used for}} ensuring safe operation of low-voltage power systems. Nowadays the loads {{supplied by the}} power systems migrate towards exhibiting significant strong nonlinear behavior accompanied by inrush currents or high-order harmonics that can cause a false tripping of circuit breakers. It is thus necessary to study the interaction between these new loads and the protection devices in order to fully assess their compatibility. Following this context, this paper deals with a new test rig dedicated to protection switching devices, {{which is based on}} the hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation concept. The proposed approach is focused on replicating the tripping conditions of a real circuit breaker coupled to a power system emulated by means of a real-time simulator. The software part of this simulator adds flexibility to the test rig as the circuit configurations and the operating scenarios may conveniently be adapted at lowest cost. The control of the interface between the software simulator and the hardware under test, as well as the closed-loop stability issues, has been thoroughly approached. Experiments carried out on this test rig show the effectiveness of this new test prototyping concept in characterizing real circuit breakers behavior when they protect lighting circuits...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Senior Project {{is to use the}} SEL 387 current differential and overcurrent microprocessor relays to protect three-single-phase 1 KVA 120 : 208 transformers configured in ∆-∆, Y-Y, Y-∆, and ∆-Y connections. In the second phase of this project, is to create a functioning lab that uses the SEL 587 relay to teach basic differential transformer protection for the upcoming EE- 444 students. The protection schemes developed in both of the senior project phases require the use of differential and overcurrent protection elements by monitoring the changes of the input and output current through the transformer. When these currents fail to match, {{in the case of a}} fault, or reach a specified current set point, the relay must trip. Experimentally, these differential protection schemes will be tested by flipping the polarity of the currents going into the relay to simulate an internal fault in the transformer. Afterwards, the event report generated by the relay will be analyzed to verify the results. Because of safety limitations regarding circuit <b>breakers,</b> the overcurrent <b>element</b> will not be tested in this senior project. The EE- 444 lab will follow the same design and test procedure for the first phase of the senior project. However, the lab will use the SEL 587 in place of the SEL 387, the same 3 KVA transformers on the lab bench, and will only test the differential protection for the Y-Y transformer configuration...|$|R
40|$|High {{voltage circuit}} <b>breakers</b> are {{important}} <b>elements</b> in {{the transfer of}} energy between the power plant and the consumer. Circuit breakers of the third generation, so-called SF 6 -selfblast-circuit-breakers, use the energy set free by the switching arc {{in case of a}} fault to build up the pressure necessary for extinguishing the electric arc. Advancing the development and the optimization of circuit breakers requires state-of-the-art simulation tools which grasp the complex interactions between the switching arc, radiation, ablation and gas flow. In the present thesis a model is presented which – due to its physics-based modeling – can be used to answer a wider range of different questions about SF 6 -arcs in comparison with preceding papers, in which the experiment-based two-zone-model for ablation-controlled electric arcs and selfblast-circuit-breakers was deduced and used. The electric arc is modelled by Ohmic heat, convection, heat conduction and radiation included in the energy balance equation and represents a control circuit which controls its temperature profile by specifying only the current. The development of this model is based on a comparison of different radiation models and on the simulation of a SF 6 -model circuit breaker with experimental data. The choice of a suitable radiation model is the essential goal of this thesis. For the simulation of ablation controlled electric arcs both the radiation losses in the arc as well as the radiation flow {{on the surface of the}} nozzle, which is necessary for the PTFE ablation, must be established. It turns out that within the given framework the P 1 model, which requires solving additional differential equations, is clearly better suited for a CFD simulation than the method of the partial characteristics or the Monte Carlo model, which require a beam-pursuing process in the solution space, or the net emissions coefficient, which requires the use of correction factors. The electric arc model was validated with the simulation of wall-stabilized electric arcs, for which the core temperatures can be calculated in good agreement with the experiment. Experimental data for electric arcs in a PTFE nozzle are used to investigate ablation-controlled arcs. Here, not only the pressure build-up is compared, but also the structure of the arc. A suitable turbulence model is chosen with the help of an axially blasted arc for different amperages and by comparing temperature profiles. It turns out that the measured temperature profiles can only be calculated with a reasonable degree of exactness with the help of the SST model. The entire model is validated by virtue of measurements at a model circuit breaker, and the limits of the model are shown...|$|R
