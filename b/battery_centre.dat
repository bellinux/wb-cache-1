40|$|Abstract [...] The paper {{describes}} a real-time adaptive battery model {{for use in}} an all-electric Personal Rapid Transit vehicle. Whilst traditionally, circuit-based models for lead-acid <b>batteries</b> <b>centre</b> on the well-known Randles’ model, here the Randles’ model is mapped to an equivalent circuit, demonstrating improved modelling capabilities and more accurate estimates of circuit parameters when used in Subspace parameter estimation techniques. Combined with Kalman Estimator algorithms, these techniques are demonstrated to correctly identify and converge on voltages associated with the battery State-of-Charge, overcoming problems such as SoC drift (incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to over-charging or ambient temperature fluctuations). Online monitoring of the degradation of these estimated parameters allows battery ageing (State-of-Health) to be assessed and, in safety-critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Due to the adaptive nature of the proposed methodology, this system can be implemented {{over a wide range}} of operating environments, applications and battery topologies...|$|R

50|$|HPIR High Power Illuminating RadarThe early AN/MPQ-46 High Power Illuminator (HPIR) radars {{had only}} the two large dish-type antennas side by side, one to {{transmit}} and one to receive. The HPIR automatically acquires and tracks designated targets in azimuth, elevation and range. It also serves as an interface unit supplying azimuth and elevation launch angles computed by the Automatic Data Processor (ADP) in the Information Coordination Centre (ICC) to the IBCC or the Improved Platoon Command Post (IPCP) {{for up to three}} launchers. The HPIR J-band energy reflected from the target is also received by the Hawk missile. These returns are compared with the missile reference signal being transmitted directly to the missile by the HPIR. Target tracking is continued throughout the missile's flight. After the missile intercepts the target the HPIR Doppler data is used for kill evaluation. The HPIR receives target designations from one or both surveillance radars via the <b>Battery</b> Control <b>Centre</b> (BCC) and automatically searches a given sector for a rapid target lock on. The HPIR incorporates ECCM and BITE.|$|R

60|$|Let me advert to a {{circumstance}} connected with this theme, which cannot but be appreciated by every heart of sensibility. You must have remarked, Mr. Editor, on summer evenings, and on Sunday afternoons, certain grave, primitive-looking personages, walking the Battery, in close confabulation, with their canes behind their backs, and ever and anon turning a wistful gaze toward the Jersey shore. These, Sir, are {{the sons of}} Saint Nicholas, the genuine Nederlanders; who regard Communipaw with pious reverence, not merely as the progenitor, but the destined regenerator, of this great metropolis. Yes, Sir; they are looking with longing eyes to the green marshes of ancient Pavonia, as did the poor conquered Spaniards of yore toward the stern mountains of Asturias, wondering whether the day of deliverance is at hand. Many is the time, when, in my boyhood, I have walked with {{my father and his}} confidential compeers on the Battery, and listened to their calculations and conjectures, and observed the points of their sharp cocked hats evermore turned toward Pavonia. Nay, Sir, I am convinced that at this moment, if I were to take down the cocked hat of my lamented father from the peg on which it has hung for years, and were to carry it to the <b>Battery,</b> its <b>centre</b> point, true as the needle to the pole, would turn to Communipaw.|$|R

50|$|To {{forestall}} {{the perceived}} Russian attack on Eylau and to pin the Russian army, so that Davout's flank attack {{would be more}} successful, Napoleon launched an attack against the Russian centre and left with Augereau's VII Corps {{on the left and}} Saint-Hilaire's Division of Soult's IV Corps on the right.Augereau was very ill, having to be helped onto his horse. Fate intervened to turn the attack into a disaster. As soon as the French marched off a blizzard descended, causing all direction to be lost. Augereau's Corps followed the slope of the land and veered off to the left away from Saint-Hilaire. Augereau's advance struck the Russian line at the junction of its right and centre, coming under the fire of the blinded French artillery, and then the point-blank fire of the massive 70-gun Russian <b>centre</b> <b>battery.</b> Meanwhile, Saint-Hilaire's division, advancing alone in the proper direction, was unable to have much effect against the Russian left.|$|R

5000|$|The central battery ship, {{also known}} as a <b>centre</b> <b>battery</b> ship in the United Kingdom and as a casemate ship in European {{continental}} navies, was a development of the (high-freeboard) broadside ironclad of the 1860s, given a substantial boost due to the inspiration gained from the Battle of Hampton Roads, the very first battle between ironclads fought in 1862 during the American Civil War. One of the participants was the Confederate casemate ironclad , essentially a central battery ship herself, albeit a low-freeboard one. The central battery ships had their main guns concentrated {{in the middle of the}} ship in an armoured citadel. [...] The concentration of armament amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type like previous warships. In this manner the design could maximize the thickness of armour in a limited area while still carrying a significant broadside. These ships meant the end of the armoured frigates with their full-length gun decks.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, the central {{waterfront}} area of Wapping, {{which included the}} original wharf area built on Hunter Island, had declined dramatically {{as a result of}} government attempts to control prostitution, gambling and excessive drinking. As the areas of Wapping and to a lesser extent, Glebe declined, Battery Point and Sandy Bay located to the south of the town, were becoming home to the town's more prosperous residents. Soon, <b>Battery</b> Point was <b>centred</b> on the pleasant Arthur's Circus, where many of the cottages and fine homes of the period can still be seen. Whereas Glebe enjoyed a resurgence, the shanties and brothels of Wapping were condemned, and many were destroyed to make way for new developments, such as the wool store, that survives to this day as the Old Woolstore Hotel. Part of the area had already been reclaimed in the early 1850s for the construction of the Hobart Gas Works, which was opened amidst much fanfare on 9 March 1857, bringing gas lighting to the streets of Hobart Town for the first time.|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of efficient electron and ion transport is a criticalissue in an exciting {{new group of}} materials based on lithium metalphosphates that are important as cathodes for lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> Much interest <b>centres</b> on olivine-type LiFePO 4, the most prominent member of this family 1. Whereas the one-dimensional lithium-ion mobility in this framework is high 2, the electronically insulating phosphate groups that benefit the voltage also isolate the redox centres within the lattice. The pristine compound is a very poor conductor (σ∼ 10 – 9 S cm– 1),thus limiting its electrochemical response. One approach to overcome this is to include conductive phases, increasing its capacity to near-theoretical values 3 – 6. There have also been attempts to alter the inherent conductivity of the lattice by doping it with a supervalent ion. Compositions were reported to be black p-type semiconductors with conductivities of∼ 10 – 2 S cm– 1 arising from minority Fe 3 + hole carriers 7. Our results for doped (and undoped) LiMPO 4 (M = Fe, Ni) show that a percolating nano-network of metal-rich phosphides {{are responsible for the}} enhanced conductivity...|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} forward was European when in 1986 France, Germany and UK agreed the 'List of Military Requirements' {{for a new}} counter-battery radar. The {{distinguishing}} feature was that instead of just locating individual guns, etc., the radar was able to locate many simultaneously and group them into <b>batteries</b> with a <b>centre</b> point, dimensions and attitude of the long axis of the battery. This radar eventually reached service as Euro-ART's COunter Battery RAdar (COBRA) AESA system. 29 COBRA systems were produced and delivered in a roll-out which was completed in Aug. 2007 (12 to Germany - out of which two were re-sold to Turkey, 10 to France and 7 to the UK). Three additional systems were ordered in Feb. 2009 by the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. Simultaneous {{with the development of}} COBRA, Norway and Sweden developed a smaller, more mobile counter-battery radar known as ARTHUR. It was taken into service in 1999 and is today used by 7 NATO countries and The Republic Of South Korea. New versions of ARTHUR have twice the accuracy of the original.|$|R
50|$|Formed at Hartshill, Stoke-on-Trent on 31 August 1914, the 2nd-Line battery was {{assigned}} to the 2nd-Line North Midland Division, which was later numbered 59th (2nd North Midland) Division. At first the recruits had to train on 'Quaker' guns - logs of wood mounted on any available wheels. The division concentrated around Luton in January 1915, where it was tasked with the defense of London; 2/1st Battery relocating to Gadebridge Camp, Hemel Hempstead on 5 February. Here it received four 4.7 inch guns. It trained with the 59th Division until April 1916, but when the Division was posted to Ireland, 2/1st Battery proceeded to France independently, landing at Le Havre on 30 May. It joined VI Corps heavy artillery at Dainville near Arras and {{was assigned}} to 8th HAG on 3 June 1916 as part of Third Army. Here they handed their 4.7 inch guns over to 119th Heavy Battery and three days later took delivery of four 60-pounders. The Battery went into action {{for the first time on}} 5 June 1916 when Left Section at Dainville and Right Section at Berneville began engaging German artillery south of Arras in preparation for Third Army's attack on Gommecourt. The battery was brought up to six guns on 31 July 1916 when it was joined by a section from 149th Heavy <b>Battery</b> which became <b>Centre</b> Section, and it maintained counter-battery fire in support of troops holding Arras until 12 September 1916.|$|R
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} 20 - 30 years, children’s {{physical}} activity levels have decreased significantly resulting in obesity rates reaching epidemic levels. To date there has been very little research regarding physical activity in toddlers, {{with the majority of}} research focussing on young children (3 - 5 year-olds) or on children at risk of motor or neurological deficiencies. Purpose: To investigate the effects of a nine-week, child-centred physical activity programme on cognitive and motor skill development, safety skills, balance and parent supervision in typically developing 12 - 24 month-old children. Methods: In a randomised, controlled design, 90 toddlers (age 17. 0 ± 2. 6 months; 52. 2 % male) and their parents were split into two treatment groups stratified by age and gender at baseline. The intervention completed was either nine weeks (one school term) of one-hour child-centred physical activity classes or normal physical activity for nine weeks. In the school holiday periods prior to, and following the intervention period anthropometric measures (mass and height), overall development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development – Screening Test), safety skills (nine-skill test <b>battery),</b> balance measures (<b>centre</b> of pressure) and parent-child supervision were assessed. Results: The nine-week physical activity intervention was successful in improving the overall safety skills score (p < 0. 05). In addition, the ability to climb over a small-runged A-frame while using a cylinder grip and safe face-the-slope dismount and the execution of a safety roll down a foam wedge were improved {{as the result of the}} intervention (p < 0. 05). There was no effect of the exercise intervention on overall development, measures of balance or supervision aspects. A main effect of Age Group on the mean change score in all subscales was reported with younger children (12 - 18 months) tending to show greater improvements as compared to older children (18 - 24 months). Regression analysis showed that 27. 8 % of the change in overall development could be predicted by knowing the age of the child and whether their day-to-day environment was mostly home care with their parent or other adult, or not. Conclusions: This was the first randomised, controlled trial that examined the effects of a child-centred physical activity programme on overall development, safety skills, balance and supervision in 12 - 24 month-old children in New Zealand. There is a need for more randomised, controlled trials that incorporate a multitude of external factors that may influence development, namely cognitive and motor skill development...|$|R
