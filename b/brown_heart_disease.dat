40|$|OBJECTIVE - To assess {{mortality}} and the psychological repercussions of the prolonged waiting time for candidates for heart surgery. METHODS - From July 1999 to May 2000, using a standardized questionnaire, we carried out standardized interviews and semi-structured psychological interviews with 484 patients with coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> 121 patients with valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> and 100 patients with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> RESULTS - The coefficients of mortality (deaths per 100 patients/year) were as follows: patients with coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> 5. 6; patients with valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> 12. 8; and patients with congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> 3. 1 (p< 0. 0001). The survival curve was lower {{in patients with}} valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> than in patients with coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (p< 0. 001). The accumulated probability of not undergoing surgery was higher in patients with valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> than in the other patients (p< 0. 001), and, among the patients with valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> this probability was higher in females than in males (p< 0. 01). Several patients experienced intense anxiety and attributed their adaptive problems in the scope of love, professional, and social lives, to not undergoing surgery.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{has been the}} leading cause of death all over the world. However, it is among the most {{preventable}} and controllable diseases. The World Health Organization reported that early detection of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> reduces progression to severe and costly illness and complications. Early detection of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients helps in recovering the patientsâ health and decreasing the mortality rate from <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Although <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> can be detected by several tests, such as electrocardiogram, stress tests, and cardiac angiogram, these tests are expensive and cannot be used as community-level screening tests. The Framingham <b>Heart</b> <b>Disease</b> Risk Evaluation Tool and the Australian Absolute Cardiovascular Risk Calculator are two common <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> risk evaluation screening tests. However, both tests need prior blood sample investigations, an invasive and relatively costly process, which reduces their usability in other than medical settings. Motivated by the increasing mortality rates of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients, researchers have been applying different data mining techniques in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Research finds that the same data mining technique shows different results across different <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> datasets indicating that there can be significant attributes for <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosis. Furthermore, researchers suggest that hybrid data mining techniques show better performance in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients. This research seeks to help healthcare professionals in the early detection and risk evaluation of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients using data mining analysis. To achieve this objective, the significant attributes in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients are identified using a benchmark dataset and a new larger dataset, the reliability of non-invasive attributes in the diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> is investigated, the enhancement of applying hybrid data mining model to the non-invasive attributes is tested, and a <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> expert system risk evaluation tool (HD - ESRET) using hybrid data mining model on non-invasive data attributes is constructed.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{diagnosis}} is a challenging task which can offer automated prediction about the <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> of patient so that further treatment {{can be made}} easy. Due to this fact, <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosis has received immense interest globally among medical community. Here, artificial intelligence {{played an important role}} in diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> with improved effectiveness. Based on this perspective, several researches have been conducted in the literature recently. So, analyzing those diagnosis techniques can lead to new development in this area. Accordingly, we present a detailed survey of 47 articles published in the standard journals from the year 2005 to 2013. The survey of the papers related to <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and also the survey of many categories of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> such as coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> coronary artery <b>disease,</b> <b>heart</b> failure, ischemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> cardiovascular <b>disease,</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and hypoplastic left heart syndrome are presented in this paper. From the survey the finding is that neural network based techniques contribute more effectiveness and some techniques have obtained more than 90 % accuracy.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} firstly to estimate the healthcare costs attributable to <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in Denmark using recently available data for 2002 – 05. Secondly, to estimate the attributable healthcare costs of lifestyle risk factors among heart patients, in order to inform decision making about prevention programmes specifically targeting patients with <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Methods: For a cohort consisting of participants in a national representative health interview survey, register-based information about hospital diagnosis was used to identify patients with <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Healthcare consumption during 2002 – 05 among individuals developing <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> during 2002 – 05 was compared with individuals free of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Healthcare costs attributable to <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> were estimated by linear regression with adjustment for confounding factors. The attributable costs of excess drinking, physical inactivity and smoking among future heart patients were estimated with the same method. Results: Individuals with <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> cost the healthcare system on average J 3195 (pv 0. 0001) per person-year more than individuals without <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The attributable cost of unhealthy lifestyle factors among individuals at risk of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> was about 11 %– 16 % of the attributable cost of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Conclusions: <b>Heart</b> <b>disease</b> incurs significant additional costs to the healthcare sector, and more so if heart patients have a history of leading an unhealthy life.
