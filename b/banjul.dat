5|$|Sierra Leone has a Sierra Leone women's {{national}} under-17 football team. They {{were supposed}} {{to compete in the}} African Women U-17 Championship Qualifying Tournament 2010. Togo won the first round because Sierra Leone withdrew from the competition. They competed in the CAF qualifiers for the FIFA U-17 World Cup that will be held in Azerbaijan in September 2012. They did not advance out of their region. The team was supposed to play the Gambia women's national under-17 football team in a qualifying match for the 2012 U-17 Qualifying Tournament. Sierra Leone lost the first leg in <b>Banjul,</b> Gambia 0–3. The return match was delayed for 24 hours. The team's head coach attributed the loss to poor refereeing. The game against Gambia was the country's first junior national international match. The second match was one by Sierra Leone 3–1. Gambia won the first match in 3-0 in a game played in <b>Banjul.</b> The return match was delayed in for 24 hours and played in Makeni. Gambia beat Sierra Leone to qualify for the final round with an aggregate score of 4-3.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Great War, the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Thiès, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and <b>Banjul.</b> In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country.|$|E
5|$|While {{a direct}} route by sea {{has not been}} {{available}} since {{the sinking of the}} Joola, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and the river), the former running through Nioro du Rip to Farafenni, and the latter crossing the river to <b>Banjul.</b> The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7p.m. and 10a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant demining operations. Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring, or to travel by boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.|$|E
5|$|The {{country did}} not have a FIFA-recognised youth {{national}} team until 2012, when the Gambia under-17 women's team competed in Confederation of African Football qualifiers for the FIFA U-17 World Cup, to be held in Azerbaijan in September 2012. The Gambia had fielded an under-17 team of 24 players, narrowed from an initial pool of 49 young women. Two girls from the SOS Children’s Village Bakoteh were chosen as a members of the team. The Gambia first played Sierra Leone in a pair of qualifying matches for the tournament. Gambia won the first match 3-0 in <b>Banjul,</b> the Gambia's capital. The return match was delayed in for 24 hours and played in Makeni. The Gambia beat Sierra Leone 4-3 to qualify for the final round. The Gambia then beat Tunisia 1-0 at home and won 2-1 in Tunisia. Adama Tamba and Awa Demba scored the Gambia's goals. Tunisia's only goal was a Gambian own goal. The win qualified Gambia for the 2012 Azerbaijan World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Following the shooting, {{students}} in the country's only boarding school and several other rural towns across the Gambia launched their own protests on 11 April. Like their colleagues in <b>Banjul,</b> they were violently suppressed and hundreds of students were detained across the country.|$|E
25|$|The airline had a {{revenue of}} 209 million kroner in 1986, up 31 percent, and {{produced}} a profit of 5 million.

25|$|In October 2012, {{start-up}} airline Gambia Bird commenced twice-weekly non-stop services between <b>Banjul</b> and Robertsfield with an Airbus A319. This {{service was}} later {{expanded to include}} multi-week flights to Accra and Freetown, and by mid-2014 Gambia Bird had offered the most destinations from Robertsfield of any airline, with same-plane service to Lagos, Douala and Dakar. Also in early 2014, Air Côte d'Ivoire added a service from Abidjan to Freetown via Roberts International.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} new cities were built {{following}} the end of colonialism, while others were greatly expanded. Perhaps the best known example is that of Abidjan, where the majority of buildings were still designed by high-profile non-African architects. In Yamoussoukro, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro {{is an example of a}} desire for monumentality in these new cities, but Arch 22 in the old Gambian capital of <b>Banjul</b> displays the same bravado.|$|E
25|$|The {{membership}} {{of many of}} the communities overlaps, and their rationalisation has been under discussion for several years– and formed the theme of the 2006 <b>Banjul</b> summit. At the July 2007 Accra summit the Assembly finally decided to adopt a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities. This protocol is intended to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and Lagos Plan of Action time frames.|$|E
25|$|GAMSU {{decided to}} hold their protest march on 10 April 2000, and 'thousands' {{reportedly}} gathered outside the Gambia Technical Training Institute intending to march towards the <b>Banjul</b> city centre. However, they were stopped by police officers, who ordered them to disperse. Refusing to do so, the police opened fire on the protest with tear gas and rubber bullets. The students then scattered but regrouped, creating barricades out of burning tires and throwing stones at the police. As non-students then joined the fray, government buildings were attacked and a police station was set on fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{black market}} also {{attracted}} an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began {{to institute a}} delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting {{to wait for the}} Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to <b>Banjul,</b> where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently {{with the}} {{developments}} surrounding Barry's murder, a 13-year-old girl, {{known in the}} press as Binta, was allegedly raped by a uniformed paramilitary police officer (part of the Police Intervention Unit) at the Independence Stadium during an inter-schools sports competition. A medical examination confirmed that the girl had been raped, and GAMSU again pressed the government for answers, calling for the girl {{to be allowed to}} identify the rapist. Following a long delay in any government action, GAMSU requested a police permit to hold a public protest. The request was denied, but, referring to their constitutional right to protest, GAMSU called its members {{to take part in a}} peaceful march towards the capital city of <b>Banjul.</b>|$|E
25|$|The April 2000 Gambian student {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 14 people (and one accidental death) by Gambian police officers and soldiers on the 10 April 2000 at a student protest in <b>Banjul,</b> the Gambia. The protest had been called following two separate incidents - the beating to death of secondary school student Ebrima Barry by firefighters, and the rape of a 13-year-old girl by a uniformed police officer - {{and the lack of}} investigation of both of those incidents. Despite firing live ammunition into the protesters after government buildings had been damaged, no charges have been brought against those involved, and the Yahya Jammeh government suppressed commemoration of the event. Adama Barrow's government has since promised to investigate the shooting.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} peacemaking {{conferences}} in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. But {{the first seven}} peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in <b>Banjul,</b> Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by Dr. Amos Sawyer, leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed. [...] ECOMOG was reinforced {{in order to protect}} the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.|$|E
