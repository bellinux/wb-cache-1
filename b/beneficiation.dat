25|$|Iron {{production}} continued steadily {{for many}} more decades; by the 1950s traditional iron mines had exhausted most of their resources. It had been known for many years that northern Minnesota had an ore called taconite, which could be refined into iron through a process called <b>beneficiation.</b> A taconite processing plant was built further north along the North Shore at Silver Bay, and it quickly became the major taconite shipping port. Minnesota taconite produces {{over half of the}} iron mined in Minnesota at the present date.|$|E
25|$|As the {{merchant}} pig iron business began to decline, Crane Iron sold off {{much of its}} railroad interests in 1896. In an effort to revive Eastern iron mining {{in the face of}} competition from Minnesota, Crane took part in Thomas Edison's attempts to develop a magnetic ore <b>beneficiation</b> process. However, Edison's experiments proved uneconomical and the Edison Ore-Milling Company was a failure. In 1899, Crane Iron was sold to the Empire Steel and Iron Company, a conglomerate of Eastern and Southern iron furnaces. The Crane Works, as the company's plant was now known, last made iron in 1930, and the plant was torn down in 1932.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II {{and the ensuing}} industrial demand further increased lime traffic. The war also brought about a brief resurgence in the Bellefonte Central's original source of revenue, iron ore. The Scotia Mining Company was formed {{at the beginning of}} the war to resume mining in Scotia, and built a new ore washer in 1942. The ore was initially trucked to Waddle for shipment, but after it was determined to be insufficiently pure, the company obtained Reconstruction Finance Corp. money for further improvements. A new 3mile (4.8km) spur was built from the main line at Lagarde (Alto) to a new <b>beneficiation</b> plant at Scotia. However, only 35carloads of ore were shipped before the Surrender of Japan, and the resulting fall in iron ore prices made mining uneconomical once again.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, No. 3 stack was raised, and No. 4 {{went out}} of service in July 1890. The Crane and Thomas Iron {{companies}} leased the C to the Reading Railroad on December 8, 1893, and Crane Iron sold off its share to the Reading entirely from June 5, 1896, leaving the line-haul railroad business. During the 1890s, Crane Iron also participated in the experiments of Thomas Edison, who was attempting to rejuvenate the then-moribund Eastern magnetite mines by magnetic <b>beneficiation.</b> Initial attempts were frustrated by the dusty nature of the finely-ground ore (which made it susceptible to losses both in transit and during the furnace blast), and the process ultimately proved uneconomical in competition with cheap Mesabi Range ores, which came to replace locally-mined ore. In 1899, the company was sold to the Empire Steel and Iron Company and became their Crane Works. The works was gradually dismantled, last making iron in 1930. It was scrapped in 1932.|$|E
25|$|Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, {{although}} {{depending on}} the application, {{this may not be}} necessary. Ash used as a cement replacement must meet strict construction standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. 75% of the ash must have a fineness of 45µm or less, and have a carbon content, measured by the loss on ignition (LOI), of less than 4%. In the U.S., LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance. This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using <b>beneficiation</b> methods like mechanical air classification. But if fly ash is used also as a filler to replace sand in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the Bureau of Indian Standards mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality.|$|E

2500|$|Graphite is mined by both {{open pit}} and {{underground}} methods. Graphite usually needs <b>beneficiation.</b> This may {{be carried out}} by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. <b>Beneficiation</b> by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and [...] "marks" [...] (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the [...] "marked" [...] gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue).|$|E

In a similar way to that in which electrostatic separation sorts particles with different electrostatic charges magnetic <b>beneficiation</b> sorts particles that respond to a magnetic field. Electrostatic <b>beneficiation</b> is effective for removing particulate matter, such as ash from mined coal, while magnetic separation functions well for removing the magnetic iron ore from deposits of clay in the earth.|$|E
