40|$|The paper {{discuss the}} profit made by {{construction}} sites operated by one {{company as a}} measure of their effectiveness. The different types of cost, that should have been covered by income, were described. The distinction between indirect cost made on <b>building</b> <b>site</b> and indirect cost made by headquarter of a company were shown, as well as necessity of including both on them in calculating <b>building</b> <b>site</b> effectiveness. Three different method of assigning company overhead cost to the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> were shown and discussed. Their significant influence on <b>building</b> <b>site</b> profitability was emphasised and calculated for exemplary values. The necessity of calculating full cost for each <b>building</b> <b>site</b> operating by one company was discussed in the article too, by showing which information is necessary for a company management, a <b>building</b> <b>site</b> management and for company shareholders...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to standardize the procedure on building site-dynamic tasks and to give instructions how building costs can be saved and damages at building/installations can be avoided by timely building site-dynamic investigations. Conditions for the consideration of the vibration behaviour of the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> are defined. On the estimation of vibrations, there are three different types: the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> influences the vibration behaviour of buildings/installations, the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> transmits vibrations by wave propagation and the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> can change its properties due to vibration effectsAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 5973 (2213) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Raumordnung, Bauwesen und Staedtebau, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimated}} {{market value}} of a <b>building</b> <b>site</b> can be determined from several practical reasons. Amongst the various cases, it {{may be required to}} determine the market value of the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> aggregated into homogeneous areas, as occurs in the estimates carried out for tax purposes, in the assessments related to the construction of public facilities or infrastructure and urban regeneration interventions related to whole degraded environments. The process outlined in this paper is instrumental to these goals. The method uses an indirect approach to estimate, based on a combination of planning parameters and characteristics of the area that contribute to the formation of market values of <b>building</b> <b>sites.</b> It does not provide a point estimate, relative to assets specifically identified, but produces average market values of the <b>building</b> <b>sites</b> to separate homogeneous areas, for intended use and for building ratio...|$|R
