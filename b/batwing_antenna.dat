For reasons never really determined, it actually made reception worse.|$|E
5000|$|A batwing or super {{turnstile}} antenna {{is a type}} of broadcasting antenna used at VHF and UHF frequencies, named for its distinctive shape which resembles a bat wing or bow tie. Stacked arrays of <b>batwing</b> <b>antennas</b> are used as television broadcasting antennas due to their omnidirectional characteristics. [...] <b>Batwing</b> <b>antennas</b> generate a horizontally polarized signal. The advantage of the [...] "batwing" [...] design for television broadcasting is that it has a wide bandwidth. It was the first widely used television broadcasting antenna.|$|R
50|$|Batwing or superturnstile - A {{specialized}} antenna used {{in television}} broadcasting consisting of perpendicular pairs of dipoles with radiators resembling bat wings. Multiple <b>batwing</b> <b>antennas</b> are stacked vertically on a mast to make VHF television broadcast antennas. Omnidirectional radiation pattern with high gain in horizontal directions. The batwing shape gives them wide bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{normal mode}} {{turnstile}} antennas called superturnstile or <b>batwing</b> <b>antennas</b> {{are used as}} television broadcasting antennas. Axial mode turnstiles are widely used for satellite ground station antennas in the VHF and UHF bands, as circular polarization is often used for satellite communication since it is not sensitive to {{the orientation of the}} satellite antenna in space.|$|R

50|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air on September 18, 1954; {{broadcasting}} at 316,000 watts, it was founded by the Skyway Broadcasting Company, owners of WLOS radio (1380 AM, now WKJV; and 99.9 FM, now WKSF). Having been with the ABC-TV network since its sign-on, WLOS is the second-longest tenured primary ABC affiliate located south of Washington, D.C. (behind Lynchburg, Virginia's WSET-TV, also on virtual channel 13 and also owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group). During the late-1950s, WLOS was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. The station's original studios and transmitter facilities were based alongside its co-owned radio stations in West Asheville (the 300 ft self-supporting tower with an analog <b>batwing</b> <b>antenna</b> atop; it remains standing to this day). A {{few months after the}} station signed on, the television station relocated its studio operations to Battle House (a restored mansion on Macon Avenue, northeast of downtown Asheville, next to the historic Grove Park Inn).At that same time, the transmitter was moved to the much-higher Mount Pisgah, 35 mi away. Due to the higher elevation, Federal Communications Commission rules required channel 13 to reduce its transmitter power by half. But even with its power reduced to 178,000 watts, the station still more than doubled its coverage area to include most of Western North Carolina and Upstate South Carolina. Soon afterward, the FCC combined the western Carolinas into one large market. With its move to Mount Pisgah, WLOS could now boast the second highest transmitter location east of the Mississippi River at 2804 ft above average terrain (the valley floor) and 6056 ft above sea level. At the time, the highest transmitter elevation belonged to WMTW-TV atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire at 3871 ft above average terrain (the valley floor), and 6374 ft above sea level.|$|E
40|$|A passive, battery-free {{transponder}} {{system with}} a carrier frequency of 5. 83 GHz has been designed for information transmission from the roadside to passing vehicles independent on the conditions of weather and visibility. Battery-free operation is enabled by active storers and modulators {{in connection with a}} high-frequency field released by the vehicle for energy supply. The required energy efficiency is achieved by special <b>batwing</b> <b>antenna</b> radiators. Reliability of the data transmission system is demonstrated by field tests revealing {{at the same time that}} the carrier frequency may be varied without additional system modification.

5000|$|A later {{innovation}} involved {{changing the}} shape of the dipole elements, from simple rods to broader shapes, to increase the bandwidth of the antenna. [...] Early TV broadcast antennas used [...] "cigar shaped" [...] elements, shown in image of 1939 RCA Empire State Building antenna above. A common shape today is the <b>batwing</b> or superturnstile <b>antenna,</b> used for television broadcasting in the VHF or UHF bands [...] The batwing shape of each element produces an antenna with wide impedance bandwidth. [...] Up to eight <b>batwing</b> <b>antennas</b> are usually stacked vertically and fed in phase to make a high gain omnidirectional antenna for TV broadcasting. [...] The wide bandwidth was needed at the low VHF analog TV broadcast band, as the 6 MHz TV channel bandwidth was about 10% of the frequency.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Batwing</b> <b>antennas</b> are a {{specialized}} type of crossed dipole antenna, {{a variant of}} the turnstile antenna. Two pairs of identical vertical batwing-shaped elements are mounted at right angles around a common mast. Element “wings” on opposite sides are fed as a dipole. To generate an omnidirectional pattern, the two dipoles are fed 90° out of phase. The antenna radiates horizontally polarized radiation in the horizontal plane. Each group of four elements at a single level is referred to as a bay. The radiation pattern is close to omnidirectional but has four small lobes (maxima) in the directions of the four elements.|$|R
5000|$|For {{directional}} antennas, the Yagi antenna is {{the most}} widely used as a high gain or [...] "beam" [...] antenna. For television reception, the Yagi is used, as well as the log periodic antenna due to its wider bandwidth. Helical and turnstile antennas are used for satellite communication since they employ circular polarization. For even higher gain, multiple Yagis or helicals can be mounted together to make array antennas. Vertical collinear arrays of dipoles {{can be used to make}} high gain omnidirectional antennas, in which more of the antenna's power is radiated in horizontal directions. Television and FM broadcasting stations use collinear arrays of specialized dipole <b>antennas</b> such as <b>batwing</b> <b>antennas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "batwing" [...] {{shape of}} the {{elements}} is used because it gives the antenna a wide bandwidth of approximately 20% of operating frequency at a VSWR of 1.1:1. This makes the antenna design suitable for broadcasters who wish to use a single antenna to transmit multiple television signals and thus made the <b>batwing</b> the preferred <b>antenna</b> for lowband TV stations (channels 2-6) {{in the early days}} of broadcast television.|$|R
