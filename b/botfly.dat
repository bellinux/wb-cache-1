25|$|Myiasis often {{occurs in}} wild, and {{domestic}} animals. In particular, rabbits, pigs, dogs and sheep can be victims of “blowfly strike” {{because of the}} urine or fecal matter stuck to their fur, fleece, or hind quarters through neglect, poor captivity and living conditions, or ill-health. “Blowfly strike” is a well-recognized and economically damaging problem primarily seen in sheep. “Blowfly strike” is estimated to cost the Australian sheep industry at least $161 million annually. 9 of the 10 cases submitted by the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association stated that the insects colonizing most animals were the metallic Blue-Green Blow Fly (Lucilia illustris, Meigen) or the Green Bottle Fly (Phaenicia sericata, Meigen). In the one case, the larvae of <b>botfly</b> (Cuterebra jellison, Curran) colonized a pet rabbit.

500|$|Caprimulgus {{and the old}} name [...] "goatsucker" [...] both {{refer to}} the myth, old even {{in the time of}} Aristotle, that nightjars suckled from nanny goats, which {{subsequently}} ceased to give milk or went blind. This ancient belief is reflected in nightjar names in other European languages, such as German Ziegenmelker, Polish kozodój and Italian succiacapre, which also mean goatsucker, but despite its antiquity, it has no equivalents in Arab, Chinese or Hindu traditions. It is likely that the birds were attracted by insects around domestic animals, and, as strange nocturnal creatures, were then blamed for any misfortune that befell the beast. Another old name, [...] "puckeridge", was used to refer to both the bird and a disease of farm animals, the latter actually caused by <b>botfly</b> larvae under the skin. [...] "Lich fowl" [...] (corpse bird) is an old name which reflects the superstitions that surrounded this strange nocturnal bird.

5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of <b>botflys.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii, Poljakov, 1881) is an {{endangered}} subspecies of wild horses (Equus ferus) native to steppes of Central Asia. In 2015, the Program of Establishing of a Semi-Free Population of the Przewalski’s Horse in the Orenburg Reserve was launched by FGFI “Orenburg Reserves”. The {{first group of}} 6 Przewalski’s horses (2 males and 4 females) born in the semi-reserve Le Villaret, France, was transported to the Orenburg Reserve. Th e aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} species composition of the intestinal parasite community and to monitor the dynamics of the parasite infection of the newly established Przewalski’s horse population. The level of infection by gastrointestinal parasites within the horses was examined by the McMaster method. Gastrointestinal parasites were collected in vivo after deworming of the horses with macrocyclic lactone drug “Univerm” (0. 2 % aversectin C, PharmBioMed, Russia). Totally, 20 species of parasites were found: 19 species of nematodes (species of the family Strongylidae and Habronema muscae) and one species of <b>botflies</b> from the genus Gasterophilus. Th e widest species diversity (18 species from 8 genera) was observed in strongylids: 2 species from the subfamily Strongylinae and 16 species from Cyathostominae. Distribution of strongylid species between ten prevalence classes revealed a bimodal structure (“core-satellite” mode) of the strongylid community.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether synchronization of birth by female Townsend's voles occurs in natural populations {{as a result}} of environmental or social factors, the temporal pattern of reproduction was monitored in two populations of known relatedness. reproduction was most intense from April to July and less intense during the infestation by <b>botflies</b> in August and September. Synchronization of births was not related to the distance between females's nests or activity centers. This suggests that habitat characteristics of home-ranges do not cause the synchronization of parturitions. There was no correlation between the degree of relatedness of females and the synchronization of the birth of their litters. Among nearest neighbours, pairs of sisters and mothers and their daughters reproducing in the year of their birth had their litters significantly more synchronized than other females. Thus neighbouring relatives reproduce more synchronously than unrelated neighbours. Because related females often breed in communal home-ranges they could benefit from synchrony through a reduction of the risk of their pups being killed by close-relatives. Voles are thought to be unable to recognize their relative's offspring and it is possible that, like female wild mice, female Townsend's voles are infanticidal during pregnancy and non-infanticidal during lactation. The degree of synchrony of the spring onset of reproduction changed between years and was not higher among females of high average relatedness. Thus the synchrony of the onset of reproduction in spring is more a consequence of differences in the condition of individual females than determined by the extent of female territoriality...|$|R
40|$|Polystictus superciliaris (Wied, 1831) {{is a small}} tyrant-flycatcher {{endemic to}} mountaintops in the {{highlands}} of eastern Brazil. In this paper we present the first description of the breeding biology of P. superciliaris and estimate its reproductive success from a population inhabiting rocky outcrops. This study was conducted during 2005 in the Parque Estadual da Serra do Rola Moça, municipality of Nova Lima (20 ° 03 'S, 44 ° 00 'W), state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Fourteen pairs of P. superciliaris were banded and monitored. The onset of the breeding season in 2005 was assumed to have been sometime before the 26 th of July, while it was assumed to have ended on the 23 rd of November based on the last observation of a successful brood. Clutch size was invariably two eggs (N = 21), the incubation period averaged 17. 7 ± 1. 3 days (N = 9), and the nestling period averaged 16. 4 ± 1. 3 days (N = 8). We estimated the probability of reproductive success for P. superciliaris to be 41. 3 %, during this particular breeding season. Of the 12 (57. 1 %) unsuccessful nests, eight (66. 7 %) had eggs and four (33. 3 %) had nestlings when they failed. In nine (42. 8 %) of these cases, the nests were lost to predation, two to parasitism by <b>botflies,</b> and one due to abandonment. This study suggests that the reproductive success of P. superciliaris is intermediate {{compared to the other}} species of Tyrannidae that have been studied and closer to the lower limit of the 40 %- 80 % range which is characteristic of tyrant _ flycatcher species that breed in temperate regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStudies {{investigating}} host-parasite systems rarely {{deal with}} multispecies interactions, and mostly explore impacts on hosts as individuals. Much less {{is known about}} the effects at colony level, when parasitism involves host organisms that form societies. We surveyed the effect of an ectoparasitic fungus, Rickia wasmannii, on kin-discrimination abilities of its host ant, Myrmica scabrinodis, identifying potential consequences at social level and subsequent changes in colony infiltration success of other organisms. Analyses of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), known to be involved in insects' discrimination processes, revealed variations in chemical profiles correlated with the infection status of the ants, that could not be explained by genetic variation tested by microsatellites. In behavioural assays, fungus-infected workers were less aggressive towards both non-nestmates and unrelated queens, enhancing the probability of polygyny. Likewise, parasitic larvae of Maculinea butterflies had a higher chance of adoption by infected colonies. Our study indicates that pathogens can modify host recognition abilities, making the society more prone to accept both conspecific and allospecific organisms. In natural ecosystems, relations among different organisms are characterized by a high degree of complexity which makes studies on multispecies systems difficult. For this reason, many investigations focus exclusively on pairwise relationships 1, 2, although the outcomes of these interactions vary and depend on the context 3. For instance, in the classical case of the brood parasitic giant cowbirds (Scaphidura oryzivora), where the presence of other parasites, as <b>botflies,</b> may change the cowbird's effect on the host from damaging to beneficial 4. In the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis the parasite manipulation is less efficient when the host is infested with both nematodes and trematodes, compared to being exclusively parasitized by trematodes 5. Increase in immune function caused by the presence of the mildly antagonistic ectosymbiont Laboulbenia formicarum might boost the survival chances of the host ant Lasius neglectus exposed to the lethal entomopathogen fungus Metarhizium brunneum 6. Interaction between different organisms could have more complex consequences when social animals, as e. g. ants, are targeted. Changes induced by parasites at the individual level may also be reflected in the social system through the interaction of host individuals. Generally, the structure of social insect colonies, in which many similar individuals live together, makes them attractive for social parasites and various pathogens 7, 8. This is especially true in the case of ants due to the stability of their colonies and their mostly ground-based nesting habits, which make their colonies accessible to a plethora of organisms. Among these, fungi are the most important antagonists ants must constantly deal with, and they can occur inside the colony either as ectoparasites on the host cuticle, endoparasites, or endosymbionts 8, 9. Some fungi are even able to manipulate host ant behaviour to increase their own fitness 10. The relationships between the hosts and these fungi often have spectacular outcomes, but as these parasitic species have quite a low prevalence 11, their interference with other parasites is hard to study. Certain fungi, like Rickia wasmannii 9 an ectoparasitic fungus of Myrmica ants, however, are common in some population...|$|R
