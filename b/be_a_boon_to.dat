5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} {{made its}} way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said {{tax credits}} and BNDES {{resources}} are public money and that the concession of those resources to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying that tax credits are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said tax credits are not subsidies and the stadium will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of tax credits issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit and dismissed it.|$|E

25|$|According to the U.S., Iran {{could reduce}} the world price of crude {{petroleum}} by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl).

25|$|The {{battle for}} the Tidewater Railway's {{rights-of-way}} displayed Rogers at his most crafty and ingenious. He was able to persuade the leading citizens of Roanoke and Norfolk, both strongholds of the rival Norfolk and Western, that his new railroad would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> both communities, secretly securing crucial rights-of-way in the process. In 1907, {{the name of the}} Tidewater Railway was changed to The Virginian Railway Company, and it acquired the Deepwater Railway to form the needed West Virginia-Virginia link.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} post-detection {{courses of}} action, {{it is also}} useful to consider the relative technological capabilities both in relation to signal relay time and in relation {{to whether or not}} the ETI is thought to pose a militaristic threat. If the ETI in question is transmitting from outside the Solar System, there will be a significant lag in time between transmission and receipt by either party. The relative sophistication of the communication technology available to each party would play heavily into the feasibility of certain types and content of messaging. In a similar vein, the potential disparities in sophistication of weapons technology hold grave implications for how humankind should react to ETI. Due to the perceived risk of revealing the precise location of the Earth to alien civilizations, METI has been heavily criticized as irresponsible considering the lack of information available about any real or potential ETI threat. Even in the likely scenario that accurate locational coordinates of Earth were available, there is question as to whether humankind should reveal anything more about itself that could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> hostile ETI. Notable among the critics of METI are British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and science fiction author David Brin.|$|E

30|$|Inherent in {{the work}} {{produced}} by radiologists (and histopathologists) {{is the fact that}} virtually every clinical act we perform is available for re-interpretation or review at a later date. Digital archival systems have virtually eliminated the loss of radiological material, even after many years. This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> patient care, and underpins much multidisciplinary team activity. It has also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> those interested in researching radiological error and those interested in using archival data for other purposes, including litigation.|$|R
50|$|Docile {{immigrant}} workers may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> industry, but invariably, such workers were ruthlessly exploited. In the mines, yesterday's perplexed new arrival often became today's militant unionist.|$|R
25|$|The {{use of the}} x86 {{architecture}} allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, {{and opens}} {{the possibility of using}} the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a dual-boot setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> switchers, since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{also learned}} much about Massachusetts' mercantile elite; while he {{initially}} considered this knowledge a curse, it {{would prove to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> his later activities in Kansas and at Harper's Ferry. The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool en masse at low prices. Initially, Brown naively trusted them, but soon {{realized that they were}} determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the Ohio Cultivator, Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools en masse at the cheap prices they had been getting from them. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, LaMarche {{points to}} two {{other types of}} movies {{difficult}} to market to large audiences. [...] "Winter can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> little movies with niche audiences," [...] she writes, pointing to Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, Quartet, which received a limited U.S. release in January 2013, and Struck by Lightning, released at the same time. Movies that also blend genres or defy such categorization, such as the zombie–human Romeo and Juliet retelling, Warm Bodies, or the limited-release Charlie Sheen comedy A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, are also ideal for their dump-months release time frame.|$|E

2500|$|During the war, Northwestern trained 49,725 {{military}} personnel through eleven training programs. The existing NROTC program proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the university as the War Department and Navy used Northwestern facilities to train 36,124 sailors {{over the course}} of the war, leading Northwestern to be called the [...] "Annapolis of the Midwest." [...] The programs included the Navy V-7 Naval Reserve Midshipman's School, V-5 Naval Aviation Preparatory Program, V-1 Accredited College Program, H-V(P) Medical and Dental Program, the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and training schools for cooks, bakers, and radio operators. The scale and importance of these programs led the Navy to cordon off the Lunt Building, Swift Hall, and Shanley Pavilion as well as taking over the dormitories and fraternities on the north campus. The Technological Institute housed training programs for the Radio School and V-12 Unit. The Army also established a signal corps training school on the Evanston campus and a civil affairs training school on the Chicago campus.|$|E

6000|$|A bonâ fide emigration, a free engagé system, would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> Western and Inner Africa, {{where the}} tribes {{live in an}} almost continual state of petty warfare.

And there is a large class of men captured in battle, and a host of those condemned to death by savage superstition, whose lives can be saved only by their exportation, which, indeed, is the African form of transportation. [...] "We believe," [...] says the Abbé Proyart (1776), [...] "that the father sells his son and the prince his subjects; he only who has lived among them can know that it is not even lawful for a man to sell his slave, if he be born in the country, unless he have incurred that penalty by certain crimes specified by law." ...|$|E
60|$|Helen settled {{herself back}} upon the stone, leaned a very little against his shoulder, {{and tried to}} think over her adventure. But her mind refused to {{entertain}} any ideas, except those of the present. Mingled with the dreamy lassitude that grew stronger every moment, was a sense of delight in her situation. She was alone on a wild mountain, in the night, with this borderman, the one she loved. By chance and her own foolhardiness this had come about, yet she was fortunate to have it tend to some good beyond her own happiness. All she would suffer from her perilous climb would be aching bones, and, perhaps, a scolding from her father. What she might gain was more than she had dared hope. The breaking up of the horse-thief gang would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boon</b> <b>to</b> the harassed settlement. How proudly Colonel Zane would smile! Her name would go on that long roll of border honor and heroism. That was not, however, one thousandth part so pleasing, as to be alone with her borderman.|$|E
