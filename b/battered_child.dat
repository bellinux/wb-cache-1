2500|$|Historically, {{children}} had few protections from violence by their parents, {{and in many}} parts of the world, this is still the case. For example, in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children. Many cultures have allowed fathers to sell their children into slavery. Child sacrifice was also a common practice. Child maltreatment began to garner mainstream attention with the publication of [...] "The <b>Battered</b> <b>Child</b> Syndrome" [...] by pediatric psychiatrist C. Henry Kempe. Prior to this, injuries to children—even repeated bone fractures—were not commonly recognized as the results of intentional trauma. Instead, physicians often looked for undiagnosed bone diseases or accepted parents' accounts of accidental mishaps such as falls or assaults by neighborhood bullies.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{landmark}} 1976 California case of Landeros v. Flood, the California Supreme Court remanded {{a case to}} the trial court for action in tort against a treating physician for failure to report suspected child abuse. [...] The theory at trial was that the plaintiff, a child of about 12 months of age, had been returned to a home where further physical abuse occurred, causing more damages. [...] This was because the physician had failed to report the abuse in violation of California law. [...] After this case, all states instituted mandatory reporting by physicians and other medical personnel of any suspected child abuse or neglect cases. In general, reporting in good faith shields the physician or health care worker from tort liability. Reporting to police or social services necessitates obtaining medical records by subpoena duces tecum. This case, and legislation that followed it were in response to several articles {{that appeared in the}} medical literature that defined <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> syndrome and child abuse syndrome.|$|E

5000|$|It {{appears from}} the {{literature}} that the <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> syndrome was first tentatively identified and reported to the medical profession in the early 1950s.

[...] Since that date numerous additional studies of the condition have been undertaken, and their results and recommendations publicized in the medical journals. A typical article in the field recites case histories of child abuse, points out the distinguishing {{signs and symptoms of}} the <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> syndrome, and advises the practicing physician how to detect and treat the condition.

50|$|While helpful, the {{foregoing}} general {{history of the}} <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> syndrome is not conclusive on the precise question in the case at bar. The question is whether a reasonably prudent physician examining this plaintiff in 1971 would have been led to suspect she {{was a victim of}} the <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> syndrome from the particular injuries and circumstances presented to him, would have confirmed that diagnosis by ordering X-rays of her entire skeleton, and would have promptly reported his findings to appropriate authorities to prevent a recurrence of the injuries.

40|$|A {{random sample}} of the {{literature}} on <b>child</b> <b>battering</b> and interviews with parents who had <b>battered</b> their <b>child</b> was content analyzed. From paragraph themes which indicated causality for <b>child</b> <b>battering,</b> the presence of seven causal dynamics in <b>child</b> <b>battering</b> was noted. The causal dynamics included three factors (parent, child and context) and the interactions between and among the factors. All of the causal dynamics were found to exist in the interviews, literature and separately identified segments of the literature which delineated events immediately preceding an incident of battering. It was concluded that a strong possibility existed that all of the factors and interactions existed in reality. The parent-child and parent-context interactions were shown to be important causal dynamics in <b>child</b> <b>battering.</b> The possibility of the parent-child-context interaction being an important causal dynamic was suggested. A dichotomy between personal troubles of milieu and public issues of social structure for causal dynamics involving the context factor was found to be useful in conducting the content analysis. The dichotomy also yielded interesting results regarding the two aspects of the context factor. Based on all of the results, two theoretical models of <b>child</b> <b>battering</b> were presented. The ‘chain’ model viewed the child and/or the context interacting only with the parent to cause battering. The ‘triangular’ model viewed all of the factors interacting with each other to cause battering. Both models represented an open system rather than a closed system. The need for addressing preventative assistance to all of the causal dynamics at the same time, rather than focusing on an individual factor or interaction, was advanced. Characteristics of the individual factors and interactions contained in the models were speculatively suggested...|$|R

5000|$|Child abuse, or <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> {{syndrome}} {{was first}} {{reported in the}} medical literature in 1946 by Caffey.

50|$|Second, {{assess the}} extent of the problem.Having clearly {{identified}} what the problem is, evaluators need to then assess {{the extent of}} the problem. They need to answer the ‘where’ and ‘how big’ questions. Evaluators need to work out where the problem is located and how big it is. Pointing out that a problem exists is much easier than having to specify where it is located and how rife it is. Rossi, Lipsey & Freeman (2004) gave an example that: a person identifying some <b>battered</b> <b>children</b> may be enough evidence to persuade one that child abuse exists. But indicating how many children it affects and where it is located geographically and socially would require knowledge about abused children, the characteristics of perpetrators and the impact of the problem throughout the political authority in question.|$|R

By means of a word and concept analysis as well as a literary study, the two concepts, namely trust and trustworthiness were explored.

5000|$|A {{diagnosis}} of <b>battered</b> <b>child</b> syndrome essentially means that serious injuries inflicted {{on a child}} were done by another person, by other than accidental means, and it had become an accepted medical diagnosis by the early 1970s.
