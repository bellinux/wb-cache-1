5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that taking life interferes {{with the ability to}} preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|Lauren is interrogated by Mulder and Scully, {{and the two}} unknown {{agents that}} called them in, {{who say they are}} {{involved}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> Graves and Dorlund's company sold technology to the Isfahan. Lauren admits to Mulder and Scully that the sales did indeed take place and that she believes Dorlund had Graves killed. After hearing Lauren recount the eerie circumstances that she believes are being caused by Graves' spirit, Scully - the usually reserved skeptic - readily accepts her story. Mulder is confused but, after Lauren leaves, Scully admits she was just humoring her. The agents search the company's premises, but are unable to find any evidence. When Dorlund attacks Lauren with a letter opener Graves' spirit takes it and cuts open the wallpaper, revealing a disc with evidence. Weeks later, Lauren starts her new job, but it appears that Graves' spirit may have followed her there.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm {{the course of the}} world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E

25|$|The team's captain {{declares}} the innings closed, usually <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> {{they have}} enough runs. A declaration before the innings starts is called an innings forfeiture.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} reasons as well. Some professors are {{reluctant}} to report violations to the appropriate authorities <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> the punishment to be too harsh.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrists may favour {{biomedical}} models <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> such models {{make their}} discipline seem more esteemed. Similarly, families of mentally ill {{people tend to}} favour biomedical models because to do so gives less self-blame.|$|E
50|$|During the Rwandan genocide, both Hutus and Tutsis avoided searching local Rwandan Muslim neighborhoods <b>because</b> <b>they</b> widely <b>believed</b> {{the myth}} that local Muslims and mosques were {{protected}} {{by the power of}} Islamic magic and the efficacious jinn. In Cyangugu, arsonists ran away instead of destroying the mosque <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that jinn were guarding the mosque and they feared their wrath.|$|R
50|$|Native Americans {{always used}} these natural shrines. If {{opposing}} tribes, even those at war, {{arrived at the}} same spring, all conflict ceased <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were walking on sacred ground.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> their production causes animal suffering or premature death.|$|E
25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People tend to view their risks as less than others <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> {{that this is what}} other people want to see. These explanations include self-enhancement, self-presentation, and perceived control.|$|E
25|$|Some analysts {{view this}} measure with caution <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> {{that it has}} a {{tendency}} to take one part of the footprint analysis and I=PAT equation (productivity) and to focus on the sustainability of economic returns to an economic sector rather than on the sustainability of the entire population or culture.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Christ" [...] {{says these}} {{prominent}} figures were [...] "laughingstocks" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the Demiurge was the One True God, {{and did not}} know the [...] "Truth".|$|R

25|$|The most {{well-known}} {{sight of the}} city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People {{from all over the country}} visit the place, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.|$|E
25|$|Fields such {{as social}} psychiatry, {{clinical}} psychology, and sociology may offer non-biomedical accounts of mental distress and disorder for certain ailments and are sometimes critical of biopsychiatry. Social critics believe biopsychiatry fails to satisfy the scientific method <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> there is no testable biological evidence of mental disorders. Thus, these critics view biological psychiatry as a pseudoscience attempting to portray psychiatry as a biological science.|$|E
25|$|Cosmetic {{reasons for}} {{modification}} of the female genitalia {{may be due to}} FGM, voluntary cosmetic operations, or surgery for intersex conditions. There are two main categories of women seeking cosmetic genital surgery: those with congenital conditions (such as an intersex condition), and those with no underlying condition who experience physical discomfort or wish to alter the appearance of their genitals <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> they do not fall within a normal range.|$|E
50|$|While the {{two schools}} agree that North Carolina leads the series, {{they do not}} agree on the overall record. This is due to an 1889 game where both teams stayed home <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were the home team. As a result, both schools claim the game as a win by forfeit.|$|R
50|$|In December, the Lawn Tennis Association {{decided to}} cut his annual {{financial}} support from Â£15,000 to the stipulated minimum of Â£4,000, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> he wasn't working hard enough, though Bogdanovic disagreed.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Egyptians {{manufactured}} amulets in {{the shape}} of a plumb bob or plummet. They included these plummet amulet in the mummification process <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> it would bring balance to their next life.|$|R
25|$|Voluntary liquidations {{occur when}} the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up {{the affairs of the}} company. This may be <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that the company will soon become insolvent, or it may be on {{economic}} grounds if they believe that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.|$|E
25|$|The {{spirit of}} Tigerstar tells Ivypaw that giving {{a strip of}} {{territory}} to ShadowClan to avoid future conflicts has endangered ThunderClan. Ivypaw believes Tigerstar and tells Firestar {{that she had a}} dream from StarClan of ShadowClan invading <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that Firestar is too weak to keep his own territory. Firestar and the senior warriors decide to attack ShadowClan preemptively. During the battle, Lionblaze accidentally kills ShadowClan deputy Russetfur after she takes Firestar's seventh life.|$|E
25|$|Some cranks lack {{academic}} achievement, {{in which}} case they typically assert that academic training in the subject of their crank belief is not only unnecessary for discovering the truth, but actively harmful <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> it poisons the minds by teaching falsehoods. Others greatly exaggerate their personal achievements, and may insist that some achievement (real or alleged) in some entirely unrelated area of human endeavor implies that their cranky opinion should be taken seriously.|$|E
50|$|In {{using this}} defense, the {{defendant}} claims that they {{committed a crime}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>they</b> were in the Matrix, {{and not in the}} real world.

50|$|The Cowboys {{were very}} patient with Johnson <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> in his talent, but he couldn't stay healthy, playing {{in only two}} preseason games in two seasons. He {{announced}} his retirement on February 27, 2015.|$|R
