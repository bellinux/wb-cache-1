5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{result in a}} denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E

And that is <b>because,</b> notionally, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{have been said}} to have been in the gift of Duchess Anne de Bretagne as Queen of France Charles VIII from 1492-98, while Brittany had been annexed to allegiance to the Valois Monarchy.|$|R
5|$|Diffused {{lighting}} camouflage {{was a form}} {{of active}} camouflage using counter-illumination to enable a ship to match its background, the night sky, prototyped by the Royal Canadian Navy on corvettes during World War II. The principle was discovered by a Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, in 1940. It attracted interest <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> help to hide ships from submarines in the ongoing Battle of the Atlantic, and the research project began early in 1941. The Royal Navy and the US Navy carried out further equipment development and trials between 1941 and 1943.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{plays an}} iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely {{considered}} to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be eaten with meat or dairy meals. According to Jonathan Kis-Lev, falafel and hummus are often used as symbols for peace, as well as tools for bridging Israelis and Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Strategic Hamlet Program and the {{intensified}} military operations of 1962, the events at Ap Bac placed additional pressure on Diem's government <b>because</b> <b>it</b> showed <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not cope with the resurgence of the Viet Cong, particularly in the regions surrounding the Mekong River.|$|R

50|$|However, {{one problem}} {{that could not}} be blamed on outside factors was Triangle Telecasters' {{frequent}} preemption of network shows for syndicated programs, presumably <b>because</b> <b>it</b> believed <b>it</b> <b>could</b> get more revenue from local advertising than from network airtime payments. As NBC's popularity declined precipitously through the 1970s, WRDU only increased the number of preemptions.|$|R
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{fin whale}} was {{occasionally}} hunted by open-boat whalers, {{but it was}} relatively safe, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> easily outrun ships {{of the time and}} often sank when killed, making the pursuit a waste of time for whalers. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{be both a}} coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, {{that was the way}} in which it would be filmed. Noé had been working on different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern {{platforms}} for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake {{should be done in}} 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be used as a base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some calling it a better Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.|$|E
5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
5000|$|Filming {{began in}} April 1991. The role of Kathy was offered to Gwyneth Paltrow. Her father Bruce Paltrow forbade her from {{accepting}} <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> he thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> hurt her career.

The Tribunal erred, <b>because</b> (1) <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not be discrimination to treat all employees in the same way (2) the appropriate comparator was a hypothetical someone who disliked gay people without it being due to a religious belief (3) looking at the plain words of regulation 5 it was clear that Ladele had not been harassed.|$|R

5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} this {{migration}} have been observed {{in the ruins of}} burial sites left behind by the Iazyges, in that they lacked the standard items of gold being buried alongside a person, and even lacked the gear of a warrior. One explanation for this was that the Iazyges were no longer in contact with the Pontic Steppe, and thus cut off from all trade with them, which had previously been a vital part of their economy. Another problem the Iazyges had with their new location was that it lacked both precious minerals and metals, such as iron, that could be turned into weapons. The Iazyges found that it was much harder to raid the Romans, due to them having organized armies around the area, as opposed to the disorganization of the armies of their previous neighbors. Due to their trade with the Pontic Steppe being cut off, they could no longer trade for gold for burial sites, assuming any of them could afford it. The only such goods they could find were the pottery and metals of the Dacian and Celtic peoples near them. Iron weapons would have been exceedingly rare, if the Iazyges even had them, and would likely have been passed down from father to son, rather than buried, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not have been replaced.|$|E
50|$|The opening {{voice-over}} by Connery has an echo effect <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was recorded in}} the bathroom of his Spanish villa, {{where he had been}} working on his Spanish accent for the film with a voice coach. It was played for the producers over the phone, and they approved of <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they <b>could</b> not discern the quality of the recording.|$|R
