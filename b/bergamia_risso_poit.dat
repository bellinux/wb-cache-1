40|$|The {{presence}} of pipecolic acid and pipecolic acid betaine, {{also known as}} homostachydrine, is herein reported {{for the first time}} in Citrus genus plants. Homostachydrine was found in fruits, seeds, and leaves of orange, lemon, and bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso</b> et <b>Poit).</b> As homostachydrine was not commercially available, as a comparative source, extracts of alfalfa leaves (Medicago sativa L.) were used, in which homostachydrine is present at high concentration. Then, the results where confirmed by comparison with an authentic standard synthesized and purified starting from pipecolic acid. The synthesized standard was characterized by a ESI-MS/MS study using a 3 D ion-trap mass spectrometer. When subjected to MS/MS fragmentation in positive ion mode, homostachydrine, unlike its lower homologue proline betaine (also known as stachydrine), showed a pattern of numerous ionic fragments that allowed unambiguous identification of the compound. For the quantitation in the plant sources, high sensitivity and specificity were achieved by monitoring the transition (158 → 72), which is absent in the fragmentation patterns of other major osmolytes commonly used as markers for studies of abiotic stress. As for the metabolic origin of homostachydrine, the occurrence in citrus plants of pipecolic acid leads to the hypothesis that it could act as a homostachydrine precursor through direct methylation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) airway pathology is a fatal, autosomal, recessive {{genetic disease}} characterized by extensive lung inflammation. After induction by TNF-α, elevated concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (i. e. IL- 6, IL- 1 β) and chemokines (i. e. IL- 8) are released from airway epithelial cells. In {{order to reduce the}} excessive inflammatory response in the airways of CF patients, new therapies have been developed and in this respect, medicinal plant extracts have been studied. In this article we have investigated the possible use of bergamot extracts (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso)</b> and their identified components to alter the expression of IL- 8 associated with the cystic fibrosis airway pathology. Methods The extracts were chemically characterized by 1 H-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), GC-FID (gas chromatography-flame ionization detector), GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography). Both bergamot extracts and main detected chemical constituents were assayed for their biological activity measuring (a) cytokines and chemokines in culture supernatants released from cystic fibrosis IB 3 - 1 cells treated with TNF-α by Bio-Plex cytokine assay; (b) accumulation of IL- 8 mRNA by real-time PCR. Results The extracts obtained from bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso)</b> epicarps contain components displaying an inhibitory activity on IL- 8. Particularly, the most active molecules were bergapten and citropten. These effects have been confirmed by analyzing mRNA levels and protein release in the CF cellular models IB 3 - 1 and CuFi- 1 induced with TNF-α or exposed to heat-inactivated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusions These obtained results clearly indicate that bergapten and citropten are strong inhibitors of IL- 8 expression and could be proposed for further studies to verify possible anti-inflammatory properties to reduce lung inflammation in CF patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso</b> et Poiteau) is a {{citrus fruit}} growing almost {{exclusively}} in the South of Italy. Its essential oil is obtained by cold pressing of the epicarp and, partly, of the mesocarp of the fresh fruit. Although this phytocomplex {{has been used for}} centuries, reputedly effectively, as a traditional medicine, there is very little verified scientific evidence to support this use. This paper reports original data on the systemic effects of the essential oil of bergamot (BEO) on gross behaviour and EEG activity recorded from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the rat. The Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was used to analyse and quantify the energy in single frequency bands of the EEG spectrum. The results obtained indicate that systemic administration of increasing volumes of BEO produces dose-dependent increases in locomotor and exploratory activity that correlate with a predominant increase in the energy in the faster frequency bands of the EEG spectrum. These data contribute {{to our understanding of the}} neurobiological profile of BE...|$|R
40|$|Background Statins are {{the most}} common used lipid {{lowering}} drugs but they may cause adverse effects and despite their well-established therapeutic benefits residual cardiovascular (CV) risk remains. The use of other lipid lowering drugs and nutraceuticals alone or as add-on lipid-modifying therapy can be an option in such cases. Several studies have reported health-related properties of the Citrus fruits, among which bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso)</b> differs from others by particularly high content of certain compounds. Purpose This narrative review summarizes the current evidence on the effects of bergamot on lipid parameters based on studies involving animals and humans. Main evidence This natural supplement may lead to effective lipid-lowering treatment. Its lipid-lowering activity is attributed to different flavonoids. However, the exact mechanisms involved remain unclear. Conclusion It is expected that ongoing and future studies will confirm the benefit of bergamot in dyslipidemic and other cardiometabolic disorders, potentially leading to reduced overall CV risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{process of}} cystic fibrosis (CF) {{is characterized by}} production and release of cytokines and chemokines, among which interleukin 8 (IL- 8) represent {{one of the most}} important. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in developing therapies against CF {{in order to reduce the}} excessive inflammatory response in the airways of CF patients. In this respect, extracts from medicinal plants have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in several reports. In this study we report that extracts obtained from bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso)</b> epicarps contain two components (citropten and bergapten) displaying an strong inhibitory activity on IL- 8 expression. These effects have been confirmed both at the mRNA levels and the protein release in the CF cellular model IB 3 - 1 induced with TNF-alpha, using RT-PCR and Bio-plex technology respectively. These results indicate that bergapten and citropten could be proposed as potential anti-inflammatory molecules to reduce lung inflammation in CF patients...|$|R

40|$|Bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia,</b> <b>Risso</b> et Poiteau) {{cultivation}} {{started in}} Italy {{at the beginning}} of the 18 th century. Italian bergamot production is limited in a narrow strip of the Calabrian coast, along the Ionian and the Thyrrenian seas. Bergamot is cultivated for the essential oil representing an important raw material for cosmetic and food industry. Among non-volatile fraction components of the bergamot essential oil there are coumarins, whose fluorescence was widely investigated in the past. Because of their structural diversity and diverse occurrence, these oxygenated heterocyclic compounds have an important role in the identification of the quality and genuineness of the bergamot essential oil. This review reports spectrofluorometric properties of bergamot essential oil. From excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis of bergamot essential oil solutions in ethanol characteristic emissions of citropten, linalyl acetate and that of chlorophills have been detected. One citropten emission has been used in quantitative determination while none of linalyl acetate.

40|$|Bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia,</b> <b>Risso</b> et Poiteau) {{essential}} oil (BEO) {{is a well}} characterized, widely used plant extract. BEO exerts anxiolytic, analgesic and neuroprotective activities in rodents through mechanisms that are only partly known {{and need to be}} further investigated. To gain more insight into the biological effects of this {{essential oil}}, we tested the ability of BEO (0. 005 – 0. 03 %) to modulate autophagic pathways in human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells. BEO-treated cells show increased LC 3 II levels and appearance of dot-like formations of endogenous LC 3 protein that colocalize with the lysosome marker LAMP- 1. Autophagic flux assay using bafilomycin A 1 and degradation of the specific autophagy substrate p 62 confirmed that the observed increase of LC 3 II levels in BEO-exposed cells is due to autophagy induction rather than to a decreased autophagosomal turnover. Induction of autophagy is an early and not cell-line specific response to BEO. Beside basal autophagy, BEO also enhanced autophagy triggered by serum starvation and rapamycin indicating that the underlying mechanism is mTO...|$|R
40|$|Citrus <b>Bergamia</b> <b>Risso,</b> {{commonly}} known as Bergamot, is a fruit whose Essential Oil and Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction have numerous medicinal properties. It is also an excellent antioxidant and in this study, for the first time, its potential effect on morphine induced tolerance in mice has been investigated. Our studies revealed that development of antinociceptive tolerance to repeated doses of morphine in mice is consistently associated with increased formation of superoxide, malondialdehyde and tyrosine-nitrated proteins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord such as the enzyme glutamine synthase. Nitration of this protein is intimately linked to inactivation of its biological function and resulting increase of glutamate levels in the spinal cord. Administration of Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction (5 - 50 mg/kg) attenuated tolerance development. This effect was accompanied by reduction of superoxide and malondialdehyde production, prevention of GS nitration, re-establishment of its activity and of glutamate levels. Our studies confirmed the main role of free radicals during the cascade of events induced by prolonged morphine treatment and the co-administration of natural derivatives antioxidant such as Bergamot Polyphenolic Fraction {{can be an important}} therapeutic approach to restore opioids analgesic efficacy...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to examine the effects of {{essential}} oil of Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso</b> (bergamot, BEO) on intracellular Ca 2 + in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Fura- 2 fluorescence was used to examine changes in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration [Ca 2 +]i. In the presence of extracellular Ca 2 +, BEO increased [Ca 2 +]i, which was partially inhibited by a nonselective Ca 2 + channel blocker La 3 +. In Ca 2 +-free extracellular solutions, BEO increased [Ca 2 +]i in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that BEO mobilizes intracellular Ca 2 +. BEO-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase was partially inhibited by a Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release inhibitor dantrolene, a phospholipase C inhibitor U 73122, and an inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate (IP 3) -gated Ca 2 + channel blocker, 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borane (2 -APB). BEO also increased [Ca 2 +]i in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca 2 + uptake. In addition, store-operated Ca 2 + entry (SOC) was potentiated by BEO. These results suggest that BEO mobilizes Ca 2 + from primary intracellular stores via Ca 2 +-induced and IP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + release and affect promotion of Ca 2 + influx, likely via an SOC mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Food {{fortification}} {{is one of}} the cost-effective tool enabling {{people to}} increase their nutrient intake. Functional foods that contain bioactive components may provide desirable health benefits beyond basic nutrition and play important roles in the prevention of life-style related diseases. However, stable and bioactive ingredients are necessary for the food and nutraceutical industry. The particle technology applied to food derivatives and by-products involves several aspects from the stability and size reduction processes to modification of the solubility of the active ingredients producing easy handling powder forms readily soluble in water. The present work reports on the encapsulation of Bergamot (Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso)</b> and Bitter orange (Citrus aurantium L.) juices recovered as Citrus industrial by-products. Citrus juices are valuable source of antioxidant polyphenols having health beneficial properties, mainly in protecting tissues against oxygen free radicals damages, mutagenesis and lipid peroxidation. Flavonoids are suggested as dietary agents in the prevention of many degenerative diseases being attractive materials for the food and nutraceutical industry. The basic problem associated with the recycling of fresh juice is that, after the recovery and waiting for a possible re-use, juice can undergo to functional and organoleptic alterations, preventing its use. In the frame of our research on Citrus species, the spray drying technique and a polymeric carrier based on Sodium-Carboxymethylcellulose (C) and Lactose (L), food grade excipients, have been proposed as a microencapsulation system to enhance the juice (J) shelf life in order {{to use it as a}} dietary supplement or to enrich foods in flavonoids. The lactose used in the formulation has also been recovered, through the anti-solvent method, from industrial dairy wastes (fresh milk remained unsold).

40|$|The {{increase}} of free radicals {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases and in particular in cardiovascular diseases (Kovacic et al. 2011). The intake of food containing phytochemicals such as polyphenols and flavonoids reduces the risk of age-related cardiovascular diseases (Holt et al. 2012). In this contest, from Mediterranean area, Citrus <b>bergamia</b> <b>Risso</b> et Poiteau (Rutaceae), bergamot, is a natural source of flavonoids, both flavanones and flavones, which exhibited antioxidant (Ferlazzo et al., 2015) and anti-inflammatory activities (Risitano et al., 2014). So, the aim of our research was to investigate the potential anti-ageing effects of fresh bergamot juice of three different cultivars. Initially, the juices obtained from “Fantastico”, “Femminello”, and “Castagnaro” cultivars of C. bergamia fruits were investigated for antioxidant activity by four different and complementary assays (Armentano et al. 2015). Three of them (O 2 •-, •NO and FRAP) have not been previously reported for measuring the activity of tested samples. Moreover, the Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI) was calculated to compare antioxidant capacities of all samples tested by different assays. The results showed that “Fantastico” cultivar juice possesses the strongest antioxidant activity with highest RACI (0. 55), followed by “Castagnaro” cultivar (- 0. 09). Successively, myocardial H 9 c 2 cells were treated with the lyophilized bergamot juice of “Fantastico” cultivar (Dong et al. 2013), which showed the highest antioxidant potential. The results demonstrated that bergamot juice from “Fantastico” cultivar did not exert any cytotoxic effect on H 9 c 2 cells and counteracts chemical-induced senescence in myocardial H 9 c 2 cells. Moreover, the juice flavonoid profiles of the three cultivars were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array-electrospray-mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS). Flavonoids, both flavone, flavanone glycosides and two limonoid glycosides were detected. The overall results suggested that bergamot juice of “Fantastico” cultivar possesses beneficial health effects that make it useful as a source of health promoting constituents with antioxidant and anti-senescence properties...|$|R
