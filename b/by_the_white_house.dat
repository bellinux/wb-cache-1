5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama {{administration}} initially {{sought to}} persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform, then as government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, called {{for him to}} resign from the presidency. The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria. During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal was rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, {{public support}} {{can play a}} crucial role in the {{decisions}} to initiate and terminate military action. Some scholars argue that the public holds âprudent â opinions regarding the use of the militaryâsupporting efforts to stop aggression but not to engage in nation building. We argue that what seems like a âprudent â opinion may be driven more <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>Houseâs</b> rhetoric.
