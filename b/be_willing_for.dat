40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to examine the}} {{copyright}} and licensing knowledge gap of academic staff to identify their current understanding of, and attitudes towards, copyright, licensing and the open access movement in relation to the content they use, create, and share in their teaching and research practice. The motivation behind this study was to gather information to assist the Library in creating and providing effective information resources and training for academic staff. Methods: An anonymous online survey was distributed to Faculty of Health academic staff at Deakin University. Seventy individuals in the Faculty of Health completed the survey. Results: The results suggested that most of the academics have used content created by others in their teaching materials, but they are not confident about complying with copyright or licensing conditions whilst doing so. Most had not posted any of their own content online, but would generally <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>for</b> it to be used by others, with attribution. Around half had never posted their published articles in an institutional or discipline repository, but again, would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>for</b> them to be used for educational purposes. Most academics have never shared their research data online, and some were very unwilling to do so - despite current pushes to broaden access to research data sets. Finally, most had never applied a Creative Commons licence to a piece of work, and over half were unaware of what rights they had retained under publishing agreements for their work. It was strongly indicated that an informational website would be very helpful in providing guidance around topics of copyright, licensing and sharing. Conclusions: Results were largely consistent with other similar studies conducted around these topics. There is a clear role for librarians to continue providing such training and resources as the push for Open Access resources, publishing, and data only gains momentum...|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} {{of social interaction}} possibilities for distance learning will help decrease the isolation of those learners.

This study analyses the Course-Break site which is provided to promote the social interaction of the students enrolled in Information Management Program which is a distance education program in Anadolu University. This site is delivered in an address different from the one where the course content is delivered. This site is a notice board in a way. The fact that learners learning in face-to-face classroom environments share a social environment during course breaks led us to fill this gap for distance learning learners via CMC.

40|$|Human {{resources}} for health in Tanzania {{are in short}} supply and urban-biased. Preference for urban practice prevails among newly graduating medical doctors. This study sought to determine the factors influencing willingness for rural practice among Tanzanian final year medical students. A cross sectional survey was conducted among 130 medical students at MUCHS and HKMU in Dar es Salaam and KCMC in Moshi. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on demographic characteristics, rural experience, perception of rural facilities, employment prospects, willingness to accept rural posts, and perceived advantages and disadvantages of rural career. About 35 % of students would specifically consider a rural post in their job search, while 59. 4 % would accept to be posted to rural areas by their employers although they would not initially apply for it. Students from a rural background were twice more likely to <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>for</b> rural practice compared to their urban counterparts (p= 0. 004). The influence of gender, age and source of sponsorship on willingness for rural practice was not statistically significant. Willingness for rural practice was also influenced by type of rural experience, perceived state of rural health facilities, intended fields of specialization, and perceived merits and demerits of a rural career. t Vlll The Government and other employers should recruit doctors centrally through their headquarters and deploy them equitably in the peripheral under served districts. An affirmative action is needed to increase representation of rural background students in medical schools. Medical school curricula and internship programs should incorporate Rural Medical Practice as an essential component. Remuneration and incentive packages for doctors in Tanzania need to be improved...|$|E
