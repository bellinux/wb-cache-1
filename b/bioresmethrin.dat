50|$|Elliott led {{the team}} that invented the major {{pyrethroid}} insecticides <b>bioresmethrin,</b> permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. In 2009 {{it was estimated that}} pyrethroid-treated mosquito nets significantly decreased the number of deaths due to malaria.|$|E
50|$|The first-generation pyrethroids, {{developed}} in the 1960s, include bioallethrin, tetramethrin, resmethrin and <b>bioresmethrin.</b> They are more active than the natural pyrethrum but are unstable in sunlight. Activity of pyrethrum and 1st-generation pyrethroids is often enhanced by addition of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (which itself has some insecticidal activity). With the 91/414/EEC review, many 1st-generation compounds have not been included on Annex 1, probably because the market is simply not big enough to warrant the costs of re-registration (rather than any special concerns about safety).|$|E
50|$|The {{resmethrin}} molecule {{has four}} stereoisomers determined by cis-trans orientation around a carbon triangle and chirality. Technical resmethrin {{is a mixture}} of (1R,trans)-, (1R,cis)-, (1S,trans)-, (1S,cis)- isomers, typically in a ratio of 4:1:4:1. The 1R isomers (both trans and cis) show strong insecticidal activity, while the 1S isomers do not. The (1R,trans)- isomer is also known as Bioresmethrin,(+)-trans-Resmethrin, or d-trans-Resmethrin; although <b>bioresmethrin</b> has been used alone as a pesticide active ingredient, it is not now registered as a separate Active Ingredient (AI) by the U.S. EPA. The (1R,cis)- isomer is known as Cismethrin, but this is also not registered in the U.S. for use alone as a pesticide AI.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to pyrethrin I and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, allethrin, phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and <b>bioresmethrin.</b> Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|E
40|$|Of several aerosol {{formulations}} of 3 synthetic pyrethroids, S- 2539 Forte, resmethrin, and <b>bioresmethrin,</b> the 2 % formulation was most effective for the disinsection of passenger spaces aboard jet aircraft; the 1. 2 % and 0. 3 % formulations were less effective. Break-off tip aerosol units gave good dispersal, but these limited production cans showed slight {{variability in the}} rate of release...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bioresmethrin</b> was detd. by gas chromatog. using flame {{ionization}} or electron capture detectors. The detection threshold for both detectors was 0. 1 mg. In {{the presence of}} piperonyl butoxide, it was detd. as 2 -benzyl- 4 -hydroxymethylfuran, an alk. hydrolysis product. Principal gas chromatog. parameters were: column packing (e. g. 3 % OV- 101 absorbed on 100 - 140 mesh Chromosorb G-HP); carrier gases (N 2 for {{flame ionization}} and Ar-CH 4 mixt. for electron capture); detector and injection port temps., 300...|$|E
40|$|Carbamate {{resistance}} induced {{in a field}} {{strain of}} A. albimanus from El Salvador by laboratory selection with propoxur remained fairly stable on relaxation of selection pressure for 12 generations. Studies on cross and multiple resistance showed that this strain was not resistant to the pyrethroids <b>bioresmethrin,</b> bioallethrin, and CRC 11451, although resistance to cismethrin was 2. 3 -fold. Resistance to 10 carbamates of various structural configurations covered a broad spectrum, being for example > 100 × to Bay 38799, Ciba 17474, and Ciba 18107, 74. 8 × to carbaryl, 20. 57 × to carbanolate, and 2. 27 × to Stauffer R 15396. The possible causes of {{the presence or absence}} of cross resistance and the implications of stability of resistance and cross resistance are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of bifenthrin (0. 5 mg/kg) + piperonyl butoxide (7 mg/kg) + chlorpyrifos-methyl (10 mg/kg) against beetle and psocid pests of sorghum was evaluated in silo-scale trials in southeast Queensland, Australia. The pyrethroid bifenthrin was evaluated {{as a potential}} new protectant {{in combination with the}} organophosphate chlorpyrifos-methyl, which is already registered for control of several insect pests of stored cereals. Sorghum (200 metric tons) was treated after both the 1999 and 2000 harvests and sampled at intervals to assess treatment efficacy and residue decline during up to 7 mo of storage. Generally, test strains of the beetles Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) were prevented from producing live progeny for up to 7 mo. The treatment failed against one strain of R. dominica known to be resistant to <b>bioresmethrin</b> and organophosphates. Two malathion-resistant strains of O. surinamensis were marginally controlled with 94 – 100...|$|E
30|$|Very limited {{knowledge}} exists about {{the regulation of}} carboxylesterase protein expression and activity. Interestingly, unlike the reported induction of mouse Ces 1 d mRNA expression by PPARα agonism, Ces 1 d protein abundance {{did not appear to}} be regulated by PPARα. Ces 1 d protein abundance did not increase by clofibrate administration to wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 mice and did not decrease in PPARα deficient mice (Dolinsky et al., 2003). This suggests additional regulation at the level of protein stability/turnover. While the carboxylesterase protein abundance following forced their expression in cells/mice appeared to directly correlate with their hydrolytic activities toward model substrates (Ko et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2007 a), studies in human liver samples indicated that CES 1 protein abundance did not correlate well with its ability to hydrolyze the CES 1 -specific substrate <b>bioresmethrin</b> (Ross et al., 2012). The reason for the differential CES 1 activities is not clear but it was proposed that these could be due to specific coding SNPs, alternative splice sites or differences in posttranslational modifications. Alternatively, different human samples may contain variable amounts of endogenous substrates and/or inhibitors that may compete with hydrolysis of exogenously provided substrates. No endogenous protein co-factors (activators/inhibitors) for carboxylesterases have yet been described. ApoE was found to be associated with Ces 1 d on LLDs in the ER lumen (Wang et al., 2007). However, whether apoE modulates Ces 1 d function in the ER and regulates mobilization of LLD lipids for VLDL assembly and secretion requires further investigation.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} seven {{different}} pyrethroid insecticides on the lateral-line sense organ and on peripheral nerves of the clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, were investigated {{by means of}} electrophysiological methods. The results show that two classes of pyrethroid can be clearly distinguished. (i) Pyrethroids without an α-cyano group (permethrin, cismethrin, and <b>bioresmethrin).</b> These noncyano pyrethroids induce short trains of nerve impulses in the lateral-line sense organ. In peripheral nerve branches they induce a depolarizing afterpotential and repetitive firing. These effects {{are very similar to}} those previously reported for allethrin. (ii) Pyrethroids with an α-cyano- 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol (cypermethrin, fenpropathrin, deltamethrin, and fenvalerate). In the lateral-line sense organ these α-cyano pyrethroids induce very long trains of nerve impulses which may last for seconds and may contain hundreds or even thousands of impulses. The α-cyano compounds do not cause repetitive activity in peripheral nerves. Instead they induce a quickly reversible, stimulus frequency-dependent suppression of the action potential. Since the chemical structure of cypermethrin differs from that of permethrin only in the α-cyano group and because all four α-cyano compounds act in a very similar way, it is concluded that the α-cyano substituent is responsible for the large differences in neurotoxic effects. In the lateral-line sense organ the duration of nerve impulse trains induced by the noncyano as well as the α-cyano pyrethroids increases dramatically when the temperature is lowered. Further, in sensory fibers the effects of both classes of pyrethroid on the nerve action potential are more pronounced compared to their effects on motor fibers. It is argued that the different neurotoxic effects reported here originate from a common mechanism of action of pyrethroids, which is a prolongation of the transient increase of sodium permeability of the nerve membrane associated with excitation. It is concluded that the sodium channel in the nerve membrane is the major target site of noncyano and α-cyano pyrethroids...|$|E
