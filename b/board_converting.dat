50|$|Under Walden’s leadership, UPM was {{transformed}} into a multi-business company adding a wide and diversified paper and <b>board</b> <b>converting</b> business for export to the Soviet Union. Later, engineering works and a chemical factory were added to produce equipment and materials for the paper industry. The company also acquired some small mills in other countries, especially in Italy. These acquisitions were, however, not always economically feasible.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of most methods for mechanical testing {{of paper and}} paperboard is production control, i. e. to secure that {{the performance of the}} produced material fulfils certain minimum end‐use requirements. There is in the industry an ever increasing demand for improved efficiency in paper and <b>board</b> <b>converting</b> and end‐use, and this demand paves the way for the development of new test methods that enables {{a better understanding of the}} material design. There is a need for better control of changes in the pulping and papermaking processes at different structural levels, and for efficient characterization of these changes. To achieve such control, novel test methods and computational modelling are required. The {{objective of}} this paper is to discuss some newly proposed test methods and to illustrate how these in combination with simulations are a valuable tool for efficient materials design. The mechanical properties that are covered in the paper include in‐plane residual stresses and transverse shear properties of paper and paperboard. The methods will be shortly described and some important experimental results will be presented. Finally, some examples of computation modelling related to these properties will be discussed.

30|$|The working {{principle}} is that {{power is supplied}} to the wireless receiving board and the outer magnetic ring on the cover by the cable and voltage-stabilizing circuit board. The rotating inner magnetic ring receives the voltage-stabilizing signal by wireless induction transmission, and all sensors in the detection roller and all the circuit boards on the rotating head are powered by the excitation power board. The output signals of sensor are gathered by the analog acquisition board, and the digital processing board implements analog-to-digital conversion. Digital processing and coding are performed under the conditions of magnetic coupling isolation and photoelectric isolation. The signals are then delivered to the wireless transmission board. The wireless transmission <b>board</b> <b>converts</b> the signals into high-frequency wireless signals and transmits the wireless signals to the wireless receiving board. The wireless receiving <b>board</b> <b>converts</b> the wireless signals to wired signals. Finally, the signals are transmitted to the remote signal-processing computer via the shielded cable.|$|R

50|$|During the 1920s, the city's {{population}} {{continued to}} grow, stretching {{the capacity of}} the school system. An addition to Miller, including a girl's gymnasium, was completed in 1931.

Parents of white students at nearby Eastern High School complained about the rising Black student population, and in response the Detroit School <b>Board</b> <b>converted</b> Miller to a senior high school in 1933. A liberal school transfer policy allowed white students zoned to Miller to attend Eastern, which left Miller as the de facto, if not de jure, African-American High school.|$|R
