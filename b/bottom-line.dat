The research provides a general approach to explore suitability of BEMs to include corporate sustainability and it is limited in scope as some organizations' have specific maturity levels in both: deploying BEMs and corporate sustainability.

The differential geometry permits, by the computation of a new measure of valley, to characterize locally the centerlines of vessels as the image surface <b>bottom-lines</b> of valleys. The informations given by the centerlines and the valley scale-spaces are used to obtain the two-dimensional multi-scale centerlines of the coronary arteries.

Then the obtained detection is coded as an attributed graph. So the medical practitioner can act and choose the most interesting arteries for the future three-dimensional reconstruction. Finally, we test our process on several digital coronary arteriograms, and some retinal angiograms...|$|R

Surface acting involves a [...] "faking" [...] process through which outward expressions are altered, yet internal feelings are left intact (2013). Conversely, deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays (Grandey et al., 2013) (3). Although the underlying regulatory processes involved in each approach differ, the objective of both, is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and <b>bottom-line</b> outcomes (e.g., sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business; Pugh, 2001; Tsai, 2001). However, as previously mentioned, research generally has found surface acting to be more consistently problematic for employee well-being than deep acting (Grandey, 2003; Hülsheger & Schewe, 2011).|$|E

The relationships amongst the sub-dimensions of workplace spirituality (meaningfulness of work, sense of community, alignment with organisational values) and the sub-dimensions of corporate or organisational citizenship behaviour (altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy, civic virtue) are also examined. The {{extent to which the}} sub-dimensions of organisational citizenship behaviour predict workplace spirituality are analysed. The study was undertaken in a retail products outlet that focuses on quality and professionalism. The sample was drawn using cluster sampling and the adequacy of the sample was assessed using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity. Data was collected using a closed-ended, established questionnaire and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results reflect that the organisation is fairly high on workplace spirituality with the focus being on meaningfulness of work and, on corporate or organisational citizenship behaviour with altruism and civic virtue being its greatest strength. There is a significant relationship between spirituality in the corporate environment and corporate or organisational citizenship behaviour, with sportsmanship and civic virtue being strong predictors of workplace spirituality. The results therefore, display the dynamic relationship between spirituality in the corporate environment and corporate or organisational citizenship behaviour, which when nurtured has the potential to enhance both <b>bottom-lines</b> of profits and people as well as society as a whol...|$|R

(Engineering Management) Abstract: Today’s {{competitive}} market climate call for organisations effectiveness in applying extra precautions on sourcing processes and decisions leading to assets acquisitions. Often than not, during sourcing activities, {{one of the}} key objectives is to find out all there is to know as far as the potential costs pertaining the acquisition in prospect is concerned. Beyond reengineering and enabling continuous improvement on supply chain processes to gain market competitiveness, organisations adopts the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) philosophy designed to deliver a beyond price-based outlook upon sourcing decisions to ensure that all possible costs elements incurable is fully accounted and outlined accordingly. This study intends to evaluate and analyse the typical perceptions surrounding the widespread adoption of the TCO philosophy by organisations’ acquisitions key decision-makers. Further evaluating the overall implications of adopting the concept of TCO upon strategic sourcing objectives towards fulfilling the organisations key <b>bottom-lines</b> in a cost effective manner. It is often common practice for purchasing organisations to base their performance measures on savings achieved. Thus making saving the key performance indicator (KPI) of the strategic sourcing function without enabling possibilities to consider a price-based approach as an enabler of savings. Savings breeding from reduced face value or purchase price with little insight of the total value cost of the offering and without considering the Life Cycle Cost (LLC) inherent some limitations as far as the consideration of all the cost effects is concerned. In order to enhance the understanding of the TCO concept to its widest sense and its applicability within the strategic sourcing function. Major value drivers within the strategic sourcing space are critically analysed to depict their major influences to the value chain and to the widespread adoption of the TCO concept. The empirical findings points out the prevalence of quality and reliability of the suppliers’ offering and the capability to adequately meet the purchaser’s stipulated requirements. High dependency of the quality and reliability levels of the offered suppliers’ expertise, the overall costs of such relationships is sought to carry ripple effects to the value chain. As a result, in pursuit of understanding all possible cost impacts breeding from supplier selection, TCO enables quantification of major cost drivers and channels continuous improvement initiatives for effective strategic sourcing intent’s fulfilment. There also exists an outlying dominance of lower price preferences as a major contributor to the reduction of TCO of the purchasing function leaving a loophole for non-quantified cost impacts, which is detrimental to organisational effectiveness. Moreover, the reduction of the purchasing function TCO directly prevails from the adoption of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) as it enables quantification of all costs associated with the acquisitions during its validity or existence. Co-value creation between suppliers and buyers displayed a resounding significance towards [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{constraints}} and {{limited access to}} markets {{are the most important}} obstacles for economic development in developing economies that are largely dependent on agriculture. Lack of access to credit and output markets, in particular, is frequently identified as a key barrier to transformation of subsistence agriculture. The fundamental problems are related to information asymmetry, lack of collateral and limited economies of scale. Innovative institutional mechanisms, in the form of microfinance and producer organizations, offer ways to address information asymmetry and increase scale economies. This dissertation examines the outreach, financial performance and impact of microfinance institutions as well as the key drivers of agricultural cooperatives and its impact on smallholder farmers efficiency in Ethiopia. To meet these objectives four data sets from Ethiopia, one institutional and three household survey data, are used. The analysis of microfinance generally focuses on examining the trade-offs between outreach to the poor and financial sustainability by ownership forms (shareholder owned vs. memberowned). The outreach-financial sustainability trade-offs analyzed first using the institutional survey data. The empirical results show that serving the poor and financial sustainability are challenging objectives to achieve together. There is also evidence that suggests the presence of mission drift. Second, the role of ownership form on outreach, financial performance and cost-efficiency is analyzed within the framework of efficient ownership assignment theories using regression and stochastic cost frontier approaches. This analysis aims at testing whether the commonly held proposition of greater efficiency of shareholder firms in microfinance by policy advocates is empirically supported. The results reject the superiority of shareholder-owned microfinance over financial cooperatives. In fact, the evidence here supports the advantages of member-owned microfinance on cost efficiency and balancing the double <b>bottom-lines</b> of microfinance. Third, the impact of access to microfinance credit on farmers investment on agricultural inputs is assessed using propensity score matching (PSM) and control-function-regression methods that address potential participation selection biases. Results from both approaches show that access to credit increased the use of productivity enhancing inputs among borrower farmers. Indeed, farmers that borrow from financial cooperatives tend to invest more on modern inputs. The analysis of agricultural cooperatives tested theoretical propositions from organizational and the new institutional economics theories on the drivers of agricultural cooperatives incidence and farmers membership and patronage decisions. Discrete choice models are employed for the empirical analysis. The results indicate that the incidence of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia is more related to the countervailing market power argument than to the transaction cost reduction hypothesis. Despite open membership polices, the analysis on farmers participation indicates that membership and patronage decisions are related and significantly influenced by location, asset and relational specificities. Finally, the impact analysis estimated technical efficiency gains of membership in agricultural cooperatives and employed matching and stochastic production frontier techniques. The evidence suggests that membership in agricultural cooperatives significantly enhances efficiency gains among smallholder farmers...|$|R
