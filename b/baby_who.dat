5|$|Blair is {{pregnant}} with Patrick's <b>baby,</b> <b>who</b> {{has been identified}} as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd's request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd's affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr's request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Riley's father, Carl (Paul Opacic), takes an instant disliking to Mercedes. This causes tension between Mercedes and Carl and they have sex. Carl and Mercedes begin an affair and Riley later proposes to Mercedes, which she accepts. Carl's son and Riley's brother, Seth (Miles Higson), discovers the affair and threatens to tell Riley. Mercedes tells Seth that he cannot reveal the affair because she is pregnant with Riley's child. She later tells Myra that she lied and is not pregnant. Myra tells Mercedes to fake a miscarriage, which she refuses to do. Mercedes attends an awards ceremony with Riley, where he becomes intoxicated. He accepts an award and attempts to get Mercedes onto the podium, but her high heel becomes trapped in the step. As Riley pulls her, she loses her balance and falls to the ground. Myra then declares that Mercedes is having a miscarriage. Mercedes is taken to hospital, where she is told that she is in fact twelve weeks pregnant. She explains to Myra that she is unsure of the child's paternity. On her wedding day to Riley, she reveals her affair with Carl. Riley's grandfather, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who is a serial killer, kidnaps Mercedes {{as a result of}} her behaviour and holds her captive in a basement, planning to kill her when the baby is born. While Mercedes is in the basement, Silas is arrested for four murders, leaving Mercedes trapped while she goes into labour. Lynsey asks Silas to tell them where Mercedes is, but he refuses. She taunts him until eventually he reveals her whereabouts. Riley finds Mercedes, who is about to give birth. Mercedes gives birth to a baby boy, who is put in an incubator because of breathing difficulties. Mercedes is hurt when, after the birth, Riley declares he wants nothing more to do with Mercedes or the baby. However, he later continues to visit Mercedes and the <b>baby</b> <b>who</b> Mercedes names Bobby. Mercedes returns to live with the McQueens and after Riley refuses to see Bobby, Mercedes agrees to do a paternity test. The results confirm that Riley is Bobby's biological father. Mercedes and Riley argue over Bobby until Riley is transferred to a football club in Leeds and Mercedes asks him to take Bobby with him.|$|E

40|$|Background: Placental growth {{responds}} to maternal influences including diet. We have examined placental size, shape and efficiency among babies born {{around the time}} of the 5 -month wartime famine in Holland 1944 - 1945. Methods: We examined the birth records of 2414 term singleton babies born in Amsterdam during 1943 – 1947. The records included the size of the baby and the thickness of the placental surface, together with its length and breadth which we used to calculate its area and volume. Results: Compared to babies born before the famine <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were in utero during the famine had smaller placental areas. Babies whose mothers conceived after the famine ended also had smaller placental areas. Famine was associated with a 19 cm 2 decrease in area. <b>Babies</b> <b>who</b> were in mid-late gestation during the famine were 160 g lighter than would have been predicted from their placental area (p < 0. 001). <b>Babies</b> <b>who</b> were in early gestation during the famine, or who were conceived after it had ended were 102 g heavier than would have been predicted from their placental area (p < 0. 001). These latter babies were either longer or had larger head circumferences depending on when the mother experienced the famine. Among <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were in early gestation during the famine the reduction in placental area was greater in boys than girls (p for interaction 0. 03). Conclusion: Famine impaired the normal processes of placentation, even among <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were conceived after it had ended. In <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were in mid-late gestation during the famine, the placenta was less efficient. In <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were in early gestation during the famine, or who were conceived after it had ended, the placenta was more efficient. The placentas of boys and girls responded differently to famine. <br/...|$|R

25|$|Louis' {{second wife}} Clementia was {{pregnant}} {{at the time}} of his death, leaving the succession in doubt. A son would have primacy over Louis' daughter, Joan. A daughter, however, would have a weaker claim to the throne, and would need to compete with Joan's own claims – although suspicions hung over Joan's parentage following the scandal in 1314. As a result, Louis' brother Philip was appointed regent for the five months remaining until the birth of his brother's child. The <b>baby,</b> <b>who</b> turned out to be male, lived only five days, until 20 November 1316—an extremely short reign for Louis's posthumous son, John I.

Such examples include a <b>baby</b> <b>who</b> has not had its diapers changed often or an incontinent elderly person {{who has not been}} helped in maintaining routine bodily hygiene. Flies lay their eggs in and around clothing and skin which, if left undiscovered, will hatch into maggots (larvae) which begin feeding upon flesh, open wounds, ulcers, and any natural bodily entry point.

25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A <b>baby</b> <b>who</b> is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E

25|$|Howes {{moved to}} the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire for the {{duration}} of World War II. She was a show-business <b>baby</b> <b>who</b> lived a quiet, orderly childhood where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, it was inevitable that another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My Sister and I (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh.|$|E

40|$|Background: Globally, 15 million {{babies were}} born prematurely in 2012, with 37. 6 % {{of them in}} South Asia. About 32. 4 million infants were born small for gestational age (SGA) in 2010, {{with more than half}} of these births {{occurring}} in South Asia. In Nepal, 14 % of babies were born preterm and 39. 3 % were born SGA in 2010. We conducted a study in a tertiary hospital of Nepal to assess the level of risk for neonatal mortality among <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were born prematurely and/or SGA. Methods: This case-control study was completed over a 15 -month period between July 2012 and September 2013. All neonatal deaths that occurred during the study period were included as cases and 20 % of women with live births were randomly selected as referents. Information on potential risk factors was taken from medical records and interviews with the women. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the level of risk for neonatal mortality among babies born preterm and/or SGA. Results: During this period, the hospital had an incidence of preterm birth and SGA of 8. 1 and 37. 5 %, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a 12 -fold increased risk of neonatal death among preterm infants compared to term. <b>Babies</b> <b>who</b> were SGA had a 40 % higher risk of neonatal death compared to those who were not. Additionally, <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were both preterm and SGA were 16 times more likely to die during the neonatal period. Conclusions: Our study showed that the risk of neonatal mortality was highest when the baby was born both preterm and SGA, followed by <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were born preterm, and then by <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> were SGA in a tertiary hospital in Nepal. In tertiary care settings, the risk of mortality for <b>babies</b> <b>who</b> are born preterm and/or SGA can be reduced with low-cost interventions such as Kangaroo Mother Care or improved management of complications through special newborn care or neonatal intensive care units.
