40|$|A {{compilation}} of papers {{presented in a}} joint NASA, American Society for Metals, The George Washington University, American Welding Soceity, and Society of Manufacturing Engineers conference on Welding, Bonding, and Fastening at Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, on October 23 to 25, 1984 is given. Papers were presented on technology developed in current research programs relevant to welding, bonding, and fastening of structural materials required in fabricating structures and mechanical systems used in the aerospace, hydrospace, and automotive industries. Topics covered in the conference included equipment, hardware and materials used when welding, brazing, and soldering, mechanical fastening, explosive welding, use of unique selected joining techniques, adhesives bonding, and nondestructive evaluation. A concept of the {{factory of the future}} was presented, followed by advanced welding techniques, automated equipment for welding, welding in a cryogenic atmosphere, <b>blind</b> <b>fastening,</b> stress corrosion resistant fasteners, fastening equipment, explosive welding of different configurations and materials, solid-state bonding, electron beam welding, new adhesives, effects of cryogenics on adhesives, and new techniques and equipment for adhesive bonding...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} liaison to better integrate product model and assembly process model so as to enable sharing of design and assembly process information in a common integrated form and reason about them. Liaison {{can be viewed as}} a set, usually a pair, of features in proximity with which process information can be associated. A liaison is defined as a set of geometric entities on the parts being assembled and relations between these geometric entities. Liaisons have been defined for riveting, welding, bolt fastening, screw fastening, adhesive bonding (gluing) and <b>blind</b> <b>fastening</b> processes. The liaison captures process specific information through attributes associated with it. The attributes are associated with process details at varying levels of abstraction. A data structure for liaison has been developed to cluster the attributes of the liaison based on the level of abstraction. As information about the liaisons is not explicitly available in either the part model or the assembly model, algorithms have been developed for extracting liaisons from the assembly model. The use of liaison is proposed to enable both the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out, as well as maintaining integrity of both product and process models as the inevitable changes happen to both design and the manufacturing environment during the product lifecycle. Results from aerospace and automotive domains have been provided to illustrate and validate the use of liaisons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed parametric {{study on the}} behaviour of blind-bolted curved endplate connections to concrete-filled circular hollow sections. A detailed finite element model was developed and compared with the results from a full scale T-stub connection test. Comparisons between numerical and experimental data for tensile behaviour of the connection show satisfactory agreement. The models take into account material nonlinearities, geometrical curvature, and complex contact interactions between the blind bolt heads, circular tube wall, curved endplates and nuts. The various effects of tube wall thickness, endplate thickness, and anchorage extensions in the tubes on the connection behaviour have been explored using the developed finite element models. A moment-rotation curve has been derived based on the analysis. The favourable strength and stiffness of this innovative connection utilising one-sided <b>fastening</b> <b>blind</b> bolts with anchorage extensions showed {{that it could be}} an attractive solution to the conventional welded moment connections in a composite structural frame. The cogged extensions to the blind bolts are very effective in relieving the stress concentration on the thin tube wall...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} achieving better convergence between different phases (here design and manufacturing) of the product development cycle. The use of liaison has been proposed to better integrate the product and assembly process. Two facets of integration have been addressed in this thesis. One is concurrent evolution of the process model with the product model {{and the second is}} associativity between product model and process model. A liaison data structure has been proposed, which is set of geometric entities, associated with one or more assembly process that acts as an interface between the product model and process model. As the liaison data is not available explicitly in the product model, a set of algorithms have been developed and implemented to identify and extract the geometric entities defined in the liaison data structure from assembly model. The proposed algorithms can identify and extract liaisons for riveting, welding, bolt fastening, screw fastening, adhesive bonding (gluing) and <b>blind</b> <b>fastening.</b> The developed algorithms have been implemented and tested. The process model needs to evolve with the product model concurrently so that any mistakes or infeasibility in the process model can be flagged right away. The use of liaison enables the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out. A framework based on liaison has been proposed and implemented to demonstrate the concurrent evolution of product and process model. Linking the changes in the product model to flag the changes (or at least identify the need for changes) in the process model forms the associativity problem. The liaison has been used for maintaining associativity between the product and process model. A framework has been proposed for maintaining associativity between product model and process model that makes use of expert knowledge or tribal knowledge to track impact of changes in product model or process model. An aircraft wing box has been used as an example to illustrate and validate the proposed approaches. Finally the thesis concludes by summarizing contributions of the research and outlining future work...|$|E
