5000|$|Piece picking, {{also known}} as <b>broken</b> case <b>picking</b> or pick/pack operations, {{describes}} systems where individual items are picked.

5000|$|Operation of weaving in {{a textile}} mill is {{undertaken}} by a specially trained operator {{known as a}} weaver. Weavers are expected to uphold high industry standards, and are tasked with monitoring anywhere from ten, {{to as many as}} thirty separate looms at any one time. During their operating shift, weavers will first utilize a wax pencil or crayon to sign their initials onto the cloth to mark a shift change, and then walk along the cloth side (front) of the looms they tend, gently touching the fabric as it comes from the reed. This is done to feel for any broken [...] "picks" [...] or filler thread. Should <b>broken</b> <b>picks</b> be detected, the weaver will disable the machine and undertake to correct the error, typically by replacing the bobbin of filler thread in as little time as possible. They are trained that, ideally, no machine should stop working for more than one minute, with faster turn around times being preferred.|$|R

50|$|Following Li's {{successful}} loan spell, Everton battled {{with his}} former club Liaoning FC to sign him on a permanent basis after the 2002-03 season and the deal was finally negotiated on 12 August 2003 when Li signed a three-year contract. Everton paid £1,200,000 for his transfer with two-thirds of the deal paid by sponsorships. The club's ownership let him move to the Premier League despite higher offers from Chinese clubs. At {{the beginning of the}} 2003-04 season, Li's start was marred by a sending off against Arsenal on 16 August 2003 after only been substituted on for David Unsworth. A series of injuries followed which meant that Li only played five league matches that season. The last injury, a <b>broken</b> leg <b>picked</b> up during international duty in February 2004, ruled him out for another twelve months. In January 2005, when Li made his return to the pitch by playing for Everton's reserve side against Bolton Wanderers, he lasted just forty-one minutes and required his leg to be reassessed.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile, the {{men were}} fully {{occupied}} each day in hunting seals or fishing, cutting firewood with the axe they had found in the hut, and in making their home more comfortable. A door was fitted to the hut; a wooden partition was put up to cut off more effectually the women's apartment {{from that of the}} men; the open crevices in the walls were stopped up with moss, and many other improvements were made. A few nails extracted from the walls of the hut were converted into fish-hooks, by means of the file which had been found, and Nellie spun some excellent fishing-lines from flax found growing wild in abundance. The file also enabled them to strike fire with <b>broken</b> flints <b>picked</b> up on the shore. The ash of burnt cotton, as the doctor knew, makes good tinder; so in the public interest, John Mitford agreed to part with the ragged remains of the cotton shirt he had long worn--quite unnecessarily--over his woollen jersey. Thus they could afford to let the fire go out, and were relieved from constant watching, as well as anxiety in regard to it.|$|R
60|$|Venters {{passed the}} black cottonwoods, and, {{entering}} the sage, climbed the gradual slope. He kept his direction {{in line with}} a western star. From time to time he stopped to listen and heard only the usual familiar bark of coyote and sweep of wind and rustle of sage. Presently a low jumble of rocks loomed up darkly somewhat to his right, and, turning that way, he whistled softly. Out of the rocks glided a dog that leaped and whined about him. He climbed over rough, <b>broken</b> rock, <b>picking</b> his way carefully, and then went down. Here it was darker, and sheltered from the wind. A white object guided him. It was another dog, and this one was asleep, curled up between a saddle and a pack. The animal awoke and thumped his tail in greeting. Venters placed the saddle for a pillow, rolled in his blankets, with his face upward to the stars. The white dog snuggled close to him. The other whined and pattered a few yards {{to the rise of}} ground and there crouched on guard. And in that wild covert Venters shut his eyes under the great white stars and intense vaulted blue, bitterly comparing their loneliness to his own, and fell asleep.|$|R
50|$|McLachlan, {{a speedy}} left winger, was then {{transferred}} in November 1925 {{for a fee}} of £2,000. He joined the strongest Cardiff City side in the club's history. Promoted to the top division in 1921, they had finished runners up in the 1923-24 League Championship (a late penalty miss in the last {{game of the season}} cost the Welsh side the title) and in the 1924-25 FA Cup. Fellow Scot Hughie Ferguson also joined in 1925. Many Football League clubs were interested in signing McLachlan but he was persuaded to join City as his father was captain of a ship that regularly called at Cardiff docks. Much to McLachlan's disappointment he missed out on an international cap in 1926 with a <b>broken</b> leg <b>picked</b> up against Leicester City. The high point of McLachlan's career came with Cardiff City when he was part of their victory in the 1927 FA Cup Final. McLachlan recovered from the broken leg in 1926 to star in Cardiff's FA Cup triumph. At Cardiff, McLachlan moved from outside left to wing half. He played 139 league games, hitting 22 goals. While at Cardiff, in 1928, he played for the Anglo-Scots against the Home-Scots in an international trial match at Firhill.|$|R

40|$|The 1986 Fall Field Day {{was held}} at the 4 -H Camp at Halsey National Forest on 4 and 5 October. The cloudy, rainy weather, which had been rather general over the state the {{previous}} few days, cleared up (the last rain at Halsey was late Friday night), and Saturday and Sunday were clear, which pleased the 51 who attended. Of the rare bird reports submitted, the Lesser Goldfinch, by Jim Minyard, was ranked first, and the Laughing Gull, by Paul and Karla Kaufman, the Prairie-Chickens at Omaha, by Douglas Fritz, and the King Rail, by Wayne Mollhoff, were ranked next.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{resonant}} leptogenesis scenario in a U(1) _B-L gauge {{extension of the}} standard model to generate large lepton asymmetries for cosmological baryon asymmetry and dark matter. After B-L number is spontaneously <b>broken,</b> inflaton can <b>pick</b> up a small vacuum expectation value for the mass splits of three pairs of quasi-degenerately heavy Majorana neutrinos and the masses of three sterile neutrinos. With thermal mass effects of sphaleron, the observed small baryon asymmetry can be converted from large lepton asymmetries of individual flavors although total lepton asymmetry is assumed zero. The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos is elegantly suppressed by the heavy Majorana neutrinos. Before the active neutrinos start their strong flavor conversions, the sterile neutrinos as warm dark matter can be produced by resonant active-sterile neutrino oscillations to reconcile X-ray and Lyman-α bounds. Small neutrino masses are naturally realized by seesaw contributions from the heavy Majorana neutrinos and the sterile neutrinos...|$|R
50|$|In the 47th minute, New Zealand were on {{the attack}} and {{were the first to}} score in the second half when a long pass from Hohaia out to Vatuvei saw him dive over {{untouched}} in the left corner for his second try of the match. The video referee awarded the try and Luke's sideline conversion attempt was wide, so the score was New Zealand 18, England 24. The Kiwi's then continued dominating possession and field position and in the 55th minute Vatuvei scored his 3rd, again diving over untouched in the corner after receiving a long ball from Hohaia. Once more Luke had to kick for goal from the sideline and this time was successful so the scores were level at 24 all. In the 69th minute, Luke gained his team a penalty when he was given a push by an England player while running in to contest a bomb and fell to the ground. The Kiwis decided to take the kick from in front of the posts and Luke got the two points which put New Zealand in the lead {{for the first time at}} 26 - 24. New Zealand were attacking England's line again in the 75th minute when an English defender fumbled an intercept chance and from the confusion Nathan Fein, who was playing on despite a <b>broken</b> nose, <b>picked</b> up the ball and crashed over. The try was awarded by the video referee and the conversion was kicked by Jeremy Smith, so New Zealand led 32 to 24 with 5 minutes of the match remaining. The Kiwis got one more try, again from Lance Hohaia throwing a long ball out to Manu Vatuvei to cross untouched on the left wing once more, his fourth try for the night. Benji Marshall took the sideline conversion attempt and missed, but the game was already beyond doubt, with New Zealand winning 36 - 24.|$|R
6000|$|Owing {{to which}} it is that I don't at all know what troops were in question, a [...] "mere" [...] couple of Rhode Island regiments (nothing in those days could be too big to escape the {{application}} of the [...] "mere,") or a congeries of the temporarily incapacitated, the more or less <b>broken,</b> <b>picked</b> from the veterans--so far as there already were such--of the East at large and directed upon the Grove as upon a place of stowage and sanitation. Discriminations of the prosaic order {{had little to do with}} my first and all but sole vision of the American soldier in his multitude, and above all--for that was markedly the colour of the whole thing--in his depression, his wasted melancholy almost; an effect that somehow corresponds for memory, I bethink myself, with the tender elegiac tone in which Walt Whitman was later on so admirably to commemorate him. The restrictions I confess to are abject, but both my sense and my aftersense of the exhibition I here allude to had, thanks to my situation, to do all the work they could in the way of representation to me of what was most publicly, most heroically, most wastefully, tragically, terribly going on. It had so to serve for my particular nearest approach to a [...] "contact" [...] with the active drama--I mean of course the collectively and scenically active, since the brush of interest against the soldier single and salient was an affair of every day--that were it not for just one other strange spasm of awareness, scarce relaxed to this hour, I should have been left all but pitifully void of any scrap of a substitute for the concrete experience. The long hot July 1st of '63, on which the huge battle of Gettysburg had begun, could really be--or rather couldn't possibly not be--a scrap of concrete experience for any group of united persons, New York cousins and all, who, in a Newport garden, restlessly strolling, sitting, neither daring quite to move nor quite to rest, quite to go in nor quite to stay out, actually listened together, in their almost ignobly safe stillness, as to the boom of far-away guns. This was, as it were, the War--the War palpably in Pennsylvania; not less than my hour of a felt rage of repining at my doomed absence from the sight of that march of the 54th Massachusetts out of Boston, [...] "Bob" [...] Shaw at its head and our exalted Wilky among its officers, of which a great sculptor was, on the spot of their vividest passing, to set the image aloft forever. Poor other visitations, comparatively, had had to suffice for me; I could take in fact for amusing, most of all (since that, thank goodness, was high gaiety), a couple of impressions of the brief preliminary camp life at Readville during which we admired the charming composition of the 44th of the same State, under Colonel Frank Lee, and which fairly made romantic for me Wilky's quick spring out of mere juvenility and into such brightly-bristling ranks. He had begun by volunteering in a company that gave him half the ingenuous youth of the circle within our social ken for brothers-in-arms, and it was to that pair of Readville afternoons I must have owed my all so emphasised vision of handsome young Cabot Russell, who, again to be his closest brother-in-arms in the 54th, irrecoverably lost himself, as we have seen, at Fort Wagner. A dry desert, one must suppose, the life in which, for memory and appreciation made one, certain single hours or compressed groups of hours have found their reason for standing out through everything, for insistently living on, in the cabinet of intimate reference, the museum, as it were, of the soul's curiosities--where doubtless at the same time an exhibition of them to mere other eyes or ears or questioning logical minds may effect itself in no plain terms. We recognise such occasions more and more as we go on, and are surely, as a general thing, glad when, for the interest of memory--which it's such a business to keep interesting--they constitute something of a cluster. In my queer cluster, at any rate, that flower of the connection which answers to the name of Portsmouth Grove still overtops other members of its class, so that to finger it again for a moment is to make it perceptibly exhale its very principle of life. This was, for me, at the time, neither more nor less than that the American soldier in his multitude was the most attaching and affecting and withal the most amusing figure of romance conceivable; the great sense of my vision being thus that, as the afternoon light of the place and time lingered upon him, both to the seeming enhancement of his quality and of its own, romance of a more confused kind than I shall now attempt words for attended his every movement. It was the charmingest, touchingest, dreadfullest thing in the world that my impression of him should have to be somehow of his abandonment to a rueful humour, to a stoic reserve which could yet melt, a relation with him once established, into a rich communicative confidence; and, in particular, all over the place, of his own scanted and more or less baffled, though constantly and, as I couldn't not have it, pathetically, [...] "knowing" [...] devices.|$|R
5000|$|The name Arrow Lakes, {{though in}} wide use, is unofficial; the gazetted names are for Upper Arrow Lake and Lower Arrow Lake, and BC Hydro refers to them {{together}} as the Arrow Lakes Reservoir.

Different stories surround the meaning of the arrows, said to be shot there by the Lakes people (Sinixt) for good luck, either before or after war:On October 19, 1826, while travelling south between Upper and Lower Arrow Lakes, Simpson passed [...] "...The Arrow Rock, so named on account of a round hole in the face full of Arrows, said to have been fired at it by the Indians when practicing the Bow and Arrow before a war excursion." [...] (Journal of Emilius Simpson; HBC Archives' accession B223/a/3 1826 Folio 39D-41) Source: included with note [...] "On our passage up the Columbia to the Boat Encampment, the Brigade had a spell and a smoke at this place. I recollect the boats were right under a high & perpendicular wall of rock, and the arrows were embedded in holes or hollows some 30 or 40 feet above us in the boat. Mr. Duncan Finlayson asked me in chinook if I wanted the arrows. I told him yes; he took up his shot gun & fired, bringing a number of them down <b>broken.</b> arrows were <b>picked</b> up by the men and given to me but before doing so I remember they were closely examined.....being old voyageurs and men of Experience in Indian Arrows, they took great interest to Endeavor to solve the question by what tribe or nation were those arrows made. They examined the kind of wood, the cut of the feathers & even the denew, the number of turns it took to secure the feathers, but experts as they were they had to give it up - they could not solve it satisfactorily. I recollect there was something said of a large war party of Lake Indians or Upper Columbia River Indians invading the Kutanays or Mountaneirs. They had defeated the Mountaneirs and had captured a large quantity of arrows & having no further need of them expended them in those holes to commemorate the action. I am sure the spot is at the Lower Lake. I have made several enquiries of miners, boat-men and others, and strange to say not one of them ever saw...arrows. I then began to think that I was mistaken, however questioned Big head Edward the chief of the Lake Indians. He told me there was such a place, but not speaking his language I could get no further information." [...] (letter from Ranald Macdonald to Malcolm McLeod, 29 December 1890, held in Provincial Archives details not cited on BC name card [...] ) Source: included with note In the days before Columbus was born, the 'Indians' of the west and east Kootenay were at continual strife. It was customary for the west Kootenay Indians to winter along the southern Columbia and to ascend the stream every summer, to the lakes where hunting was good. As the tribes in the Slocan were always on the alert for war, they had their scouts out on the Arrow Lakes to note when their enemies came up the river. One summer the scouts returned from the Arrow Lakes with news that a particularly large force of warriors were going up the river. So the Slocan tribes prepared for war and crossed the mountains in force to Nakusp. On embarking from their canoes at Nakusp (the bay behind the long point) they noticed signs of a great storm having passed. On proceeding up the lake for some distance they came upon the force of the enemy. But alas ! There were none to resist them, for the great storm had apparently come suddenly upon them and there was nothing left but a heaving mass of canoe wreckage and dead bodies. The Slocan Indians took this as a great favour from the great 'Manatoo', and in token of respect they fired all their arrows at the high rock off which they lay, and wrote inscriptions {{on the face of the}} rock. Because of the vast wealth of arrow heads that fell to the bottom of the lake that day, the Indians named it Arrow Lake. (Relayed by Richard Blyth, as told to him by Chief Louis Joseph, Burton.)
