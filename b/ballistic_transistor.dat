50|$|One {{advantage}} of the <b>ballistic</b> <b>transistor</b> is that because such device will use very little power, it will create less heat. Having produced less heat, {{it will be able}} to withstand a longer duration and speed. Thus, it will be easier to incorporate into a variety of technology. This design will also reduce electrical noise that come from the electronic devices. With an increased speed, another {{advantage of}} the transistor is that it will be beneficial in both aspects of linear amplifier and switch. The signal on a device would massively increase as well as its memory because the transistor will be able to withstand more than the standard chips. Additionally, the size of an ideal <b>ballistic</b> <b>transistor</b> is going to be significantly smaller than the standard transistor. The reduced size helps with the precision of electron movement, thus eliminating any error of fluctuations of random scattering and collision.|$|E
50|$|Ballistic Transistors are {{electronic}} devices currently being developed for high-speed integrated circuits, {{which is a}} set of circuits bounded on semiconductor material. They use electromagnetic forces instead of a logic gate, a device used to perform solely on specified inputs, to switch the forces of electrons. The unique design of this transistor includes individual electrons bouncing off of wedge-shaped obstacles called deflectors. Initially impelled by the circuits electric field, electrons proceed on their respective paths via this electromagnetic deflection. Electrons are then able to travel without being scattered by atoms or defects thus producing an increased transit time. With an increased transit time, the <b>ballistic</b> <b>transistor</b> will be able to produce longer and more effective results than the standard transistor today.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ballistic</b> <b>transistor</b> {{would be}} {{significant}} in acting {{as both a}} linear amplifier and a switch for current flow on electronic devices. A transistor used as a linear amplifier helps heighten a signal on a device. Additionally, a transistor used as a switch for current flow helps maintain digital logic and memory on devices. A transistor's switching speed greatly affects how fast charge carriers-typically electrons-can cross from one region to the next. For this reason, researchers want to use ballistic action to improve the charge carrier's traveling time and speed. A standard transistor is used to amplify electronic power and signals. However, ballistic transistors {{will be able to}} fulfill its purpose and last longer than standard transistors because of its continuous flow of electrons. With this, the transistors should also be able to withstand immense amounts of heat, or rather perform faster in order to avoid drawbacks.|$|E

40|$|The {{definition}} of the intrinsic cut-off frequency ($f_T$) based on the current gain equals to one (0 dB) is critically analyzed. A condition for {{the validity of the}} quasi-static estimation of $f_T$ is established in terms of the temporal variations of the electric charge and electric flux on the drain, source and gate terminals. Due to the displacement current, an electron traversing the channel length generates a current pulse of finite temporal width. For electron devices where the intrinsic delay time of the current after a transient perturbation is comparable to such width, the displacement currents cannot be neglected and the quasi-static approximation becomes inaccurate. We provide numerical results for some <b>ballistic</b> <b>transistors</b> where the estimation of $f_T$ under the quasi-static approximation can be one order of magnitude larger than predictions obtained from a time-dependent numerical simulations of the intrinsic delay time (including particle and displacement currents).

Furthermore, graphene is also an excellent electronic material as it can be either a metal or semiconductor depending on the edge states, zigzag or armchair [7]. It exhibits superior mobility, with reported values in excess of 15, 000 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 [1], which is superior to that of III-V semiconductors for high-speed device applications.

In both regimes, inelastic scattering induced by the ac drive can excite quasi-bound states in the channel that leads to resonance promotion of higher order sidebands.

The conductance modulation of the SFET {{as a function of the}} Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength is numerically examined for the number of channels ranging from a few to close to 100. Even with the ideal spin injector and collector, the conductance modulation ratio, defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum conductances, decays rapidly and approaches one with the increase of the channel number. It turns out that the decay is considerably faster when the Rashba spin-orbit coupling is larger. Effects of the electronic coherence are also examined in the multi-channel regime and it is found that the coherent Fabry-Perot-like interference in the multi-channel regime gives rise to a nested peak structure. For a nonideal spin injector/collector structure, which consists of a conventional metallic ferromagnet-thin insulator- 2 DEG heterostructure, the Rashba-coupling-induced conductance modulation is strongly affected by large resonance peaks that arise from the electron confinement effect of the insulators. Finally scattering effects are briefly addressed and it is found that in the weakly diffusive regime, the positions of the resonance peaks fluctuate, making the conductance modulation signal sample-dependent.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to {{theoretical}} study of new hydrodynamic phenomena in two dimensional electron fluid. These phenomena {{taking place in the}} channel of a <b>ballistic</b> field effect <b>transistor</b> (FET) may be used for generating and detecting terahertz radiation. It was shown in [1] that, if the temperature is not too low, two dimensional electrons in the channel of the FET behave not as a gas (as conventionally expected) but as a fluid. Indeed, as one can show, the electron mean free path for collisions with impurities and phonons is much greater than the mean free path for electron-electron collisions. This means that the theoretical description of the electron flow in the FET channel should be based on the equations of hydrodynamics. The hydrodynamic model for the FET was proposed in [1]. It was shown that the equations describing the electron flow in the channel coincide with those for shallow water, the channel voltage playing the role of the water level. This far-ranging analogy has profound consequences for predicting and studying a number of new phenomena in two dimensional electron fluid. First of all, in the electron fluid, waves should exist just as in water. These waves are just plasma waves with a linear dispersion law. A short enough channel of the FET (of submicron length) acts essentially as a resonator for plasma waves. The quality of the resonator for the submicron channel may be high enough (about 10).

Carbon nanotube FETs (CNTFETs) are illustrated to replace silicon {{in the future}} [1]. Carbon nanotubes were explored by Sumio Iijima in 1991 [2]. Carbon nanotubes have properties, such as caring high current, ballistic transport, mechanical stability, and dynamic load, which make them appropriate substances to replace silicon as the channel of field-effect <b>transistors.</b> <b>Ballistic</b> transport in p-type CNTFETs using quasi-planar gate geometries and higher on-currents to MOSFET has been proved by experiments [3, 4]. Cylindrical carbon nanotube with gate-all-around (GAA) leads {{to an increase in}} miniaturization and also provides electrostatic control of the gate [5]. There is charge pile-up in the channel CNTFET, which leads to the increase in the off-current and lowers the I ON/I OFF ratio. To overcome this problem, a gate-controlled tunneling device (T-CNTFET) is offered. A steep inverse sub-threshold slope and the better controlled off-current were obtained by T-CNTFETs. In T-CNTFET, the increase in the potential difference between the gate and the drain contact leads to strong band-bending near the drain contact [6]. The T-CNTFET has been simulated by self-consistent solution between the Poisson and Schrodinger equations [3]. As can be found from [3], to suppress the ambipolar behavior of CNTFET and to improve the performance of this device, the asymmetric double-halo doping has been applied in CNTFET. In addition, for this purpose, CNTFETs with graded double-halo channel are presented as in [7]. Transmission is considered ballistic in both [3] and [7]. In this paper, we investigate the effect of changing a channel parameter on characteristics of T-CNTFET, provided that the other channel parameters remain constant. The investigated channel parameters include channel length (L), channel diameter, and gate oxide thickness. Finally, on-current (Ion), tunneling current, on/off-current ratio (I ON/I OFF), and sub-threshold swing (SS) were the characteristics investigated in this research.|$|R
