25|$|So-on soon {{sent his}} {{students}} to train with a Rinzai master for a while. Here Shunryu studied {{a very different kind}} of Zen, one that promoted the attainment of satori through the concentration on koans through zazen. Suzuki had problems sitting with his koan. Meanwhile, all the other boys passed theirs, and he felt isolated. Just before the ceremony marking their departure Suzuki went to the Rinzai teacher and <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> his answer. The master passed Suzuki; later Shunryu believed he had done it simply to be kind.|$|E
25|$|During their meeting, {{the deputy}} {{leader of the}} expedition, Xu Jing, spontaneously <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> that on his descent from the First Step, he {{recalled}} having spotted a dead climber lying on his back, feet facing uphill, in a hollow or slot in the rock. Since no one other than Mallory and Irvine had ever been lost {{on the north side}} of Everest before 1960, and Mallory had been found much lower down, it was almost a certainty that Xu had discovered Irvine. However, the sighting was brief, and Xu was in desperate straits during the descent, and while he clearly remembered seeing the body, he was unclear about where it was.|$|E

But as soon as he and the Spanish general were in private, he <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> his mission. He knew it was possible that La Romana might turn him over to Napoleon's police to be hanged as a spy. At first, the Spaniard regarded Robertson as a likely French agent trying to test his loyalty. Finally, the priest convinced La Romana that he was working for the British government. The general admitted that he was dismayed by his position and certain that Napoleon's intentions toward Spain were bad.|$|E

25|$|There {{were rumors}} that Dmitry was an illegitimate {{son of the}} Polish king, Stefan Batory, who had reigned from 1575 to 1586; {{according}} to a later tale, Dmitry <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> that identity when once slapped by a violent master. Dmitry's own story was that the Tsar Ivan's widow his mother, anticipating Boris Godunov's assassination attempt, had given the young tsarevich into {{the care of a}} doctor, who placed him in various Russian monasteries through the years. After the doctor's death, Dmitry had then fled to Poland, working there as a teacher for a brief time, before being accepted into the service of the Wisniowieckis. Several of those who had known Ivan IV claimed later that Dmitry did indeed resemble the young tsarevich; further, the young man also displayed aristocratic tendencies, such as horsemanship and literacy, and was fluent in Russian, Polish, and French.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} has received attention out of soap opera media. Kyle Anderson of MTV News noted the song [...] "Blame Game" [...] by American rapper Kanye West {{to contain a}} reference to the character of Chloe Mitchell. Before Chris Rock's cameo in the song, West [...] "blurts out" [...] the name Chloe Mitchell, which Anderson commented [...] "doesn't rhyme with anything and doesn't seem to have much context". The author concluded that it was in fact the soap opera character being mentioned. Unfortunately, this is not true as the <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> name {{at the end of the}} verse is crediting a poet named Chloe Mitchell who wrote the prior lines of the song.|$|E

Wiesner <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> [...] "No, that's no good" [...] {{in front of the}} press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was [...] "still subject to final review". Webb held firm, and issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October Cuban Missile Crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb. NASA announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor in November 1962.|$|E
500|$|While sources {{agree the}} name is a {{reference}} to North Texas' athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his [...] "Mean Greene" [...] nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university's moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene's first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the [...] "Mean Green" [...] moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she <b>blurted</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "That’s the way, Mean Greene!" [...] Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham's thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, [...] "Mean Green, you look so good to me". The rest of the crowd soon followed. [...] "After that we did it every game," [...] Davis said. [...] "A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant that Saturday night at Fouts Field. And that's the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was written and {{composed}} for Michael Jackson by Steve Porcaro of Toto. Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. He had written the song after his first-grade daughter came home crying because a boy pushed her off the slide. He <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> three reasons for the incident to comfort her: one, the boy liked her, two, people can be strange and three, it's human nature. Fellow Toto band member David Paich gave the demo tape, along {{with two of his}} own songs, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be used by Jackson. Jones did not think Paich's songs were right for Jackson's current work, but enjoyed the rough demo of [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{at the end of the}} cassette. Jones explained, [...] "All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor'". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting [...] "Carousel" [...] from the final track listing.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1960s, then-Mayor John F. Collins {{reportedly}} gasped as {{the design}} was first unveiled, and {{someone in the}} room <b>blurted</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "What the hell is that?" [...] City Hall is sharply unpopular with some Bostonians, {{as it is with}} some employees of the building, who see it as a dark and unfriendly eyesore. [...] In part, these opinions are a reaction against greater Boston's numerous examples of concrete modernism from the 1960s; with City Hall being {{one of the very few}} public buildings in the Brutalist style, it naturally receives more attention. [...] In part, these opinions are influenced by the building's long-term inadequate funding for maintenance (compared to the Boston Public Library, for instance), its need for upgraded lighting and mechanical systems, its lack of coherent signage, and its post-9/11 security barriers and closed entrances.|$|E
2500|$|At Caltech, Pauling {{struck up}} a close {{friendship}} with theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, who was spending part of his research and teaching schedule away from U.C.

Oppenheimer even gave Pauling a stunning personal collection of minerals. [...] The two men planned to mount a joint attack {{on the nature of}} the chemical bond: apparently Oppenheimer would supply the mathematics and Pauling would interpret the results. Their relationship soured when Oppenheimer tried to pursue Pauling's wife, Ava Helen. When Pauling was at work, Oppenheimer came to their home and <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> an invitation to Ava Helen to join him on a tryst in Mexico. She flatly refused, and reported the incident to Pauling. He immediately cut off his relationship with Oppenheimer.|$|E
2500|$|Casting for {{the lead}} {{characters}} of NBC police procedural television drama series [...] occurred {{in the spring of}} 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA, were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead – Detective Olivia Benson – Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Hargitay were being considered. For the male role – Detective Elliot Stabler – the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, and Christopher Meloni. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together and after the actors left, {{there was a moment of}} dead silence, after which Wolf <b>blurted</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni." [...] The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from the first time he saw them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent. Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson.|$|E

2500|$|DMCA {{claims have}} also been {{threatened}} or used to remove Let's Plays of games owned by a company who {{do not agree with}} ideals or morales of the person creating the video. In September 2017, Kjellberg accidentally <b>blurted</b> <b>out</b> a racist insult while live-streaming a game to viewers, later apologizing for this; this followed previous incidents of where Kjellberg's on-screen behavior had been criticized. Campo Santo's founder Sean Vanaman was dismayed by this, and issued a DMCA notice to takedown Kjellberg's Let's Play of their game Firewatch, stating that having their game shown on his YouTube channel was the equivalent of endorsing his ideologies; YouTube complied with this request a few days later. Vanaman later clarified that his goal was not to censor Kjellberg, but that there is a [...] "bad fit" [...] between Kjellberg's views and Campo Santo's views and would prefer that Kjellberg not cover his games. Lawyers and legal experts speaking to both Kotaku, The Verge and PC Gamer believed that content owners like Campo Santo have full control to issue DMCA takedowns under the law, but whether these takedowns are valid under fair use defense within copyright law is unclear, since to this point there has been no case law to challenge the legality of Let's Plays and other video game video walkthroughs or challenges to DMCA takedowns for this type of content. Kjellberg did not plan to counter the DMCA claim but pointed out that the use of DMCA to take down videos due to issues other than related to copyright has a potential for abuse by game developers and publishers and affect the current balance of the value of Let's Plays in game promotion and marketing.|$|E
