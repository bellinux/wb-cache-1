[...] "Idiot," [...] said he, [...] "if that is your way of {{thinking}} you might as well say that if a well caves in you should never again dig for water, or that nobody should have a cellar under his house for fear that the house should fall into it. There's no more danger of the ice beneath us ever giving way again than there is that this bluff should crumble under our feet. That <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the ice tunnel was caused by my digging away the face of the bluff very near that spot. The high temperature of the outer air weakened the ice, and it fell. But down here, under this ground and secure from the influences of the heat of the outer air, the mass of ice is more solid than rock. We will build a brick arch over the place where the accident happened, and then {{there will not be a}} safer mine on this continent than this ice-mine will be." ...|$|E

You have rubbed yourself all over with fir boughs, to destroy some of <b>the</b> scent <b>in</b> your clothes, and hidden yourself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top of a fallen tree. The twilight goes; the moon wheels over the eastern spruces, flooding the river with silver light. Still no sign of life. You are beginning to think of another disappointment; to think your toes cannot stand the cold another minute without stamping, which would spoil everything, when a ripple shoots swiftly across the pool, and a big beaver comes out on the bank. He sits up a moment, looking, listening; then goes to the broken house and sits up again, looking it all over, estimating damages, making plans. There is a commotion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water; three others join him--you are warm now.|$|R
50|$|Bacon met Dyer—in {{an often}} {{repeated}} but likely fictitious story—when he caught <b>the</b> younger man <b>breaking</b> <b>in</b> through <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of his flat in a failed burglary. Dyer was then {{in his early}} 30s, tall and athletic, and largely uneducated and from an impoverished East London background—all of which appealed to Bacon's taste for rough trade. There was an immediate {{connection between the two}} men, and from the mid-1960s Dyer became Bacon's principal model and muse. However, while Bacon's fame grew and critical attention of the successful portraits of Dyer brought the younger man a degree of fame and notoriety, the focus on Bacon as the star of the art world overshadowed Dyer's neediness, and he inevitably came to see himself as just another associate and hanger-on.|$|R

50|$|Vanbrugh's {{northwest}} facade {{consisted of}} a single flat surface, in which a Venetian window on each floor filled the central space between two shallow projections. Perhaps to improve the view down to Avonmouth, the centre was remodelled by Mylne with a canted bay window, {{at odds with the}} tautness of Vanbrugh's overall design of the house, in which all planes were parallel or perpendicular to the walls. On the northeast the wall was moved forward during nineteenth-century remodelling, destroying an aesthetically significant alignment between wall projections and the <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> arcade, which had been present in Vanbrugh's design.|$|E

40|$|Report to the Archives of the Cathedral, San Cristóbal, de las Casas, 2008. There {{are many}} {{documented}} examples of meridian lines in Italian churches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 14 th and 15 th centuries. Hilbron (1999) discusses how these lines {{and others were}} {{used to measure the}} date of the equinox, the sun's altitude {{on the day of the}} summer solstice, the earth's annual motion, its obliquity, and other topics of interest to astronomers. No published instances of these astronomical uses of churches have been found for in Latin America. We report here a new finding, that meridian lines were also constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas, <b>in</b> 17 th and 18 th century churches in Chiapas, Mexico. They traced the principle aisle of the church. Incredibly, although the lines continue to provide a spectacular light show, their meaning has been lost. Even more astonishing is the finding that these 17 th and 18 th century churches were designed to produce these impressive light shows. Old World churches were retrofitted for Meridian lines by <b>breaking</b> holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> or cutting them into stained glass installations. Four of <b>the</b> churches studied <b>in</b> San Cristóbal de las Casas, were designed from the ground up to cast equinoctial and solsticial beams of light...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach for analytical analysis and field tests to estimate <b>the</b> <b>break</b> line <b>in</b> a main <b>roof</b> over <b>the</b> goaf edge. An analytical model which treated <b>the</b> main <b>roof</b> as a beam seating on the Winkler foundation {{and subjected to}} nonuniformity roof loading was established. Further analysis of the bending moment distribution of such a main roof beam was undertaken. Based on the geological conditions pertaining to a case study at Wangjialing coal mine, Shanxi Province, China, <b>the</b> <b>break</b> line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>roof</b> <b>in</b> a typical longwall panel was calculated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rib-sides {{at a distance of}} 5. 6 to 7. 4 [*]m from the goaf edge. The influence of main roof flexural rigidity and foundation rigidity and so forth on the bending moment distribution was revealed by a parametric study. Borehole camera detection was employed to further validate the analytical model and its results. The results of the field test demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>break</b> line detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main <b>roof</b> was about 5. 5 to 6. 8 [*]m away from the goaf edge, which was in good agreement with the analytical model...|$|R

40|$|Moisture {{intrusion}} is {{the major}} reason why low-slope roofing systems fail prematurely. With approximately 75 % of all roofing activity being reroofing, <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> professional is faced with deciding {{what to do with}} an existing wet roof on almost a daily basis. Problems can originate from moisture entering <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system by two completely different mechanisms. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> wintertime, <b>the</b> vapor pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> building interior typically exceeds <b>the</b> vapor pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system, causing water vapor to migrate from the building interior into <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system. If <b>the</b> vapor pressure gradient is severe and persists for a long time, sufficient water vapor may build up under <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> membrane to allow condensation to occur. The second mechanism that allows an appreciable amount of water into <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system is membrane failure. <b>Breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> membrane will allow water to enter <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system from <b>the</b> exterior. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> construction, <b>the</b> water will either build up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> or migrate to <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> deck where it may manifest itself as a leak. The net effect of water entering <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> system by either mechanism is the same: reduced energy efficiency, corrosion of metal components (decks and fasteners), mechanical degradation of the insulation materials, and bond failures between adhered components. These impacts lead to reduced durability, shorter service life, and health/safety issues. This paper describes finite-difference computer modeling performed to address moisture control in low-slope roofing systems. Based on a large database of finite difference modeling results, algorithms have been developed that allow <b>the</b> <b>roofing</b> practitioner to simply determine if a roofing system design requires a vapor retarder or if the system can be modified to enhance its tolerance for small leaks. This paper illustrates how modeling results were obtained, describes the process employed to develop the algorithms, anddemon-strates how these algorithms can be used to design a moisture-tolerant low-slope <b>roof.</b> <b>The</b> range of applicability and limitations of these algorithms are also detailed...|$|R
