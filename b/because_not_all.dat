5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> local cults of Isis held mystery rites, not all her devotees {{would have}} {{undergone}} initiation.

5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, {{within striking distance of}} a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. <b>Because</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison centers in 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison centers in 2003. In Australia there were 17 cases reported to the Victorian poison center and 30 cases reported to the New South Wales poison center in 2007. However, these numbers may underestimate actual numbers <b>because</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> cases attributable to ethylene glycol are reported to poison control centers. Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall <b>because</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, <b>because</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E

25|$|The Aztec empire was an {{informal}} or hegemonic empire {{because it did}} not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them.

40|$|Ajaxâ€™s {{death is}} a crucial moment in the Sophoclean tragedy {{entitled}} Ajax, <b>because,</b> <b>not</b> only <b>all</b> the facts {{in the first half}} of the play converge to it, but also the second half begins with it. Although the desire to evade his honourâ€™s loss comes from the hero himself, this death will be an assertion of Ajaxâ€™s character and will allow his rehabilitation in the end of the tragedy. Thus, by considering Ajaxâ€™s suicide, which shapes our understanding of the play as a whole, the present paper will focus on the complexity of a death whose purpose is to redress the heroâ€™s fall. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
