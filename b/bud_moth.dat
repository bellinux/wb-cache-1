40|$|At the La Tapy Experimental Station {{in southeastern}} France, {{a plot of}} table grapes is managed {{according}} {{to the principles of}} organic farming in order to study potential technical impediments of this growing system compared to another plot that is managed according to the principles of sustainable agriculture. Muscat de Hambourg, the variety common to these two plots, is used as a reference for the different observations. Results are primarily related to the impact of pest management efficiency on vine quality. The qualitative requirement that powdery mildew be absent on table grapes is difficult to fulfil in the case of organic farming, even with several different treatments and frequent applications. Botrytis management is related to climatic conditions; disease prevention is therefore essential. Small populations of grapeberry moths (Lobesia botrana) and the absence of grape <b>bud</b> <b>moths</b> (Eupoecilia ambiguella) on those plots, as well as the efficacy of specific treatments, even in the context of biological control, using products containing Bacillus thuringiensis, led to either none or negligible damage on the two observed plots. Monitoring of grape leaf hopper populations (Empoasca vitis) revealed that there was no increase in the larva population. The stable level of auxiliaries on this plot partially explains the low incidence of Empoasca vitis...|$|R
50|$|The spruce <b>bud</b> <b>moths</b> of {{the genus}} Zeiraphera, transcontinental in range, are found {{frequently}} on white spruce but only occasionally on other spruces and firs (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Zeiraphera canadensis (Mutuura and Freeman Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), has caused {{a high incidence of}} multiple and abnormal leaders in white spruce in the Maritime provinces, Quebec, and Maine (Quiring et al. 1991). However, although severe feeding damage has seldom been extensive in forests, new shoots on open-grown white spruce are frequently disfigured (Rose and Lindquist 1985). The insect overwinters in the egg stage on the tree. The larva emerges in May and feeds underneath the bud cap, which it characteristically secures to the growing shoot with silk. The cap remains in place long after the other bud caps have been shed, an obvious impediment to the effectiveness of contact insecticides. When populations are high, it is not unusual to find several larvae feeding among the needles of a single shoot. The head and thoracic legs of young larvae are dark brown, but full-grown larvae are cream to yellow and about 10 mm long. Feeding is completed in June or early July, whereupon the larva drops to the ground and becomes a pupa in the litter. From mid-July to mid-August, moths emerge from the pupae to lay eggs singly or in groups of two to seven at the base of shoots of the current year. In a New Brunswick seed orchard, white spruce of intermediate height (1.5 to 3.73 m) were damaged most, and damage in one year was positively correlated with damage in the next. At four test sites, mean growth reduction of trees in the two most susceptible families was estimated to be approximately 30% higher than those of trees in the two least susceptible families. The lack of damage to some trees, among those trees suffering damage, suggested the existence of genetically based differences in susceptibility to this pest.|$|R
50|$|The oval egg (0.75-0.8 mm) is {{flattened}} on one side. At first, {{it has a}} white {{color and}} then it becomes yellow. In the end the color turns dark. The larva reaches 14 mm long. At first it is white, then yellow with dark head and anal scutellum. It has eight lines of dark warts with hairs. Larva also has eight pairs of legs (three pairs on thorax). The body length of yellow-brown pupae varies from 5 to 7 mm. The over-wintering takes place during the phase of fifth-instar larvae, within a dense oval cocoon in the ground on fields of pea, lentil, peavine and vetch. An insignificant number of caterpillars over-winter in places where grain is dried and threshed. The insects pupate, in their cocoons, underground {{during the month of}} May. The pupae period lasts 10-18 days. The first moths appear during the period of wild vetch and pea-vine blooming. When first <b>buds</b> appear, the <b>moths</b> are found on pea. After coupling, which takes place four to seven days after emergence from the cocoon, the insects begin to lay eggs. Additional feeding on pea flowers is preferred. Moths fly in the evening; they live 10-14 days. Mass oviposition occurs at the beginning of July. The oviposition lasts 25-30 days. Pests lay eggs in groups of one, two or three (rarely four) on upper leaves (lower side), peduncle, bell, stems. Embryonic development lasts 6-10 days. Fecundity reaches 200 eggs. Hatching caterpillars penetrate into the pods and gnaw grains from above, making wide channels, ending in a hollow at one end. They soil the grain with fecal masses and cobwebs. Usually, one, rarely two or more (up to four) caterpillars are located in pods. The entire larval period (lasting 16-25 days) occurs inside one pod. The larvae have five instars, four molts. Then the insect makes a hole in the pod wall and comes out, making a cocoon in the ground. This take place when the pods become mature and the plants become dry (from the end of July and up to the first ten-day period of September). Young caterpillars (not fifth instar) that did not finish their feeding can diapause, but eventually they perish.|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, {{sunflower}} producers, field scouts and seed companies have {{expressed concern about the}} injury to sunflower resulting in deformed and misshapen areas in the head.
