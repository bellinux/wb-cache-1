5|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{lies between}} the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, both mostly desert regions {{with very few}} {{permanent}} settlements. The seismologists who work with historical events gather macroseismic data from written records from cities {{that may not have}} <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> near the epicentral area. This can result in the mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred. The records of these events have been influenced by the distribution of the population (where the people were) and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events. Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6.5–7.0 based on macroseismic data.|$|E

The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages for their pain and suffering, lost future earnings, funeral expenses, etc. There has not <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> else, either before or since this controversial incident, any other reported cases involving or alleging Salvia divinorum as a serious factor in suicide, overdose, accidental, or {{any other kind of}} death.|$|E

Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair." [...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote: [...] "The result {{is a lot of}} laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year." [...] In a five star review for Empire Magazine, Ian Nathan wrote: [...] "For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana" [...] and [...] "In a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers."

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining." ...|$|E
500|$|Canning's {{trial was}} marked by the prosecution's {{inability}} to find any evidence whatsoever that she had <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> but in Wells's home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. [...] Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. [...] The writer F. J. Harvey Darton suspected that the family were smugglers, {{and that it was}} significant they had passed through Eggardon, where Isaac Gulliver operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). [...] The 18th-century artist Allan Ramsay claimed that Canning's initial story was [...] "exceedingly stupid", and false. [...] He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. [...] The US author Lillian Bueno McCue theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. [...] Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells's home. [...] He suggests that Robert Scaratt implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells's house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy. [...] Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not have lied intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. [...] He calls Canning [...] "the first media product." [...] Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. [...] Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires' testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits—often at the expense of others.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 April 1944, the {{day before}} U-129 {{attacked}} Melbourne Star, an eastbound ship purporting to be the Portuguese four-masted [...] cargo steamer [...] had passed the cargo ship in mid-Atlantic. The Admiralty enquiry into the loss of Melbourne Star established that no Portuguese ship answering that description had <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> near {{that part of the}} Atlantic that day. It was therefore suspected that this was a Kriegsmarine merchant raider disguised as a neutral Portuguese ship, and that she had passed Melbourne Stars position and course to the BdU.|$|E
2500|$|... "Timesitheus" [...] is a cognomen which {{suggests}} that the bearer was ethnically a Greek. However, Timesitheus's nomen and praenomen (i.e. [...] "Furius Sabinius" [...] and [...] "Gaius" [...] respectively) indicate long-established Roman citizenship and a family that was well-integrated into the élite classes of the Empire although it is otherwise unknown. Such enthusiasm {{to be associated with the}} Imperial power was not unknown in the case of ambitious Greek families. His origins could have <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> in the eastern provinces where Greek, rather than Latin, was the dominant culture. Somewhere in Asia (i.e. the region that roughly coincides with modern Turkey) is a possibility. However, as will be seen, his early career supports the notion that he may have had some connection to the Severan Dynasty, in particular the [...] "Syrian Princesses". This could indicate that his origins were in the Oriens - i.e. the modern Levant /Arabia.|$|E
2500|$|McCann {{claims to}} have no {{knowledge}} of Stanley or Maidenhead when Stanley asks him [...] "Ever <b>been</b> <b>anywhere</b> near Maidenhead? [...] There's a Fuller's teashop.

I was born and brought up there. I lived well away from the main road" [...] (51); yet Goldberg later names both businesses that Stanley used to frequent connecting Goldberg and possibly also McCann to Maidenhead: [...] "A little Austin, tea in Fuller's a library book from Boots, and I'm satisfied" [...] (70). Of course, both Stanley and Goldberg could just be inventing these apparent [...] "reminiscences" [...] as they both appear to have invented other details about their lives earlier, and here Goldberg could conveniently be lifting details from Stanley's earlier own mention of them, which he has heard; as Merritt observes, the factual basis for such apparent correspondences in the dialogue uttered by Pinter's characters remains ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.|$|E
