5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E
5|$|Cycling is an {{increasingly}} popular {{way to get}} around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision. But in the central parts (The City & City of Westminster) are common cyclists a rare thing to see. Only messenger with helmets and sport <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> seen there. There is a general lack of bike roads. Further out from the city centre is however lots of bikes parked around tube stations and other.|$|E

50|$|In Zec, quad <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> {{another popular}} {{activity}} in summer. The extensive network of logging roads passable by mountain <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> connected to organized trails.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{mountain}} <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> generally {{prohibited by}} the FLTC. In state parks, mountain <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> allowed only if specifically {{designated by the}} NYS OPRHP. In state forest and reforestation areas, mountain <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> allowed unless the NYS DEC has specifically posted otherwise. Similar disparate rules apply to possession of firearms, both long guns and licensed handguns.|$|R

25|$|All {{modes of}} transit in Metro Vancouver carry bicycles. Most buses {{operated}} by TransLink have bike racks, supplied by SportWorks. <b>Bikes</b> <b>are</b> allowed on SeaBus. <b>Bikes</b> <b>are</b> also allowed on SkyTrain, except during weekday rush {{hours in the}} peak direction of travel (inbound to Vancouver in the morning rush hour and outbound from Vancouver in the evening rush hour).|$|E
25|$|Little 500 <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> rather distinctive. They {{are single}} gear, coaster brake racing bicycles. There are two {{different}} versions of the bike: the men's and the women's. The only difference between the men's and women's bikes is the frame size; the men race on a 56 cm frame, the women's <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> built on 54 cm frames. Men and women race on the same 46x18 gearing. Every year {{a new version of the}} bike is made and then two are given to each team. The cost of the <b>bikes</b> <b>are,</b> for the most part, covered in the team registration fees and race sponsorship money. At the end of the season, team's are given the option to keep their bikes or to sell them back to IUSF. The used <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> then kept at the track and are rented out by those teams that do not have old bikes.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, over 40 {{bicycles}} {{were stolen}} from Baltimore Recreation and Parks department's bike-share program. The <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> stolen during the city's Ride Around Reservoir program in Druid Hill Park. The <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> set up to be lent out {{when a group of}} youths took them. The cost of replacing the stolen <b>bikes</b> <b>is</b> devastating to the program, which operates completely on donations.|$|R
5000|$|Roehr {{introduced}} the V-Roehr production motorcycle in March 2007. The <b>bike</b> <b>was</b> {{to be powered}} by a 180 hp supercharged Harley Davidson 1250 cc [...] "Revolution" [...] engine. Production of the first 50 <b>bikes</b> <b>was</b> scheduled to begin in 2008.|$|R

25|$|Wheelbase {{has a major}} {{influence}} on the longitudinal stability of a bike, along with the height of the center of mass of the combined bike and rider. Short <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> much more suitable for performing wheelies and stoppies.|$|E
50|$|PJD {{would wind up}} repeating as Build-Off Champions, {{with their}} bike {{inspired}} by classic cars winning the fan voting. The <b>bike</b> <b>was</b> highlighted {{by the use of}} an actual grill from a '39 Chevrolet, around which the rest of the <b>bike</b> <b>was</b> built.|$|R
50|$|Bicycle Victoria offered {{entrants}} of the 2004 Great Victorian Bike Ride a bike, free of charge, if they registered {{early for}} the event. The <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> imported and distributed by Bicycle Victoria. The <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> available fully assembled, or partially assembled in a box.|$|R
50|$|The Melon Slice folding {{system is}} {{relatively}} conventional and straightforward. First, it folds at the pedals {{and then at}} the handlebar stem. The <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> then folded {{in the middle of the}} top tube so that the two halves come together. With practice, the <b>bike</b> can <b>be</b> folded in about 15 seconds. The folded size of the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> 34”L x 27”H x 13”W.|$|R

25|$|Going through dense backmarker traffic, Schwantz catches Lawson. Both <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> squirming and bucking under acceleration. In Lawson’s draft on the straight, Schwantz {{pops out}} and passes on the brakes. Schwantz shows he can slide {{with the best}} of them as he gets the {{back-end}} spinning on the exits.|$|E
50|$|The public <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} {{available from}} 6am to 9pm. However, as of September 2015, {{the time for}} borrowing a <b>bike</b> has <b>been</b> extended to midnight.|$|R
50|$|If {{the wheels}} are not aligned in the {{direction}} of travel when traction is suddenly restored and the rear tire stops slipping, then a highside is likely, depending on how much the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> turned across the direction of travel and how fast the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> traveling when the rear tire stops slipping. If the angle is high enough, the <b>bike</b> <b>is</b> moving fast enough, and the rear tire slips and regains traction suddenly enough, the rider has no chance of preventing a highside.|$|R
50|$|Mountain <b>biking</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} in the park.|$|R
25|$|The ride is also {{completed}} on {{all manner of}} bicycles. Most riders use regular road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, and touring bikes of varying standard, quality, and age. Some less typical <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> also used, including recumbent bikes and tricycles, tandem bikes, folding bicycles, children in bicycle trailers and on trailer bikes, and even occasional unicycles, scooter style footbikes, and custom made bicycles.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay in Jet Moto 3 {{differs from}} that of a {{traditional}} racing game with cars or motorcycles. Players instead control hoverbikes which sit close to the ground and can be ridden over land and water. Most of the courses in the game are designed {{to take advantage of this}} ability. Characters are split into teams, and <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Doritos, similar to real-life sponsored racing.|$|E
25|$|An in 2014 inaugurated bike sharing system covers {{mostly the}} Chengguan District with 377 stations. The system had a {{successful}} start {{and the number of}} stations is being expanded. However, vandalism proved to be a problem, with 600 (out of a total of 6,500) bikes a year not being returned to the stations. As <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> not rented out anymore late at night, people reportedly outed their frustration on the bikes in the case they were too late to rent one.|$|E
50|$|Two R90S bikes placed {{first and}} second at the very first AMA Superbike race at Daytona International Speedway in 1976.

25|$|The Washington Avenue Bridge carries County Road 122 and the METRO Green Line {{light rail}} across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota and connects the East Bank and West Bank {{portions}} of the University of Minnesota's main campus. The bridge has two decks, with the lower deck designated for motor vehicle traffic and light rail trains and the upper deck used for pedestrians and bicycles (lanes specifically for <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> on the north side). It is a utilitarian structure with simple architecture, but it has cultural significance because thousands of students, faculty, staff, and visitors walk across it every day.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017, Beijing saw over 200,000 dockless shared bikes {{from various}} {{companies}} entered service. Near {{the end of}} 2017 it has grown to 2.35 million for-hire bikes from 15 companies. The <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> accessible via an app, and cost 1 RMB per hour plus a refundable damage deposit of 299 RMB. This {{is on top of}} the existing municipal run dock based bike network with 86,000 bikes. The Beijing municipal government has pledged to improve management and parking availability in response to the rapidly growing fleets of dockless bikes shares. Beijing cycling mode share increased from 5.5% to 11.6% after the arrival of these dockless bike systems.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for getting {{around on the}} dry lake. Mountain <b>bikes</b> <b>are</b> generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E
50|$|Late in 2008 Cateye Co Ltd. stopped all {{international}} {{distribution of the}} fitness line. Game <b>Bike</b> Production <b>was</b> then done by Source Distributors Inc. out of Dallas, Texas. Source Distributors produced the bike and made modifications to the unit to improve the controller serviceability. The Game <b>Bike</b> <b>is</b> a popular product within the school and YMCA markets. Thousands of <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> sold in {{since the start of}} 2003.|$|R
50|$|The range {{included}} track bikes, road bikes, touring bikes, tandems and off-road bikes. Unless {{built for}} demonstration of shows, all <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> {{tailored to the}} specific requirements of the customer. Technical specialisms were developed that could be applied including: Fittings in the down tube and cross tube that enabled the complete cycle to be dismantled, {{and the application of}} Rohloff internal geared hubs. In the last year of production a prototype Gates belt driven <b>bike</b> <b>was</b> made to explore the potential of the application; though no customer <b>bikes</b> <b>were</b> completed.|$|R
