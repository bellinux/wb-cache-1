25|$|In 1930 the {{vestibule}} was added. The mikvah was {{built as a}} community project a decade later. Further renovations in the 1990s added <b>beadboard</b> siding inside, replaced the ark and put in new windows. At that time some of the original interior paintings were painted over as well, although they are preserved in photographs.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical <b>beadboard</b> and molded chair rail complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between {{the walls and}} ceiling. The slip pews are made of oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors {{in the center and}} side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.|$|E
25|$|On {{the east}} facade {{is the main}} entrance, flanked by pointed-arch tripane windows in wooden surrounds. A small {{projecting}} wooden vestibule shelters the main entrance. It has a gabled roof with the same pitch as the main roof. The gently arched exterior entrance is built of an H-shaped bent with <b>beadboard</b> siding on the exterior, chamfered edges {{on the inside and}} intricate quatrefoil sawn tracery in the gable field above. Lancet windows are on either side. Above it is an octagonal oculus.|$|E
500|$|Hall's {{approach}} {{was to create}} peaceful compositions that evoked classicism, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences {{to take in the}} action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by [...] "painting in" [...] the blacks and whites, before adding fill light, which he reflected from <b>beadboard</b> or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a [...] in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T-stop (T1.9); given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect {{may not have been the}} best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35â€“anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.|$|E
50|$|Both {{floors of}} the 1905 {{building}} were subdivided into four classrooms, off a central hallway. Plastered walls had <b>beadboard</b> wainscotting {{at the height of}} the window sills. Ceilings were also <b>beadboard.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Rigid {{cellular}} polystyrene (RCPS). This includes EPS, MEPS, XPS, <b>beadboard,</b> blueboard, and Styrofoam.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>beadboard</b> wainscoting {{and walls}} of exposed brick, which will {{eventually}} be covered with fresh plaster or drywall. On the ceiling are dark wooden planks supported by hammerbeams. The pews are arranged in a gentle arc with center and side aisles.|$|E

50|$|The former Village School {{is located}} in Unity's central village, {{on the north side}} of School Street, west of its {{junction}} with United States Route 202. It is a single story wood frame structure, with a roughly cruciform shape set on a foundation that is built from a combination of stone, brick, and concrete block. Its main block is oriented east-west, with a hipped roof and a gabled front projection that houses the entry and the building's restrooms. The front-facing gable is fully pedimented, and it and the main eave are studded with decorative brackets. The gable pediment is filled with a Queen Anne style floral decorative pattern. The entrance is sheltered by a hip-roofed hood that is supported by large decorative brackets. The interior is divided into three classrooms, accessed via central hall. The walls are finished in vertical <b>beadboard</b> wainscoting, with either plaster of horizontal <b>beadboard</b> above.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{the station}} retains its {{original}} layout {{except for one}} closet that was built for electrical control equipment. Both the waiting room and the baggage room are now given over to museum displays. They are sided in narrow <b>beadboard</b> yellow pine, laid both horizontally and vertically, up to the vaulted ceiling. The floors have three-inch (7.5 cm) tongue and groove planking.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is an open hall with a small separated kitchen area in the southwest corner. The ceiling is finished in tin, a replacement (at unknown date) for the original plaster ceiling. The floor is narrow hardwood, and the walls are lined with <b>beadboard</b> wainscoting. There is a raised platform in the northeast corner, which once held a wood stove.|$|E
50|$|The schoolhouse is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front gable roof, {{weatherboard}} siding, minimal exterior ornamentation, and {{a foundation}} of stone piers. It is set on a large (more than 5 acre) parcel of land {{on the east side}} of Point Road, which also includes a c. 1980s private residence. Its main facade has a centered doorway with a transom window, and an opening for a small sash window in the gable above. The side elevations have two pairs each of sash windows, and the rear elevation has a window in the gable, and a doorway leading into an attached shed-roof garage. The main entrance opens into a small vestibule area, which has doors to either side leading into the classroom space. That space has vertical <b>beadboard</b> wainscoting, with horizontal <b>beadboard</b> paneling above and on the ceiling. The floors are maple, a replacement for original pine floors. The space includes original fixtures, including desks, benches, and electric lighting dating to 1937.|$|E
50|$|Both entrances {{lead into}} small vestibules, where {{another set of}} double wooden paneled doors opens into the auditorium, a single open space with curved pews divided into three sets of rows by side aisles, and {{straight}} pews at the rear. The walls are sided in <b>beadboard</b> to the chair rail and plaster above. The ceiling follows the gable from the plate but is flat.|$|E
50|$|New Zion AME Zion Church is a {{historic}} African Methodist church at the junction of Myrtle and Neely Streets in Warren, Arkansas. Built in 1927, it has a vernacular styling that includes Gothic and Romanesque Revival details, included castellated towers with parapet, and an arched entryway. Its interior fixtures, including pews, chancel railing, and <b>beadboard</b> tray ceiling, are in original condition, but the windows have been modernized.|$|E
5000|$|Today, Field Manor {{is owned}} by Field Manor Foundation, a private 501(c)3 {{foundation}} created by Alma Clyde Field, the last Field family member to reside in the house. The homestead {{is open to the}} public as a historic house museum, having undergone two years of preservation and restoration. Everything in the house is original, from the furniture collection to the <b>beadboard</b> walls. The site also serves as an event venue.http://www.fieldmanor.org ...|$|E
50|$|Original <b>beadboard</b> {{paneling}} {{remains on}} the second story, along with the original window surrounds and their rosette corners. The original wooden trusses are still visible in the factory wing, {{making it possible to}} see that its third floor is carries by suspension rods from the roof trusses. The stable has been extensively modified after its original use was discontinued, but it retains its original stair as well and some of its woodwork.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical <b>beadboard</b> and molded chair rail complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between {{the walls and}} ceiling. The slip pews are made of oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors {{in the center and}} side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.|$|E
50|$|On {{the east}} facade {{is the main}} entrance, flanked by pointed-arch tripane windows in wooden surrounds. A small {{projecting}} wooden vestibule shelters the main entrance. It has a gabled roof with the same pitch as the main roof. The gently arched exterior entrance is built of an H-shaped bent with <b>beadboard</b> siding on the exterior, chamfered edges {{on the inside and}} intricate quatrefoil sawn tracery in the gable field above. Lancet windows are on either side. Above it is an octagonal oculus.|$|E
50|$|A {{platform}} at {{the west}} end is raised 20 inches (50 cm) {{off the floor and}} faced in <b>beadboard</b> as well. A wooden rail with velvet curtain sets off the edges. It has a lectern in the center and space for a choir at the east. Its furniture, apparently original, includes carved Eastlake chairs and a communion table, in addition to a piano and organ. To the west is the community room, a large open space with kitchen and bathrooms partitioned off at the end.|$|E
50|$|Inside, the {{building}} has been extensively modified from its original plan both during its days as a factory and afterwards for conversion into apartments and a library. Some original features remain in the main block. Most significant {{among them is the}} stairway at the main entrance. It has pine <b>beadboard</b> walls, chamfered newel posts topped by balls and molded railings. The third-floor door has its original window with 27 small glass panes and three large ones amid three wooden panels, topped by a three-light transom.|$|E
5000|$|Grips {{also set}} [...] "passive fill" [...] {{which is a}} term for the {{reflected}} light that is [...] "bounced" [...] back onto a subject on the fill or non-key light side. The first choice for most film-makers' fill is a product known in the US as <b>beadboard</b> and called [...] "poly", short for polystyrene, in Europe. It is rigid insulation made for the construction trade, but {{was adopted by the}} film trade because of its [...] "true-white" [...] color and [...] "soft" [...] bounce.|$|E
50|$|The Sandy Pond School {{is located}} at the {{northwest}} corner of the threeway junction of Westford, Sandy Pond, and Willow Streets in eastern Ayer. It is a single-story brick building, with a small shingled wood-frame ell attached. It is covered by a gabled roof, and is oriented facing roughly south. Its main facade is symmetrical, with sash windows flanking the entrance, and another sash window in the gable above. The entrance is recessed under a segmented arch. The interior has tongue-and-groove flooring, <b>beadboard,</b> wainscoting with blackboards and plastering above.|$|E
5000|$|Molded {{expanded}} polystyrene, {{also known}} as MEPS, EPS, or <b>beadboard,</b> consists of many tiny foam beads molded and pressed together. EPS is manufactured in low-density and high-density versions. Low-density EPS is relatively inexpensive, resistant {{to the effects of}} moisture, and can be used underground. High-density EPS is even more moisture-resistant, and is manufactured for use on exterior foundation walls and burial against footings, if the soil is relatively dry. EPS typically uses pentane as a blowing agent, avoiding the high global warming potential of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, as well as the ozone depletion potential of CFC and HCFCs.|$|E
50|$|Double walnut doors {{lead to the}} interior, {{with much}} of its {{original}} Eastlake style woodwork. Most prominent among this is the main staircase, also of walnut, with turned balusters. A large two-tone newel has a niche for a gas light and intricate carvings in a floral pattern. The gas fireplace has a walnut frontispiece with more floral carvings, geometric forms and an intricate cast iron grill. The inside of the front bay, in the living room, has louvered shutters and decorative surrounds. That room, the central hall and stair hall all have vertical <b>beadboard</b> wainscoting. Walnut sliding doors separate the living and dining room.|$|E
5000|$|By 1982, the {{building}} {{was used as an}} antique store and no longer served as a railway station. [...] During {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, the City of Magnolia acquired the property for use as a city hall. [...] Because of the structure's age and deterioration of the foundation, complete exterior restoration was required, but the original windows and siding were retained for historical integrity. [...] New exterior doors were installed, and the freight doors were removed and were replaced with windows. For the interior, original doors, wood flooring, and <b>beadboard</b> walls were retained and restored. Renovation also included new plumbing and electrical wiring.|$|E
50|$|The Brock Hill Schoolhouse {{stands in}} a rural area of western Newbury, {{on the west side of}} North Road. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled cedar shingle roof, {{clapboard}} siding, and a modern concrete foundation which replaced an original fieldstone foundation. The main facade is unadorned except for a central entrance and a flagpole, mounted above the entrance. The sides and rear each have two window bays. The interior has a small coatroom, which is separated from the class room by a reproduction of an original divider wall. The interior walls are all finished in <b>beadboard</b> with a chair rail, painted in latex paint. A 19th-century wood stove stands in the center of the classroom.|$|E
50|$|The West Haven Baptist Church {{stands in}} an open field {{on the west side}} of Book Road, just south of its {{junction}} with Main Road, the principal east-west route through the rural community. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a mortared limestone foundation. A gabled vestibule projects from the front (east-facing) facade, with a center entrance flanked by Gothic arched windows. A squat two-stage square tower rises, straddling the line between the main block and vestibule, with a louvered belfry as the second stage, and a flat top above. The vestibule interior is finished in <b>beadboard,</b> while the main sanctuary has vertical matchboard below a chair rail, and horizontal matchboard above. Lines of stencilwork adorn the walls.|$|E

40|$|House mice (Mus musculus) were {{introduced}} into 20, 4 -inch thick insulated panels and provided unlimited {{food and water}} for six months. Mouse populations increased 3 -to 4 -fold inside the insulated panels. Aluminum foil vapor barriers were severely damaged by mice and in all cases, reduced to {{less than half of}} their original mass. All of the insulation materials tested (insulation board, fiberglass batt, rockwool, <b>beadboard,</b> and vermiculite) sustained significant levels of damage as measured by increased thermal conductance. Researchers have yet to discover an insulative material that is not susceptible to house mouse damage. Producers should use construction techniques that exclude house mice and other rodents from insulated walls. In addition, house mouse populations in and around buildings should be controlled to minimize economic damage...|$|E
