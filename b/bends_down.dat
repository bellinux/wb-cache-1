5|$|That evening, Anya {{falls asleep}} on Giles' sofa while Spike takes a mugful of {{blood from the}} refrigerator. Xander enters Giles' {{apartment}} as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> to pick up something that he dropped {{in front of the}} sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E
5|$|On {{a trip to}} {{the bird}} sanctuary, the Simpson family discovers that a {{speedway}} raceway built around the sanctuary is opening that day, to Lisa's dismay. The family watches from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. The cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but he <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls {{over the edge of the}} bleachers to her death on the parking lot.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

25|$|On {{the opening}} {{night of the}} tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom the {{beginning}} of the show features the album cover artwork projected on a giant screen. The silhouette of Fogerty <b>bends</b> <b>down,</b> picks up a guitar from the corn, and puts it on. As the lights come on it is revealed that it is really John Fogerty playing the opening song River is Waiting high in the air.|$|E
25|$|From the 15th {{century in}} the Netherlands onwards, it was more usual to show the non-Biblical subject of the Holy Family resting on the journey, the Rest on the Flight to Egypt, often {{accompanied}} by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent, James the Brother of the Lord, interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage. The background to these scenes usually (until the Council of Trent tightened up on such additions to scripture) includes a number of apocryphal miracles, and gives {{an opportunity for the}} emerging genre of landscape painting. In the Miracle of the corn the pursuing soldiers interrogate peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully say it was when they were sowing their wheat seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the Miracle of the idol a pagan statue falls from its plinth as the infant Jesus passes by, and a spring gushes up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In further, less commonly seen, legends a group of robbers abandon their plan to rob the travellers, and a date palm tree <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> to allow them to pluck the fruit.|$|E
500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> {{to pick up the}} first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E

500|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Rumpelstiltskin's (Carlyle) backstory is revealed. During the ogre wars, the {{children}} {{that live in the}} Frontlands are conscripted to military service at age 14. The Duke's men gather young soldiers with the help of [...] "The Dark One" [...] who possesses great magical power. Rumpelstiltskin's son, Baelfire (Dylan Schmid), will turn 14 in three days and he is desperate to keep his child out of battle. As father and son flee from the village, they are confronted by the Duke's men. They mock Rumpelstiltskin for running away when he was supposed to serve, and reveal that his cowardice caused his wife to leave him. Rumpelstiltskin begs for his son's life but he has nothing to offer but fealty. The Duke's chief soldier commands Rumpelstiltskin to kiss his boot, but when the desperate man <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> the soldier kicks him to the ground. The old beggar (Brad Dourif) {{by the side of the}} road sees this and offers the pair assistance since they spared him a coin. The beggar tells Rumpelstiltskin a secret, the Duke possesses a dagger that allows him to command The Dark One and all his power. If Rumpelstiltskin steals the dagger, he will control The Dark One himself. If he kills The Dark One with the dagger, he will possess his magic. Rumpelstiltskin sets fire to the Duke's castle (in a parallel with Mr. Gold's actions) and steals the dagger which reads the name of The Dark One, [...] "Zoso".|$|E
2500|$|Tevez {{is known}} for his tango flare goal {{celebrations}} ever since playing for Boca Juniors, as well with Corinthians of Brazil. During his time at Manchester United, he would hide a baby's dummy in his shorts and put it in his mouth after scoring a goal as a commemorative gesture to his baby daughter. After his move to Manchester City, Tevez often performed a dance where he puts his hands together, <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> and rocks his body; this dance has been named after him as the [...] "Tevez Dance".|$|E
2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime. Usually 1 to 5 flowers are produced at a time.|$|E
