40|$|Hydraulic {{properties}} {{affect the}} shear strength of unsaturated soils {{in terms of}} suction, predicted {{as a function of}} water volume in the pores. In complex pore geometries, such as soils with <b>bimodal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions,</b> suction effects on shear behavior are poorly understood. This paper presents an analytical approach to define how a bimodal suction stress originates in such soils, which are conceptually divided into micro and macrostructures due to aggregation {{of a wide range of}} particle sizes. The results were compared with data from the literature for other soils with aggregated macrostructure or with a prevailing coarse fraction. A physically based dependence of soil shear behavior on the bimodal hydraulic behavior was observable with the extension of the suction stress theory to a bimodal soil hydraulic response in agreement with the suction and moisture change. Depending on the soil type and the range of suctions investigated, the micro and macrostructures should prevail affecting the mechanical soil response subject to environmental loading, such as rainfall events. From a practical point of view, taking into account the bimodal structure network should be fundamental in the set-up of proper prediction models for shallow landslides induced by rainfall...|$|R

At first, a reaction model that simultaneously {{takes into account}} the non-uniformity in the solid microstructure and the sintering phenomenon is developed.

This model is validated with experimental data on the redox reactions of copper-based oxygen carriers, in which the sintering phenomenon has a remarkable importance. In addition, it was proposed a mathematical expression for the aggregation frequency that depends on physical meaningful variables and can be used to identify the operating mechanism in sintering. Afterwards, another model for the sintering of the CaO under N 2 atmosphere is proposed.

The characteristic particle morphology of the starting materials was retained after the transformation. Analysis of the products by gas sorption and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed hybrid pore structures, which featured – depending on the degree of transformation – variable contributions from the original and the newly introduced pore systems. In the case of SBA- 15, it was found that a high degree of transformation leads to a seemingly complete conversion of the original pores with a diameter of 7. 1 nm to pores with a diameter of 4. 0 nm. The SAXS pattern of the product shows additional peaks that can be assigned to the original SBA- 15 pore spacing. Similarly, a cubic phase could be observed in the samples prepared by pseudomorphic transformation of SBA- 16, despite an almost complete conversion of the SBA- 16 cavities.

The various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET), FT-IR, and 13 C and 29 Si CPMAS NMR spectroscopies were used to characterize the resulting structure of functionalized PMO mesostructures. Results obtained from XRD, TEM, and BET analysis clearly showed that the structural and pore arrangement of the functionalized PMOs were found to be dependent on the used concentration of BSPUCh. The functional PMOs showed well ordered mesophases when BSPUCh concentration was ≤ 9 wt% in the initial mixtures, whereas higher concentration of the BSPUCh always produced disordered hierarchical mesostructures with <b>bimodal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions.</b> The incorporation of BSPUCh also reduces the surface area, <b>pore</b> volume, <b>pore</b> <b>size,</b> and <b>pore</b> wall thickness of the functionalized nanostructures, indicating that the BSPUCh is incorporated in the pore channels of the PMOs.

For this purpose experiments have been performed using ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, and ethyl isovalerate as adsorbates and the microporous-mesoporous activated carbons Filtrasorb 400, Norit ROW 0. 8 and Norit ROX 0. 8 as adsorbents. The repulsive contribution to the pore potential is incorporated through a Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential model, and the bulk-liquid phase non-ideality through the UNIFAC activity coefficient model.

We describe the methods with which such water desaturation processes in rock materials can be quantified. The water retention characteristic theta(psi) of crystalline rock samples was determined with a pressure membrane apparatus. The negative water potential, identical to the capillary pressure, psi, below the tensiometric range (psi < - 0. 1 MPa) can be measured with thermocouple psychrometers (TP), and the volumetric water contents, theta, by means of time domain reflectometry (TDR). These standard methods were adapted for measuring the water status in a macroscopically unfissured granodiorite with a total porosity of approximately 0. 01. The measured water retention curve of granodiorite samples from the Grimsel test site (central Switzerland) exhibits a shape which is typical for <b>bimodal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions.</b> The measured bimodality is probably an artifact of a large surface ratio of solid/voids. The thermocouples were installed without a metallic screen using the cavity drilled into the granodiorite as a measuring chamber. The water potentials observed in a cylindrical granodiorite monolith ranged between - 0. 1 and - 3. 0 MPa; those near the wall in a ventilated tunnel between - 0. 1 and - 2. 2 MPa.

In our new invention, hydrothermally formed core-shell nanoparticles underwent KOH activation to create micro- and mesopores forming porous hydrochar outer-shell on Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles core for improving capacitance performance. These porous structures eventually could act as potential electrolyte-accessible pathways {{which led to the}} contribution of pseudocapacitance connecting from the core (reaction at Fe 3 O 4 /electrolyte interface). Based on our electrochemical capacitive performance evaluation, p-Fe/HC nanocomposite electrode which comprised of 5 wt% Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (± 45 nm) could reach the specific capacitance of 259. 3 F g- 1 with a superior wide potential window of 1. 8 V in 1 mol L- 1 Na 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. By comparing KOH activation of pristine porous hydrochar and p-Fe/HC, an exceptionally high specific surface area (1712. 8 m 2 g- 1) with <b>bimodal</b> type <b>pores</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> was observed. In addition, p-Fe/HC displayed a maximum energy density of 29. 2 W h kg- 1 at a power density of 1. 2 kW kg- 1, which is about 26 % higher energy density than that of pristine porous hydrochar. In this manner, the synthesized porous hydrochar outer-shell could provide additional electrochemical stability to Fe 3 O 4 core, preventing volume change at high current loading as well as conductive coating to enhance pseudocapacitance performance. Consequently, a symmetrical nanocomposite cell was successfully designed, with high capacitance retention of 95. 1 % after 5000 cycles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Synthesis of {{mesoporous}} {{materials with}} a <b>bimodal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> {{has always been}} of great importance for size-selective separation process. Especially, ordered mesoporous cubic MCM- 48 with its highly interwoven and branched pore structure, is a potential separation material in applications similar to which zeolites are now being used. This material could have specific technological advantages because of the 3 -D channel network of MCM- 48. We report that by post-synthesis alumination of siliceous MCM- 48 containing organic templates with sodium aluminate solution, a <b>bimodal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of MCM- 48 is obtained. In particular, it was found from N 2 adsorption−desorption measurements that MCM- 48 obtained had 26 Å and 38 Å dual narrow <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions.</b> From 27 Al solid-state MAS NMR measurements, {{it is confirmed that}} the aluminium is in the framework structure of mesoporous MCM- 48...|$|R
