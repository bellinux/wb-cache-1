50|$|<b>Biting</b> <b>Stonecrop</b> (Sedum acre) {{contains}} high {{quantities of}} piperidine alkaloids (namely (+)-sedridine, (−)-sedamine, sedinone and isopelletierine), which {{give it a}} sharp, peppery, acrid taste and make it somewhat toxic.|$|E

50|$|Sedum acre, {{commonly}} known as the goldmoss stonecrop, mossy stonecrop, goldmoss sedum, <b>biting</b> <b>stonecrop,</b> and wallpepper, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to Europe, but also naturalised in North America, Japan and New Zealand.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Biting</b> <b>stonecrop</b> is a low-growing {{plant that}} cannot compete with more vigorous, fast-growing species.

50|$|Other {{parts of}} the lowland (on the south and north east slopes) are used as pasture.

50|$|<b>Biting</b> <b>stonecrop</b> spreads when {{allowed to}} do so, but is easily controlled, being shallow-rooted. It is used in hanging baskets and {{container}} gardens, as a trailing accent, in borders, or as groundcover. This plant grows as a creeping ground cover, often in dry sandy soil, {{but also in the}} cracks of masonry. It grows well in poor soils, sand, rock gardens, and rich garden soil, under a variety of light levels. It does not thrive in dense shade with limited water.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Biting</b> <b>stonecrop</b> is a tufted {{perennial}} herb {{that forms}} mat-like stands some 5 to 12 cm tall. Much {{of the year}} the stems are short, semi prostrate and densely clad in leaves. At the flowering time in June and July, the stems lengthen and are erect, somewhat limp and often pinkish-brown with the leaves further apart. The leaves are alternate, fleshy and shortly cylindrical with a rounded tip. They are also sometimes tinged with red. The starry flowers form a three to six-flowered cyme. The calyx has five fleshy sepals fused at the base, the corolla consists of five regular bright yellow petals, there are ten stamens, a separate gynoecium and five pistils. The fruit is five united, many-seeded follicles. The leaves contain an acrid fluid that can cause skin rashes.|$|E
