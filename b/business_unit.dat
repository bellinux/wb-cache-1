The company opened new offices throughout the U.S. in the 1930s, and had 19 sales offices {{by the end of}} the decade. A controlling interest in the company was acquired in 1939 by Senior Richard Hallam Grant, ending the Reynolds family ownership. He became the company's president in 1941. A new printing facility was built in 1948 in Celina, Ohio, and another in 1953 in Dallas, Texas, in addition to the one built in Los Angeles in 1928. Reynolds became a public company in 1961. In the 1960s, Reynolds opened new printing facilities in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Canada. In 1963, Reynolds expanded into Canada through the acquisition of the automotive <b>business</b> <b>unit</b> of Windsor Office Supply, forming Reynolds and Reynolds (Canada) Ltd.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{acquisition}} of the chain by Pillsbury in 1969, Burger King opened its first Canadian restaurant in Windsor, Ontario, in 1969. Other international locations followed soon after: Oceania in 1971 with its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's, and Europe in 1975 with a restaurant in Madrid, Spain. Beginning in 1982, BK and its franchisees began operating stores in several East Asian countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. Due to high competition, all of the Japanese locations were closed in 2001; however, BK reentered the Japanese market in June 2007. BK's Central and South American operations began in Mexico in the late 1970s, and by the early 1980s it was operating locations in Caracas, Venezuela; Santiago, Chile; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. While Burger King lags behind McDonald's in international locations by over 12,000 stores, by 2008 it had managed to become the largest chain in several countries, including Mexico and Spain. The company divides its international operations into three segments: The Middle East, Europe and Africa division (EMEA), Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). In each of these regions, Burger King has established several subsidiaries to develop strategic partnerships and alliances to expand into new territories. In its EMEA group, Burger King's Switzerland-based subsidiary Burger King Europe GmbH {{is responsible for the}} licensing and development of BK franchises in those regions. In the APAC region, the Singapore-based BK AsiaPac, Pte. Ltd. <b>business</b> <b>unit</b> handles franchising for East Asia, the Asian subcontinent and all Oceanic territories.

40|$|In product {{development}} organizations, {{the front end}} of {{product development}} is usually confined to planning within <b>business</b> <b>units</b> for product families and individual products. This can pose a problem for businesses, as individual <b>business</b> <b>units</b> and development teams do not think in terms of the big picture of the company. <b>Business</b> <b>units</b> are responsible for only their market and product strategies, and are relatively unconcerned about those of other <b>business</b> <b>units.</b> Because of this, there is the potential for product offerings across <b>business</b> <b>units</b> to overlap in the marketplace, thereby wasting development resources and confusing customers with multiple offerings of similar value propositions. There is also the potential to have gaps in the marketplace, where no <b>business</b> <b>units</b> have product offerings, which can be a prime niche for competitors to introduce products to gain a market foothold and precious market share. The purpose of this research was to “extend ” {{the front end of}} the development process upward across all <b>business</b> <b>units</b> in order to understand the market relationships across the entire product-offering portfolio. This allows the company to see how its products are related across markets, and to observe the strengths and weaknesses in it...|$|R

40|$|Most {{research}} of post-acquisition integration examines integration of individual <b>business</b> <b>units.</b> The research pays {{less attention to}} corporate level integration processes, by which we mean the standardization of integration routines and synchronization of integration activities across a firm's <b>business</b> <b>units.</b> We argue that corporate level acquisition activities and post-acquisition integration processes strongly influence long term corporate performance, particularly as a firm which comprises interdependent <b>business</b> <b>units</b> becomes geographically diffuse. Acquisitions tend to increase system diversity and goal diversity across <b>business</b> <b>units.</b> Some goal diversity is beneficial, but excessive goal diversity {{and the existence of}} system diversity can reduce long run corporate performance by requiring greater managerial effort and increasing the opportunity cost of managerial efforts. The negative effects become stronger as a firm becomes geographically diffuse or if <b>business</b> <b>units</b> are interdependent. Firms that employ active corporate level integration processes – particularly firms that acquire frequently and have interdependent <b>business</b> <b>units</b> – can enhance the benefits and eliminate some of the problems of diversity. Many studies have examined post-acquisition integration. Questions include how acquiring firm...|$|R
