50|$|In 1883, Cutler gave {{a series}} of lectures {{throughout}} backwoods Vermont; her influence led to {{the founding of the}} Vermont Woman Suffrage Association. On December 13, 1884 Cutler published in the Woman's Journal a eulogy for her longtime friend, Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{speech was}} briefly {{reported}} in two contemporary newspapers, and {{a transcript of}} the speech {{was published in the}} Anti-Slavery Bugle on June 21, 1851. It received wider publicity in 1863 during the American Civil War when Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> published a different version, one which became known as Ain't I a Woman? because of its oft-repeated question. This later, better known and more widely available version has been the one referenced by most historians.|$|R
50|$|Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> (October 12, 1808November 10, 1884) was {{a leading}} American reformer, feminist and abolitionist. She worked closely with Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along with other leaders of the early women's rights {{movement}} in the United States. She {{was among the first}} to champion voting rights for all citizens without regard to race or gender and was a particularly outspoken supporter of giving newly freed African American women the franchise during Reconstruction, along with African American men who had formerly been slaves.|$|R
2500|$|Twelve years later, in May 1863, Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> {{published}} {{a very different}} transcription. In it, she gave Truth many of the speech characteristics of Southern slaves, and she included new material that Robinson had not reported. Gage's version of the speech was republished in 1875, 1881, and 1889, and became the historic standard. This version is known as [...] "Ain't I a Woman?" [...] after its oft-repeated refrain. Truth's style of speech was not like Southern slaves; she {{was born and raised}} in New York, and spoke only Dutch until she was nine years old.|$|R
50|$|Jones {{was known}} for her {{abolitionist}} views and traveled throughout New England, Pennsylvania, and Ohio as a lecturer in support of Garrisonian abolitionism. In 1845, she traveled to Salem, Ohio with fellow abolitionist lecturer, Abby Kelley. The pair organized anti-slavery activities and co-edited the Anti-Slavery Bugle. In 1850, she delivered a lecture before the Ohio Women’s Convention in Salem, Ohio where she highlighted people in slavery and women, wishing that the term “Women’s Rights” would go out of use and instead focus on human rights for all. In 1861, Jones successfully lobbied with Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> and Hannah Tracy Cutler for Ohio law to grant limited property rights to married women.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a year of}} study, Tracy {{accepted}} the position of matron of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum at Columbus, Ohio (now the Ohio Institution for the Deaf and Dumb). In Columbus, Tracy met Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage,</b> another abolitionist and feminist; both were interested in advancing the Free Soil Party with its anti-slavery platform. Tracy helped {{in the effort to}} elect abolitionist Salmon P. Chase to the United States Senate. Because the Deaf and Dumb Asylum allowed only one of her children to remain in residence with her, in 1849 Tracy accepted a position as principal of the [...] "female department" [...] at Columbus' new public high school. Tracy attended a Presbyterian church in Columbus.|$|R
2500|$|Antoinette Brown, Ernestine Rose, Josephine Sophia White Griffing and Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> {{spoke to}} the crowd, listing for them the {{achievements}} and progress made thus far. Lucy Stone spoke for the right of each person to establish for themselves which sphere, domestic or public, they should be active in. A heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers [...] "a few disappointed women." [...] Stone responded with a retort that became widely quoted, saying that yes, she was indeed a [...] "disappointed woman." [...] "...In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business {{of my life to}} deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart until she bows down to it no longer." ...|$|R
50|$|In late May 1856, Cutler {{was on her}} way {{to preside}} over a Woman's Temperance Convention in Chicago when she heard about arson and crimes {{committed}} in Lawrence, Kansas against abolitionists. During the successful temperance convention, Cutler conceived and planned for a Woman's Kansas Aid Convention to follow two weeks afterward, for the purpose of helping displaced citizens and preventing Kansas from becoming a slave state. Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> and Josephine Griffing assisted in the work of gathering supplies and forwarding them to those in need in Kansas. Spurred by the women's effort, Gerrit Smith, Thurlow Weed and other politically active men organized a National Kansas Aid Convention in Buffalo, New York, beginning July 10. Cutler and Gage attended; soon, the Woman's Society was consolidated into the national group.|$|R
5000|$|In June 1870, Cutler and Amelia Bloomer {{held two}} {{meetings}} in Des Moines, Iowa, {{one on the}} subject of temperance, held in the open air on land planned for a new capitol building, and a second held in a Baptist church, {{on the subject of}} women's voting rights. A woman suffrage convention was held in Mt. Pleasant in mid-June; Cutler was the leading speaker, and helped the Iowans form the Iowa Woman Suffrage Society. Later that summer, Bloomer and Cutler lectured in Oskaloosa, Iowa and sparked the formation of a woman suffrage society there, building on a much earlier visit by Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> in 1854. In December 1870, Cutler spoke several times in Lincoln, Nebraska while on her way to California. [...] "Her womanliness and logic won and convinced her hearers", but didn't result in the formation of a local woman suffrage organization until Susan B. Anthony came through later that winter.|$|R
5000|$|Although Julian's primary {{political}} {{goal in the}} 1850s and 1860s was {{the abolition}} of slavery and challenging its expansion into the western United States, he was a longtime supporter of women's enfranchisement. Julian had espoused the cause of women's suffrage as early as 1847. As Julian explained in his memoirs, [...] "the subject was first brought to my attention in a brief chapter on 'the political non-existence of woman,' in Miss Harriett Martineau’s book on 'Society In America,' which I read in 1847. She there pithily states the substance of all that has since been said respecting the logic of woman's right to the ballot, and finding myself unable to answer it, I accepted it. On recently referring to this chapter I find myself more impressed by its force than when I first read it." [...] While campaigning in 1853 Julian invited Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage</b> and Emma R. Coe, early advocates for woman suffrage, to lecture in his hometown of Centreville. Julian was also close friends with Lucretia Mott, co-organizer of the Seneca Falls Convention. Following the Civil War and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, Julian returned to the issue of woman's rights. In 1868 he proposed a constitutional amendment on women's suffrage, but it was defeated.|$|R
5000|$|In 1851, Truth joined George Thompson, an {{abolitionist}} and speaker, on {{a lecture}} tour through central and western New York State. In May, she attended the Ohio Womens Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, where she delivered her famous extemporaneous speech on womens rights, later known as [...] "Aint I a Woman." [...] Her speech demanded equal human rights {{for all women}} as well as for all blacks. The convention was organized by Hannah Tracy and Frances Dana <b>Barker</b> <b>Gage,</b> who both were present when Truth spoke. Different versions of Truths words have been recorded, with the first one published a month later in the Anti-Slavery Bugle by Rev. Marius Robinson, the newspaper owner and editor who was in the audience. Robinsons recounting of the speech included no instance of the question [...] "Aint I a Woman?" [...] Nor did any of the other newspapers reporting of her speech at the time. Twelve years later, in May 1863, Gage published another, very different, version. In it, Truths speech pattern had characteristics of Southern slaves, and the speech was vastly different then the one Robinson had reported. Gages version of the speech became the historic standard version, and is known as [...] "Aint I a Woman?" [...] because that question was repeated four times. It is highly unlikely that Truths own speech pattern was Southern in nature, as she {{was born and raised in}} New York, and she spoke only upper New York State low-Dutch until she was nine years old.|$|R
