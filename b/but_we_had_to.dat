500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do that in order for her to get out. So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{execution}} of Saddam Hussein, which Anwar had filmed {{from the internet}} from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. [...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it just gets you. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
500|$|Tibbets {{was interviewed}} {{extensively}} by Mike Harden of the Columbus Dispatch, and profiles {{appeared in the}} newspaper on anniversaries of the first dropping of an atomic bomb. In a 1975 interview he said: [...] "I'm proud that I was able to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did... I sleep clearly every night." [...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible." ...|$|E

I'm still stunned about what <b>has</b> happened, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{revitalise}} and rejuvenate the team quickly. Frank Burrows brought me to Cardiff and did everything within his power for the club. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look forward, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work quickly. That's what Frank would want." ...|$|R

500|$|In later life, he {{was known}} for his blunt and {{critical}} comments towards modern players, believing the cricket in earlier times to be superior. After Steve Waugh's team set a world record of consecutive Test victories, Harvey named three Australian teams that he thought to be superiors, saying [...] "no, far from it" [...] in response to the suggestion that Waugh's men were the best team in history. He attributed the wins to weak opponents, stating [...] "No I don't think they're up to the world standard they were years ago" [...] and that the 1980s West Indies team were far superior. He also criticised the Australian team for publicly praising the skills of their opponents, believing that they did so to aggrandise their statistical performances against teams he considered to be weak. In 2000, he was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century and criticised modern day batsmen, noting that players in earlier eras had to play on sticky wickets saying [...] "these guys who play out here are a little bit spoilt in my opinion. They play on flat wickets all the time and they grizzle if ... the ball does a little bit off the pitch, and whatever ... <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put up with that" [...] and going to assert his opinion that the current players would be no match.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, and because I don't {{feel like the}} show ever really used Ray Wise to his full potential. But {{so much of it}} was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually thought to myself, 'You know, this would be a pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, [...] "Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{his career}} at Hardin–Simmons, Turner and {{teammate}} A. J. Roy encouraged each other in practice sessions by referring to each other by nicknames. Turner was given the nickname [...] "Bulldog", and Roy was known as [...] "Tiger". Turner later recalled his college experience as follows: [...] "We got room, board and tuition, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> buy our own books and {{we were supposed to}} take care of two jobs. I had to sweep out the gym and wait tables, but I kind of farmed out the sweeping after a while. It was tough but I loved it. And the more I played, the more I liked the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the movie's {{production}} from June 2005 to July 2007, the filmmakers shot more than 250 hours of footage with exclusive, unprecedented access to Valentino and his entourage. [...] "We were let {{in to the}} inner circle, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stick it out for a long time, practically move in, to capture the truly great moments", says Tyrnauer. [...] "Valentino {{is surrounded by a}} tight-knit family of friends and employees, but, eventually, their guard came down and they forgot there was a camera crew in the room." [...] The film had its North American premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on 18 March in New York City and selected cities.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{capacity}} of 8,500, the Field House was packed. The home crowd waved U.S. flags and sang patriotic songs such as [...] "God Bless America". Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out {{on a piece of}} paper, telling them that [...] "You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours." [...] Brooks believed they could win and later said, [...] "The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get to the point to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, 'It's meant to be. This is your moment and it's going to happen.' It's kind of corny and I could see them thinking, 'Here goes Herb again....' But I believed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Army of the West {{crossed to}} the north bank of the Loire, Kléber and Marceau advised moving in several columns but Léchelle {{overruled}} them, insisting that the army move in a single column. Kléber was incredulous, writing that, [...] "it seemed most extraordinary to us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> obey". On the evening of 25 October the reckless Westermann blundered into an ambush at Croix-de-Bataille south of Laval and fell back to a fine defensive position at Entrammes. On 26 October Léchelle and {{main body of the}} 25,000-strong army reached Château-Gontier. He ordered Westermann to retreat from his position and Kléber to continue marching to Villiers-Charlemagne. Kléber and Marceau recommended that the army halt at Château-Gontier while they devised a two-pronged attack along both banks of the Mayenne River. Urged on by the representatives on mission, Léchelle and the council of war insisted on making contact with the rebels the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E
