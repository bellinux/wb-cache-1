5000|$|Hart Island is the {{location}} of a 101 acre potter's field for New York City, the largest tax-funded cemetery in the world. Burials on Hart Island began shortly after the American Civil War. Hart Island was sold to New York City in 1868. In 1869, the city then began using it as a cemetery when a 24-year-old woman named Louisa Van Slyke {{was the first person to}} be <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> the island's 45 acre public graveyard. Burials of unknowns were in single plots, and identified adults and children were <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> mass graves. [...] In 1913, adults and children under five were <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> separate mass graves. Unknowns are mostly adults. They are frequently disinterred when families are able to locate their relatives through photographs and fingerprints kept on file at the Office of the Medical Examiner. Adults are <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>trenches</b> with three sections of 48 individuals to make disinterment easier. Children, mostly infants, are rarely disinterred and are <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>trenches</b> of 1,000. [...] Hart Island's southern end continued to accommodate the living up until Phoenix House moved in 1976. In 1977, the island was vandalized and many burial records were destroyed by a fire. Remaining records were transferred to the Municipal Archives in Manhattan.|$|R

40|$|This {{version of}} the thesis only covers the {{literature}} study. The results analysis and conclusion of the thesis are confidential. Pipelines in arctic waters {{are at risk of}} being damaged by gouging ice masses. To protect these pipelines, they can be <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> <b>trenches.</b> When <b>trenching</b> <b>in</b> arctic clayey soil, sub sea permafrost can be encountered. The main objective of this research is to study the failure mechanism of frozen clay as encountered in permafrost regions. Knowledge of the cutting mechanism leads to the ability to calculate cutting forces and the specific energy required to excavate material. To find the failure mechanism and answer the research question, a cutting setup was designed and built and cutting experiments were conducted. The setup was designed, based on requirements that result from studied literature on frozen clay and cutting theories. A series of cutting experiments were conducted where a slab of frozen clay was pressed against a transparent wall and the top layer was cut off while filming the process with a high speed camera. The results are measurements of the cutting forces and observations of the failure mechanism.
