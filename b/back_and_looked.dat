500|$|The women's saw Australia beating New Zealand 24–17 in {{the first}} final of women's rugby union at the Olympic Games. New Zealand took the early lead but Australia fought <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> the most {{dangerous}} team throughout. The New Zealand defence was brutal early. Australia [...] had the ball {{for the first two}} minutes but there was just no way through. New Zealand eventually found a way through after five minutes through Kayla McAlister. Australia almost struck back two minutes later but brutal one-on-one New Zealand defence prevented the try. Finally Australia scored in the corner. The ball looked to be grassed early and then bobble over the line without Australian player Emma Tonegato being in control. But the five points went onto the scoreboard. They went on and scored again right on halftime through Evania Pelite. Australia made an awful start to the second half, kicking the ball out on the full. But they soon recovered with tries to Ellia Green and Charlotte Caslick.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Penn State {{announced}} tailback Bill Belton would not play due to illness, leaving Zach Zwinak {{to carry the}} load in the running game in the snow. Nebraska received the opening kickoff, and promptly went three-and-out, forcing a punt, which though Penn State returner Jesse Della Valle fumbled, but the Lions recovered, setting up Penn State at their own 23 yard line, but they too went three-and-out. Nebraska's second drive, however, got off to a much better start, as Ameer Abdullah rushed for a 25-yard gain on the drive's first play, but ultimately Penn State's defense held on a later third down and short play, forcing another punt. Penn State's subsequent drive showed promise, with Zwinak rushing for a few first downs (on one of which Nebraska star defensive back Cionte Evans was injured; he returned a few drives later), however they eventually punted, and for the second time, Alex Butterworth pinned them inside the 20, and Nebraska failed to execute, punting for the third time; on the punt return, Della Valle redeemed himself with a 25-yard return into Nebraska territory. Penn State took advantage of the field position, and in the waning seconds of the first quarter, Hackenberg threw a two-yard touchdown to Adam Breneman after Zwinak rushed the ball six times for a total of 27 yards; Sam Ficken missed the extra point, his first extra point miss of the season. Penn State led {{at the end of the}} first quarter, 6–0. On Nebraska's next drive, they entered with senior Ron Kellogg III at quarterback, after Armstrong's ineffectiveness. Kellogg III came in firing on all cylinders, completing his first three passes, before Abdullah ran for a first down, and then Kellogg III completed another pass, this time for a touchdown on a 27-yard pass to Quincy Enunwa. Nebraska made the extra point, taking a one-point lead. Penn State's next drive stalled, and again Butterworth was able to pin Nebraska inside the 20 on the ensuing punt. Nebraska subsequently went three-and-out, setting Penn State up with solid field position at their own 37-yard line. They got one first down, and were positioned for another, but Felder dropped a pass, and Penn State's ensuing punt was blocked after Butterworth dropped the low snap, setting up Nebraska in Penn State territory. Nebraska recorded the game's first third down conversion en route to getting the ball in the red zone. On a snap to Abdullah from the wildcat formation, he ran up the middle, but fumbled into the end zone, and Della Valle recovered in the end zone, setting Penn State up with some momentum at their 20-yard line, however they were unable to capitalize, going three-and-out. Nebraska's ensuing drive stalled, and they punted. Penn State came out trying to score before the half, and they did achieve a few first downs, but ultimately punted, and Nebraska downed the ball to go into half time leading by one. Coming out of the half, the snow showers returned, and Penn State got the ball to start the half, and they did convert a third down for the first time of the game, however again, their drive stalled, and Butterworth punted the ball for the sixth time. Nebraska faced a third-and-long on their next drive, and on the play, C. J. Olaniyan sacked the quarterback, and forced and recovered a fumble, setting Penn State up inside the Nebraska 10 yard line. Two plays later, with the snow increasing in intensity, Hackenberg ran a play-action bootleg and rolled right, running for a 7-yard touchdown, putting Penn State up 13–7, as this time, Ficken made the extra point. The lead did not last long; Kenny Bell returned the ensuing kickoff for a 99-yard touchdown, the second consecutive week Penn State surrendered a return touchdown. Back where they started at the beginning of the half in terms of scoring differential, Penn State got the ball inside their own 20 after Geno Lewis fumbled the kickoff return (he recovered). Penn State achieved a first down on the drive, but a false start penalty set up a third-and-long situation from which they could not recover. They punted. Nebraska also punted on their next drive, and the punt was downed at the one-yard line. They did not remain in the shadow of their own goal post for long, as Zwinak rushed for four yards, and then, on a play action pass, Hackenberg threw a 43-yard pass to Allen Robinson. Two plays later, however, Evans intercepted Hackenberg's pass, giving Nebraska good field position at their own 48. They capitalized, kicking a field goal, going up by four. The Huskers led 17–13 at the end of the third quarter. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Jesse James caught a pass in the flat on a third-and-three, and ran down the sideline for a 46-yard touchdown putting Penn State up 20–17. Penn State quickly got the ball <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> to milk clock with Zwinak running the football, however two incomplete passes decimated the drive, and they punted it back to Nebraska. After exchanging punts, Nebraska embarked on a drive that had a 62-yard run by Abdullah called back due to a personal foul penalty called. The foul occurred deep into the run, so Nebraska still got the ball at Penn State's 27-yard line. Subsequently, they moved the ball into the red zone, and got it down to the one-yard line before a false start backed them up to the six-yard line ... one play later, they called timeout, and on the next play, Kellogg III scrambled and got to the one-yard line before he and Mike Hull collided, jarring the ball loose, but the ruling was that Nebraska maintained possession, and Smith made a 19-yard field goal to tie the game at 20. When Penn State received the subsequent kickoff, they ran the ball several times, and ultimately punted the ball away with 1:40 remaining from their 38-yard line; it was downed at the five-yard line, setting up Nebraska with two of their three timeouts and 1:31 remaining. Nebraska was backed up inside their one on third-and-long, and threw a long pass that fell incomplete, however Jordan Lucas was flagged for pass interference. The next series, however, was decimated by penalties, and ultimately, Nebraska punted the ball away, and the game went into overtime, Penn State's third OT game of the season (they won the first two). In overtime, Penn State got the ball first, and after failing to achieve a first down, lined up to attempt a field goal, but the typically reliable Ficken missed another kick, and Nebraska conservatively positioned themselves for a field goal try on their ensuing possession. They lined up for a 37-yard field goal, but committed a false start penalty backing them up five yards. It did not matter, however, as Smith hit a 42-yard field goal to win the game, 23–20.|$|E

2500|$|In his memoir, Courage and Consequence, Rove devotes three {{chapters}} to Wilson's New York Times op-ed {{and subsequent}} grand jury investigation. Rove writes that before his third {{appearance before the}} grand jury, Robert Luskin went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> through all of Rove's saved emails from April through September 2003. Luskin, according to Rove, uncovered an email Rove had written to Steve Hadley in which Rove discussed a conversation he had had with Matt Cooper concerning Wilson's op-ed. Rove writes that while the [...] "email didn't jog any better recollection of the call", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, {{that he wanted to}} [...] "set the record straight." [...] After presenting the email to Fitzgerald, Rove writes that [...] "it was as if I'd detonated a bomb in the shabby little room." [...] Rove writes that before his fourth appearance before the grand jury he received a [...] "target warning" [...] by Fitzgerald. Rove describes his fourth appearance as [...] "brutal from the first moment", and that the grand jury [...] "hung on Fitzgerald's every word." [...] After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin [...] "All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client." [...] According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, [...] "Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: my conversation with Matt Cooper. Was I lying {{about not being able to}} recall my phone conversation with him the morning of July 11, 2003?" [...] Specifically, Rove writes, Fitzgerald wanted to know why [...] "in December 2003 or January 2004 did I ask my aides...to find any evidence of contact with Matt Cooper." [...] It was at this moment, according to Rove, that Luskin revealed his conversation with Viveca Novak in which Luskin learned that Cooper [...] "had insisted around Times Washington bureau that he had talked to [...]" [...] Luskin then revealed to Fitzgerald that it was he who instructed Rove to have his aides find any records of that contact. According to Rove, Fitzgerald was [...] "stunned", and stated to Luskin, [...] "You rocked my world." [...] Rove writes that it [...] "was clear Fitzgerald had originally intended to indict Libby and me on the same day." [...] Rove also writes that in the end, Luskin had a [...] "charitable view of Fitzgerald...the prosecutor never leaked, and he treated Luskin with respect and was forthcoming about his evidence and concerns." ...|$|E
