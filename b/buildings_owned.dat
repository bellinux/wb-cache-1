25|$|The {{historical}} {{residence of}} the Society of Jesus, this site was transformed to support pilgrims to the site, and {{is marked by a}} chapel delineated by Corinthian columns, supporting plinths surmounted by simple frieze and cornice. The interior was decorated in azulejo tile of polychromatic vegetal design, with triumphal arch dividing the sanctuary from the college, identifiable by the large granite rock in its interior, where legend says the image of the Virgin Mary was first discovered. In this space is the oratory of Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows) with its nativity by António Ferreira (particularly visible in the juxtaposition of various representations).

25|$|According to the Palestinian Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs, 203 mosques {{were damaged}} during the war, with 73 being {{destroyed}} completely.

In contrast to Operation Pillar of Defensive, which did not damage a single mosque, Israel maintained that Hamas had a routine military use of mosques and that made them legitimate military targets. According to the IDF, 160 rockets were launched from mosques during the war. It also stated that mosques were used for weapon storage, tunnel entrances, training and gathering of militants. In one Associated Press report, residents denied that mosques damaged by Israeli forces had been used for military purposes.|$|E

25|$|He {{terminated}} {{his contract}} in spring {{of the following}} year, and decided to open of school for boys aged 12 to 15; the initiative was publicized by Heliade Rădulescu's magazine Curierul Românesc. Vaillant's school was located in <b>buildings</b> <b>owned</b> by Serdar Popa, {{in the vicinity of}} Stavropoleos Monastery. Together with the similar activities of Félix Colson (who was tutoring young members of the Văcărescu family), and those of the Moldavian-based Cuénim and the abbé Lhommé, this brought an important step in the Westernization of Romanian society, while contributing to enforcing admiration for France among young boyars. It also signified a breaking point with education in Greek, which had been the norm before and during the Phanariote age (ever since the 17th century initiatives of Prince Matei Basarab). The memoirist Ion Ghica later noted that, among Vaillant's pupils, were scions of the Filipescu family, {{as well as those of}} the Grădişteanus, Bălăceanus, Rosettis, Golescus and his own family (the Ghicas). Another of his pupils was the future radical politician and historian Nicolae Bălcescu. Vaillant was also a teacher at a school for girls, which functioned without tuition.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days after}} the disaster, the city sued the owners and {{managers}} of the building in the Housing Court due {{to a number of}} breaches in building regulations. Those named in the complaint included LG Properties, the company's president Philip Pappas, and George Koutroumos, the contractor who built the balcony. The city was reportedly seeking $500 per violation for each day the structure was in existence, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a court order for the replacement of the balcony. The apartment block was legally uninhabitable until the balconies were replaced, as they provided mandatory emergency exits. The city's Buildings Department inspected forty-two other <b>buildings</b> <b>owned</b> or managed by Pappas and/or LG Properties for similar violations. The city also claimed that twenty-one other <b>buildings</b> <b>owned</b> by Pappas had similar problems. They did, however, note {{the fact that he had}} since made [...] "dramatic improvements" [...] to all twenty-one porches.|$|E
