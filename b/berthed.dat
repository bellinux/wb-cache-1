5|$|A second {{full-size}} {{replica of}} Endeavour is <b>berthed</b> on the River Tees in Stockton-on-Tees. While this reflects the external dimensions of Cook's vessel, this replica was constructed with a steel {{rather than a}} timber frame, has one less internal deck than the original, and is not designed {{to be put to}} sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers <b>berthed</b> {{in the rear of}} the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the ship's age and {{limitations}} became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. The ship was paid off in April 1945 and, <b>berthed</b> at Loch Striven, {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap, and had been completely broken up in Troon by 1954.|$|E

5|$|From late 1914, Philomel, needing {{maintenance}} and an update of equipment, was <b>berthed</b> at Malta and underwent an overhaul. This {{was completed by}} late January 1915 and she then started operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks. On 8 February she landed an armed party in Southern Turkey where a large force of Turkish soldiers were encountered, resulting in three seamen being killed and three wounded. This action marked the first deaths {{in the war of}} New Zealanders serving with a New Zealand formation.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} Fort Glanville's {{significance}} declined rapidly. Fort Largs was equipped in 1889 with two 6inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked {{to changes in}} Port Adelaide's maritime facilities and the consequent northward movement of anchored and <b>berthed</b> vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of anchoring off-shore.|$|E
5|$|Hermes was <b>berthed</b> in Trincomalee on 8 April when {{a warning}} of an {{approaching}} Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes {{were lost in the}} sinking.|$|E

5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and <b>berthed</b> the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
5|$|The crew celebrated Christmas aboard Monitor while <b>berthed</b> at Hampton Roads in {{what was}} {{described}} as a most merry fashion, while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. The ship's cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day; it was received with mixed opinion. That day, Monitor was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.|$|E
5|$|There {{are still}} two prisons on Portland: HMP The Verne, which until 1949 {{was a huge}} Victorian {{military}} fortress, and a Young Offenders' Institution (HMYOI) on the Grove clifftop. This was the original prison (HM Prison Portland) built for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland Breakwaters from 1848. For a few years until 2005 Britain's only prison ship, HMP The Weare, was <b>berthed</b> in the harbour.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , <b>berthed</b> next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|After {{one final}} match in Adelaide, {{which was the}} last time South Australia needed odds (i.e., extra men) to compete, the {{tourists}} left Melbourne on 11 March 1884 aboard the P & O steamer Sutlej and arrived at Plymouth on 29 April. With a programme of 32 fixtures arranged, the first game in England began on 12 May at Sheffield Park, Uckfield and the last game against the South of England was completed on 12 September. The team travelled home on the SS Mirzapore and reached Melbourne again in early November. Murdoch enjoyed a shipboard romance on the return voyage with an heiress called Jemima Watson whom he married at Fitzroy, Victoria in December, only {{a few weeks after the}} Mirzapore <b>berthed.</b>|$|E
5|$|By early 1943 the Australian Army's focus {{had shifted}} to {{operations}} in the Pacific theatre against the Japanese, and the 9th Division received orders to return to Australia to join the other two 2nd AIF divisions, the 6th and 7th, which had departed earlier in 1942. A divisional parade was held in Gaza, after which the 2/15th embarked upon the transport Acquitania and sailed with a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet {{as part of the}} final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions from the Middle East. After a journey of just over a month, the Acquitania <b>berthed</b> at Sydney in late February 1943. During this time the battalion was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Barham.|$|E
50|$|Before 2006, Shield {{winners were}} not {{necessarily}} guaranteed a <b>berth</b> into CONCACAF competitions. Most regular season champions to earn <b>berths</b> into CONCACAF competitions typically earned them from earning a <b>berth</b> into the MLS Cup, or earning a <b>berth</b> due {{to the number of}} <b>berths</b> allocated to the United States for MLS. Most times, the United States was allocated two <b>berths</b> into the tournament, which went to the MLS Cup champion and runner-up.|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock <b>berthed</b> in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely <b>berthed</b> in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen <b>berthed</b> in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|Qualification for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup determines which 15 teams join Germany, {{the hosts}} of the 2011 tournament, {{to play for}} the Women's World Cup.

5|$|On 21 November 2008, the {{two ships}} left Portsmouth {{for the last}} time for Aliağa, Turkey under tow. Scrapping took place in the same yard which was {{scrapping}} the Tuxedo Princess, a former ferry and floating nightclub that had been <b>berthed</b> underneath the Tyne Bridge. Following a decommissioning ceremony at Cardiff city hall, her bell was removed and is now mounted in the north aisle of St John's Parish Church in Cardiff.

5|$|On August 29, {{the fleet}} {{transporting}} the two first brigades arrived in Navarino bay, where the joint Franco-Russo-British squadron was <b>berthed.</b> The Egyptian army was concentrated between Navarino and Methoni. Thus, the landing was risky. The fleet sailed toward the Gulf of Koroni {{protected by a}} fortress held by the Ottomans. The expeditionary corps began to disembark without meeting any opposition {{on the evening of}} August 29, finishing on the morning of August 30. A proclamation by governor Capodistria had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. The locals rushed up before the troops as soon as they set foot on Greek soil and offered them food.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was {{surplus to}} postwar {{requirements}} {{with the large}} numbers of Essex-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946. This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate the effect of the atomic bomb on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny's radio show on 21 April, while Saratoga was <b>berthed</b> in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini.
