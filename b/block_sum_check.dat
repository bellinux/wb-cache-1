50|$|Within English Electric, its predecessor, DEUCE, had a well-used matrix scheme {{based on}} GIP (General Interpretive Programme). The {{unreliability}} of valve machines led to {{the inclusion of a}} sum-check mechanism to detect errors in matrix operations. The scheme used block floating-point using fixed-point arithmetic hardware, in which the sum-checks were precise. However, when the corresponding scheme was implemented on KDF9, it used floating point, a new concept that had only limited mathematical analysis. It quickly became clear that <b>sum</b> <b>checks</b> were no longer precise and a project was established in an attempt to provide a usable check. (In floating point (A + B) + C is not necessarily the same as A + (B + C) i.e. the + operation is not associative.) Before long, however, it was recognized that error rates with transistor machines was not an issue—they either worked correctly or didn’t work at all! Consequently the idea of <b>sum</b> <b>checks</b> was abandoned. The initial matrix package proved a very useful system testing tool as it was able to generate lengthy performance checks well before more formal test packages which were subsequently developed.|$|R

Consider a m Θ n table with numerical values (e. g., amount of money) in which the last column contains <b>check</b> <b>sums</b> of numbers in particular rows. Similarly, the last row consists of column <b>check</b> <b>sums.</b> A new table is to be produced in which the original numbers, and <b>check</b> <b>sums</b> are rounded off (e. g., to integers). However, the classical rounding procedure (i. e., rounding fractions smaller than 0. 5 down, otherwise up) can generally violate the validity of sums. Therefore, the possibility to round off the non-integer numbers in the table to adjacent integers (i. e., either up or down independently on their fractions) is explored in order to preserve the <b>check</b> <b>sums.</b> We formulate a necessary and sufficient condition stating when rounding, which is consistent with prescribed (integer) <b>check</b> <b>sums,</b> exists.

The exact partitions are derived by {{getting rid of}} the absolute function from MAD by using the idea of re-expressing the mean absolute deviation as a weighted average of data with sum of weights zero. ANOMAD has advantages: offers meaningful measure of dispersion, does not square data, and can be extended to other location measures such as median. Two ANOMAD graphs are proposed. However, the variance-gamma distribution is used to fit the sampling distributions for the mean of BLSA and the mean of TRSA.

The matching process of the proposed algorithm {{is based on a}} <b>Block</b> <b>Sum</b> Pyramid algorithm that significantly reduces the computational complexity while maintaining the same accuracy as the conventional sum of absolute difference approach. The searching process, on the other hand, is based on a multilevel search strategy rather than the full-search strategy used by most conventional tracking methods. Both simulated speckle images and clinical breast images were used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the computation efficiency is improved by up to a factor of five over the conventional approach. The improved efficiency enables real-time or near-real-time implementation of motion estimation in ultrasonic imaging, which is particularly beneficial in areas such as blood flow estimation, elasticity imaging, speckle image registration, and strain compounding. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
