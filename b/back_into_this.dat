Diplomatic agents were exchanged between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa Chiefs as reliable [...] "ambassadors", and colonial expansion into Xhosa land was forbidden.

2500|$|Placating the {{northern}} German NSDAP branches {{in the wake}} of Bamberg, Hitler assigned leadership of the SA, which was temporarily vacated by Ernst Roehm, to one of Strasser own key members, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon. [...] More importantly perhaps, Hitler began a personal campaign to lure away Strasser's chief lieutenant, Goebbels, into his personal fold—a move which proved immediately successful. The future Führer also struck a deal with Strasser to disband the Northern Working Group of the NSDAP and asked him to assume responsibility for the party propaganda department. Strasser accepted this position, but a car accident March 1926 proved a setback since he was bedridden as a result. Upon recovery, he was welcomed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> position.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the last}} of the Kula Plate decayed and the Farallon Plate {{advanced}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> area from the south, it once again started to subduct under the continental margin of Western Canada 37million years ago, supporting a chain of volcanoes called the Cascade Volcanic Arc. At least four volcanic formations along the British Columbia Coast are associated with Cascadia subduction zone volcanism. The oldest is the eroded 18-million-year-old Pemberton Volcanic Belt which extends west-northwest from south-central British Columbia to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the northeast where it lies [...] west of mainland British Columbia. In the south it is defined by a group of epizonal intrusions and a few erosional remnants of eruptive rock. Farther north in the large Ha-Iltzuk and Waddington icefields, it includes two large dissected calderas called Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano while the Queen Charlotte Islands to the northeast contain a volcanic formation ranging in age from Miocene to Pliocene called the Masset Formation. Although widely separated from each other, all Pemberton Belt rocks are of similar age and have similar magma compositions. Therefore, these magmatic rocks are believed to be products of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Farallon Plate. By late Pliocene time the Farallon Plate had been greatly reduced in size and its northern portion ultimately broke off between five and seven million years ago to form a new plate boundary called the Nootka Fault. This rupture created the two small Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates that lie off the west coast of Vancouver Island.|$|E
