5|$|The {{size of the}} {{development}} team and the complexity of porting the whole browser to a new <b>backend</b> caused Epiphany to re-release version 2.22 with bugfixes instead of the actual development code, so browser development remained stagnant until , when the project team announced that Epiphany 2.26 would be the final Gecko-based version. Eventually, in September 2009 the Webkit-powered Epiphany 2.28 was released, as part of GNOME 2.28.|$|E

50|$|Other {{languages}} {{can then}} be interfaced to by calling them from these languages. However, this means that foreign language code {{may need to be}} written several times for the different <b>backends,</b> otherwise portability between <b>backends</b> will be lost.|$|R
25|$|The current {{production}} version (1.0.x) implements OpenGL ES 2.0 and EGL 1.4, {{claiming to}} pass the conformance tests for both. Work has started on the future OpenGL ES 3.0 version, for the newer Direct3D 11 <b>backend.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smuxi is a {{cross-platform}} IRC client for the GNOME desktop {{inspired by}} Irssi. It pioneered {{the concept of}} separating the frontend client from the <b>backend</b> engine which manages connections to IRC servers inside a single graphical application.|$|E
25|$|Since JavaScript {{is getting}} more {{important}} for web development (frontend overtakes many aspects which were done in <b>backend</b> before), there is also more consideration done about performance. Especially mobile devices could have problems with rendering and processing unoptimized complex logic.|$|E
50|$|Cantor is a {{graphical}} {{user interface}} that delegates its mathematical operations to one of several <b>backends.</b> Its plugin-based structure allows adding different <b>backends.</b> It can make use of GNU Octave, Julia, KAlgebra, Lua, Maxima, Python, Qalculate!, R, SageMath, and Scilab.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the last}} planned bug-fix release in the 1. 4 series. Many bugs are fixed including: 	fixing drawing of edge-only markers in AGG 	fix {{run-away}} memory usage when using %inline or saving with a tight bounding box with QuadMesh artists 	improvements to wx and tk gui <b>backends</b> Additionally the webagg and nbagg <b>backends</b> were brought closer to feature parity with the desktop <b>backends</b> {{with the addition of}} keyboard and scroll events thanks to Steven Silvester...|$|R

25|$|The York Haskell Compiler (Yhc) was a fork of nhc98, {{with the}} goals of being simpler, more {{portable}} and efficient, and integrating support for Hat, the Haskell tracer. It also had a JavaScript <b>backend,</b> allowing users to run Haskell programs in web browsers.|$|E

50|$|The PCL, color laser, and Lexmark <b>backends</b> are {{currently}} unmaintained. Volunteers are welcome.Fairly often, printers that would use these <b>backends</b> have emulation capability for other languages, in particular Postscript. In such a case, the printer can be configured {{to use a}} standard Postscript driver.|$|R
40|$|Honeypots are {{a type of}} {{security}} tools aimed to capture malicious activity. Related to their data capture function, two main factors are important: scalability and fidelity. A hybrid honeypot is a special honeypot system consisting of frontends and <b>backends</b> that can achieve a good balance between scalability and fidelity, as the frontends can monitor large-scale IP address spaces and the <b>backends</b> can provide fully functional systems to guarantee fidelity. The traffic redirection function is used to bridge the frontends and the <b>backends,</b> allowing to redirect the interesting traffic from the frontends to the <b>backends.</b> In this paper, a dynamic hybrid honeypot system based transparent traffic redirection mechanism is proposed {{in order to address}} the identical-fingerprint problem. The experimental results show that this mechanism can keep the traffic redirection stealthy and effective...|$|R

25|$|ANGLE (Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine) {{is an open}} source, BSD-licensed {{graphics}} engine abstraction layer developed by Google. The API is mainly designed to bring high-performance OpenGL compatibility to Windows computers and to web browsers such as Chromium by translating OpenGL calls to Direct3D, which has much better driver support. There are two <b>backend</b> renderers for ANGLE: the oldest one uses Direct3D 9.0c, while the newer one uses Direct3D 11.|$|E
25|$|While Java was {{originally}} made for e.g. client-side applet use in web browsers (usage shifted {{mostly to the}} <b>backend),</b> major browsers no longer have applet support (nor is that use case officially supported by Oracle; neither do they or Apple support Java for macOS; outdated Windows XP is also no longer officially supported, and Microsoft in general hindered use of unchanged Java with their Windows operating system, for a time competing with a J# language).|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 2012, Drupal 8 {{started its}} feature completion. About three years later, on October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release {{candidate}} (rc1) was announced. Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; {{introduced a new}} object-oriented <b>backend</b> leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support.

50|$|The Haxe {{compiler}} {{is divided}} into one frontend and multiple <b>backends.</b> The frontend creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the source code, and performs type checking, macro expansion, and optimization on the AST. The various <b>backends</b> translate the processed AST into source code or generate bytecode, depending on their target.|$|R

25|$|After this, data {{is output}} in PHP format (compiled with HipHop for PHP). The <b>backend</b> {{is written in}} Java and Thrift is used as the {{messaging}} format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are {{used to make the}} web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.|$|E
25|$|Phonon is {{the name}} of the {{multimedia}} API in KDE4. Phonon is a different approach to multimedia backends than in previous versions of KDE. This is because Phonon only functions as a wrapper, abstracting the various multimedia frameworks available for Unix-like operating systems into runtime switchable backends that can be accessed through a single API. This was done to provide a stable API for KDE 4 and to prevent it from depending on a single multimedia framework. Applications that use the Phonon API can be switched between multimedia frameworks seamlessly by simply changing the <b>backend</b> used in System Settings. Nokia adopted Phonon for multimedia use in Qt4.4 and are developing backends for Gstreamer, Windows and OS X in the KDE SVN repository under the LGPL.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} process heavily suffered from multiple problems, {{related to the}} Gecko <b>backend.</b> To address these issues in July 2007 the Epiphany team added support for WebKit as an alternative rendering engine for Epiphany. As the <b>backend</b> development advanced, on [...] the Epiphany team {{announced that it would}} stop using the Gecko rendering engine and proceed using just WebKit.|$|E
50|$|Emotion is {{a library}} {{providing}} video-playing capabilities {{through the use}} of smart-objects. Emotion provides several video <b>backends.</b> The best-supported one is libxine, a well-established video-playing library, but gstreamer and vlc <b>backends</b> are also provided. Thus, Emotion supports all of the video formats that video libraries support, including Ogg Theora, DivX, MPEG2, etc.|$|R
