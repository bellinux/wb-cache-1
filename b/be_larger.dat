5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E

5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed undamaged.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} {{of the early}} 21st century, astronomers had no real need for a formal {{definition}} for planets. With the discovery of Pluto in 1930, astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets. Pluto was thought to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Females {{grow faster}} than males overall, and must <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> to mature sexually. In most populations males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2–4years old, and females at 6–10. Size and age at maturity increase with latitude; {{at the northern}} edge of their range, males reach sexual maturity at 7–9years of age and females at 11–16.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to <b>be</b> <b>larger,</b> and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> {{than those in the}} western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{other type}} was the mainland; these tended to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> because their {{pastures}} provided richer nutrients. They {{came in a}} range of colours, most frequently dun or red. These types have now been crossbred so that there is no distinct difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> than halfbacks and {{function}} primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations and are seldom used in passing situations.|$|E
5|$|There are {{physical}} {{differences between}} the show strains and working strains in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability and as such several physical differences have appeared. Working type dogs tend to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The working strain {{seems to be more}} energetic than the show strain.|$|E

Furthermore, sudamericid molariforms tend to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> and are {{supported}} by one large root, but the smaller ferugliotheriids {{have at least two}} roots under their molariforms.

5|$|Archaeologists have mapped 268 {{structures}} {{clustered in}} 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in the site core. Residential structures were {{concentrated in the}} area surrounding the ceremonial centre, especially on {{the north and west}} sides near to the reservoir. Residences tended to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> the closer they were to the reservoir. The residential area of El Chal was extensive and archaeologists have divided it into four sectors. Municipal consists of the area occupied by the modern village, El Arrepentimiento is the northeastern portion of the site, Panorama is the northwestern area, and Central is the site core. Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, Panorama contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups. Panorama was an area of chert production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
