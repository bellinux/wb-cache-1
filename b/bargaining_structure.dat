Following their 1996 election victory, the Howard Government proposed {{to balance the}} Australian federal budget by means of extensive budget cuts, and introduced a draft Workplace Relations Amendment Bill which proposed to curtail 'compulsory unionism' and to introduce a more decentralised <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> to the Australian work place.

Nevertheless, against the backdrop of Visser’s discussion, it may be argued that alternative <b>bargaining</b> <b>structures</b> have been accorded insufficient attention in recent theoretical models. One such potentially important characteristic is the synchronization of pay policies of distinct bargaining units or coordination. The final application considered in this section (re)introduces pattern bargaining as a means of coordination.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> has {{traditionally}} been at the centre of Industrial Relations research, and increasingly attention is being given to the influences upon it. This study examines management's attempts to regulate union behaviour in four organisations having different bargaining structures. These are treated as case studies and using qualitative data they are compared to study three relationships: between management structure and bargaining structure; between <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> and union behaviour; and between situational determinants and <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure.</b> The background to the thesis is outlined in Part I. This introduces the study, des 0 ribes the research method, and then applies {{some of the research}} data available to previous hypotheses. A number of tentative proposals are put forward regarding <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> and the influences upon it which are pursued in Part III. The four case studies are systematically analysed in the following four chapters. For each collective bargaining in practice is outlined followed by an analysis of managerial attempts to regulate this. Part III draws on this raw data and analyses managerial involvement in Industrial Relations in two stages. Initially a framework for the study of managerial involvement is developed which puts <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> in its context. Secondly using an established criterion the effectiveness of management control over union activity is examined. Finally the implications of the analysis for management, trade unions, and the reform of Industrial Relations are pursued. A number of proposals are put forward in this thesis. First the level of bargaining cannot be studied in isolation, but must be placed {{in the context of the}} other dimensions of <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure.</b> Second, <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> is influenced by constraints both internal and external to the organisation, yet management appear to have a good deal of discretion in choosing a particular structure. Third, <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> must be placed within the context of the control systems used by management, many of which may not immediately be concerned with Industrial Relations. Finally, to understand managerial control over union activity we must look not only at the control systems but also the legitimacy of managerial authority. Put together these proposals contribute to our understanding of likely future changes in <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure,</b> and the shape possible reforms might take...|$|E

40|$|Union {{organization}} structure in Korea is being rapidly changed from company-level union structures to industrial union ones, {{especially after the}} 1997 foreign currency crisis. Through industrial union restructuring, unions are seeking a political power enhancement, the organization of nonstandard workers, and the reduction of differences in wage and working conditions by firm size. These changes to industrial unions, however, caused worries for companies because they believe industrial unions {{are more likely to}} have antagonistic industrial relations with more frequent bargaining impasses and strikes. This paper tries to answer the question of whether the <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> affects the impasse-resolution process with frequent mediations and strikes. The data show a significant effect of <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> on the impasse-resolution process: a diagonal <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> has a higher probability of requesting mediation service than does traditional single-company <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure.</b> Industry-wide bargaining has a higher probability of strike given a mediation was requested.

40|$|Calmfors and Driffill in 1988 {{argued that}} there is a humpshaped {{relation}} between the degree of centralisation in wage <b>bargaining</b> <b>structures</b> within an economy and unemployment. They collected aggregate economic data from 17 different OECD economies and ranked them according to their relative degree of centralisation to prove their model. The model was further developed by Rowthorn who in 1992, using individual data from the same countries, concluded {{that there is a}} negative linear relationship between the degree of centralisation in wage <b>bargaining</b> <b>structures</b> and wage dispersion. During the past two decades the Russian economy, as well as the Russian trade union movement, has transformed greatly. Membership rates in trade unions have fallen and bargaining leverage of trade unions vis-á-vis employers has decreased. Using data from ten sectors within the Russian economy (collected in interviews with trade union representatives in Moscow, June 2006) this essay questions whether the theoretical assumptions above hold in the Russian context. By ranking the sectors according to their relative degree of centralisation in wage <b>bargaining</b> <b>structures</b> and using these rankings as explanatory variables in econometric analyses with unemployment rates and wage dispersion rates as dependent variables, this essay finds little proof that the theoretical framework of Calmfors and Driffill holds within the Russian economy.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{employers}} {{belong to}} more than one employer association, and often to associations with different and sometimes conflicting policies on major aspects of industrial relations. In the case of national associations, dual membership may exist in associations which have high public profiles and widely publicised policies which are fundamentally distinct. This raises the following critical questions. First, how do employers with dual membership behave when confronted by their associations with conflicting policies? Second, {{what are the implications of}} dual membership for cohesion within and among employer associations? To address these questions, this study focuses on employers who belong to the Business Council of Australia and the Metal Trades Industry Association between 1983 and 1995. During this period, these associations held strongly conflicting policies on <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure.</b> This paper examines the behaviour and attitudes of a selection of such members, towards the policies of these two associations on <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> during these years...|$|E

40|$|It has {{frequently}} been {{noted in the}} wage bargaining literature that increasing average labour taxes {{may in fact be}} over-shifted in the pre-tax wage that is negotiated between unions and firms, raising workers post-tax wages. In this paper, we study the precise conditions for such tax over-shifting to occur under both Nash and Right-To-Manage <b>bargaining</b> <b>structures,</b> and considering both competitive and imperfectly competitive output market conditions. In the case of competitive output markets, we derive and interpret the conditions for over-shifting to occur and show that they hold for an entire class of commonly used production functions. Moreover, under monopolistically competitive output markets we show that tax over-shifting will occur when the firm has sufficient market power. The conditions on the production function, that were necessary and sufficient for tax over-shifting to occur under perfect competition, are shown to be no longer necessary.

40|$|Abstract: Various factors {{influence}} {{the development of}} collective bargaining structures. Based on cross-sectional and pooled cross-sectional data from the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey series, this article discusses and empirically analyses the establishment-level determinants of collective bargaining centralization, i. e. whether an establishment is covered by single-employer collective bargaining or multi-employer collective bargaining. It argues that the employers ’ and trade unions ’ preferences for a particular <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> depend {{on the outcome of}} cost–benefit analyses of different available institutional alternatives. The actual choice of a collective <b>bargaining</b> <b>structure</b> then reflects the interaction of the actors ’ preferences, moderated by an institutionally determined decision-making process. Estimation of a probit model with pooled cross-sectional data shows that the number of unions present at the establishment, membership of an employers ’ association, and public sector affiliation are positively associated with collective bargaining centralization. In contrast to this, establishment size, trade union density, foreign ownership and control, and international product markets are negatively associated with centralization. Neither establishment age nor foreign ownership appeared to be significant...|$|E
