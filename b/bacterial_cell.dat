5|$|D-isomers are {{uncommon}} in live organisms. For instance, gramicidin is a polypeptide made up from mixture of D- and L-amino acids. Other compounds containing D-amino acid are tyrocidine and valinomycin. These compounds disrupt <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> walls, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. Only 837 D-amino acids {{were found in}} Swiss-Prot database (187 million amino acids analysed).|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal cells {{is different from that}} of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E

40|$|Studying how {{antimicrobial}} peptides {{interact with}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> is pivotal {{to understand their}} mechanism of action. In this paper we explored the use of Circular Dichroism to detect the secondary structure of two antimicrobial peptides, magainin 2 and cecropin A, with E. coli <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells.</b> The results of our studies allow us to gain two important information {{in the context of}} antimicrobial peptides- <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> interactions: peptides fold mainly due to interaction with LPS, which is the main component of the Gram negative bacteria outer membrane and the time required for the folding on the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> depends on the peptide analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Cationic polypeptides {{interact}} with <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> of E. coli and B. anthracis. They confer upon the cells {{some of the}} characteristics of cationic particles. Since <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> usually behave as anions, acidic dyes at high pH levels differentiate between cells which have and those which have not interacted with cationic polypeptides. Under the conditions of these experiments it appeared that cationic polypeptides tend to be sorbed in highest concentration in the surface layers of the cells. Electrovalent binding to anionic cell components and detergent action are probably among the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the polypeptides such as histones and <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells.</b> The differential staining of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> which have interacted with cationic polypeptides is feasible and reasonably selective. It should be useful in determining whether <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> {{interact with}} host cationic polypeptides in vitro...|$|R
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of peptidoglycan surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, {{but these are}} not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E

40|$|An in situ {{hybridization}} technique with HNPP (2 -hydroxy- 3 -naphthoic acid- 2 '-phenylanilide phosphate) and Fast Red TR was used to detect specific <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> at the single-cell level. By this technique, the fluorescent signals of target <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> were up to eight times more intense than those of standard fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} with mono-fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide probes.

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{action of}} cationic polypeptides {{has been found}} to be correlated with changes which they produce in the cytochemical reactions of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> ordinarily stain with cationic dyes at pH values above 7. Treatment with cationic polypeptides rendered them stainable with the anionic dye fast green at pH 8. 1. This change occurred parallel to loss of bacterial viability. An anionic, biological substance, mucin, was found to inhibit the usual conversion of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> from strong basophilia to strong acidophilia in the presence of cationic polypeptide. This inhibitory action was paralleled by inhibition of the toxicity of the cationic polypeptides for the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells.</b> It was found that the basic protein, globin, which has a lesser pK than total calf thymus histone, was less toxic for E. coli and less effective in causing the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> to become stainable with the anionic dye at high pH. Staining with fast green at pH 8. 1 appeared to provide presumptive evidence of lethal interaction between certain <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> and cationic polypeptides such as total histones. It is suggested that the method may prove to be useful in the detection of lethal interaction between cationic polypeptides of the host and bacteria residing in host tissues...|$|R
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|Nucleases are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell,</b> acting {{as part of the}} restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.|$|E

5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>cell</b> division. The {{regulation}} of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E

30|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} the biosurfactant anti-adhesive action relates with its ability of binding to <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells,</b> altering their hydrophobic and electrochemical properties (Neu 1996; Monteiro et al. 2011).

This observation, coupled with the lack of growth-inhibiting activity of the biosurfactant (Fig.  1) suggested that the adhesion inhibition is mainly due to the interaction of biosurfactant molecules with <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> or polystyrene surface, changing their surface properties, rather than its effect on the cell viability.

It is expected that a wide range of disease modifying substrates such as enzymes, hormones, antibodies, vaccines, and other genetic products will be used successfully and will impact upon health care substantially. However, a major limitation in the use of these <b>bacterial</b> <b>cells</b> is the complexity of delivering them to the correct target tissues.
