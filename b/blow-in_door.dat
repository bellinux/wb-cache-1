40|$|An approximately. 25 {{scale model}} of a Tandem Fan nacelle {{designed}} for a Type A V/STOL aircraft configuration was tested in a 10 -by- 10 foot wind tunnel. A 12 inch, tip driven, turbofan simulator was used to provide the suction source for the aft fan inlet. The front fan inlet was faired over for this test entry. Model variables consisted of a long aft inlet cowl, a short aft inlet cowl, a shaft simulator, <b>blow-in</b> <b>door</b> passages and diffuser vortex generators. Inlet pressure recovery, distortion, inlet angle of attack separation limits were evaluated at tunnel velocities from 0 to 240 knots, angles of attack from - 10 to 40 degrees and inlet flow rates representative of throat Mach numbers of 0. 1 to 0. 6. High inlet performance and stable operation was verified at all design forward speed and angle of attack conditions. The short aft inlet configuration provided exceptionally high pressure recovery except at the highest combination of angle of attack and forward speed. The flow quality at the fan face was somewhat degraded {{by the addition of}} <b>blow-in</b> <b>door</b> passages to the long aft inlet configuration due to the pressure disturbances generated by the flow entering the diffuser through the auxiliary air passages...|$|E
40|$|Many {{proposed}} advanced aircraft - {{but especially}} tilt-nacelle, subsonic-cruise, V/STOL aircraft - require nacelles that operate {{over a wide}} range of aerodynamic conditions. The optimum design of such nacelles and their inlets is described, including how the inlet low-speed design conditions are selected, the conditions for which the various regions of the inlet are designed, and appropriate criteria of merit. For low-speed operation the optimum internal surface velocity distributions and skin friction distributions are described for three categories of inlets: those without boundary-layer control (BLC), those with BLC, and those with <b>blow-in</b> <b>door</b> slots and retractable slats. Experimental results are presented that show the performance of the various types of inlets. At cruise speed the effect of factors that reduce the nacelle external surface area and the local skin friction is illustrated. These factors are cruise Mach number, inlet throat size, fan-face Mach number, and nacelle contour. The interrelation of these cruise-speed factors with the design requirements for good low-speed performance is discussed. Finally an inlet design without BLC and an optimized inlet design with slots and slats are compared to illustrate the possible reductions in nacelle size...|$|E
50|$|A simple {{example of}} ejector nozzle is the fixed {{geometry}} cylindrical shroud surrounding the afterburning nozzle on the J85 installation in the T-38 Talon. More complex were the arrangements {{used for the}} J58(SR-71) and TF-30(F-111) installations. They both used tertiary <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors</b> (open at lower speeds) and free-floating overlapping flaps for a final nozzle. Both the <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors</b> and the final nozzle flaps are positioned by a balance of internal pressure from the engine exhaust and external pressure from the aircraft flowfield.|$|R
5|$|Another {{idea that}} McDonnell {{proposed}} was {{a variation of}} a carrier-based Phantom, {{with the goal of}} improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) would have had a longer fuselage and wingspan, with less sweep, stabilators with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors</b> to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.|$|R
40|$|A {{concept is}} {{presented}} that combines the low-noise and high-thrust {{characteristics of a}} turbofan at takeoff, together with its high efficiency at subsonic flight speeds, with the high efficiency of a turbojet at supersonic cruise. It consists of a free turbine with tip fan mounted behind the turbine of a conventional turbojet engine. Fan air is supplied from <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors</b> or is ducted from the main engine inlet. At high flight speeds where fan augmentation is not desirable, the fan inlet is closed and the free turbine is stopped by adjustment of its variable-camber stators. Estimates of noise, cycle performance, and example configurations are presented for a typical supersonic transport application...|$|R
500|$|The Kestrel and the Harrier {{were similar}} in appearance, though {{approximately}} 90 per cent of the Kestrel's airframe was redesigned for the Harrier. The Harrier was powered by the more powerful Pegasus 6 engine; new air intakes with auxiliary <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors</b> were added to produce the required airflow at low speed. Its wing was modified to increase area and the landing gear was strengthened. Several hardpoints were installed, two under each wing and one underneath the fuselage; two [...] ADEN cannon gun pods could also be fitted to {{the underside of the}} fuselage. The Harrier was outfitted with updated avionics to replace the basic systems used in the Kestrel; a navigational-attack system incorporating an inertial navigation system, originally for the P.1154, was installed and information was presented to the pilot by a head-up display and a moving map display.|$|R
500|$|While superficially {{similar to}} the later F-117, the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter {{the weight of the}} F-117, with a wing sweep of 72.5° and inward-canted {{vertical}} tails (inverse V-tail). Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, were applied to the aircraft's flat surfaces – for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics. The aircraft's gross weight of 9,200–12,500lb (4,173–5,669kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft's powerplants were two [...] General Electric J85-GE-4As of the T-2C Buckeye. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16. The overwing engine inlet was covered by a low-RCS grid; during takeoffs, when more air is needed, <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors</b> were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of inlet-turbojet-engine matching {{for a range}} of Mach numbers up to 2. 0 indicates large performance penalties when fixed-geometry inlets are used. Use of variable-geometry inlets, however, nearly eliminates th The analysis was confirmed experimentally by investigating at Mach numbers of 0, 0. 63, and 1. 5 to 2. 0 two single oblique-shock-type inlets of different compression-ramp angles, which simulated a variable-geometry configuration. The experimental investigation indicated that total-pressure recoveries comparable withose attainable with well designed nose inlets were obtained with the side inlets when all the boundary layer ahead of the inlets was removed. Serious drag penalties resulted at a Mach number of 2. 0 from the use of blunt-cowl leading edges. However, sharp-lip inlets produced large losses in thrust for the take-off condition. These thrust penalties which are associated with the the low-speed operation of the sharp-lip inlet designs can probably be avoided without impairing the supersonic performance of the inlet by the use of auxiliary inlets or <b>blow-in</b> <b>doors...</b>|$|R
