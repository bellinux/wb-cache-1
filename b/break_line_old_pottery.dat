40|$|Water body {{detection}} {{is necessary}} to generate hydro <b>break</b> <b>lines,</b> which are in turn useful in creating deliverables such as TINs, contours, DEMs from LiDAR data. Hydro flattening follows the detection and delineation of water bodies (lakes, rivers, ponds, reservoirs, streams etc.) with hydro <b>break</b> <b>lines.</b> Manual hydro <b>break</b> <b>line</b> generation is time consuming and expensive. Accuracy and processing time depend {{on the number of}} vertices marked for delineation of <b>break</b> <b>lines.</b> Automation with minimal human intervention is desired for this operation. This paper proposes using a novel histogram analysis of LiDAR elevation data and LiDAR intensity data to automatically detect water bodies. Detection of water bodies using elevation information was verified by checking against LiDAR intensity data since the spectral reflectance of water bodies is very small compared with that of land and vegetation in near infra-red wavelength range. Detection of water bodies using LiDAR intensity data was also verified by checking against LiDAR elevation data. False detections were removed using morphological operations and 3 D <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> were generated. Finally, a comparison of automatically generated <b>break</b> <b>lines</b> with their semi-automated/manual counterparts was performed to assess the accuracy of the proposed method and the results were discussed...|$|R
