[...] The annal for 577, below, is another possible example.|$|E
2500|$|David Edelstein of New York Magazine {{compared}} {{the film to}} 1940s low-budget westerns of Lash LaRue, Douglas Sirk melodramas, the heroic bloodshed films of John Woo and George A. Romero's gore-filled horror films. [...] "It's no buried postmodern masterpiece, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a jaw-dropper: a delirium-inducing crash course in international trash", Edelstein wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Scream 3 writer Ehren Kruger {{was brought}} in during {{production}} to do re-writes. Craven said, [...] "Look, there was a bumpy period when things shifted over from Kevin to Ehren. I signed up to do a script by Kevin and unfortunately that didn't {{go all the way}} through the shooting. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> Kevin's script and concept and characters and themes". Additional rewrites were made by Paul Harris Boardman. It was reported that the actors were not given the 140-page script past page 75 in order to protect the identity of the Ghostface killer.|$|E
50|$|Southall {{himself said}} of Josh {{that it might}} not be his best book <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> his most unusual. It is written from Josh's point of view, the taut {{language}} effectively conveying his distress and frustration. Michele Gill cites Josh as an early example of the sensitive and vulnerable hero, a theme which became more and more prominent in children's literature afterward.|$|R
5000|$|In Funk (1948), the Court said ideas (natural principles) {{could not}} be {{patented}} and that the device utilized in that case [...] "may have been the product of skill, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> not the product of invention"; yet, the Court did not yet state in terms {{that the key to}} patenting the implementation of an idea is inventive implementation.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the book}} he reiterates his early {{statement}} (page 71): [...] "Military and naval endeavors may not always have been the raison d'être of the new nations-states, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> their most expensive and pressing activity", and it remains such until the power's decline. He concludes that declining countries can experience greater difficulties in balancing their preferences for guns, butter and investments.|$|R

60|$|All {{these may}} be unmerited suspicions; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a {{circumstance}} strongly corroborative of them, that Mr. M'Dougal, shortly after concluding this agreement, {{became a member of}} the Northwest Company, and received a share productive of a handsome income.|$|E

50|$|The {{hospital}} {{closed in}} 1972. Since then {{the building has}} sat idle, deteriorating in Yazoo City. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> active during the 60 years it served the black community. It was the first hospital for African Americans in the state when it was built. Before then, there was no health care facility blacks could use. Then in 1928 Mr. T.J. Huddleston, Sr. changed that. Mr. Huddleston was Mike Espy's grandfather.|$|R
6000|$|... "Been funny season this year, anyway. Never saw it {{with such}} a cold October and such a nice November. 'Member we had a snow way back on October ninth! <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> nice up to the twenty-first, this month--as I {{remember}} it, not a flake of snow in November so far, has there been? But I shouldn't wonder if we'd be having some snow 'most any time now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Father {{says the}} {{machinery}} will do {{good in the}} long run, Abijah--that it will largely increase trade, and so give employment to a great many more people than at present. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> hard on those who have learned to work in one way to see their living taken away from them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but it is}} not a {{question}} of being killed in battle, Beric; it is {{a question}} of being captured in battle and put to death afterwards. It may be the fashion some day or other to treat captives taken in war with generosity and honour, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not so at present, either with us or with any other nation that I know of. I don't think that your people differ from the rest, for every soul who fell into their hands was slain." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} before noon when we drove into Stratford, by which time, with our usual {{fatality}} in visiting poetic shrines, the day had melted off {{into a kind of}} drizzling mist, strongly suggestive of a downright rain. It is a common trick these English days have; the weather here seems to be possessed of a water spirit. This constant drizzle is good for ivies, and hawthorns, and ladies' complexions, as whoever travels here will observe, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> very bad for tourists.|$|E

60|$|Little {{by little}} he forgot {{that it was}} an egg. At least, he forgot that he wanted to eat it. He began to find {{pleasure}} in just looking at it. It might not satisfy his stomach, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> very satisfying to his eyes. He forgot {{to think of it as}} a thing to eat, but began to think of it wholly as a thing to look at and admire. He was glad he hadn't been able to break that shell.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the writer}} on {{heraldry}} Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, the red dragon of Wales originated with the standard of the 7th century king, Cadwaladr, and {{was used as a}} supporter by the Tudor dynasty (who were of Welsh origin). Queen Elizabeth, however, preferring gold, changed the royal mantle and the dragon supporter from red to gold, and some Welsh scholars still hold that the dragon of Wales is properly ruddy gold rather than gules. There may be some doubt of the Welsh origin of the dragon supporter of the Royal arms, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> used by King Henry III.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is our misfortune, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> {{not your}} fault. As for your resignation, if you crossed {{the floor of}} the House to-morrow we should not require it of you. You are {{responsible}} to your constituents only.

Whether you are with us or against us, we recognize you as one of those whose place is amongst the rulers of the people." ...|$|E
6000|$|That is very true. In {{the work}} of forming {{the hearts and minds}} of {{children}} it is [...] "line upon line, and precept upon precept" [...] that is required; and it can not be claimed that one such conversation as that of James is any thing more than one line. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> that. It would be as unreasonable to expect that one single lesson like that could effectually and completely accomplish the end in view, as that one single watering of a plant will suffice to enable it to attain completely its growth, and enable it to produce in perfection its fruits or its flowers.|$|E

50|$|It was in {{late summer}} of 2005 that the first tune {{utilizing}} a sample from Mothertrucker was spotted. That was when the California-based record producer D.J. Shadow’s Funky Skunk disc (DJ Shadow/Obey Reconstruction B000BRONYQ) was released with a sample from “Piledriver.” Then in 2010 The Alchemist + Oh No’s Gangrene album (Decon Records DCN 101) was issued replete with a sample from “Bazooka” on the tune, “Take Drugs.” What comes next for Mothertrucker <b>is</b> anyone’s guess, <b>but</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>been</b> a wild ride for Dennis The Fox who is probably laughing his ass off at this very moment.|$|R
5000|$|Nolan, {{who served}} as {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild from 1975-1980, called Martínez's selection [...] "a major breakthrough in terms of minority representation on television. It may not have been the representation that we <b>are</b> seeking now, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> a breakthrough to have a major character on television that was not white... He was just a natural, and he had this enormous sense of comedy timing." [...] Nolan noted, too, that the Pepino character, despite the stereotype, was [...] "wise" [...] and often used common sense to help the McCoys resolve their family squabbles.|$|R
60|$|That {{might have}} been a woman's speech, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> had <b>been</b> made in a girl's voice. She was neither shy nor embarrassed nor self-conscious. As she stood back from him he could not see her face in the dense twilight.|$|R
6000|$|... {57b} Sir Martin Wright is {{of opinion}} that Domesday-Book was made soon after our {{ancestors}} {{had agreed to}} tenures, i.e. the feodal system of tenure, {{for the purpose of}} ascertaining each man's fee; and he supposes that as soon as the survey was completed, the great landholders of the kingdom were summoned to London and Sarum to do homage to the king for their landed possessions. Now it may be presumed, that if Merdon had been then surrendered to the king, and any alteration made {{in the nature of the}} tenure of the lands in the manor, it would have been reported and registered in the book. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not to be found there. May it not then be justly concluded that it was passed over, and that the customs now prevailing are the same as were in use previous to the Conquest? ...|$|E
60|$|Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, {{they offer}} no greater {{difficulty}} than do corporeal structures {{on the theory}} of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt often comes into play in modifying instincts; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not indispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under widely different conditions of life, yet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of tropical and temperate South America, for instance, line their nests with mud like our British species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some instincts being not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer.|$|E
60|$|Daily {{experience}} {{proves that}} the labour employed in trade and manufactures is sufficiently productive to individuals, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not productive in the same degree to the state. Every accession to the food of a country tends to the immediate benefit of the whole society; but the fortunes made in trade tend but in a remote and uncertain manner to the same end, and in some respects have even a contrary tendency. The home trade of consumption {{is by far the}} most important trade of every nation. China is the richest country in the world, without any other. Putting then, for a moment, foreign trade out of the question, the man who, by an ingenious manufacture, obtains a double portion out of the old stock of provisions, will certainly not to be so useful to the state as the man who, by his labour, adds a single share to the former stock. The consumable commodities of silks, laces, trinkets, and expensive furniture, are undoubtedly a part of the revenue of the society; but they are the revenue only of the rich, and not of the society in general. An increase in this part of the revenue of a state, cannot, therefore, be considered of the same importance as an increase of food, which forms the principal revenue of the great mass of the people.|$|E
6000|$|On these {{occasions}} {{the lady}} was perhaps {{not the only}} member of that company who was startled, but she was startled more than the others, sometimes rising from the sofa and standing with clasped hands, the authentic portrait of terror and irresolution. It was no more than natural that Haberton should at these times reseat her with infinite tenderness, assuring her of her safety and regretting her peril in the same breath. It was perhaps right that he should finally possess himself of her gloved hand and a seat beside her on the sofa; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>was</b> highly improper for him to be in the very act of possessing himself of both hands when--boom, whiz, BANG! ...|$|R

60|$|There is, however, {{yet another}} {{peculiarity}} in Turner's painting of smooth water, which, though less deserving of admiration, as being merely a mechanical excellence, is not less wonderful than its other qualities, nor less unique--a peculiar texture, namely, {{given to the}} most delicate tints of the surface, when there is little reflection from anything except sky or atmosphere, and which, just at the points where other painters are reduced to paper, gives {{to the surface of}} Turner the greatest appearance of substantial liquidity. It is impossible to say how it is produced; it looks like some modification of body color; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not body color used as by other men, for I have seen this expedient tried over and over again without success; and it is often accompanied by crumbling touches of a dry brush, which never could have been put upon body color, and which could not have shown through underneath it. As a piece of mechanical excellence, {{it is one of the}} most remarkable things in the works of the master; and it brings the truth of his water-painting up to the last degree of perfection, often rendering those passages of it the most attractive and delightful, which from their delicacy and paleness of tint, would have been weak and papery in the hands of any other man. The best instance of it I can give, is, I think, the distance of the Devonport with the Dockyards.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this moment}} {{that is the}} only kind of {{patriotic}} poem that could satisfy the emotions of a patriotic person. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not the sort of poem that is expected from a Poet Laureate, either on the highest or the lowest theory of his office. He is either a great minstrel singing the victories of a great king, or he is a common Court official like the Groom of the Powder Closet. In the first case his praises should be true; in the second case they will nearly always be false; but in either case he must praise. And what there is for him to praise just now it would be precious hard to say. And if there is no great hope of a real poet, there is still less hope of a real prophet. What Newman called, I think, [...] "The Prophetical Office," [...] that is, the institution of an inspired protest even against an inspired religion, certainly would not do in modern England. The Court is not likely to keep a tame prophet in order to encourage him to be wild. It is not likely to pay a man to say that wolves shall howl in Downing-street and vultures build their nests in Buckingham Palace. So vast has been the progress of humanity that these two things are quite impossible. We cannot have a great poet praising kings. We cannot have a great prophet denouncing kings. So I have to fall back on a third suggestion.|$|E
60|$|This {{matter of}} {{swordfish}} charging {{the boat is}} apt to be discredited by fishermen. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not doubted by the few who know. I have seen two swordfish threaten my boat, and one charge it. Walker, an Avalon boatman, tells of a prodigious battle his angler had with a broadbill giant calculated to weigh five hundred pounds. This fight lasted eight hours. Many times the swordfish charged the boat and lost his nerve. If that propeller had stopped {{he would have gone}} through the boat {{as if it had been}} paper. After this fish freed himself he was so mad that he charged the boat repeatedly. Boschen fought a big broadbill for eleven hours. And during this fight the swordfish sounded to the bottom forty-eight times, and had to be pumped up; he led the boat almost around Catalina Island--twenty-nine miles; and he had gotten out into the channel, headed for Clemente, when he broke away. This fish did everything. I consider this battle the greatest on record. Only a man of enormous strength and endurance could have lasted so long--not to speak of the skill and wits necessary on the part of both fisherman and boatman. All fishermen fish for the big fish, though it is sport to catch any game fish, irrespective of size. But let any fisherman who has nerve see and feel a big swordfish on his line, and from that moment he is obsessed. Why, a tarpon is child's play compared to holding a fast swordfish.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in The Guardian, John Fordham commented [...] "mingling wide-interval melodies that {{sometimes}} sound like contemporary classical music and sometimes trampling funk, quiet solos or intimate duets, tonal contrasts (warm clarinet lyricism, glimmering vibraphones, free-jazz sax wailing), dynamic percussion and unrelenting eventfulness.
