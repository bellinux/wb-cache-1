5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{a decade}} of work began on the {{construction}} of the Thames Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While the <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> expected to function as designed until roughly 2070, concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed.|$|E
5000|$|Construction of the Fox Point Hurricane <b>Barrier</b> <b>was</b> begun after Hurricane Carol {{struck the}} area in 1954; the <b>barrier</b> <b>was</b> not {{completed}} until 1966.|$|R
50|$|In 1989 {{concrete}} tank <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed on}} the three south entrances. In war times these <b>barriers</b> would have <b>been</b> exploded out of their resting places. The <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> removed in 2000 during construction of the 4th bore.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the main barriers to knowledge sharing in the extended enterprise. The <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> identified through a literature review and work with industrial companies. The <b>barriers</b> have <b>been</b> categorised according to the TOP (Technology, Organisation, People) classification. The main finding is {{that the majority of}} <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> concerned with people issues...|$|R
5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the blood-brain barrier. Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The blood-brain <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the blood–brain barrier, but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{existence}} of {{barriers to entry}} (patents, rights, etc.). The most attractive segment {{is one in which}} entry <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> high and exit <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> low. Few new firms can enter and non-performing firms can exit easily.|$|R
3000|$|... [I]nterdisciplinary efforts inevitably meet <b>barriers,</b> <b>be</b> they structural, {{cognitive}} or normative. The {{questions that}} should be discussed, then <b>are</b> what these <b>barriers</b> <b>are,</b> what makes each of them a barrier and {{how can they be}} surpassed? ([9], p. 447).|$|R
50|$|Steel guard rails (since 2000s as thrie-beam barrier) and {{concrete}} profile <b>barrier</b> <b>are</b> the <b>barrier</b> systems used in expressways in the territory. The designs of their beam <b>barrier</b> <b>are</b> based in American and Australian designs {{and concrete}} based in European standards.|$|R
5|$|The Thruway {{continues}} north {{through the}} river valley toward Harriman, where it encounters the Woodbury toll barrier, the southeastern {{end of the}} mainline's major closed ticket system. The <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> located on the mainline within exit16 (NY17), a trumpet interchange. Along with the mainline barrier in Harriman, a separate toll plaza exists on the exit16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY17 exit131 (NY32). Now a completely tolled highway, the Thruway heads northward, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river's west as it serves the city of Newburgh, the village of New Paltz, {{and the city of}} Kingston, indirectly connecting to the short I-587 in the latter.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{southern}} waterfront, {{away from}} the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane <b>Barrier</b> <b>is</b> also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.|$|E
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E
50|$|Barriers {{to entry}} {{restrict}} {{the threat of}} new entrants. If the <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> high, the threat of new entrants is reduced and conversely if the <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> low, the risk of new companies venturing into a given market <b>is</b> high. <b>Barriers</b> to entry <b>are</b> advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{respective}} concepts and purposes {{of a range}} of hurricane protection barriers. The structural components of each type of <b>barrier</b> <b>are</b> discussed and common variants of the forms used in each <b>barrier</b> <b>are</b> included in the discussion. The advanced analysis used in the design of hurricane protection <b>barriers</b> <b>is</b> also reviewed with reference to purpose and procedure. Finally, the associated construction is discussed in terms of the construction sequence and advanced construction methodology...|$|R
40|$|Two two-bay {{pultruded}} {{glass fibre}} reinforced polymer (GFRP) post and rail safety <b>barriers</b> have <b>been</b> fabricated. One, a modular <b>barrier,</b> <b>was</b> fabricated from circular cross-section tubes, bolted sheet moulded composite (SMC) two-part multi-way connectors and bases. The other, a custom <b>barrier,</b> <b>was</b> fabricated from three profiles: square cross-section tubular posts, a circular cross-section tubular knee rail and a C-section hand rail. Rivets connected the hand rail to {{the tops of}} the posts and bolted bases connected the posts to the foundation. The continuous knee rail was located by means of holes in the posts’ walls. Both <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> loaded incrementally up to the general duty load applied to the hand rail and then unloaded. Their load–deformation responses were monitored and both <b>barriers</b> <b>were</b> able to support the general duty load undamaged. After unloading the maximum residual deflection of the hand rail was about 5 mm. The barriers’ mean transverse stiffnesses were evaluated and the custom <b>barrier’s</b> stiffness <b>was</b> about 46 % greater than that of the modular barrier. The custom <b>barrier</b> <b>was</b> re-tested up to the heavy duty load and was able to support the load without visible signs of damage...|$|R
5|$|Eventually, {{the party}} comes to {{discover}} that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the fight is not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E
25|$|To further {{restrict}} saltwater intrusion, in 1966, a hinged barrier {{was installed}} just upstream {{of the large}} lock. This hollow metal <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> filled with air {{to remain in the}} upright position, blocking the heavier salt water. When necessary to accommodate deep-draft vessels, the <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> flooded and sinks {{to the bottom of the}} chamber.|$|E

30|$|A {{fundamental}} {{limitation of}} site-specific mechanical <b>barriers</b> <b>is</b> {{the requirement of}} the surgeon to predict where clinically significant adhesions are likely to form in order to decide where to place the product. In addition, site-specific <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> difficult to use in laparoscopic surgery. As {{a result of these}} limitations, gel <b>barriers</b> have also <b>been</b> developed.|$|R

25|$|A {{formulation}} of imatinib with a cyclodextrin (Captisol) as a carrier {{to overcome the}} blood–brain <b>barrier</b> <b>is</b> also currently considered as an experimental drug for lowering and reversing opioid tolerance. Imatinib has shown reversal of tolerance in rats.|$|E
50|$|Shark <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> {{often made}} out of netting; {{held in place by}} a system of piles, anchors and buoys. Netted <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> {{susceptible}} to damage from strong ocean forces and so are generally limited to sheltered bays and beaches and favourable seasons and weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|Termite <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> {{materials}} {{that have been}} specifically designed to prevent subterranean termites from gaining access to a structure. Termite <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> free of pesticides and act as physical and mechanical impediments to termite foraging activity. Development of physical barriers to effectively exclude subterranean termites {{have made it possible}} to add new dimensions to integrated pest management strategies for both new and existing structures. Termite <b>barriers</b> <b>are</b> unique in that, since they contain no pesticides, they are classified as devices by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|R
