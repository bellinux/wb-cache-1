5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Edziza's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to its previous eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E

5|$|It is {{proposed}} that in 2019 World Cup, {{the number of}} teams participating will go down to 10 and all the teams will play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the semifinals. This would <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the one used in 1992 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. Great white shark hunting strategies may <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to how megalodon hunted its large prey. However, megalodon bite marks on whale fossils {{suggests that it}} employed different hunting strategies against large prey than the great white shark.|$|E
5|$|The Development Bank of Latin America has {{awarded a}} grant to RSMAS to conduct a {{feasibility}} study for a new experimental water tunnel facility located in Panama.

5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to its previous eruptions. But this would likely be abandoned {{in part because of the}} volcano's remoteness.|$|E
5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and thought to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> {{to the metal}} stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, {{it is thought that}} her steel bodice was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may <b>be</b> <b>similar.</b>|$|E

The SOHC VTEC ZC <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> to the D16Z6 ('91-'96). The DOHC ZC <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> to the D16A1, D16A3, D16A8, D16A9 and D16Z5 engines.|$|R
5|$|Archaea {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in archaea. Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|As an {{opponent}} of the Vietnam War, Bedell signed a petition urging against United States military intervention in Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war would <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|As colonies {{closer to}} each other are more genetically similar, {{independent}} colony foundation is most likely associated with nuptial flight if they disperse far from genetically similar colonies they originate from. Inseminated queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out, known as the nest-site limitation hypothesis. Some queens could even try {{to return to their}} nests that they came from after nuptial flight, but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the queens birth nest.|$|E

5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.|$|E
5|$|Bessel roughly {{estimated}} {{the period of}} the companion of Sirius to be about half a century; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851. It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to that of Sirius.|$|E
