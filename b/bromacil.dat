Field measurements of a commonly used herbicide (<b>bromacil)</b> mass beneath mulch-covered pineapple beds and inter-bed open areas revealed that open areas contained {{a mass of}} <b>bromacil</b> about 3. 5 times greater than was originally applied, based on label instructions, to the entire field.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of surficial management on water dynamics and <b>bromacil</b> concentration in the soil on a pineapple plantation using the one- (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) flow and transport models. Flow and transport processes were simulated in a 2 D vertical cross-section perpendicular to the plant rows. The 1 D simulation was limited to the open inter-bed areas. Several simulation scenarios were proposed to evaluate the effect of plastic mulch on <b>bromacil</b> transport in soil. In our simplified approach, the water and solute boundary fluxes for the non-covered areas were increased to simulate the water and solute contribution from the plastic mulch surface. The simulation results were compared with field observations of soil water potentials and resident <b>bromacil</b> concentration profiles. The field and laboratory-measured hydraulic and transport parameters were used for all simulation scenarios. Reasonably good agreement between the model-predicted and observed soil water potentials and <b>bromacil</b> concentration profiles was obtained.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In {{previous}} research, <b>bromacil</b> gave {{good performance}} {{when it was}} applied in early fall with fairly dry soil conditions and before the fall germinating weeds had started growth. On the other hand, if <b>bromacil</b> was applied in late November, December, or January on nearly saturated soil with weeds that had grown {{for one or two}} months, weed control was quite noticeably reduced. Field and greenhouse studies were conducted at Corvallis, Oregon, to determine the influence of soil moisture and time of herbicide application on <b>bromacil</b> movement and performance. In one field trial, two or six acre-inches of water were applied by sprinkler irrigation at intervals following herbicide treatment. Intervals used were one day, two, four, or eight weeks following herbicide application on dry soil. Field bioassay with rape, wheat, oats, annual bluegrass, sugar beets, and winter field peas indicated that the performance of <b>bromacil</b> applied to dry soil was not affected by differences in irrigation levels or by the time interval between application and irrigation. Bioassay of core segments taken from the top six inches of soil showed no difference due to treatment and indicated that <b>bromacil</b> was not leached below three inches regardless of irrigation treatment. Of the <b>bromacil</b> found in the top three inches, approximately half of it was in the 0 - 1 inch segment. Difficulty in duplicating fall conditions appeared to have a definite effect on results of field studies. Extensive loss of soil moisture due to evaporation was probably the main factor causing deviation from the desired conditions. Another field trial included 0 -, 1. 5 -, 3 -, and 6 -inch sprinkler irrigation rates on an annual bluegrass stand which had been treated with either pre- or post-emergence applications of <b>bromacil.</b> Irrigations were applied immediately after the post-emergence treatment. Both pre- and post-emergence applications of <b>bromacil</b> gave good control of annual bluegrass regardless of subsequent post-emergence irrigation. However, total precipitation during the first month was only 0. 25 inches and where there was no irrigation, <b>bromacil</b> did not give adequate control. Greenhouse leaching studies with soil columns did not give satisfactory results. Consistent patterns of leaching throughout replications could not be accomplished. When <b>bromacil</b> movement was determined by the use of soil columns and subirrigation with 1. 5 inches of water, {{there was no difference in}} movement whether it was applied to water-saturated or dry soil. A preliminary experiment with a shorter subirrigation period, however, resulted in less movement of the <b>bromacil</b> applied to dry soil. <b>Bromacil</b> movement in soil by subirrigation is not the same as leaching downward.

The results showed that <b>bromacil</b> was the less retarded compound followed by atrazine and lindaneAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 007) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium des Innern, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} at Estacao Experimental de Citricultura de Bebedouro, SP {{to evaluate the}} response of glyphosate-resistant horseweed and hairy fleabane biotypes to herbicides glyphosate, <b>bromacil</b> + diuron, diuron e paraquat isolated and in mixture and effect of a sequential application of glyphosate. The experimental design was of complete randomized blocks with four replication and seven treatments. The herbicides were applied with costal sprayer, constant pressure with three nozzles TT 110015, the equivalent spray volume was 150 L ha(- 1). The control was visually evaluated, trough percentile note scale. The best results were obtained to general control of weed with diuron isolated and glyphosate in mixture with <b>bromacil</b> + diuron while to glyphosate-resistant horseweed and hairy fleabane {{there was no difference}} between the treatments. After sequential application to Conyza sp control, the best treatment was obtained associated with diuron and bromacil+diuron...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicide}} <b>bromacil</b> {{has been}} extensively used in the Spanish Mediterranean region, and although plant protection products containing <b>bromacil</b> have been withdrawn by the European Union, this compound is still frequently detected in surface and ground water of this area. However, the fast and complete disappearance of this compound has been observed in water intended for human consumption, {{after it has been}} subjected to chlorination. There is a concern about the possible degradation products formed, since they might be present in drinking water and might be hazardous. In this work, the sensitive full-spectrum acquisition, high resolution and exact mass capabilities of hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry have allowed the discovery and proposal of structures of transformation products (TPs) of <b>bromacil</b> in water subjected to chlorination. Different ground water samples spiked at 0. 5 [*]µg/mL were subjected to the conventional chlorination procedure applied to drinking waters, sampling 2 -mL aliquots at different time intervals (1, 10 and 30 [*]min). The corresponding non-spiked water was used as control sample in each experiment. Afterwards, 50 μL of the water was directly injected into an ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) /electrospray ionization (ESI) -(Q) TOF system. The QTOF instrument enabled the simultaneous recording of two acquisition functions at different collision energies (MSE approach) : the low-energy (LE) function, fixed at 4 [*]eV, and the high-energy (HE) function, with a collision energy ramp from 15 to 40 [*]eV. This approach enables the simultaneous acquisition of both parent (deprotonated and protonated molecules) and fragment ions in a single injection. The low mass errors observed for the deprotonated and protonated molecules (detected in LE function) allowed the assignment of a highly probable molecular formula. Fragment ions and neutral losses were investigated in both LE and HE spectra to elucidate the structures of the TPs found. For those compounds that displayed poor fragmentation, product ion scan (MS/MS) experiments were also performed. On processing the data with specialized software (MetaboLynx), four <b>bromacil</b> TPs were detected and their structures were elucidated. To our knowledge, two of them had not previously been reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} thiocarbamates (S-ethyldipropylthiocarbamate and diallate), {{substituted}} ureas (monuron and diuron), and uracils (<b>bromacil</b> and terbacil) on lipid metabolism in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) leaves was investigated under nonphotosynthetic conditions. The uptake of [1 - 14 C]acetate by leaf disks was inhibited by the thiocarbamates and marginally by the substituted ureas, {{but not by}} the uracil herbicides. The uptake of [methyl- 14 C]choline was inhibited {{to a lesser extent}} by thiocarbamates, while the other herbicides showed a slight stimulation. The thiocarbamates almost completely inhibited uptake of [32 P]orthophosphate at 1. 0 mM concentration, while diuron and terbacil showed significant inhibition. [1 - 14 C]Acetate incorporation into lipids was inhibited only by diallate. [methyl- 14 C]Choline incorporation into the choline phosphoglycerides was inhibited by diallate, diuron, and <b>bromacil.</b> The incorporation of [32 P]orthophosphate into phospholipids was substantially inhibited (over 90 % at 1. 0 mM) by the thiocarbamates, but not by the other herbicides. [35 S]Sulfate incorporation into sulfoquinovosyl diglycerides was markedly inhibited only by the thiocarbamates. Fatty acid synthesis by isolated chloroplasts was inhibited 40 – 85 % by thiocarbamates, substituted ureas, and <b>bromacil,</b> but not by terbacil. The inhibitory effect of the urea derivatives was reversible, but that of thiocarbamates was irreversible. sn-Glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase(s) of the chloroplast and microsomal fractions were profoundly inhibited by thiocarbamates, but not by the other two groups of herbicides. Phosphatidic acid phosphatase was insensitive to all the herbicides tested...|$|E
30|$|This study {{investigated}} the phytotoxicity of herbicides applied singly or as mixtures to different crops under greenhouse conditions. Growth inhibition of the crops was taken {{as an indicator of}} phytotoxicity. Phytotoxicity of mixtures was estimated by calculating EC 50 value in toxic units. EC 50 (mg/kg soil) of Alachlor, <b>Bromacil</b> and/or Diuron were: 11.37, 4.77, 1.64, respectively, on melon; 0.11, 0.08, 0.24, respectively, on molokhia, and 3.91, 3.08, 1.83, respectively, on wheat. EC 50 values of binary mixture tests of (Alachlor + Bromacil), (Alachlor + Diuron), and (Bromacil + Diuron) were 12.21, 5.84, 10.22 on melon, 0.982, 925.4, 38.1 on molokhia, and 0.673, 1.34, 0.644 on wheat. Tertiary mixture tests showed EC 50 values (TU/kg soil) of (Alachlor + Bromacil + Diuron) was 633.9 on melon, 3.02 on molokhia and 32.174 on wheat. Diuron was more toxic than Alachlor and <b>Bromacil</b> to the tested crops based on individual tests. Molokhia was the most sensitive crop to herbicides. Binary mixtures showed a synergistic effect as compared to the tertiary mixtures.|$|E
30|$|Alachlor, <b>Bromacil</b> and Diuron are {{herbicides}} {{widely used}} for weed control {{all over the}} world. Alachlor is a chloroacetanilide herbicide, used to control annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds in fields of corn, soybeans and peanuts. It inhibits protein synthesis in plant roots (Walker and Lawrence 1992). <b>Bromacil</b> belongs to Uracil family of herbicides used for brush control on non-cropland areas. It is especially useful against perennial grasses and used for selective weed control in pineapple and citrus crops (Redondo 1997). Diuron, {{one of the most}} commonly used herbicides, belongs to Urea derivatives that are applied in pre-emergence and post-emergence to control broadleaf weeds {{in a wide variety of}} annual and perennial broadleaf and grass weeds (Field et al. 1997; Gooddy et al. 2002). It has been classified as a slightly hazardous pesticide by WHO (USEPA 1994; Malato et al. 2002). Diuron is relatively persistent in the environment with a half-life of over 300  days.|$|E
