5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide <b>bond</b> <b>formation,</b> and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide <b>bond</b> <b>formation,</b> and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group.

They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated {{from a large}} pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon <b>bond</b> <b>formation,</b> and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction.

25|$|Deoxyribozymes, {{also called}} DNAzymes or {{catalytic}} DNA, are first discovered in 1994 and quickly {{emerged as a}} new class of metalloenzymes. Almost all DNAzymes require metal ions for their function; thus they are classified as metalloenzymes.

40|$|Electrical {{characteristics}} {{improvement of}} the fluorinated metal/SiO 2 /HfO 2 /SiO 2 /Si (MOHOS) flash memory using gate fluorine ion implantation (GFI) process has been investigated. Si-F or Hf-F <b>bonds</b> <b>formation</b> due to fluorine incorporation can reduce undesirable charges trapping and leakage path creation in the tunneling oxide, which consequently increases the program/erase (P/E) speed and endurance. Moreover, fluorinated flash memory not only enhances P/E efficiency, but also improves the data retention characteristic, which {{can be explained by}} more deep-level traps and reduced leakage path due to fluorine incorporation. P/E window closure during endurance stressing is significantly suppressed for the fluorinated flash memory, which can be also ascribed to stronger Si-F or Hf-F <b>bonds</b> <b>formation</b> within the dielectrics due to fluorine incorporation. However, the fluorinated MOHOS flash memory clearly exhibits apparent erase-saturation phenomenon due to higher electric field across on blocking oxide. The results clearly indicate the fluorinated flash memory using GFI process to simultaneously fabricate fluorinated OHO dielectrics becomes a feasible technology for future MOHOS-type nonvolatile flash memory application...|$|R
