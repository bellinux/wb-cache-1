40|$|Lateral force {{components}} and impacts from couplers can adversely affect wagon stability. These issues are significant in longer and heavier trains increasing risk of wagon roll over, wheel climb, wagon body pitch, <b>bogie</b> <b>pitch</b> and wagon lift off. Modelling of coupler angles {{has been added}} to normal longitudinal train simulation toallow comprehensive study of lateral components of coupler forces. Lateral coupler forces are then combined with centripetal inertia calculations to allow quasi static lateral forces, quasi static vertical forces and quasi static bogie L/V to be calculated allowing study of stringlining, buckling or wagon rollover risks. The approach taken allows for the different rollingstock lengths, overhang and coupling lengths and allows angles occurring in transitions to also be studied. Wagon body and <b>bogie</b> <b>pitch</b> is also studied with enhancements added to previous modelling to allow study of wagon lift off...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a fuzzy model is {{developed}} to predict wagon wheel unloading due to wagon body and <b>bogie</b> <b>pitch</b> modes induced by longitudinal impact forces. Data was obtained using the wagon dynamics simulation package, VAMPIRE [R] with a wagon model typical of wagons in Australian freight service. Simulations were completed for 31 states of wagon body mass from empty to maximum load, 8 to 62 tonne and 31 states of longitudinal force were applied making 961 scenarios. Four 2 -input 1 -output fuzzy systems {{were developed to}} predict wheel unloading for each axle using wagon mass and the impact force magnitude as inputs. A cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm {{was used to determine}} a complete set fuzzy rules for this system together with defining fuzzy set definitions. The fuzzy model produced was then evaluated for its suitability as a predictive model...|$|E
40|$|The {{tradition}} of treating train dynamics and wagons dynamics as two separate problems {{continues to be}} supported by both software and standards. The assumption that coupler angles are so small that the consequential vertical and lateral force components can be ignored does not necessarily hold as trains become heavier and longer and coupler forces become larger. In the Australian AS 7509 standard the wagon rollover risk from lateral forces is assessed only at slow speed and given an allowance of 100 % wheel unloading. Conversely, wagon unloading, in response to curve geometry at speed, is given a limit 60 % (excluding transients) and 80 % maximum when including effects of the track geometry and typical irregularities. If wind loads are added the criteria is lifted to 90 % wheel unloading. Lateral coupler forces, coupler misalignment due to empty wagons in loaded trains and wagon body and <b>bogie</b> <b>pitch</b> are examined. The effect of combining {{all of these issues}} is discussed. The results lead, logically, to a discussion of operational assessment verses wagon roadworthiness assessment...|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 shows that, {{within the}} {{frequency}} range analyzed, {{there are numerous}} alternating peaks and valleys in the vertical vibration of the car body and bogie. The peaks and valleys are mainly caused by mutual interference of the four wheelsets. If two wheelsets of the bogie move in the same direction, the bogie has vertical motion and no pitching motion; if the wheelsets move in opposite directions, the <b>bogie</b> has <b>pitching</b> motion and no vertical motion. Similarly, if two bogies move in the same direction, the car body has vertical motion and no pitching motion; if two bogies move in opposite directions, the car body has pitching motion and no vertical motion.

40|$|This paper investigates numerically {{the flow}} and {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{of a complex}} landing gear using Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES). The case studied is a six-wheel main landing gear with some medium and small components included, which has been measured previously in wind tunnel. The {{aim of this study}} is to extend landing gear modelling to more complicated geometry and to understand the unsteady aerodynamic loads and flow features around landing gears with complex configuration. A meshing strategy based on unstructured mesh is used to cope with the geometrical complexity. Carefully chosen refinement zones and structured boundary layer meshes are employed to improve the mesh quality, which helped to ensure the accuracy for the DDES simulation. A hex-dominated mesh with 37 million cells was generated with resolved boundary mesh using 10 - 21 layers on all landing gear components. It is found that flow around the bogie is more complex due to stronger interactions between wheels in close proximity for the six-wheel bogie. Other components, such as wheel axles, <b>bogie</b> <b>pitch</b> trimmer, forward dressing link and after torque link introduces flow unsteadiness in the bogie region. Statistics of mean and RMS forces for all components of the main landing gear are obtained. The drag on the front pair of wheels was found to be lower than the middle and the back wheels. The presence of forward and after side stays (or diagonal struts) on the landing gear possibly creates asymmetry in the flow field. This asymmetric flow features further changes the separation on and around the wheels and influence its wake region. The presence of the components like side stays, forward dressing link and the after torque link changes the wake pattern behind the cylindrical strut. This increases the mean drag coefficient of the main strut compared to that of a simple cylinder with similar geometrical dimensions. This suggests that smaller components may play a significant role in changing flow features around a bigger component. The RMS side force coefficient of the main strut is higher than the RMS lift and drag coefficients, indicating a possibility of strong interaction between the main strut and wheels. Also, efforts are made to understand the unsteadiness in the landing gear wake. This study contributes to the limited literature available for aircraft main landing gear configurations with more geometrical details...|$|E

40|$|The {{traction}} control in modern electric and diesel electric locomotives has allowed rail operators to utilise high traction adhesion levels without undue {{risk of damage}} from uncontrolled wheel spin. At the same time, some locomotive manufacturers have developed passive steering locomotive bogies to reduce wheel rail wear and further improve locomotive adhesion performance on curves. High locomotive traction loads in curving are known to cause the loss of steering performance in passive steering bogies. At present there are few publications on the curving performance of locomotive steering with linkage bogies. The most extreme traction curving cases of low speed and high adhesion for hauling locomotives have not been fully investigated, with effects of coupler forces and cant excess being generally ignored. This paper presents a simulation study for three axle bogie locomotives in pusher and pulling train positions on tight curves. The simulation study uses moderate and high traction adhesion levels of 16. 6 % and 37 % for various rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed, showing forced steering bogies to have considerable advantages over self steering bogies. Likewise it is shown that self steering bogies are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As the required traction adhesion approaches the rail friction coefficient, steering performance of all bogies degrades and yaw of the bogie frame relative to the track increases. Operation with excess cant and tensile coupler forces are both found to be detrimental to the wear performance of all locomotive bogies, increasing the bogie frame yaw angles. <b>Bogie</b> frame <b>pitching</b> is also found to have significant effect on steering, causing increased performance differences between bogie designs...|$|R
