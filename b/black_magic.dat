5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{deviates}} {{from the}} style of customisable characters featured {{in the last two}} titles by reviving the character class concept, which designates a character to a certain role in battle. For example, Vivi is designated as a black mage and is the only character who can use <b>black</b> <b>magic,</b> and Steiner is a knight and is the only character who can use sword skills.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on {{the usage}} of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found {{the death of the}} sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by {{touching}} her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and <b>black</b> <b>magic</b> are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya.|$|E

50|$|Earth magic filters ley line energy through {{plants and}} animals and, {{although}} slower than ley line magic, is just as powerful. It is associated with living things, potions, amulets, and charms. Spells can sometimes be stored and called upon later. Earth magic can actually alter one's physical appearance or shape. The effects are permanent unless doused in saltwater. Earth magic tends {{to be associated with}} white magic users since it is more difficult {{to gain access to the}} materials necessary for <b>black</b> earth <b>magic.</b> <b>Black</b> earth <b>magic</b> involves the sacrifice of animals and, in some cases, humans or Inderlanders.|$|R

5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and <b>Black</b> <b>magic</b> shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E

He also espoused the view that any Pagan {{who was involved in}} the U.S. government or military was a hypocrite. He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and <b>black</b> <b>magic,</b> commenting that it had racial overtones and that many of those advocating such a view were racist.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of <b>black</b> <b>magic</b> in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E
5|$|Timber the Tiger's parents go {{on holiday}} and leave their son {{in charge of}} the island they live on, leaving him and his friends to {{organize}} a race. Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil intergalactic pig-wizard named Wizpig arrives at Timber's Island and attempts to take it over after having conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the island's four guardians (Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon) into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involve cars, hovercrafts, and aeroplanes. Drumstick the Rooster, the best racer on the island, failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig's <b>black</b> <b>magic.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some {{people in the country}} believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in <b>black</b> <b>magic</b> and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|In Matamoros and Brownsville, curanderos – {{practitioners}} of curanderismo – offered works {{of white and}} <b>black</b> <b>magic.</b> These services are known as brujería (witchcraft). People consult healers and fortune tellers for help with relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to make someone fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them to drive away negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her as a person who endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she was young, and her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more protective of her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E
5|$|In The Tempest, Shakespeare {{presents}} {{two powerful}} sorcerers, Prospero and Sycorax, who have both controlled the island. Initially {{it appears that}} the two characters are a contrasting pair: the benevolent Prospero and the rapacious Sycorax. However, upon closer analysis, {{the differences between the two}} characters disappear and the similarities grow. For example, Prospero, like Sycorax, coerces Ariel into doing his bidding, using the sprite to regain his inheritance as a Duke, and tortures Caliban with magic the way Sycorax tortured Ariel. Also, both Prospero and Sycorax were exiled from their respective homelands and both have children, which was possibly the reason why they were both spared being executed. The fine line between Sycorax's <b>black</b> <b>magic</b> and Prospero's white blurs even further during his renunciation of magic in Act V, a speech which has strong parallels to one given by the dark witch Medea in the Metamorphoses. In comparing himself to Medea, Prospero is implicitly comparing himself to Sycorax. Emphasizing the relationship between Prospero and Sycorax demonstrates the ambiguity of Prospero's supposedly benevolent character.|$|E

5|$|Mohini plays {{a lesser}} {{role in a}} Shaiva legend in the Skanda Purana. Here, Vishnu as Mohini joins Shiva to teach a lesson to arrogant sages. A group of sages are {{performing}} rituals in a forest, and start to consider themselves as gods. To humble them, Shiva {{takes the form of}} an attractive young beggar (Bhikshatana) and Vishnu becomes Mohini, his wife. While the sages fall for Mohini, their women wildly chase Shiva. When they regain their senses, they perform a <b>black</b> <b>magic</b> sacrifice, which produces a serpent, a lion, an elephant (or tiger) and a dwarf, all of which are overpowered by Shiva. Shiva then dances on the dwarf and takes the form of Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. The legend is retold in the Tamil Kovil Puranam and Kandha Puranam with some variation. This legend is also told in the Sthala Purana related to the Chidambaram Temple dedicated to Shiva-Nataraja.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of <b>black</b> <b>magic</b> or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
5|$|The tournament to crown {{the inaugural}} CMLL World Heavyweight Champion ran from May 24 to June 9, 1991, and {{featured}} 16 competitors. The {{first round of}} the tournament saw two eight-man battle royals, each ending when four wrestlers were left in the ring. This was used to cut the field in half with the last four remaining wrestlers from each match advancing to the next round. Konnan, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., <b>Black</b> <b>Magic,</b> and Mascara Ano 2000 advanced in the first battle royal, while Brazo de Plata, Vampiro Canadiense, Universo 2000, and El Egipcio were eliminated. In the second battle royal, Nitron, Pierroth Jr., Pirata Morgan, and Cien Caras advanced while Fabulous Blondie, Gran Markus Jr., Máscara Sagrada, and El Egipcio were eliminated. The second round saw another pair of battle royals with four men in each, ending when two wrestlers were left in the ring. This narrowed the tournament down to the final four wrestlers, who faced off in traditional semi-finals matches, before the final match to crown the inaugural champion.|$|E
50|$|The film {{tells how}} certain beliefs are so dear {{to some people}} and how, if someone tries to distort that belief either by force or by money, get the rebound. The uncle of Paramu who tried to detain chilambu with forces fails miserably and the {{jewellery}} merchant and the foreigner who {{tried to make the}} chilambu their own with money also fails miserably. In a way the film tells how important beliefs are despite modernism and scientific innovations. Yet whether Paramu could make a good life after possessing the chilambu (which in a way asserts the truth value of belief systems) remains as an unanswered question. It is also interesting to note how Ambika is successfully twisting and making use of the opportunity for a better life which is denied to her (she has a bad omen) because of similar belief systems. Her brother who has turned from medicine to <b>black</b> <b>magics</b> also remains as a contradictory symbol of these belief systems and rituals.|$|R
