25|$|As a discipline, project {{management}} developed from several fields of application including civil construction, engineering, and heavy defense activity. Two forefathers of {{project management}} are Henry Gantt, called {{the father of}} planning and control techniques, who is famous for {{his use of the}} Gantt chart as a project management tool (alternatively Harmonogram first proposed by Karol Adamiecki); and Henri Fayol for his creation of the five management functions that form the foundation of the body of knowledge associated with project and program management. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of scientific management. His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (WBS) and resource allocation.|$|E

Users can create, manage, edit and report work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures.</b> Work <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> have different abstraction levels, so the information can be tracked at any level. Usually, project workforce management has approval hierarchies. Each workflow created will go through several records before it becomes an organisational or project standard. This helps the organisation to reduce the inefficiencies of the process, as it is audited by many stakeholders.|$|R

40|$|The term karst {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} {{in this paper}} to denote the totality of processes and phenomena of gravitational and/or hydrodynamic destruction of the ceiling of a karst cavity and of the overlying sediments. It refers {{not only to the}} existence of a surface subsidence (collapse) feature but, first of all, to the "internal" (hidden in the subsurface) structures that precede development of a surface form. This study reports and discusses the results of direct mapping and examination of <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> in the gypsum karst of the Western Ukraine, at the level of their origin, i. e. in caves. The accessibility of numerous laterally extensive maze cave systems in the region provided an excellent opportunity for such an approach, which made it possible {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> and particular morphogenetic or geological features in caves, and to reveal stages of breakdown development. It is found that breakdown is initiated mainly at specific speleogenetically or geologically "weakened" localities, which classify into a few distinct types. The most of breakdowns, which are potent to propagate through the overburden, relate with the outlet cupolas/domepits that represent places where water had discharged out of a cave to the upper aquifer during the period of transverse artesian speleogenesis. Distribution of <b>breakdown</b> <b>structures</b> does not correlate particularly well with the size of the master passages. Several distinct mechanisms of breakdown development are revealed, and most of them proceed in several stages. They are guided by speleogenetic, geological and hydrogeological factors. The study confirms that a speleogenetic approach is indispensable to the understanding of breakdown pre-requisites and mechanisms, as well as for eventual subsidence hazard assessment. Direct observations in caves, aimed both at speleogenetic investigation and breakdown characterization on regional or site-specific levels, should be employed wherever possible...|$|R
