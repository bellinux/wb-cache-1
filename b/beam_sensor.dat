40|$|The {{quality of}} Continuous Casting (CC) {{products}} are highly {{connected to the}} flow of the liquid metal and injected argon inside the mould. Therefore, both physical and numerical modelling has been performed to investigate the metal flow inside the CC mould. A physical model has been used for investigating the flow inside the mould. Therefore, it uses a re-circulating technique along with a Bi-Sn alloy for representing the liquid steel. Moreover, velocity measurements using a Vives electromagnetic probe have been carried out where typical CC flow structures such as jet, upper and lower rolls were found. Overall, good contact between the metal and the Vives probe was achieved. The experiments showed that argon bubbles were possible to both count and classify using a high-speed camera with a framing rate of 500 frames per second. Almost 45 % of the bubbles were discovered in the middle region of the mould (20 % of the mould top surface area, central plane parallel to the wide faces). It was also found that the nozzle was misaligned. Levels of both alloy and the covering silicone oil were measured simultaneously using a Light <b>beam</b> <b>sensor,</b> which measured both levels at high accuracy. The usage of argon made the oil dirty, which in time made impossible to measure the level using the Light <b>beam</b> <b>sensor.</b> Argon bubbles along with a thin silicone oil layer were numerical modelled using a Discrete Phase Model combined with a Volume Of Fluid in a three dimensional model. This was solved using ANSYS Fluent 14. 5. 7. The fluid flow fields give streamlines that allows for further investigating of the flow patterns inside the model. In addition to these, more quantities can be post-processed for investigating different features of the flow.

40|$|The {{radiographic}} {{goal of the}} FXR Optimization Project is {{to generate}} an x-ray pulse with peak energy of 19 MeV, spot-size of 1. 5 mm, a dose of 500 rad, and duration of 60 ns. The electrical objectives are to generate a 3 kA electron-beam and refine our 16 MV accelerator so that the voltage does not vary more than 1 %-rms. In a multi-cell linear induction accelerator, like FXR, {{the timing of the}} acceleration pulses relative to the beam is critical. The pulses must be timed optimally so that a cell is at full voltage before the beam arrives and does not drop until the beam passes. In order to stay within the energy-variation budget, the synchronization between the cells and beam arrival must be controlled to a couple of nanoseconds. Therefore, temporal measurements must be accurate to a fraction of a nanosecond. FXR Optimization Project developed a one-giga-sample per second (gs/s) data acquisition system to record <b>beam</b> <b>sensor</b> data. Signal processing algorithms were written to determine cell timing with an uncertainty of a fraction of a nanosecond. However, the uncertainty in the sensor delay was still a few nanoseconds. This error had to be reduced if we are {{to improve the quality of}} the electron beam. Two types of sensors are used to align the cell voltage pulse against the beam current. The beam current is measured with resistive-wall sensors. The cell voltages are read with capacitive voltage monitors. Sensor delays can be traced to two mechanisms: (1) the sensors are not co-located at the beam and cell interaction points, and (2) the sensors have different length jumper cables and other components that connect them to the standard-length coaxial cables of the data acquisition system. Using the physical locations and dimensions of the sensor components, and the dielectric constant of the materials, delay times were computed. Relative to the cell voltage, the beam current was theoretically reporting late by 7. 7 ns. Two experiments were performed to verify and refine the sensor delay correction. In the first experiment, the beam was allowed to drift through a cell that was not pulsed. The beam induces a potential into the cell that is read by the voltage monitor. Analysis of the data indicated that the <b>beam</b> <b>sensor</b> signal was likely 7. 1 ns late. In the second experiment, the beam current is calculated from the injector diode voltage that is the sum of the cell voltages. A 7 ns correction produced a very good match between the signals from the two types of sensors. For simplicity, we selected a correction factor that advanced the current signals by 7 ns. This should reduce the uncertainty in the temporal measurements to less than 1 ns...|$|E

Direction insensitive sensors (two mat sensors and one light <b>beam</b> <b>sensor)</b> were additionally tested as a reference. Bidirectional counting data of free people flow was collected for 36 days in one-hour resolution, including five hours of manual counting. Compared to the manual results, one of the light beam sensors had the most equally balanced directional overall counting errors (4. 6 % and 5. 2 %). The collected data of this sensor was used to model the air transportation energy consumption of visitor counting sensor-based DCV and constant air volume ventilation (CAV). The results suggest that potential savings in air transportation energy consumption could be gained with the modeled DCV as its total daily airflow during the test period was 54 % of the total daily airflow of the modeled CAV on average. A virtually real-time control of ventilation could be realized with minute-level counting resolution.

Since the late 1960 `s it has been serving high energy physics (HEP - proton beam) users of both slow and fast extracted beams. The AGS fixed target program presently uses primary proton and heavy ion beams (HIP) in slowly extracted fashion over spill lengths of 1. 5 to 4. 0 seconds. Extraction is accomplished by flattoping the main and extraction magnets and exciting a third integer resonance in the AGS. Over the long spill times, control of the subharmonic amplitude components up to a frequency of 1 kilohertz is very crucial. One of the most critical contributions to spill modulation is due to the AGS MMPS. An active filter was developed to reduce these frequencies and it`s operation is described in a previous paper. However there are still frequency components in the 60 - 720 Hz sub-harmonic ripple range, modulating the spill structure due to extraction power supplies and any remaining structures on the AGS MMPS.

The volumetric flow-rate measurement is done by counting vortices using a flat plate placed in the wake and attached to the <b>beam</b> <b>sensor.</b> By optimizing the geometrical arrangement, the search for a significant signal has shown {{that it was possible to}} get a quasi-periodic signal, within a good range of flow rates so that its performances are well deduced.

Therefore, a dimensionless quantity is introduced, the reduced digital volume (Vr) that takes into account the average speed in the contracted section downstream of the bluff body. The reduced digital volume is found to be independent of the confinement in a significant range of Reynolds numbers, which gives the device a good accuracy. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|This thesis details a {{non-destructive}} type of tomographic {{technique to}} monitor corrosion under insulation. This method requires a radioactive source, where a detector-source pair {{is mounted on}} a circular gantry located around the periphery of a steel pipe. A radioactive source with an appropriate activity was chosen based on {{the thickness of the}} pipe under test. In order to detect gamma rays, photon scintillation detectors are required. A Thallium-activated Sodium Iodide (NaI(Tl)) detector crystal was used. Stability tests were conducted on the detectors before they were ready to be used. A portable hardware to house the detector and source was then designed and built. The system is able to operate without the need for an outlet socket to enable it to be used in remote locations where power supply may be unavailable. For testing purposes, artificial corrosion defects were created by grinding the surface of the pipeline under the insulation by a minimum of 2 mm in depth and by placing foreign objects (wood splinters and pebbles) under the pipeline insulation. A modified parallel <b>beam</b> <b>sensor</b> geometry was implemented to measure the intensity of the incident beam after passing through the pipeline under test. The Backprojection method of tomogram reconstruction without the need for sensitivity matrices was used.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 On the {{microscopic}} scale, water is complex {{due to its}} unique molecular structure and bonding capabilities. This interfacial water has been studied for nearly 200 years, since Helmholtz first proposed his model of water at a charged surface (1850 s). In biology, charged surfaces are everywhere and in addition, are hydrophilic, rough and irregular in geometry. These features contribute to interfacial water's spectroscopic, electrical and mechanical distinctiveness from bulk water. While the ordering and extent of interfacial water from a surface has a long, controversial history, long-range water ordering on the hundreds of nanometers to hundreds of microns scale has been confirmed and measured {{at a variety of}} biological interfaces and next to many hydrogels and hydrophilic surfaces. One hypothesis for such long-range ordering is called the exclusion zone (EZ). EZs are found next to many hydrophilic surfaces and are characterized by the exclusion of microsphere suspensions, colloids, dyes and some solutes from boundary layers 100 - 300 μm in thickness. In this dissertation, the EZ phenomenon was established {{to be based on the}} separation of charge between the (negatively charged) interfacial EZ water and the bulk (proton-enriched) water zone beyond the EZ (PEZ). We hypothesize, that based on charge separation, there is a significant electrostatic force that exists between the EZ and PEZ. A Nafion tube, which has previously demonstrated robust EZs, was attached to the tip of a custom-fabricated ribbon-like <b>beam</b> <b>sensor.</b> The geometry of the ribbon blocked one side of the Nafion tube and obstructed proton diffusion, thus unilateral force would develop on the contralateral side and be measured by the sensor. When water was added, the tube hydrated and the sensor measured a force of 22 ± 2 μN. pH-sensitive dye measurements of the region confirmed an electrostatic interaction since proton distributions were confirmed to be heavily weighted on the unblocked side of sensor and in the same direction as the measured deflection. Significant electrostatic forces at hydrophilic interfaces in water may play a role in a diverse array of processes in nature, such as protein folding, adhesion and water harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{characterisation}} {{of fluid}} flow at tidal energy sites {{is critical for}} cost effective Tidal Energy Converter (TEC) design in terms of efficiency and survivability. The standard instrumentation in tidal site characterisation has been Diverging acoustic-Beam Doppler Profilers (DBDPs) which remotely measure the flow over a range of scales, resolving up to three velocity vectors. However, they are understood to have several drawbacks particularly in terms of characterising turbulent aspects of the flow. This characterisation is generally based upon {{a small number of}} key transient metrics, the accuracy of which directly impacts TEC designs. This work presents an optimisation and performance assessment of newly available Single Beam Doppler Profilers (SBDPs) mounted on a commercial-scale tidal turbine at mid-channel depth in a real operating environment. It was hypothesised that SBDPs would have advantages over DBDPs for site characterisation, in terms of reduced random error, reduced uncertainty in turbulence intensities and the ability to quantify the structure of the turbulent flow. The relationship between random error, sensor orientation and flow speed is quantified for both single and diverging <b>beam</b> <b>sensor</b> types. Random error was found to increase with increasing flow velocity as a power law, the slope of which varies for different sensor orientations. Quantification of noise offers a practical method to correct turbulence metrics. To enable the use of multiple acoustic sensors mounted in close proximity, interference was quantified and mitigation techniques examined. Cross-talk between sensors of the same type were generally shown to bias measurements towards zero. In the presence of alternate types of acoustic sensors, interference caused an increase in standard deviation of velocity results. Implementing a timing offset control mechanism was able to mitigate this effect. This work has achieved a greater understanding of the drivers (spatial separation, inclination angle, pulse power) and effects on measurements of interference along with ambient-noise for users of acoustic instruments. Lessons learned of value to the industry, as site characterisation work intensifies ahead of next generation commercial scale devices, are presented. Mid-channel depth mounted SBDPs were found to have advantages over seabed mounted DBDPs in resolving the key turbulent flow metrics. SBDPs were able to resolve integral length-scales of turbulence that show an anisotropic ratio of scales as predicted from theory and in work at similar sites, while the DBDPs results were similar for all directions. Turbulence intensity measurements were found to be similar after noise correction, with the SBDPs more able to accurately capture the turbulence dissipation rate. This evidence suggests that SBDP arrays present a significant improvement over bottom mounted DBDPs in discerning information {{about the nature of the}} turbulent flow, and thus future site characterisation work should consider the use of SBDPs alongside bottom mounted DBDPs for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|Pest and {{diseases}} in agricultural systems reduce the yield {{and quality of}} available food and feed worldwide. To meet the global growing demand for these products, losses should be reduced, preferably in a sustainable way. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable method that aims to minimize economic losses due to pests {{and diseases}}. IPM is generally based on eight steps: 1) prevention, 2) monitoring, 3) Decision‐making based on monitoring and thresholds, 4) use of non‐chemical methods, 5) pesticide selection, 6) reduced pesticide use, 7) anti‐resistance strategies, and 8) evaluation. With these steps, {{it is possible to}} prevent and control pests and diseases whilst deploying pesticides only as a last resort, thus reducing issues with pesticide contamination and resistance. Implementation of IPM by farmers increases when it is clear that it is compatible with existing farm processes and that it results in benefits for them. Successful IPM is most commonly applied against pests and diseases in crop production. When comparing the number of research articles on IPM in crop production with the number of research articles on IPM in animal production, it becomes clear that a paucity of scientific papers have been published on the latter. In laying hen facilities, for example, the application of all but basic IPM is still rare, even though the benefits of IPM have been described for poultry pests and disease vectors. In laying hen facilities Dermanyssus gallinae (PRM=poultry red mite), an hematophagous parasite, is common {{in many parts of the}} world. This mite is hard to control and negatively affects hen health, ‐welfare and farm economics, with estimated costs of infestation reaching 130 million euro per year in Europe. Currently, implementation of IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities is limited to some combination of cleaning between flocks, limited preventive measures, and application of chemically or physically acting products. Implementation of more advanced IPM programmes for D. gallinae should therefore be considered to improve control prospects for this pest in laying hen facilities.   This thesis focuses on the knowledge necessary for advancing IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. More specifically it focuses on prevention, monitoring and population modelling of this significant pest, with preventive measures and monitoring being key in advancing IPM per se. Knowledge assessment. To develop IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities, biological and ecological knowledge of D. gallinae and knowledge of the effects of biotic and a‐biotic factors on this pests’ population development are required (Chapter 2). Therefore, a seminar was organized with eighteen D. gallinae researchers, from eight different European countries, with the aim of amassing existing expertise. This seminar gave insight into the current knowledge and knowledge gaps, regarding D. gallinae, also informing future perspectives and required developments for improving control of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. During four sessions, the researchers present discussed lifecycle issues, effects of D. gallinae on hen and egg production, monitoring methods for D. gallinae infestations in laying hen facilities and control methods for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. It was concluded that, where the D. gallinae lifecycle is concerned, a lot is still unknown about the mites feeding behaviour and preferences, mating behaviour, survival and conditions required for reproduction, host finding, aggregation cues, and attractant and repellent substances. When focusing on the effects of D. gallinae on the hen and on egg production it was agreed that a D. gallinae infestation is likely to result in higher water intake, lower egg production, lower feed conversion, increase of the immune response and reduced feather quality. It was also suggested that these effects may be hen genotype dependent, and further noted that effects are rarely quantified and need further investigation. Though monitoring was considered to be most important to improve control of D. gallinae, it was concluded that the available monitoring methods only indicate trends and a robust monitoring plan is lacking. The participants considered heating the hen house combined with a chemical treatment to be the most promising control method. Future promising developments for control of D. gallinae were considered to be use of vaccination, predatory mites and entomopathogenic fungi. The effects of D. gallinae on human health were not extensively discussed, but it was concluded that D. gallinae can be of medical significance, either directly via reaction to mite bites, or indirectly via human exposure to the chemicals used to control D. gallinae. Prevention. To acquire knowledge on the routes of introduction and spread of D. gallinae in laying hens facilities, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system was used (Chapter 3). The structure of this system allows the user to identify the risk factors and the critical control points for the introduction and spread of pathogens and parasites. This method was further used to identify preventive and corrective actions against D. gallinae. Four experts identified 41 hazards for introduction and spread of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. To prevent these hazards, these experts made several suggestions for corrective actions. The risks of 41 hazards were calculated by multiplying the likelihood (1 = occurring seldomly/theoretically; 2 = occurring approximately once a year; 3 = occurring repeatedly/more than once a year) by the severity (1 = low / single place in the facility becomes infested with D. gallinae; 2 = moderate/ facility becomes infested at more than one location; 3 = high/ D. gallinae infestation occurs at almost all places within the laying hen facility) of infestation. Hazards with a risk above 3, or with a severity of 3, were regarded as Critical Control Points (CCP’s). The CCP’s with the highest risks (risk of 6 and higher) for introduction of D. gallinae in laying hen facilities were: introduction of new flocks, containers and crates, the farmer and their employees. The CCP’s with the highest risks (risk of 6 and higher) for spread of D. gallinae between laying hen facilities were mice, rats and flies, wild birds, the feeding system, shared material and equipment, the egg conveyer belt, manure aeration pipes, removal of cadavers, visitors and external personnel, the farmer and their employees. The critical limits, a procedure step of the HACCP system which will be followed by a corrective action when the limit is exceeded, could not be determined as a result of lack of knowledge about thresholds. Subsequently,  suggestions  were made  for monitoring the mite population and for documentation and validation. A checklist was devised using the corrective action from the CCP’s with the highest risks. This management tool for layer farmers was evaluated by UK and Dutch layer farmers as feasible and useful. Monitoring. The approach of Reflexive Interactive Design (RIO) was used to design an automated monitoring tool for D. gallinae, including an automated mite detection sensor (Chapter 6). The approach generated effective and technically feasible solutions for the key functions of the automated mite detection sensor, these being 1) the assessment of the D. gallinae population, 2) localizing the location and assessing the time of detection and 3) removal of mites from the detection area. Three different design concepts were designed using these solutions. As an additional, albeit proven essential step to the RIO approach, the main solutions were tested with live mites ensuring the alignment of solutions with the biology and behaviour of D. gallinae in vivo. A combination of the best solutions were developed in two different prototypes. These prototypes were subsequently tested in the laboratory and on farm. The prototype situated under the perch,  with a through <b>beam</b> <b>sensor</b> and a pump to remove mites from the sensor after recording, was the most successful model. The designed automated mite detection sensor, or automated mite counter, for D. gallinae was subsequently validated in experimental laying hen cages with live birds and a growing population of D. gallinae (Chapter 5). The study resulted in 17 data points, each being a combination of ‘number of mites counted’ by the automated mite counter and the ‘number of mites present’ in the experimental laying hen cages. The regression line between the ‘number of mites counted’ and the ‘number of mites present’ demonstrated that the automated mite counter was able to track the D. gallinae population effectively. Population modelling. Step 2 of IPM describes not only pest monitoring in the field, but also ‘scientifically sound warning, forecasting and early diagnosis systems, where feasible, as well as the use of advice from professionally qualified advisors’. To advance this step for D. gallinae  we  developed  and  demonstrated  an  operational  model,  forecasting  the  mite population dynamics and evaluating and forecasting the effect of a treatment application for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. For IPM this model and the required inputs need to be 1) labour‐extensive with minimal staff input, preferably automatically implementing “real time” measurement   data   into   models;    2)    operational,   providing   easily   interpretable  data, forecasting pest population dynamics and the moment a threshold will be exceeded; 3) able to  compensate  for  different  locations  and  time‐specific‐interactions  and  variables (e. g. management and temperature), enabling the handling of variability of the parameters of interest; 4) able to identify pest hotspots; 5) able to estimate and forecast treatment efficacy; and   6)  applicable  for  different  monitoring  methods  and  therefore  able  to  correct  for monitoring  measurement  errors.  Prior  to  the  development  of  the  population  dynamics model a high variation in population growth was found which could be only partly explained by temperature, flock age, treatment, and compartment/laying hen facility. A substantial part of the total variation remained unexplained, or was found to be temporal. As a result of this   partly  temporal  variation,   a  dynamic  approach  was   suggested  to   improve   the forecasting quality of a population dynamics model. With the input of population monitoring data,   temperature   data   and   information   of   the   dates   of   any   D.  gallinae   treatment interventions, the developed model was able to forecast the population dynamics of D. gallinae post treatment and without treatment while compensating for location and time specific interactions, handling the variability of the parameters. Moreover, this population dynamics model was able to forecast the D. gallinae population using data from different monitoring methods. Together with the models compatibility with different housing systems and its ability to forecast the mite population dynamics (requiring only three relative easy obtainable parameters), this model is an improvement over existing approaches for forecasting D. gallinae that could contribute to steps 2 and 8 of IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities. The results from this study directly facilitate advanced IPM programmes for D. gallinae in laying facilities. The new ‘products’ developed are tools for prevention, monitoring, forecasting population dynamics and evaluating treatment effects, representing the requirements of IPM steps 1, 2, and 8. Indirectly the results may accelerate the development of new control measures, with knowledge acquired through use of the developed products it also is likely to contribute to IPM steps 3, 4, 6 and 8 in the future; e. g. the determination of an action threshold, and a tool advising farmers on the most effective and economic time for applying a corrective action or hotspot treatment for D. gallinae.   With the obtained knowledge and new products implemented to control D. gallinae in laying hen farms, major advances can be made in IPM for this pest. More specifically, as a result of this work IPM for D. gallinae in laying hen facilities can be advanced by the identification of preventative control measures, the development of an automated monitoring tool and a model forecasting mite population dynamics and evaluating applied treatments. Consequently, the results of this study can be expected to improve hen health, welfare and farm economics for the egg production industry. In the future, advances in other IPM programmes can be expected when the obtained knowledge, tools and methods are transferred to other pest species in multiple sectors...|$|E

As to other fundamental monitoring program components such as layout of measuring points, measuring frequency, they were usually decided as needed. The extent of the monitoring covered width of the predicted movement trough of the existing tunnel. As to the frequency of monitoring, remote readings were made once per 15 – 30  min when shield tunneling in the crossing zone. Manual monitoring was executed at night when trains stopped. Base reading were often taken 1 – 2  months {{in advance of the}} crossing construction.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} called Semantic Streams that {{allows users to}} pose declarative queries over semantic interpretations of sensor data. For example, instead of querying raw sensor data, the user can query vehicle speeds; the system decides which sensor data and which operations to use to infer the vehicle speeds. The user can also place constraints on values such as the confidence with which the speed was measured or {{the amount of energy}} consumed to measure the speeds. This framework is designed to work in a shared sensor infrastructure, where multiple queries may coexist for extended periods of time, instead of a hand-designed, single purpose sensor network. We propose a semantic service programming model and describe a service description language and a query processor that support the programming model. We demonstrate how this system can be used with a network of video, magnetometer, and infrared break <b>beam</b> <b>sensors</b> deployed in a parking garage...|$|R

These include coherent bremsstrahlung radiators {{to be used in}} this facility for generating the photon beam, a fine resolution hodoscope for the facility’s tagging spectrometer, and a photon <b>beam</b> position <b>sensor</b> for stabilizing the beam on a collimator. The principal instrumentation project was the hodoscope: its design, implementation and beam testing will be thoroughly described. Studies of the coherent bremsstrahlung radiators involved X-ray characterization of diamond crystals to identify the appropriate line of manufactured radiators and the proper techniques for thinning them to the desired specification of the beamline. The photon <b>beam</b> position <b>sensor</b> project involved completion of a designed detector and its beam test. The results of these shorter studies will also be presented. The second part of this work discusses a Monte Carlo study of a possible photo-production and decay channel in the GlueX experiment that will be housed in the Hall D facility...|$|R
50|$|The Burt strut was {{introduced}} to replace previous timing mechanisms, whereby a chock with a sensor was placed behind the rear wheel of a car at the start. Due to the chock being related {{to the rear of}} the car at the start, and readings being taken from the front of the car at the finish, the degree of precision within which cars could be timed was limited. As most British hillclimb courses are somewhat less than 1500 yards (1372 m) long, it is not uncommon for competitors' times to be separated by only a few hundredths of a second. The introduction of theoretically more accurate light beam timing required that all cars provide a consistent surface with which to break the beam at both start and finish of the timed section. However, owing to the variable shape of vehicles and inconsistencies in the placing of the <b>beam</b> <b>sensors,</b> this was not a simple condition to meet before the introduction of the Burt strut.|$|R
