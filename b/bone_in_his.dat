5|$|A {{handful of}} days before the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Hall broke a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foot during practice and was considered unlikely to play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25passes for 398yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt returner, and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham City {{entered the}} match as favourites, {{in a contest}} billed as a {{contrast}} of styles. Watched by a crowd of 100,000 and a television audience of five million, Manchester City took an early lead through Joe Hayes, but Noel Kinsey equalised midway through the first half. Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, who continued playing despite breaking a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> neck in a collision with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his ankle. An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, Yao {{discussed}} the injury with his doctors, and the Rockets {{applied for a}} disabled player exception, {{an exception to the}} NBA Salary Cap which grants the injured player's team money to sign a free agent. The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, it was decided that Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left foot. He did not play the entire 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth {{on one of his}} testicles. The medical team quickly did tests to check for testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> backyard. Instead of a traditional script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue. They cast the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E

5|$|Davies and Caldwell {{began the}} 2012–13 season as first choice until an ankle injury {{sustained}} by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress. He kept his place after Davies returned to fitness, but chipped a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{foot in the}} defeat to Barnsley and {{was expected to be}} out for a month. Further injuries, the return to fitness of Caldwell, and the emergence of young left-back Mitch Hancox, which allowed Paul Robinson to partner Davies in the centre, meant that Pablo played only twice more, and he was released {{at the end of his}} contract.|$|E
5|$|He {{was educated}} at Harrow where, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fears of}} his family that a childhood head injury caused by a dangerous fall from a horse had seriously damaged his intellect, he showed aptitude in Greek and Latin. He made good academic progress, but after he had settled a quarrel with another pupil by an organised fist-fight, his father removed him from the school. (Fist fights were tolerated at Harrow: {{it was the fact}} of Brudenell's receiving punishment for unauthorised absence while having a broken <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand attended to by a London surgeon that had annoyed the earl.) He was subsequently educated at home. Here, as the only son among seven sisters, he developed into something of a spoilt child, accustomed to getting his own way. This is seen as a cause of his arrogance and stubbornness in later life.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe's {{management}} announced his signing to Adidas {{for an undisclosed}} six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo, leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty. To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ankle whilst jogging. However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year. In a wider arena, he was named Young Australian of the Year, ABC Sports Star of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for a cracked rib and a cracked <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand, the first broken bones he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, but after three consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not offer him a new playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} with the Lightning during the 2014–15 season, Brewer was traded after 17 games to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a third-round draft pick in 2015 on November 28, 2014. At the time, he was playing in his fifth season with the Lightning. He appeared in 17 games, and had four assists on the year. Brewer played in 246 games with Tampa, scoring 10 goals and 46 assists. He also had 180 penalty minutes in his four-and-a quarter seasons with Tampa Bay. On December 3, 2014, the Ducks announced that Brewer was expected to miss four-to-six weeks with a broken <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foot from a blocked shot.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} was a let down year {{not only for}} Durant {{but also for the}} Roughriders as a whole. The Riders stumbled out of the gate losing seven of their first eight games. Durant's production fell significantly through the course of the season. Near {{the end of the season}} Durant was playing with a broken <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foot, which ultimately lead to him missing the last two games of the regular season. The Riders would finish the year with only 5 wins and 13 loses, placing them in last place in the league. Despite the reduced production in 2011 on April 27, 2012 the Riders extended his contract through the 2014 CFL season.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
5|$|Colbeck {{had been}} playing since January with a groin injury, which {{hampered}} his preparations for the 2008–09 season and prevented him from playing in Bradford's first three pre-season friendly matches. His suspension also {{kept him out of}} Bradford's first two games of the season, but he returned for a 2–0 victory against Macclesfield Town. He provided a cross for Peter Thorne to open the scoring after ten minutes. Colbeck helped City to go top of the league six matches into the season, and although he scored his first goal of the season in the seventh game, City lost 3–1 to Bournemouth. He added a second in a 2–2 home draw with Gillingham, before he broke a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foot the following week against Grimsby Town. Colbeck was unable to play for nearly three months. He returned from injury in January by playing in two reserve games, leading up to his first-team return on 24 January as a late second-half substitute for Omar Daley in a 3–3 draw with Luton Town. Colbeck broke back into the starting eleven the following month, once again for Daley, who was ruled out for the season with his own knee injury. He was a regular in the team {{for the rest of the}} season, playing a further 16 games but he struggled for form and was unable to add to his two goals.|$|E

5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded by {{the media}} and Head Coach Alain Vigneault for improving his defensive game. He had been criticized at times in the past for making risk/reward plays that resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become more responsible in the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012–13 season Walker {{appeared}} in twenty games with HC Vítkovice and recorded one assist; he was loaned to Hokej Šumperk 2003 for three games, {{where he also}} had one assist. After {{six years in the}} Czech Republic, Walker signed a contract on 8 January 2013 with the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League, a junior ice hockey league in the United States. He made his debut for the team on 11 January against the Chicago Steel, recording a goal. After four games with the Phantoms, in which he recorded six points, Walker was named to the USHL/NHL Top Prospects Game on 23 January 2013; he replaced his teammate, who was ill. Walker played 29 games for the Phantoms during the regular season and recorded 27 points (7 goals, 20 assists). His 20 assists were good enough for fifth on the team, even though Walker only joined the team midway through the season. His season ended early due to an injury suffered in a game on 5 April where Walker broke a <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> neck {{as a result of a}} hit from behind; as a result he missed all the Phantoms playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Nakajima {{once again}} {{participated in the}} Junior League in June 2007, {{finishing}} in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting up a good fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima to a future junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured navicular <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right hand, forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase {{to hold up the}} title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand.|$|E
