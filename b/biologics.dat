5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This drug was {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the occurrence of}} indicators for suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy among ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients over time in the United States (US). Data from a large US claims database (2005 - 2013) were used to retrospectively identify patients with diagnosed with either UC or CD who were new <b>biologic</b> users. Indicators of suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy included: dose escalation during the maintenance phase, discontinuation of the initial <b>biologic,</b> switch to another <b>biologic</b> within 90 days following {{the last day of}} supply of the initial <b>biologic,</b> augmentation with a non-biologic systemic therapy, UC- or CD-related surgery, UC- or CD-related urgent care, and development of fistula (for CD only). Kaplan-Meier analyses were used. A total of 1, 699 UC and 4, 569 CD patients were included. Among UC patients, 51. 1 % and 90. 9 % experienced ≥ 1 indicator of suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy within 6 months and 36 months of <b>biologic</b> therapy initiation, respectively. Among CD patients, 54. 3 % and 91. 4 % experienced ≥ 1 indicator of suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy within 6 and 36 months of <b>biologic</b> therapy initiation, respectively. For both UC and CD patients, the most frequent indicators of suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy were discontinuation, dose escalation and augmentation. In conclusion, this study found that the occurrence of suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy is common among patients with UC and CD, with approximately 90 % of patients experiencing at least one indicator of suboptimal <b>biologic</b> therapy within 36 months of <b>biologic</b> treatment initiation...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, Eli Lilly {{formed a}} joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based {{biotechnology}} company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006, Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share. After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued, but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007. Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the <b>biologics</b> facility.

25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms.

In the processing of <b>biologics,</b> viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters.

It involves using biocatalysis and synthetic biology tools to block or supplement the actions of specific cells or proteins in the immune system. Over the past decade, CBIS has produced over 2,000 peer-reviewed publications with over 30,000 citations and currently employs over 200 scientists and engineers. The center is also used primarily to train undergraduate and graduate students, with over 1,000 undergraduates and 200 doctoral students trained. The center also has numerous academic and industry partners including the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. These partnerships have resulted in numerous advances over the last decade through new commercial developments in diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, and regenerative medicine which are a direct result of research at the center. Examples of advancements include the creation of synthetic heparin, antimicrobial coatings, detoxification chemotherapy, on-demand bio-medicine, implantable sensors, and 3D cellular array chips.|$|E
25|$|RA reduces {{lifespan}} {{on average}} {{from three to}} twelve years. According to the UK's National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Young age at onset, long disease duration, the concurrent presence of other health problems (called co-morbidity), and characteristics of severe RA—such as poor functional ability or overall health status, a lot of joint damage on x-rays, the need for hospitalisation or involvement of organs other than the joints—have been shown to associate with higher mortality". Positive responses to treatment may indicate a better prognosis. A 2005 study by the Mayo Clinic noted that RA sufferers suffer a doubled risk of heart disease, independent of other risk factors such as diabetes, alcohol abuse, and elevated cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index. The mechanism by which RA causes this increased risk remains unknown; the presence of chronic inflammation has been proposed as a contributing factor. It {{is possible that the}} use of new biologic drug therapies extend the lifespan of people with RA and reduce the risk and progression of atherosclerosis. This is based on cohort and registry studies, and still remains hypothetical. It is still uncertain whether <b>biologics</b> improve vascular function in RA or not.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for publications published by 28 September 2012 using five different electronic databases; this search was complemented by a manual search. Two reviewers conducted the study selection, data collection, and validity assessment. The PRISMA criteria were applied. From 615 titles identified by the search strategy, 14 publications were included and six were suitable for meta-analyses. RESULTS: Included studies were published from the years 1924 to 2012. They differed with regard to measurements of the <b>biologic</b> width. Mean values of the <b>biologic</b> width obtained from two meta-analyses ranged from 2. 15 to 2. 30 mm, but large intra- and inter-individual variances (subject sample range: 0. 2 - 6. 73 mm) were observed.
