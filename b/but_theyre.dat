excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I

waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was l/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him l or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly well off I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him 111 know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all 111 be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a--e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 5 o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Bums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time

Granted, its not like theyre the next Danielson or something, but The Royalty does sound much more similar to, say, a power-pop Arcade Fire than 90% of worship music. In fact, if you were to listen to The Royalty without the lyrics, you wouldnt be able to tell its a worship album at all. Thats a terrific testament to the originality present. Sometimes the style contrasts with the plainly worshipful lyrics so much that the listener is forced to do a double take; while neither The Royal Royals style nor lyricism are unexplored, they havent been combined quite like this." [...] However, Fraser cautioned that [...] "Now dont get too excited yet, theres still much work to be done for the Ontario natives. Theres a lot of inconsistency littered throughout The Royalty <b>but</b> when <b>theyre</b> at their best, the result is striking...Theres quite simply more songwriting talent here than in other acts, yet its still undeveloped. At this point it may just be that The Royal Royal are still sort of naïve.

Hyacinth is heartbroken, and by the time Artem is healed enough to go to her she has become a priestess at the temple of Athena, and having become a priestess, under oath, she is unable to leave or to marry.

5000|$|Barry Weber of Allmusic {{reviewed}} the Rainbow album and {{spoke of the}} song, stating [...] "The albums leading singles, [...] "The River Unbroken" [...] and [...] "Could I Have Your Autograph," [...] are somewhat intriguing, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> certainly {{not strong enough to}} survive the glossy, overtly polished production. Even Parton sounds somewhat distanced by the music, as her vocals seem lost and bored, almost like this record was made (and probably was, come to think of it) on a punch-in/punch-out routine schedule." ...|$|E
5000|$|On Rotten Tomatoes {{the film}} holds {{a rating of}} 31%, based on 224 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The sites {{consensus}} reads, [...] "Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp make for an appealing pair of leads, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> {{not enough to make}} up for The Lone Rangers bland script, bloated length, and blaring action overkill." [...] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating [...] "generally unfavorable reviews".|$|E
50|$|In {{summarizing}} the records themes, Spin noted: Live Through This {{is both a}} scruffier and more commercial record than Pretty on the Inside. The angsty rants of yore remain, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> decorated {{with a lot more}} poetry. Milk (as in mothers) is a recurring motif, as is dismemberment. Female victimization remains the overall theme, this time depersonalized into odd, accusatory mini-narratives in which a variety of female characters receive the protection of Loves tense, manic-depressive singing. Hers is a natural songwriting talent, full of excellent instincts, and yet wildly unsophisticated.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, The Times {{influential}} {{fashion editor}} Prudence Glynn described Bowler as: [...] "one {{of the most}} successful shoe designers in this country". Bowler said she only used leather in her designs - finding plastic too difficult to work - and she commented {{on the state of the}} British shoe industry, saying: [...] "The English tanners produce some of the most beautiful and the most exciting of leathers. <b>But</b> <b>theyre</b> hopeless about selling, about promotion, about deliveries. They are quite unaware of the pressures of the industry they supply".|$|E
5000|$|An Almost Perfect Moment was Kirshenbaums fifth novel. It {{describes}} [...] "Valentine Kessler, a Jewish teenager {{living in}} Brooklyn, who is dead-ringer for the Virgin Mary as {{she appeared to}} Bernadette at Lourdes." [...] According to Frances Taliaferro in the Washington Post the novel does not mock her condition, [...] "the real wonder of An Almost Perfect Moment is that, halfway into it, youve begun to care about Kirshenbaums characters. Theyre deeply, even ludicrously flawed, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> not figures of fun because they all carry the existential burden of loneliness and the fear that [...] "in time it would mutate into something worse than loneliness: the surrender to it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Blackacidevil {{was widely}} criticized for its {{apparent}} shift in musical direction {{and was not}} well received by most critics. Glenn Danzig discussed Blackacidevils reception: [...] "That album worked exactly the way I wanted it to, basically, it shook {{a lot of stuff}} up. People either loved it or hated it, and {{we got a lot of}} new fans from its release. Hey, maybe some of the people who only liked [...] "Mother" [...] dropped out, and Ive always said those fans are okay, when you get this big MTV exposure, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> not permanent fans. The core following you have is your most important thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert said, [...] "first half is a spare, creepy {{science fiction}} parable, {{and then it}} shifts into a {{high-tech}} action picture. Both halves work. Whether they work together is a good question." [...] He gave the film {{three out of four}} stars and praised the performances of the actors, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan: [...] "He has only three or four scenes, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> of central importance, and he brings true horror to them." [...] On the critical side, he said the film [...] "never satisfactorily comes full circle" [...] and missed the opportunity [...] "to do what the best science fiction does, and use the future as a way to critique the present." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{litany of}} issues {{confronted by the}} Berenstain Bears over their fifty years of {{publication}} include bullying, messiness, poor sportsmanship, visiting the dentist, online safety, and childhood obesity, among countless others. The Berenstains often drew inspiration from their own family experiences, which Stan credited for the series continued relevance: [...] "Kids still tell fibs and they mess up their rooms and they still throw tantrums in the supermarket...Nobody gets shot. No violence. There are problems, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> the kind of typical family problems everyone goes through." [...] The couple also claimed, in response to criticism of the characterization of Papa and Mama Bear, that those characters were heavily inspired by Stan and Jan Berenstain themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Also, {{amidst the}} several controversies {{surrounding}} Americas Sweethearts release, Love accused Virgin Records {{of putting the}} final product out before it was finished. According to her, the record company chose the songs, the cover, the recorded vocals and the final arrangements without her participation: [...] "...I made five good songs. I had twelve songs, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> not on the album. I had no creative control." [...] Furthermore, according to BMI and ASCAPs websites, four of the songs on the album ("But Julian Im a Little Bit Older Than You", [...] "Almost Golden" [...] and both singles, [...] "Mono" [...] and [...] "Hold on to Me") werent officially registered for copyright collect. By late 2006, {{the legal status of}} all of them seemed to have been corrected.|$|E
5000|$|Discussing Real Sounds production, Eno {{has stated}} that [...] "I got tired of CG graphics. I didnt {{want people to think}} that they could predict what Warp would do next. Also, I had a chance to visit people who are {{visually}} disabled, and I learned that there are blind people who play action games. Of course, theyre not able to have the full experience, and theyre kind of trying to force themselves to be able to play, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> making the effort. So I thought that if you turn off the monitor, both of you are just hearing the game. So after you finish the game, you can have an equal conversation about it with a blind person. Thats an inspiration behind this game as well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{critic for}} Tiny Mix Tapes rated the album 4 stars out of 5, writing: On Christmas in the Heart...it’s not the heat, but the bitter cold, {{the kind you}} feel in {{northern}} Minnesnowtasic. These are traditional numbers, aged but not antiquated. In keeping with releases like Good as I Been to You and World Gone Wrong, the album features Dylan exorcising the musical spirits of the land. Some will rank it among other gimcrack releases, like Dylan & the Dead. Still others will categorize it as an oddity, like Self Portrait. It’s all and none of these. These songs are Dylan’s latest exploits, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> deathly sincere (and jolly), as serious and kitschy as Theme Time Radio Hour. It’s the music that introduces old Disney films, an album as dense and allusive as his other recent outings.|$|E
5000|$|... "Evil Walks": [...] "As {{the name}} says, evil walks. Its everywhere. Actually {{its just a}} catchy title with a catchy tune. We were playing it at the {{beginning}} and I said, those chords sound dead evil. And thats usually how we do it - just sitting around and nattering and thinking and jamming away, and someone says something like evil walks and thats it. Some crud just sent me a letter - addressed to Bon too - sending us these stupid things. Some people are sick. If they want to go God-bothering they should go God-bother the Pope. He needs it. We dont...I had one idiot trying to blast away in my earhole. He started with Do you believe in God? and I said Ive no interest in it so leave me alone. Their main beef is songs like Highway to Hell. <b>But</b> <b>theyre</b> just titles. Its only a song." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite Boll’s {{announcement}} that Postal {{would be given}} a wide release on October 12, 2007, it was delayed until May 23, 2008. Additionally, on 16 May, theater distributors pulled out of their deal for a wide release of 1,500 screens to a limited release of only four screens. Said Boll of the change, [...] "Theatrical distributors are boycotting Postal because of its political content. We were prepared to open on 1,500 screens all across America on May 23rd. Any multiplex in the U.S. should have space for us, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> afraid... We have even tried to buy a few screens in New York City and Los Angeles, and they wont let us even rent the theaters! I urge independent exhibitors to contact us and book Postal! Audiences have been expecting the film and I dont think exhibitors should censor what gets played in U.S. theaters." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speak No Evil was one {{of several}} albums Shorter {{recorded}} for Blue Note in 1964. At the same time, he was also active in Miles Daviss band, and so it is unlikely that Speak No Evil received any special attention {{at the time of its}} release. But the passage of time has led to the album being generally regarded as Shorters finest, and also a highlight of the Blue Note catalogue. The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested [...] "Core Collection" [...] calling it [...] "by far Shorters most satisfying record". Allmusic assigns the album five stars. Murray Horwitz stated in 2001 that [...] "Speak No Evil is sort of a consolidation of Wayne Shorters compositional excellence. Its so thorough and consistent and wide-ranging. Its almost a manifesto for his ideas. Those ideas were new 40 years ago, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> still fresh today." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{opening night}} of the Maurizio Cattelan {{retrospective}} at the Guggenheim Museum of New York, a Hummer stretch limo with the words “TOILETPAPER” printed on the side was not-so-discreetly parked outside the museum. The images in the magazine might {{appear to have been}} appropriated from world’s most surreal stock-photograph service, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> all made from scratch. “Every issue starts with a theme, always something basic and general, like love or greed,” Cattelan has explained. “Then, as we start, we move like a painter on a canvas, layering and building up the issue. We always find ourselves in a place we didn’t expect to be. The best images are the result of improvisation". Many images are rejected, he said, because theyre [...] "not Toiletpaper enough". What makes a Toiletpaper photo? [...] "We keep homing in on what a Toiletpaper image is. Like distilling a perfume. Its not about one particular style or time frame; what makes them Toiletpaper is a special twist. An uncanny ambiguity." ...|$|E
5000|$|Coronation Street {{describes}} Owen as [...] "tough-but-tender". Crowther {{described him}} as [...] "a bit controlling" [...] having brought up Izzy and Katy alone.

Collinson added that Owen is a [...] "very different bad boy" [...] and potentially dangerous. In December 2010, Puleston-Davies defended Owens violent nature and manipulative ways, saying, [...] "Hes not an evil man with an axe, or a hammer! Everything he does has reasoning behind it. Hes got morals - <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> his own morals. Dont write Owen off - hes not an out-and-out bad guy... honest!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Terri Schwartz from IGN {{gave the}} first episode a rating of 8.0/10, saying, [...] "Designated Survivor is a strong debut for a show that will fit well {{alongside}} Quantico and Scandal in ABCs government-set political drama lineup." [...] Variety said that the episode [...] "does everything it needs to, checking off the necessary boxes for the unwilling American hero-president in efficient, compelling scenes." [...] Chuck Barney from Mercury News called {{the first episode}} [...] "suspenseful". Writing for TV Insider, Matt Roush compared Designated Survivor with other series as he said [...] "falls niftiest new drama has West Wing idealism, Homeland suspense and House of Cards political intrigue in its robust and compelling DNA." [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively about the show and the premiere, praising Sutherlands performance and commented on the symbol of Sutherlands glasses as he said, [...] "The glasses hes wearing serve {{as a way to}} tell us this {{is a different kind of}} hero, <b>but</b> <b>theyre</b> also a form of camouflage, making it easier for us to understand why so many people would underestimate this man." ...|$|E
