After West won the election, he chose McNary to <b>be</b> <b>special</b> legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of monster cards, which are color-coded and vary in the methods {{by which they}} are summoned.

All other types of cards need to <b>be</b> <b>Special</b> Summoned by fulfilling the summoning requirements detailed below. Fusion, Synchro, Xyz and Link Monsters are stored in an Extra Deck separate from the Main Deck (where destroyed Pendulum Monsters are also placed). These cards may be resummoned from the graveyard provided they were successfully summoned beforehand, though if they are returned to the Extra Deck, the player will need to fulfill the summoning requirements once more to summon them again.|$|E
25|$|Advances {{in science}} and {{technology}} brought on by World War II, and continued Canadian industrialization, previously interrupted by the Great Depression, created a demand for a more highly trained population. Howard Hillen Kerr was given control of nine Ontario Training and Re-establishment centres to accomplish this. His vision of what these institutions would do was broader than what others were suggesting. In 1943, he visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was convinced Canada could develop its own MIT over one hundred years. Along the way, such an institution could respond to the society's needs. When the Province approved the idea of technical institutes in 1946, it proposed to found several. It turned out all but one would <b>be</b> <b>special</b> purpose schools, such as the mining school. Only the Toronto retraining centre, which became the Ryerson Institute of Technology in 1948, would become a multi-program campus, Kerr’s future MIT of Canada. This vision is reflected in Ryerson's Motto and its mission statement.|$|E

It recommended (1) there should <b>be</b> <b>special</b> regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. The jury did not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E
25|$|The FJ Crawler {{was first}} offered in 2007 (for the 2008 model year) {{and is the}} result of a {{collaboration}} between Dealer Services International (DSI), known for building high quality custom packages for new vehicle dealers, and ARB, who has a long history building rugged off-road products. For participating Toyota new vehicle dealerships, the FJ Crawler could <b>be</b> <b>special</b> ordered for customers who were looking for a vehicle that is even more rugged and off-road ready than a standard Off-Road Package factory option would provide. The FJ Crawler package included an ARB Front Bull Bar Bumper, an Old Man Emu 3-inch suspension lift to support the added weight of the ARB bumper and to allow for the 17-inch Pro Comp wheels with either 33 or 35-inch off-roading tires. The FJ Crawler was able to be customized in many ways with many optional accessories to achieve the customers satisfaction. For example, the FJ Crawler could be ordered in any factory color for the current model year. The customer could choose from 3 different wheel choices, 3 different tire choices, and could even choose the exact springs and shocks used in the Old Man Emu suspension to achieve the desired ride/performance quality. There was also the option of adding accessories such as a Warn winch, IFP driving lights which would be mounted to the ARB bumper, a fog light kit for the ARB bumper, and an ARB roof rack for storing gear and other items. Other options included a cat-back exhaust system, a high flow intake, as well as side steps. Also, because of variances in aftermarket tire sizes, speedometer calibration was provided to ensure correct vehicle speed and mileage are recorded.|$|E
25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to <b>be</b> <b>special.</b> Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E
