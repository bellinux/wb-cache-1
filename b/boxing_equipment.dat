40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} {{the design and}} construction of a race team <b>equipment</b> <b>box.</b> This <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> was located on the rear of a modified golf cart. The rear half of the golf cart was modified by creating framework around the rear so that the <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> would rest on top {{and be able to}} detach from it. The <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> was able to hold all necessary equipment that is needed in the pits. Each items location was placed ergonomically so they can be reached with ease in an efficient manner. Located {{on both sides of the}} <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> were tires holders. These tire holders swivel 360 degrees so the tires can be sanded. The <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> has one shelf in it so that there are two areas to store parts. Once the project was completed, a “fit check” was done to make sure the <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> could hold all that it needed. It was found that the <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> met all specifications put into place and exceeded expectations. The <b>equipment</b> <b>box</b> was able to hold over 500 lbs. of equipment and still function properly. It also had an area for a third tire to be held. The tire holders worked well and were able to hold the tire while also being able to swivel to the four different positions...|$|R

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{nature of}} the scoring process in amateur boxing has led to continual problems for the sport over many years. The success of various approaches to implement scoring systems is discussed elsewhere [1]. An attempt is being made to develop an automated scoring and performance analysis system for amateur boxing to improve scoring objectivity [2]. The automated impact scoring system (AISS) uses subtly modified <b>boxing</b> <b>equipment.</b> It has been adopted {{for use in a}} modified, low-risk form of competitive boxing called Box’Tag®, where the head is excluded from the target zone and there are additional target areas on the shoulders [1 - 3].

40|$|AbstractA fully {{automated}} impact sensing system (AISS) {{is being developed}} {{in an effort to}} overcome scoring controversies that have beset amateur boxing throughout its history. The AISS uses subtly modified <b>boxing</b> <b>equipment</b> that incorporates ‘smart’ fabrics. An impact is detected when an electrically conductive region on a glove connects with an electrically active region on another garment such that this completes a circuit. The contact information is transmitted via Bluetooth to a ringside computer, where customised software synchronises the contact information with footage from two digital video cameras and provides for storage and playback. At present, the AISS is primarily used to support a modified, low-risk form of competitive boxing called Box’Tag® and an evaluation of the performance of the AISS has been conducted in that setting. The overall validity of scores recorded by the system was explored in 32 competitive rounds of Box’Tag contests. Whilst live scores were provided during competition, the video and sensor data were later reviewed to investigate in detail the accuracy of the scoring system. The AISS was found to correctly detect ∼ 90 % of all legitimate impacts. Analysis was carried out to gain insights into the reasons for the ∼ 10 % incidence of false negatives. More than a third of false negatives are associated with impacts to target zones located on the shoulders. The rate of false positive scores registered by the AISS during Box’Tag bouts was approximately 0. 15 scores per boxer per minute. The AISS is currently performing at a level that makes it highly suitable for use in regular Box’Tag® competitions...|$|E

40|$|My {{project was}} based {{in the city of}} Dubrovnik, located in Southern Croatia. I had {{developed}} a proposal for a new “boutique” hotel to be constructed along the newly paved avenue through the centre of the city. Although some of the population had now been displaced I wanted to concentrate on the large tourist trade already present in the present day Dubrovnik. The hotel would only be small, catering for at least 7 families with 5 standard rooms and two penthouses located on the top level. There is a coffee shop located on the second level for the tenants only {{but there is also a}} bar and a restaurant on the bottom which is open towards the public. The restaurant, bar and entrance to the hotel all extend out on to the new main road. The only way to enter the hotel is through the lift system, which now I consider possibly a bad idea and stairs would have been more than adequate. Each room is around ninety square metres, with their own bar, walk-in closet, bathrooms and king size beds. They also all have large balconies with the unique “skin” curtain which can open and close at the touch of a button. The penthouses are both made to have two levels each with bedrooms located on the top level and seating/entertaining areas on the bottom level. They both have their miniature kitchen areas and bars. Next to the main hotel is the gym facilities and day spa with an outdoor pool located on the top level. The gym has a spin room and gymnastics area where classes are held with <b>boxing</b> <b>equipment</b> available. The second level has a day spa and small hairdresser. There are changing facilities as well below the pool and toilets. To access these levels patrons must use a lift. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|E
