Methods: In this randomized crossover study patients were assigned to receive latanoprost plus either dorzolamide or <b>brinzolamide</b> for four weeks. Thereafter, patients underwent 24 -hour IOP monitoring while continuing to receive dorzolamide (for two successive days/nights: at first bid then tid) or <b>brinzolamide</b> bid (once overnight). They were then switched over to receive the other test medication for a further four weeks and subsequently reexamined for 24 -hour IOP. A questionnaire survey on treatment satisfaction was performed. Results: In 20 patients dorzolamide bid or tid or <b>brinzolamide</b> bid exerted significant (p &lt; 0. 001) reductions of IOP from baseline at all time-points over 24 hours; no difference was detected among the treatment regimens.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the eff ect of topical travoprost and <b>brinzolamide</b> on retrobulbar fl ow velocities and ocular pulse amplitude in glaucoma patients. Methods Twenty patients with glaucoma underwent color doppler imaging {{of the central}} retinal, temporal and nasal short posterior ciliary and ophthalmic artery, as well as Pascal dynamic contour tonometry and ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) measurement at baseline without treatment (timepoint 1, T 1), after 1 month of travoprost (T 2) and subsequently after 3 months of travoprost and <b>brinzolamide</b> (T 3). A multivariate model {{was used to evaluate}} the changes in retrobulbar fl ow velocities and OPA. Results In the temporal posterior ciliary artery, the fl ow velocities remained unchanged after administration of travoprost (7. 9 at T 1 versus 7. 7 cm/s at T 2, p= 0. 55 and 2. 6 versus 2. 7 cm/s, p= 0. 36 for peak systolic and end diastolic velocity respectively). Peak systolic velocity signifi cantly increased after addition of <b>brinzolamide</b> compared to travoprost alone (8. 7 cm/s at T 3, p= 0. 003), which was a borderline increase as compared to baseline (p= 0. 05), whereas end diastolic velocity signifi cantly increased as compared to baseline (2. 9 cm/s, p= 0. 001).

40|$|Michele IesterClinica Oculistica, University of Genoa, ItalyAbstract: <b>Brinzolamide</b> is a {{white powder}} commercially {{formulated}} as a 1 % ophthalmic suspension to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). Pharmacologically, <b>brinzolamide</b> is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible, and effective inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), able to suppress formation of aqueous humor {{in the eye and}} thus to decrease IOP. Several clinical trials have evaluated its safety and the most commonly ocular adverse events are blurred vision (3 %&ndash; 8 %), ocular discomfort (1. 8 %&ndash; 5. 9 %), and eye pain (0. 7 %&ndash; 4. 0 %). <b>Brinzolamide</b> has been introduced to treat ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma. In some clinical studies {{it has been estimated that}} <b>brinzolamide</b> reduced IOP by was about 18 %. <b>Brinzolamide</b> can be added to beta-blockers and prostaglandins. In the latter combination, because prostaglandin derivatives improve the uveoscleral outflow but also increase the activity of CA in ciliary epithelium with a secondary increase in aqueous humor secretion, and slightly reduce the efficacy of prostaglandin analogues, theoretically topical CA inhibitors (CAI) decrease IOP by inhibiting CA-II, thus improving prostaglandin efficacy as well as lowering IOP. <b>Brinzolamide</b> could have a secondary possible effect on ocular flow too. Some clinical studies showed a mild improvement of ocular blood flow. Theoretically, CAI could give rise to metabolic acidosis, with secondary vasodilatation and improvement of blood flow. Systemic acidosis can occur in the setting of oral CAI therapy, and local acidosis within ocular tissues is theoretically possible with topical CAI therapy, with the potential for a local increase in ocular blood flow. In conclusion, topical CAI treatment has efficacy in IOP-lowering ranging from 15 % to 20 %. From published data, <b>brinzolamide</b> can be used as first-line medication, even if other medications have a higher efficacy, with few side effects and it is a good adjunctive treatment.

METHODS: Fifteen patients with OAG were evaluated in a randomised, cross-over, double-blind study. They were treated with either <b>brinzolamide</b> or dorzolamide for 3 months and then crossed-over after a 4 -week washout period. They were given timolol during a 4 -week run-in period and during washout. The following were performed after run-in, after washout and after each treatment period: adverse events check, measurement of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, blood pressure, heart rate, and intraocular pressure, and fundus examination. Ocular blood flow was assessed using confocal scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (HRF) and colour Doppler imaging (CDI). Retinal oxygenation levels were determined using a non-invasive measurement of haemoglobin oxygen saturation by digital photographic fundus oximetry. RESULTS: Both <b>brinzolamide</b> and dorzolamide {{reduced the number of}} zero-flow pixels in the retina as measured by HRF, suggesting an increase in retinal blood flow (- 6. 86 and - 0. 452 respectively) with <b>brinzolamide</b> treatment resulting in fewer zero-flow pixels than dorzolamide (- 6. 41) (p = 0. 024).

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Only few drugs with limited efficacy {{are available for}} topical treatment of equine glaucoma. Objective: To evaluate the effect of topical administration of 1 % <b>brinzolamide</b> on intraocular pressure (IOP) in clinically normal horses. Methods: Healthy mature horses (n = 20) with normal ocular findings, were studied. The IOP was measured 5 times daily (7000, 1100, 1500, 1900 and 2300 h) over 10 days, On Days 1 and 2, baseline values were established. On Days 3 - 5 one eye of each horse was treated with one drop of 1 % <b>brinzolamide</b> every 24 h immediately following the 0700 h measurement. On Days 6 - 8 the same eye was treated with 1 % <b>brinzolamide</b> every 12 h (0700 and 1900 h). Measurements on Days 9 and 10 documented the return of IOP to baseline values.

In our study we used newborn Wistar rats raised in two litters. Newborn rats (n= 17) were randomized to either intraperitoneal <b>brinzolamide</b> in dose 200 mg/kg (n= 9) or saline (n= 8), twice daily from days 2 to 7. After 5 days of recovery all rats were euthanized. Six paraffin-embedded sections prepared in a standard manner and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To investigate the damage, we evaluated the number of cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the thicknesses of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL). The cells in GCL and the thicknesses of the IPL, INL, and ONL at a distance between 375 and 625 μm from the optic disc were measured.

40|$|Introduction. This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the safety and efficacy of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % suspension (Azopt® 1 %) and travoprost 0. 004 % (Travatan®) combined therapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who {{are in need of}} additional intraocular pressure lowering. Material and methods. This is a prospective, three-month, open-label, clinical study. Forty patients (80 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension on Travatan® treatment and with unsatis-factory results in lowering intraocular pressure were included in the study. The qualifying intraocular pressure on previous treatment with Travatan® (at least 6 weeks) was 22 - 36 mmHg in at least one eye at 8 a. m. intraocular pressure measurements at three eligibility visits. The patients received <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % twice a day in addition to travoprost 0. 004 % given once a day in the evening for 3 months. The follow-up examinations assessing the safety and efficacy of combined therapy of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % and travoprost 0. 004 % were performed after 1 and 3 months. Results. Adjunctive therapy with <b>brinzolamide</b> resulted in statistically significant reductions in intraocular pressure from the travoprost baseline at all visits. Treatment with brinzolamide/travoprost caused statistically significant sustained reduction in intraocular pressure with the reduction of 17. 39 % (p< 0. 001) after 4 weeks and 20. 08 % (p< 0. 001) after 12 weeks. The intraocular pressure change from the baseline ranged from - 3. 9 mmHg after 4 weeks to - 4. 48 mmHg after 12 weeks. The most frequently related adverse effect was abnormal taste and blurred vision. Conclusion. <b>Brinzolamide</b> 1 % (b. i. d.) used adjunctively with travoprost 0. 004 % (q. d.) lowers intraocular pressure significantly compared to travoprost alone.

Methods: We initially enrolled 44 eyes from 44 primary open angle glaucoma patients, {{and a total of}} 42 patients completed the study. All patients were under treatment with various prostaglandin F 2 α analogs and dorzolamide 1 %/timolol 0. 5 %. While maintaining the prostaglandin F 2 α analog, dorzolamide 1 %/timolol 0. 5 % was switched to <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 %/timolol 0. 5 %. Conjunctival hyperemia, superficial punctate keratopathy, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Adverse events and patient preferences, measured using a questionnaire at study initiation and at 24 weeks, were also noted. Results: The IOP was 17. 7 ± 1. 7, 16. 8 ± 2. 6, 16. 7 ± 2. 2, and 16. 7 ± 2. 4 mmHg at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, respectively, with no significant differences in IOP values at any time point (P= 0. 117, one-way analysis of variance).

Methods: This was a randomized, multicenter, double-masked, three-month, three-arm contribution-of-elements study with a three-month safety extension. Patients were randomly assigned 1 : 1 : 1 to treatment with BBFC, <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 %, or brimonidine 0. 2 % after a washout period. Patients dosed their study medications three times daily at 8 am, 3 pm, and 10 pm for six months. Patients returned for visits at two weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months. IOP measurements were used to assess efficacy. Safety assessments were adverse events, corrected distance visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, pachymetry, perimetry, fundus parameters, and cardiac parameters. Results: A total of 690 patients were randomized. Six-month mean IOP values were similar to those at three months, when the mean IOP in patients treated with BBFC was significantly lower than that of either monotherapy group. A total of 175 patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (BBFC, 33. 0 %; <b>brinzolamide,</b> 18. 8 %; brimonidine, 24. 7 %), eight of which were severe, and five resulted in discontinuation. Seventy-seven patients discontinued participation due to treatment-related adverse events (BBFC, 17. 2 %; <b>brinzolamide,</b> 2. 1 %; brimonidine, 14. 5 %). There were 21 serious adverse events (n = 7 in each group), none of which was related to treatment. Resting mean pulse and blood pressure with BBFC were similar to those with brimonidine, demonstrating modest, clinically insignificant decreases. No new or increased risks were identified with use of BBFC relative to either monotherapy.

Results: IOPs at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks were 18. 6 &plusmn; 2. 1 mmHg, 17. 8 &plusmn; 2. 6 mmHg, 17. 4 &plusmn; 2. 5 mmHg, and 17. 3 &plusmn; 3. 5 mmHg, respectively. IOP reduction at 4 and 8 weeks was statistically significant (p&nbsp;&lt; 0. 05). The PR was significantly increased at 12 weeks (p&nbsp;&lt; 0. 01), but BP was not significantly affected. Four ocular adverse events were noted, but all were mild and transient. Conclusions: Substituting <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % for timolol 0. 5 % in combination therapy with latanoprost 0. 005 % demonstrated significant IOP reduction with improvement in PR with POAG or OH. Combination therapy using latanoprost and <b>brinzolamide</b> may be recommended for better IOP control with fewer systemic adverse events.

Fixed-combination therapies provide several benefits, including simplified treatment regimens, theoretical improved treatment adherence, elimination {{of the potential for}} washout of the first drug by the second, and the reduction in ocular exposure to preservatives. β-Adrenoceptor antagonists (particularly 0. 5 % timolol) are the most commonly used agents in combination with other classes of drugs as fixed-combination eyedrops, but they are contraindicated in many patients, owing to local allergy or systemic side effects. A fixed-combination preparation without a β-blocker is therefore warranted. This paper reviews the clinical effectiveness of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % and brimonidine 0. 2 % fixed combination (BBFC) for use in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We searched PubMed and the ClinicalTrials. gov registry, and identified three randomized controlled trials comparing BBFC vs its constituents (brimonidine vs <b>brinzolamide),</b> and one comparing BBFC with unfixed brimonidine and <b>brinzolamide.</b> All of the studies demonstrated mean diurnal IOP to be statistically significantly lower in the BBFC group compared with constituent groups and noninferior to that with the concomitant group using two separate bottles. The safety profile of BBFC was consistent with that of its individual components, the most common ocular adverse events being ocular hyperemia, visual disturbances, and ocular allergic reactions. Common systemic adverse effects included altered taste sensation, oral dryness, fatigue, somnolence, and decreased alertness. BBFC seems to be a promising new fixed combination for use in glaucoma patients. However, long-term effects of BBFC on IOP, treatment adherence, and safety need to be determined.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of oral acetazolamide 250 mg, topical <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % and dorzolamide 2 % on intraocular pressure (IOP) during the early period after phacoemulsification surgery. Material and Methods: The study was planned prospectively in our clinic under the same technique and operation conditions, applying uncomplicated phacoemulsification surgery in 80 eyes of 68 patients without another pathology. When 38 patients were men, 30 patients were women. Patients were randomly divided in four groups without thinking their right or left eyes, age, and sex. It was applied dorzolamide 2 % for first group, <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % for second group, oral asetazolamide 250 mg for third group after operation immediately, then in 12 th hour and 24 th hour. It was not applied treatment for fourth group that was controlling group. IOP of patients were measured using Goldmann applanation tonometer preoperatively and 4 th hour and 24 th hour postoperatively. Results: When before and after surgery 4 th hour and 24 th hour IOP measurement values compared, group 1 and 2 was found no significantly different (p> 0. 05), but group 3 and 4 were significant statistically (p 0. 05), but they were significant statistically postoperative 4 th hour (p 0. 05). Conclusion: When topical <b>brinzolamide</b> and dorzolamide was more effective than acetazolamide IOP control 4 hours after phacoemulsification, it was found similar effects at 24 hours.

40|$|Carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) is a membrane-associated enzyme {{anchored}} to plasma membrane surfaces by a phosphatidylinositol glycan linkage. We have determined the 2. 8 -angstroms resolution crystal {{structure of a}} truncated, soluble form of recombinant murine CAIV. We have also determined the structure of its complex with a drug used for glaucoma therapy, the sulfonamide inhibitor <b>brinzolamide</b> (Azopt). The overall structure of murine CAIV is generally {{similar to that of}} human CAIV; however, some local structural differences are found in the active site resulting from amino acid sequence differences in the " 130 's segment" and the residue- 63 loop (these may affect the nearby catalytic proton shuttle, His- 64). Similar to human CAIV, the C-terminus of murine CAIV is surrounded by a substantial electropositive surface potential that may stabilize the interaction with the phospholipid membrane.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the ocular comfort of a fixed topical {{combination}} of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % plus timolol 0. 5 % suspension vs. dorzolamide 2 % plus timolol 0. 5 % solution, both preserved with benzalkonium chloride (BAK), in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) through subjective and objective methods. BAK is the most commonly used preservative in topical glaucoma medications. Methods: 62 subjects were examined and included in the analysis. Each patient was asked to complete a questionnaire on symptoms (Ocular Surface Disease Index) and then underwent a series of examinations. The Ocular Protection Index evaluated the risk of damage to the ocular surface, and was expressed as the ratio between fluorescein breakup time and blinking interval. These and other analyses were repeated 30 days after instillation of the new eye drop treatment. Results: The results demonstrated that patients enrolled with the preserved fixed combination of dorzolamide or <b>brinzolamide</b> represented a subgroup of patients in which the discomfort symptoms were supposedly justified by the presence of BAK used chronically in antihypertensive drops. Ocular discomfort scores were significantly higher with dorzolamide/timolol than brinzolamide/timolol (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: This work shows the better tolerability of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % plus timolol 0. 5 % suspension, compared with dorzolamide 2 % plus timolol 0. 5 % solution. Fortunately, some of the adverse reactions induced by preserved eye drop glaucoma medication are reversible after removing the preservatives. Both the potential for added benefit and patient compliance should be considered when selecting ocular hypotensive therapy...|$|E

Methods: This was a prospective, multicenter (n = 5), open-label, single-arm, Phase IV clinical trial in which patients currently being treated with a PGA but requiring additional IOP reduction were administered <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 %/timolol 0. 5 % twice daily as adjunctive therapy to their current PGA monotherapy regimen. The primary objective was to examine the IOP-lowering efficacy of brinzolamide-timolol when used as adjunctive therapy. Results: Forty-seven patients enrolled in and completed the study. After 12 weeks of adjunctive brinzolamide-timolol therapy, the mean IOP of the total patient population decreased from 22. 1 mmHg at baseline to 16. 7 mmHg. The mean IOP reduction of 5. 4 mmHg (24. 4 %) was both clinically and statistically significant (P &lt; 0. 001). This significant decrease in mean IOP at week 12 was maintained across all PGA groups (P &lt; 0. 05). No significant differences were observed in symptom frequency between baseline and week 12 for any of the six solicited symptoms. A total of 17 adverse events from six patients was reported, of which ten were drug-related. Most (n = 7) of the drug-related adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. None of the adverse events required any treatment or resulted in treatment interruption or discontinuation. Of the 90 eligible eyes, 85. 6 % had a decrease in IOP of at least 3 mmHg from baseline and 98 % of patients had a decrease in IOP of &ge; 1 mmHg. Conclusion: This study suggests that a fixed combination of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 %/timolol 0. 5 % can provide additional IOP reduction effectively and safely when used as adjunctive therapy for patients receiving insufficient IOP reduction from PGA monotherapy.

40|$|Misha F Syed, Emma KR LoucksDepartment of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USAAbstract: Glaucoma {{encompasses}} a wide clinical spectrum of disease, {{with the common}} pathophysiology of progressive optic neuropathy leading to visual field loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a key risk factor in disease progression. Treatment is aimed at reduction of IOP to minimize continued optic nerve head damage. Pharmacologic treatment with various classes of IOP-lowering medications is generally employed before more aggressive surgical interventions. Monotherapy is generally accepted as initial therapy for glaucoma, but {{at least half of}} patients may require more than one IOP-lowering medication. One option is the fixed combination of <b>brinzolamide</b> 1 % and timolol maleate 0. 5 %, which is commercially available in some countries as Azarga&reg; for treatment of glaucoma not adequately responsive to monotherapy. These agents may also be used in an unfixed fashion, but fixed combination therapy is generally more convenient for patients, which may result in improved compliance, a reduction of the &quot;washout effect&quot; from instilling multiple drops, and a potential reduction in the side effects related to multiple doses of preservatives.
