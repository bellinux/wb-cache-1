5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized as too militaristic.

5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the}} small electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> framed in steel.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the {{granitic}} rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface).

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters.

5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA").

50|$|In the UK, such {{crossings}} are categorised as 'Manually Controlled Barriers' (MCB) <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> always manually controlled, usually from {{a signal}} box.
