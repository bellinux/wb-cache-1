The work presented herein {{is a continuation of}} the comprehensive study on the impacts of Christchurch earthquakes on the buried pipe networks presented in Cubrinovski et al. (2011). This report summarises the performance of Christchurch City’s potable water, waste water and road networks through the 2010 - 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence (CES), and particularly focuses on the potable water network. It combines evidence based on comprehensive and well-documented data on the damage to the water network, detailed observations and interpretation of liquefaction-induced land damage, records and interpretations of ground motion characteristics induced by the Canterbury earthquakes, for a network analysis and pipeline performance evaluation using a GIS platform.

40|$|Several {{cases of}} {{failures}} in steel buried pipelines under {{the effect of}} wave propagation have been reported. Due to seismic waves propagations these pipelines will encounter various axial forces and bending moments which will consequently lead to the local buckling of the pipes and {{the reduction of the}} pipes hollow-sectional area. These effects cause overall reduction of efficiency of pipes. Due to the probabilistic nature of soil and earthquake specifications, a deterministic approach for analyzing <b>buried</b> pipeline <b>networks</b> against earthquake excitations is not appropriate. In this study an algorithm for reliability assessment of <b>buried</b> pipeline <b>networks</b> is proposed which is based on nonlinear dynamic analysis and calculation of reliability using Monte Carlo simulation. Due to complexity of numerical analyses of <b>buried</b> pipeline <b>networks,</b> there is no possibility of an explicit calculation for the performance limit state function, so a trained multilayer feed forward neural network was used as an alternative. For this purpose, the obtained results of many deterministic numerical analyses were used for training the neural network and the performance limit state function was replaced by trained neural network. Finally, based on the probability density function, standard deviation and average of probabilistic parameters, reliability of the pipeline network for different performance levels, was determined. By investigating a <b>buried</b> pipeline <b>network</b> in sandy soil as a case study, effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was investigated and by determining the importance measure of probabilistic parameters, sensitivity analysis was performed...|$|R

40|$|Subsurface utility {{construction}} work often involves repositioning of, and working between, existing <b>buried</b> <b>networks.</b> While {{the amount of}} utilities in modern cities grows, excavation work becomes more prone to incidents. To prevent such incidents, excavation workers request existing 2 D utility maps, use detection equipment and dig test trenches to validate their accuracy and completeness. Although test trenches are of significant importance to reveal information about subsurface conditions, the process of determining their location, number and size is not explicated by experts to date. This study therefore aimed to explicate the reasoning and logic behind the selection of utility test trenches, and to formalize this in a semantically-rich utility model. To this end, we conducted interviews with experienced excavator operators. We then derived heuristics and rules that the experts used to determine trench locations. Such rules related to, for example, {{the layout of the}} excavation site, and the type of utilities, and accuracy of available data. Based on these rules, we integrated various incomplete sources of data, and generated a 3 D utility model that could generate several alternative construction situations. We used queries to identify the most suitable location for a test trench. The resulting answers to queries helped optimize the test trench selection process. Our prototype demonstrates that the identified rules (1) facilitate the generation of semantically rich 3 D utility models, and (2) support test trench decision making...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUrban {{growth is}} an ongoing trend {{and one of its}} direct {{consequences}} is the development of buried utility networks. With growing needs among consumers, new networks are being in- stalled and more underground space is being occupied. Locating these networks is becoming a challenging task. Mispositioning of utility networks is an important problem for both indus- trialised and developing countries and will worsen as cities expand and their networks increase in size and complexity (Jamil et al. (2012), Metje et al. (2007)). Over the past century, it was common practice for public service providers to install, operate and repair their networks sepa- rately Rogers et al. (2012). Now local authorities are confronted with the task of combing data produced by different parties, having distinct formats, variable precision and granularity (Chen and Cohn (2011)). Although in certain countries contractors are now obliged by law to position all <b>buried</b> <b>networks</b> within set precision ranges, finding data related to older network branches is a cumbersome task. Once located these data are often unavailable at the desired precision or are prone to errors or omissions. This study is a part of a global project which aims to recreate a storm water and a sewage network in settings where no accurate information regarding the position or characteristics of buried utility networks is available. The methodology consists in detecting objects, such as manhole covers or inlet grates, from areal photographs and very high resolution satellite imagery and use alternative sources of big data in order to extract interesting descriptor about them. The big data is original information scrapped from the internet such as calls for tenders, newspaper articles, consumer complaints etc. Information extracted with text mining techniques such as used in Kergosien et al. (2015) are particularly interesting to confirm or infirm the position of the previously detected manhole covers and inlet grate. This infor- mation is then used to build an attribute table of the underlying pipes. Once located, standard industry recommendations for pipe selection (diameter, slope, depth, junctions, etc.) are used to define a statistically probable network, including uncertainty associated to each characteristic. The final objective of this work will be to carry out hydraulic simulations using a classical mod- elling software and assess the output hydrographs sensitivity to location and descriptor errors...|$|E
40|$|Besides their {{suitability}} for multi-temporal {{and spatial}} deformation analysis, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image archives acquired by space-borne radar {{sensors can be}} exploited to support archaeological investigations over huge sites, even those partially or totally buried and still to be excavated. Amplitude information {{is one of the}} main properties of SAR data from which it is possible to retrieve evidences of buried structures, using feature extraction and texture analysis. Multi-temporality allows the reconstruction of past and recent evolution of both landscape and built-up environment, with the possibility to detect natural and/or anthropogenic changes, including human-induced damages to the conservation of cultural heritage. We present the methodology and first results of the experiments currently undertaken using SAR data in the Nasca region (Southern Peru), where two important civilizations such as Paracas and Nasca developed and flourished from 4 th century BC to the 6 th century AD. The study areas include a wide spectrum of archaeological and environmental elements to be preserved, among which: the archaeological site of Cahuachi and its surroundings, considered the largest adobe Ceremonial Centre in the World; the Nasca lines and geoglyphs in the areas of Palpa, Atarco and Nasca; the ancient networks of aqueducts and drainage galleries in the Puquios area, built by Nasca in the 1 st- 6 th centuries AD. Archaeological prospection and multi-purpose remote sensing activities are currently carried out in the framework of the Italian mission of heritage Conservation and Archaeogeophysics (ITACA), with the direct involvement of researchers from the Institute for Archaeological and Monumental Heritage and the Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis, Italian National Research Council. In this context, C- and L-band SAR images covering the Nasca region since 2001 were identified for the purposes of this research and, in particular, the following data stacks were selected: ERS- 2 ascending data acquired in 2001 - 2011, ENVISAT ASAR ascending and descending data acquired in 2003 - 2007, and ALOS PALSAR descending and ascending data acquired in 2007 and 2008.

Detailed breakdown of key factors contributing to the damage to buried pipes is given with reference to the above and other relevant parameters. Particular attention is given to the interpretation, analysis and modelling of liquefaction effects on the damage and performance of the buried pipe networks. Clear link between liquefaction severity and damage rate for the pipeline has been observed with an increasing damage rate seen with increasing liquefaction severity. The approach taken here was to correlate the pipeline damage to LRI (Liquefaction Resistance Index, newly developed parameter in Cubrinovski et al., 2011) which represents a direct measure for the soil resistance to liquefaction while accounting for the seismic demand through PGA. Key quality of the adopted approach is that it provides a general methodology that in conjunction with conventional methods for liquefaction evaluation can be applied elsewhere in New Zealand and internationally. Preliminary correlations between pipeline damage (breaks km- 1), liquefaction resistance (LRI) and seismic demand (PGA) have been developed for AC pipes, as an example. Such correlations can be directly used in the design and assessment of pipes in seismic areas both in liquefiable and non-liquefiable areas. Preliminary findings on the key factors for the damage to the potable water pipe network and established empirical correlations are presented including an overview of the damage to the waste water and road networks but with substantially less detail.

Thermal stability has been extensively studied in connection with practical application of biocatalysts. However, little work has been done to explore the mechanism of pH-dependent inactivation. In this study, bioinformatic analysis of the Ntn-hydrolase superfamily was performed to identify functionally important subfamily-specific positions in protein structures. Furthermore, the involvement of these positions in pH-induced inactivation was studied. The conformational mobility of penicillin acylase in Escherichia coli was analyzed through molecular modeling in neutral and alkaline conditions. Two functionally important subfamily-specific residues, Glub 482 and Aspb 484, were found. Ionization of these residues at alkaline pH promoted the collapse of a <b>buried</b> <b>network</b> of stabilizing interactions that consequently disrupted the functional protein conformation. The subfamily-specific position Aspb 484 was selected as a hotspot for mutation to engineer enzyme variant tolerant to alkaline medium.

Bioinformatic analysis of subfamily-specific positions can be further explored to study mechanisms of protein inactivation and to design more stable variants for the engineering of homologous Ntn-hydrolase...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} areas where development of novel TCE has been critical is the solar photovoltaics (PV). Currently, while an excellent suppression of the reflection is achieved in crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells by the chemical surface texturing combined with the anti-reflection coating (ARC), a moderate conductivity of the overdoped underlying silicon requires a dense network of macroscopic metallic connecting bars/fingers [22, 23]. These, in turn, shadow the active surface of the cell, compromising the efficiency. To address this issue, in our previous work, we have developed a TCE based on metallic nanowires assembled directly in the micro valleys of a textured c-Si surface, like that employed in crystalline solar cells [24]. These nanowires were formed from silver nanoparticles deposited directly on the surface, and subsequently transformed into wires by microwave or furnace sintering. This nanoparticle nanonetwork (NNN) achieved an impressive optoelectronic performance, with reflectance of ~ 16  % without ARC and < 5  % with ARC, as well as a good in-plane electrical conductivity of ~ 15  ohms/sq [24]. A logical next step has been since to test this new TCE on a functional solar cell, by replacing the conventional screen-printed TCE. Here, we provide such a demonstration, made possible by an addition of a critically important step in the NNN processing: a “burial” of the assembled NNN under the silicon surface by metal-assisted chemical etching [25, 26]. The resulting buried NNN (BNNN) not only significantly improves the contact of the network to the silicon but also reduces the TCE reflectance, due to the hidden/cloaked nature of the <b>buried</b> <b>network.</b> We have successfully incorporated these steps of BNNN processing into the conventional c-Si solar cell manufacturing process, just after the junction formation and before the nitride deposition and processing. All the other processes remained unchanged, except that the expensive screen-printed TCE processing and firing steps have been eliminated. The resulting solar cell, not yet optimized, achieved power conversion efficiency only 14  % less than the conventionally processed c-Si control cell, but its manufacturing cost has been significantly reduced.|$|R

This paper presents our work as {{a contribution to the}} development of such a model. A saturation module has been implemented to the integrated model URBS. The new model runs continuously at a short time step over long periods. Model evaluation is based on its capacity to reproduce saturation level and runoff measurements. This study shows the importance of modelling groundwater movement that is highly influenced by <b>buried</b> sewer <b>networks.</b> This attempt on module implementation demonstrates the potentiality of constructing integrated model by coupling existent models in appropriate ways...|$|R
40|$|It is {{suggested}} that in a localized remnant of Kalahari sand at Dufuya, central Zimbabwe, groundwater flows in an integrated pattern inherited from the paleochannel network of the underlying gneiss. Contact springs occur at discrete localities along the Kalahari sand/gneiss boundary and are associated with spring sapping and land surface subsidence. Subsidence is presumed {{to be due to}} preferential solute removal by leaching and dissolution as a result of concentration of groundwater flow within the <b>buried</b> paleochannel <b>network</b> and the location of the springs is presumed to occur where the paleochannel network intersects the Kalahari sand/gneiss boundary. Over time the surficial Kalahari sand is preferentially removed along these buried drainage lines by spring sapping and headwards erosion, exposing the gneiss. Multi-electrode direct current resistivity profiling and radar have been used to map the sub-surface, revealing the topography of the basement and nature of the Kalahari cover. Coincidence of gneiss basement depressions with the spring sites, leached sands and subsidence zones suggests inheritance of the gneiss fluvial paleochannel network pattern by the present day groundwater flow. Washed sand and gravel intersected in shallow boreholes in these areas provides further evidentiary support for the concept of inherited drainage...|$|R
40|$|District {{heating and}} steam {{distribution}} through an underground network of pipes {{dates back to}} the late 1800 s. Many systems exist today with piping networks that exceed 50 years of service life. The age of these systems has taken its toll resulting in the thermal inefficiency of the network. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates there are 20, 000 miles of heat distribution pipes. Millions of dollars a year are lost due to the ineffective thermal efficiency of these pipes. This inefficiency contributes to excess fuel burned at the plant, resulting in excess emissions that contribute to global warming. Steam distribution networks exist in major metropolitan areas, military bases and university campuses. The costs to replace these systems due to poor thermal efficiency would cost billions of dollars. In most cases, the steel carrier pipe is still in good condition and the outer conduit is intact; however, the insulation surrounding this pipe has degraded or fallen off and washed away. The objective of our group was to develop a way to re-insulate <b>buried</b> underground <b>networks</b> and provide a cost-effective alternative to replacement. The case study being presented indicates that ConduFill is a viable solution for many applications...|$|R
