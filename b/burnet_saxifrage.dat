50|$|Barn Hill Meadows is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It {{is located}} {{close to the}} town of Howden. The site, which was {{designated}} a SSSI in 1987, lies on the flood plain of the Old Derwent river. The site is important for its herb-rich, unimproved, neutral grassland. Several of the fields have been traditionally managed for hay and some retain remnant ridge and furrow features.The dominant grasses are red fescue and sweet vernal-grass. There is also an abundance of great <b>burnet,</b> pepper <b>saxifrage</b> and meadow cranes bill.|$|R
