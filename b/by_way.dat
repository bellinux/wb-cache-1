5|$|In 1924, Warren Street in Glens Falls and River Street in Hudson Falls {{became part}} of NY30, a highway that {{initially}} extended from Mechanicville to the Vermont state line near Fair Haven <b>by</b> <b>way</b> of Glens Falls and Whitehall. It was realigned by 1926 to continue north from Whitehall toward the Canadian border. In 1926, the portion of NY30 between Glens Falls and Whitehall {{was included in the}} new US4, which began in Glens Falls and continued east from Whitehall into Vermont <b>by</b> <b>way</b> of NY30's former routing. It was rerouted to follow its modern alignment south of Hudson Falls as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for <b>by</b> <b>way</b> of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right <b>by</b> <b>way</b> of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E
