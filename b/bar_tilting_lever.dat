Participants were asked to reach a <b>bar</b> <b>tilted</b> to the right in a context of gray vertical <b>bars.</b> A <b>bar</b> <b>tilted</b> to the left served as distractor. Relative stimulus saliency was varied via color: either the distractor was red and the target was gray, or vice versa. Throughout, we observed that reach trajectories deviated toward the distractor. Surprisingly, relative saliency had no effect on the curvature of reach trajectories. Moreover, when we increased time pressure in separate experiments and analyzed the curvature as a function of reaction time, no influence of relative stimulus saliency was found, not even for the fastest reaction times. If anything, curvature decreased with strong time pressure. In contrast, reach target selection under strong time pressure was influenced by relative saliency: reaches with short reaction times were likely to go to the red distractor. The time course of reach target selection was comparable to saccadic target selection. Implications for the neural basis of trajectory deviations and target selection in manual and eye movements are discussed...|$|R

The usability of the device depends on the individual user. Therefore, personalized and customized human interfaces are effective for the user. To create customized interfaces, we propose rapid prototyping human interfaces using stretchable strain sensors. The human interfaces comprise parts formed by a three-dimensional printer and the four strain sensors. The three-dimensional printer easily makes customized human interfaces.

40|$|The fMRI {{technique}} {{was used to}} investigate the functional neuroanatomy of binding features within- or cross-dimension during visual conjunction search. Participants were asked to perform feature search (FS; e. g., search for a vertical <b>bar</b> among <b>tilted</b> <b>bars),</b> within-dimension search (WS; e. g., search for an upright T among non-target oriented Ts and Ls), cross-dimension search (CS; e. g., search for an orange vertical bar among blue vertical <b>bars</b> and orange <b>tilted</b> <b>bars),</b> and complex search combining within- and cross-dimension features (WCS; e. g., search for an orange upright T among orange leftward Ts and blue Ls). Reaction times (RTs) taken to decide whether a target was present or absent were faster in the FS than in the WS, CS, and WCS conditions, but did not differ between the latter three conditions. Neuroimaging results revealed a set of fronto-parietal regions, including frontal eye field and intraparietal sulcus, to be consistently activated in conjunction search (WS, CS, and WCS) relative to feature search, suggesting that these regions play a more prominent role in matching visual input against the target template in conjunction search. Furthermore, left occipito-temporal cortex was more activated in within-dimension conjunction search, and bilateral intraparietal sulci were more activated in cross-dimension conjunction search. This suggests that features from the same dimension are ‘bound’ at a higher stage of the ventral pathway by conjoining the inputs from lower-level neurons, whereas neurons along the intraparietal sulcus appear to be necessary for discerning the presence of cross-dimensional conjunctions. ...|$|R

40|$|VIRTUAL PROTOTYPING {{has been}} {{generally}} adopted in product development {{in order to}} minimise the traditional reliance on testing of physical prototypes. It thus constitutes a major step towards solving the conflict of actual increasing development cost and time due to increasing customer demands on one side, {{and the need to}} decrease development cost and time due to increasing competition on the other. Particularly challenging for the off-road equipment industry is that its products, working machines, are complex in architecture. Tightly coupled, non-linear sub-systems of different technical domains make prediction and optimisation of the complete system’s dynamic behaviour difficult. Furthermore, in working machines the human operator is essential for the performance of the total system. Properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability are all not only dependent on inherent machine properties and working place conditions, but also on how the operator uses the machine. This is an aspect that is traditionally neglected in dynamic simulations, because the modelling needs to be extended beyond the technical system. The research presented in this thesis focuses on wheel loaders, which are representative for working machines. The technical system and the influence of the human operator is analysed, and so-called short loading cycles are described in depth. Two approaches to rule-based simulation models of a wheel loader operator are presented and used in simulations. Both operator models control the machine model by means of engine throttle, lift and <b>tilt</b> <b>lever,</b> steering wheel, and brake only – just as a human operator does. Also, only signals that a human operator can sense are used in the models. It is demonstrated that both operator models are able to adapt to basic variations in workplace setup and machine capability. Thus, a “human element” can be introduced into dynamic simulation of working machines, giving more relevant answers with respect to operator-influenced complete-machine properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability already in the concept phase of the product development process.

40|$|Drawing portraits {{upside down}} is a trick that allows novice artists to {{reproduce}} lower level image {{features such as}} contours with less interference from higher level face cognition. Limiting the time available for processing to be sufficient for lower but not higher level operations {{would be a more}} general way to reduce interference. We elucidate this interference using a novel visual search task requiring a target to be found among distractors. The search target had a unique lower level orientation feature, but was identical to distractors in its higher level object shape. Through bottom up processes, the unique feature attracted gaze to the target[1, 2, 3]. Subsequently, viewpoint invariant object recognition[4, 5] interfered, with the attended object being recognized as identically shaped as the distractors. Consequently, gaze often abandoned the target to search elsewhere. If the search stimulus was extinguished at time T after the gaze arrived at the target, reports of target location were more accurate for shorter (T< 500 ms) presentations. This object-to-feature interference, though perhaps unexpected, could underlie common phenomena such as the visual search asymmetry that finding a familiar object, e. g., a letter, among its mirror images is more difficult than the converse[6]. Our results should enable additional examination of known phenomena and interactions between different levels of visual processes. 2 Results and Discussion Among the 45 o left <b>tilted</b> <b>bars</b> in Fig. 1, a uniquely right <b>tilted</b> <b>bar,</b> 45 o or 20 o from vertical in conditions Asimple or Bsimple, pops out.

We derive semi-analytically the C l-spectrum for 2 ≤ l ≤ 30 together with its associated non-Gaussian cosmic variance error <b>bars.</b> A slightly <b>tilted</b> spectrum with an extra suppression at low l is found, and we investigate the dependence of the tilt on the parameters of the model. We also produce a prediction for the two point correlation function. We find a high level of cosmic confusion between texture scenarios and standard inflationary theories in any of these quantities. However, we discover that a distinctive non-Gaussian signal ought to be expected at low l, reflecting the prominent effect of the last texture in these multipoles. MRAO/ 1782 DAMTP/ 94 - 10...|$|R
