5|$|The {{first season}} of Game of Thrones was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on March 6, 2012. The set includes extra background and behind-the-scenes material, but no deleted scenes, <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all footage shot for the first season {{was used in the}} show.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>almost</b> {{all other}} species of amphidromine gastropods, such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, have already become extinct, the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, and this is why the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E
5|$|In fall 1903, {{the flood}} of miners leaving the Tanana Valley ended when major gold strikes were made north of Fairbanks. The gold was deeper than in the Klondike, and it had taken time to dig to it. At Cleary Creek, miner Jesse Noble {{discovered}} what became the richest vein of gold in Alaska. Gold extraction was slow, <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> no heavy machinery was available to remove the overburden above the layers of gold. The gold discoveries of 1903 reversed the trend of people away from the Tanana Valley. By Christmas 1903, there were between 1,500 and 1,800 miners in the valley. Another food shortage arose {{during the winter of}} 1903, alleviated only by the food Barnette had brought in after his trip to the Lower 48.|$|E

5000|$|Do {{note that}} the {{original}} tenth track [...] "Through the Wormhole" [...] has been removed entirely on the raw version, likely <b>because</b> it <b>almost</b> only consists of dialogue.|$|R
50|$|They {{are called}} bamboo lemurs <b>because</b> they <b>almost</b> {{exclusively}} eat bamboo. How bamboo lemurs can detoxify the high amounts of cyanide (from bamboo shoots) in their diets is unknown.|$|R
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E
25|$|Nirukta is the {{systematic}} {{creation of a}} glossary and it discusses how to understand archaic, uncommon words. The field grew probably <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> a quarter of words in the Vedic texts composed in the 2nd-millennium BCE appear just once.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} false positives (identifying an {{innocent}} traveller as a terrorist) to true positives (detecting a would-be terrorist) is, therefore, very high; and <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> every alarm {{is a false}} positive, the positive predictive value of these screening tests is very low.|$|E

25|$|Tibetan history, as it {{has been}} recorded, is {{particularly}} focused on the history of Buddhism in Tibet. This is partly due to the pivotal role this religion has played in the development of Tibetan and Mongol cultures and partly <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all native historians of the country were Buddhist monks.|$|E
25|$|Already Gustav I of Sweden {{appointed}} exceptionally many Finnish nobles as High Councillors of the Realm, {{partly because}} of trust and loyalty, partly <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all adult male Swedish high nobles had been efficiently axed {{just a few of}} years earlier by Christian II and thus were not available for appointments.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century, the Zenit-E {{heritage}} {{became an}} obstacle to the development of more modern Zenit models. This was <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all low-end Zenits until the recent 412DX have been based on the Zenit-E die-cast chassis, complying with the local philosophy that a crude but affordable camera was better than no camera.|$|E

25|$|According to many authorities, {{including}} Larry Englemann in his book, The Goddess and the American Girl: The Story of Suzanne Lenglen and Helen Wills, Lenglen {{was forbidden}} to play Wills by her father, and, <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> {{for the first}} time she was defying her father, she was sleepless for the whole night before the match, and in a state of the highest nervous tension.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{considerable}} number of mainly Late Cretaceous and Paleogene fossils have been described where it is uncertain {{whether or not they are}} anseriforms. This is <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all orders of aquatic birds living today either originated or underwent a major radiation during that time, making it hard to decide whether some waterbird-like bone belongs into this family or is the product of parallel evolution in a different lineage due to adaptive pressures.|$|E
25|$|Most {{operations}} on the GPU {{operate in a}} vectorized fashion: one operation can be performed on up to four values at once. For example, if one color , G1, B1> is to be modulated by another color , G2, B2>, the GPU can produce the resulting color *R2, G1*G2, B1*B2> in one operation. This functionality is useful in graphics <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> every basic data type is a vector (either 2-, 3-, or 4-dimensional). Examples include vertices, colors, normal vectors, and texture coordinates. Many other applications can put this to good use, and because of their higher performance, vector instructions, termed single instruction, multiple data (SIMD), have long been available on CPUs.|$|E

25|$|The type classifications were {{altered in}} 1992, and the trams renumbered in 1994. MBO50, -55 and -56 were all {{classified}} at SM53, S83 became SM83, TBO55 became ST55, S86T became ST86 and TBG became ST89. During {{the last years}} SM53s were only to be regularly used on Line 17, serving the Ullevål Hageby and Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. However, they were used throughout the network, in part <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all motormen had its type certification, in part because SM91 could not enter service on the suburban lines. By 1997 a further set of trams were scrapped, with nine SM53 and ten ST55 units remaining. The 1995 ordering of new SL95 trams was planned as the coup de grâce for SM53.|$|E
25|$|Norway has the world's largest {{registered}} {{stock of}} plug-in electric vehicles per capita, with Oslo {{recognized as the}} EV capital of the world. In March 2014, Norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads is a plug-in electric. Norway's fleet of electric cars {{is one of the}} cleanest in the world <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> 100% of the electricity generated in the country comes from hydropower. , a total of 43,442 plug-in electric vehicles were registered in Norway, of which, almost 95% are all-electric vehicles. The Norwegian plug-in electric segment has the world's highest market share of new car sales, with 5.6% in 2013, and 12.5% in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Word for Windows is {{available}} stand-alone or {{as part of}} the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents via e-mail <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see Microsoft Word Viewer). Word 6 for Windows NT was the first 32-bit version of the product, released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as Windows 95. It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, releases of Word were named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.|$|E
50|$|A {{more radical}} design is the tilting-pad design, which uses {{multiple}} pads {{that are designed}} to move with changing loads. It is usually used in very large applications but also finds extensive application in modern turbomachinery <b>because</b> it <b>almost</b> completely eliminates oil whirl.|$|R

25|$|The players {{often said}} {{in later years}} that they played so well as a team <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> to a man, they hated Finley with a passion. For instance, Finley {{threatened}} to pack Jackson off to the minors in 1969 after Jackson hit 47 homers; Commissioner Bowie Kuhn had to intervene in their contract dispute. Kuhn intervened again after Blue won the A.L. Cy Young Award in 1971 and Finley threatened {{to send him to}} the minors. Finley's tendency for micromanaging his team actually dated to the team's stay in Kansas City. Among the more notable incidents during this time was a near-mutiny in 1967; Finley responded by releasing the A's best hitter, Ken Harrelson, who promptly signed with the Red Sox and helped lead them to the pennant.|$|E
25|$|Maelgwn {{eventually}} died in 547 {{from the}} plague leaving a succession crisis in his wake. His son in law, Elidyr Mwynfawr of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, claimed the throne and invaded Gwynedd to displace Maelgwn's son, Rhun Hir ap Maelgwn. Elidyr {{was killed in}} the attempt but his death was then avenged by his relatives who ravaged the coast of Arfon. Rhun counter-attacked and exacted the same penalty on the lands of his foes in what is now central Scotland. The long distances these armies travelled suggests they were moving across the Irish Sea but <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all of what is now northern England was at this point (c. 550) under Brittonic rule, it is possible his army marched to Strathclyde overland. Rhun returned to Gwynedd {{and the rest of his}} reign was far less eventful. He was succeeded by his son, Beli ap Rhun in c. 586.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{her role}} in the {{collapse}} of the Lý Dynasty (as people acknowledged at that time), Lý Chiêu Hoàng was not worshipped along with her ancestors, and the eight previous emperors of the Lý Dynasty, at the Lý Bát Đế Temple (Bắc Ninh); her ancestral tablet was only placed in a nearby shrine which was smaller than the main temple. From the beginning of 2009, this shrine was renovated on a large scale {{on the occasion of the}} millenary anniversary of Hanoi which was founded by the Lý Dynasty. This restoration was criticized by several newspapers and residents <b>because</b> <b>almost</b> all architectural features at the shrine were demolished and totally rebuilt despite the fact that the shrine was already credited as a national historical relic of Vietnam. Responding to the criticism, the official responsible for this renovation stated that the temple was actually not as ancient as others thought and they had to rebuild from the foundation because the shrine was in very bad shape and reconstruction was necessary.|$|E
