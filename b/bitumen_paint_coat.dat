40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the corrosion protection and control of reinforcing steels in concrete is reported. The reinforcing steels were coated with local coating materials (i) <b>bitumen,</b> (ii) enamel <b>paint,</b> and (iii) local anti-rust paint. The reinforced concrete samples were immersed in a 0. 05 M NaCl solution. The study reveals the protection offered by these coatings in the sodium chloride solution. The study also reveals that the coatings used on the reinforcing steels have good corrosion protection within {{the period of the}} {{experimental study}} but this cannot be guaranteed at longer periods of time. The results indicated that the enamel <b>paint</b> <b>coating</b> has the best protection against corrosion in NaCl solution, followed by the bitumen coating, and finally local anti-rust <b>paint</b> <b>coating.</b> The potentials and resistances of the coated reinforcing steels at the end of six weeks of the experiment are as follows: 1. - 300 mV and 38. 4 kilo-ohm for control sample, 2. - 210 mV and 29. 8 kilo-ohm for sample with bitumen coating, 3. - 200 mV and 28. 1 kilo-ohm for sample with enamel <b>paint</b> <b>coating,</b> and 4. - 250 mV and 34. 8 kilo-ohm for sample with local anti-rust <b>paint</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|R

We investigated the effect of ultraviolet radiation in antimicrobial activity of <b>paint</b> <b>coats.</b> Methods Bacteria being tested included E. coli, S. aureus and C. albicans. We left the suspension of bacteria in contact with <b>paint</b> <b>coats</b> and we taken samples in defined time intervals. The first part of samples was irradiated by UV radiation for 30 minutes before application of microbial suspension. The second part of samples was irradiated by UV radiation for 30 minutes {{at the same time}} with microbial suspension. The third part of samples was not irradiated by UV radiation. The results were evaluated by bacterial colony plate counting. Results The <b>paint</b> <b>coats</b> have antimicrobial activity even without application of UV radiation.

40|$|In thermoelastic stress {{analysis}} (TSA) it is normal practice to coat metallic specimens with black paint to enhance and standardize the surface emissivity. It {{is assumed that}} the <b>paint</b> <b>coating</b> {{has no effect on}} the thermal emission from the specimen, but {{it is well known that}} the response is sensitive to <b>paint</b> <b>coating</b> thickness, particularly at higher frequencies. In this paper the effects of loading frequency and <b>paint</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on the thermoelastic response are investigated. The thermoelastic response is compared to theory, and optimum test conditions and coating characteristics are suggested. The motivation for the work is to develop a TSA-based means of residual stress assessment, where the measurement of much smaller temperature changes than those that are resolved in standard TSA is required; therefore the analysis is much more sensitive to the effects of the <b>paint</b> <b>coating.</b> However, the work presented in this paper is relevant to a wide range of TSA investigations and presents data that will be of interest to all practitioners of TSA...|$|R

40|$|When {{evaluating}} the carbonation resistance of <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete, {{the effects of}} both the strength grade and the curing conditions (standard curing and accelerated curing) of concrete substrate on carbonation resistance of <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete were investigated. The concept of the carbonation suppression ratio of paint was presented for evaluation of the anti-carbonation performance of {{the two types of}} paints (exterior and interior paints) when applied to a reference concrete substrate. The test results showed a good linear relationship between the carbonation depths of the <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete and the square root of exposure times. Concrete with higher strength grade exhibited greater carbonation resistance. The carbonation depth of the C 35 standard cured concrete was reduced by 56 % in comparison with that of the C 25 standard cured concrete. It was found that concrete substrate prepared by accelerated curing method displayed lower carbonation resistance than standard cured concrete. Compared with the standard cured specimen, the carbonation depth of the accelerated cured specimen increased by 61 % for the control C 25 concrete and by 56 % for the control C 35 concrete. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of a higher volume of capillary pores in concrete prepared by accelerated curing. Additionally, the exterior paint had a higher carbonation suppression ratio than the interior paint. The suppression ratios of the exterior and interior paint coatings applied on C 25 standard cured concrete were 71 % and 56 %, respectively. The exterior <b>paint</b> <b>coated</b> concrete had a better carbonation resistance with longer effective blockage time and smaller carbonation rate...|$|R
40|$|Multi-antibiotic {{resistant}} bacteria {{have been}} implicated {{with a large}} number of hospital-acquired infections and {{become one of the most}} significant concerns in public health. Given the potential risk of indoor transmission of these organisms in health care units, the development of a disinfection surface is highly attractive. Based on the recognized effectiveness of photocatalysis on the inactivation of microorganisms, a photocatalytic water born <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> (UV-A/TiO 2 – 10 W m− 2) was assessed for its antibacterial action. The UV-A/TiO 2 cellular inactivation is based on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, increased tolerance to the stress imposed by ROS has been reported to be associated with the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the bactericide activity of the photocatalytic <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> was assessed with susceptible and multi-antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli strains of different phylogenetic lineages. For comparison purposes, the antimicrobial activity of the photocatalyst was assessed also in suspensions. Viability losses above 98. 7 % and 99. 5 % after 40 min of 10 W m− 2 UV-A exposure were recorded for cells contacting the surface of the photocatalytic <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> and in suspension, respectively. No significant differences in the viability loss were found among the environmental tested strains, indicating that neither antibiotic resistance phenotype nor phylogenetic lineage influences the bacterial action of the photocatalyst. Results demonstrated that the photocatalytic action of the <b>paint</b> <b>coat</b> developed was effective against multi-antibiotic resistant E. coli strains. This technology has therefore potential to provide a powerful tool in the fight against the transmission of nosocomial infections...|$|R
