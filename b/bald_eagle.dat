5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, <b>bald</b> <b>eagle,</b> osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bald</b> <b>eagle</b> nests {{are often}} very large {{in order to}} {{compensate}} for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.|$|E
5|$|Lock Haven's economy, {{from the}} city's {{founding}} in 1833 {{until the end}} of the 19th century, depended heavily on natural resources, particularly timber, and on cheap transportation to eastern markets. Loggers used the Susquehanna River and <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Creek to float timber to sawmills in Lock Haven and nearby towns. The West Branch Canal, reaching the city in 1834, connected to large markets downstream, and shorter canals along <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Creek added other connections. In 1859, the first railroad arrived in Lock Haven, spurring trade and economic growth.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{both the}} {{national}} bird and national animal of the United States of America. The <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> appears on its seal. In the late 20th century {{it was on the}} brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> is {{important}} in various Native American cultures and, as the national bird of the United States, is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the U.S. federal government.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{which today}} makes up Lycoming County was purchased from the Iroquois in two treaties signed at Fort Stanwix in New York: the first treaty was in 1768, {{and the second}} treaty was in 1784. The county was formed on April 13, 1795 from part of Northumberland County. The county originally contained seven townships when formed: Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle,</b> Loyalsock, Lycoming, Muncy, Nippenose, Pine Creek, and Washington. Today Pine Creek is part of Clinton County and Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> is part of both Centre and Clinton counties, but the rest are still in Lycoming County, although many other municipalities have been formed from these since.|$|E
50|$|Because nesting <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> can deter golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) from breeding, the {{recovery}} of <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> on the northern Channel Islands has also helped enable recovery of the endangered island fox. Golden eagle predation had {{been responsible for the}} steep decline of island foxes on the northern Channel Islands in the 1990s.|$|R

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{protected}} in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended {{to all of}} North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States {{due to the fact}} that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Undivided Keyser and Tonoloway Formations {{occur in}} the {{southern}} and southeastern parts of the Buffalo Creek watershed. The Hamilton Group occurs in {{a small portion of}} the southeastern part of the watershed. Undivided Onondaga and Old Port Formations also occur here, but take up a bigger area in the watershed. The <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Formation occurs in small parts of the western and northwestern areas of the watershed. The Juniata Formation occurs in the same areas as the <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Formation, as well as part of the northern part of the watershed. However, it takes up more area than the <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Formation. The Reedsville Formation also occurs in the western and northwestern parts of the watershed. The undivided Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formations occur in a zigzagging band that goes from the northeastern to the southwestern part of the watershed. The Clinton Group occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of the Bloomsburg and Mifflinville Formations. It also occurs in a few scattered areas in the northeastern and western parts of the watershed. The Tuscarora Formation occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of the Clinton Group. The Wills Creek Formation occurs in parts of the southern and northeastern areas.|$|E
5|$|Juniata County lies over 16 {{different}} rock formations, some {{of which}} contain limestone. These rock formations come from the Ordovician Period, the Silurian Period, and the Devonian Period. The northernmost {{part of the county}} contains rocks of the Juniata Formation, the <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Formation, and undivided Juniata and <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> formations. All of these formations primarily consist of sandstone. South of these formations lie the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation undivided, the Clinton Group, and the Tuscarora Formation. The first two of these consist mainly of shale, while the third is composed of quartzite. The rock formations in the southwestern part of the county include the Brallier and Harrell Formations undivided, the Hamilton Group, the Irish Valley member of the Catskill Formation, and others. The eastern part of the county lies almost entirely over the Hamilton Group, the Tuscarora Formation, and the Irish Valley member of the Cataskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bald</b> <b>eagles,</b> ospreys, kingfishers, brook trout, and {{freshwater}} molluscs {{have all}} been observed on the tributaries Hammersley Fork and Trout Run. <b>Bald</b> <b>eagles,</b> ospreys, Canada geese, herons, and mallard ducks have visited Kettle Creek Lake. Various birds of prey have also temporarily visited the watershed. Ring-necked pheasants and ruffed grouse live in the watershed.|$|R

5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> population was 300,000â€“500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E
5|$|Pocono {{sandstone}} {{can also}} be found in the watershed, and bituminous coal formations known as the Clarion Formation, the Lower Kittanning Formation and the Eagleton Coal field also exist in the creek's watershed. The valley of Tangascootack Creek is the only place in <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township where there are significant deposits of minerals.|$|E
5|$|The city of Lock Haven is {{the county}} seat of Clinton County, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

50|$|The District Court convicted Dion for the {{shooting}} of <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> {{in violation of the}} Endangered Species Act, and for the distribution of carcasses in violation of the Eagle Protection Act. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, however, held that members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe have a treaty right to hunt <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> within the Yankton Reservation for noncommercial purposes. It also held that the Eagle Protection Act and Endangered Species Act did not abrogate this treaty right. Since neither the District Court nor the jury ruled on whether the killings were for commercial or noncommercial purposes, the appellate court directed that Dion's convictions for shooting <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> be vacated. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine the correctness of the Eighth Circuit's holding that noncommercial hunting of <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> on the Yankton reservation was not punishable under the Endangered Species Act or Eagle Protection Act.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult <b>bald</b> <b>eagle</b> is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} {{growing in the}} {{riparian}} zones along the Rogue River include willows, red alder, white alder, black cottonwood, and Oregon ash.
