40|$|Light Field, or Plenoptic, imaging is an {{exciting}} new technique where a user can capture 3 -D information about a scene in a single acquisition. By placing a microlens array (thousands of tiny lenses) in between a conventional camera's main lens and image sensor, we can split rays which would have met on a single pixel onto different pixels, storing the direction which the ray has come from. By knowing where rays have come from, we can use computational techniques to produce different images from the captured data. This means we can change viewpoint, aperture, and focus after an image has been taken. We can produce an image with everything in focus or a 3 -D reconstruction, all from a single acquisition. This technology has many potential benefits in normal photography, and also <b>biomedical</b> imaging <b>techniques</b> such as microscopy.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{evolution of}} medical technologies in the European Union offers {{a unique perspective}} with regard to highlighting significant elements of both European science policy {{and the development of}} European institutions, especially regarding the passage from their (primarily) economic to their political phases. Since the early 1990 s, while establishing a market for biotechnology, the European Communities have been developing some policy-related visions of technoscience and its potential risks, and framing the concept of European citizenship through European values and rights. From this perspective risks do not represent a mere technical dimension, a value-free, allegedly neutral combination of science and norms. Instead, ‘regulatory science’ appears as a complex activity where facts cannot be purified of values, but require discussion and negotiation. The concept that provides an adequate account of the relationship between science, technology, law, policy and politics is co-production. According to this notion, knowledge and regulation should be looked at as processes generating and influencing each other. The medical technology analysed in this chapter, and followed throughout its regulatory history of changes and metamorphoses, is xenotransplantation (XT) : the clinical use of cells, tissues and organs between species. This <b>biomedical</b> <b>technique</b> has evolved from its primary focus on organs to (what is legally defined in the European context as) Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP), namely cell therapy, gene therapy, and tissue engineered products...|$|R

Second, Europe is the only region of the world where <b>biomedical</b> <b>techniques</b> are subjected to legal and sometimes binding harmonisation.

Recent advances in biomedicine provide opportunities for molecular biology, such as measurement of activity of thousands of molecular tissue biomarkers.

In this work, we propose novel multiclass feature selection and classification system for merged data from different molecular <b>biomedical</b> <b>techniques.</b> However, when we merge these data {{the biggest problem is}} the huge number of features with a limited number of samples. For that reason the feature selection step is crucial in high dimension data classification problem.

40|$|End-stage {{renal failure}} is a {{life-threatening}} condition, often treated with home-based peritoneal dialysis (PD). PD is a demanding regimen, and {{the patients who}} practise it must make numerous lifestyle changes and learn complicated <b>biomedical</b> <b>techniques.</b> In our experience, the renal nurses who provide mostPDeducation frequently express concerns that patient compliance with their teaching is poor. These concerns are mirrored in the renal literature. It {{has been argued that}} the perceived failure of health professionals to improve compliance rates with PD regimens is because ‘compliance’ itself has never been adequately conceptualized or defined; thus, it is difficult to operationalize and quantify. This paper examines how a group of Australian renal nurses construct patient compliance with PD therapy. These empirical data illuminate how PD compliance operates in one practice setting; how it is characterized by multiple and often competing energies; and how ultimately it might be pointless to try to tame ‘compliance’ through rigid definitions and measurement, or to rigidly enforce it in PD patients. The energies involved are too fractious and might be better spent, as many of the more experienced nurses in this study argue, in augmenting the energies that do work well together to improve patient outcomes...|$|E

Both techniques have received significant attention from scientists and bioethicists about their clinical potential, social implications, {{and the prospects}} of genetic and germline modification. In many countries the policy debates on regulating both technologies is ongoing and operating in tandem. The UK, however, is operating in a distinct policy context in that mitochondrial donation was formally legalized under license in 2015, meaning the British CRISPR/cas 9 debates occur {{in the light of}} a confirmed policy position on mitochondrial donation. Our analysis of the Progress Educational Trust 2015 annual conference ‘From Three-Person IVF to Genome Editing’ argues that this event conducted important staging work in articulating the relationship between these two technologies in the UK. These efforts constitute what we call a ‘transition performance’ that (i) enacted the successful resolution of the mitochondrial donation policy debate, (ii) performed the success of British biomedical politics, and (iii) opened the space for a public debate on CRISPR/cas 9 in line with a specifically configured set of legitimacy practices.

Novel <b>biomedical</b> <b>techniques</b> have advanced {{our understanding of how}} the brain develops and is shaped by behaviour and environment. This has led to the advent of stratified medicine, which translates advances in basic research by targeting aetiological mechanisms underlying mental disorder. The resulting increase in diagnostic precision and targeted treatments may provide a window of opportunity to address the large public health burden, and individual suffering associated with mental disorders. While mental health and mental disorders have significant representation in the “health, demographic change and wellbeing” challenge identified in Horizon 2020, the framework programme for research and innovation of the European Commission (2014 – 2020), and in national funding agencies, clear advice on a potential strategy for mental health research investment is needed.

40|$|Coherence is the {{fundamental}} property of optical radiation. Methods based on this characteristic are employed in different areas of research even in NASA and European space agency. However, coherence properties of light can be successfully applied in life sciences {{for the purposes of}} diagnostics and treatment. The subject of current research is the development and improvement of the quantitative performance of non-invasive low coherence optical diagnostic which is a novel modern <b>biomedical</b> <b>technique</b> uniquely suited for the measurements of particles distribution within the topical layers of biological tissues and other complex media, such as polymers, colloids, composite materials, etc. This approach is based on the illumination of a medium by optical radiation with a low coherence both spatial and temporal, and analysis of the back-scattering signal. Recently introduced this technique is not currently used. The main difficulty in the developing of practical low-coherence systems in biomedical diagnostics is associated with the complexity of biotissues structure. For example, the human skin has very complex structure and consists with several layers of cells with unique optical properties in each layer. External boundary and internal boundaries between layers are rough and wavy. Thus, the most accurate description of optical radiation propagation is extremely complicated to achieve and can be performed only as a computer simulation. All further investigations of the optical methods of biotissues diagnostics can be enhanced using such computer models. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
