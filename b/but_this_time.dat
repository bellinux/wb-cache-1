5|$|As on Dark Horse, Harrison listed {{contributing}} musicians {{for each}} song, on the LP's back cover, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{with an additional}} list for those not appearing. The first of these is guitarist Danny Kortchmar, the fourth member of Attitudes; others include Derek Taylor, Eric Idle, Peter Sellers and Dark Horse executive Dino Airali.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, the team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> Bradman insisted only six England players from the season's Tests be allowed to compete. After his opponents had finalised their team, Bradman fielded a full-strength team, and Brown missed out. The match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|Friday, however, {{saw more}} panic on the exchange. Morgan again {{approached}} the bank presidents, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> was {{only able to}} convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money {{could not be used}} for margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly made it to the closing bell.|$|E

5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{with greater}} care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls. Grant {{did not want}} a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E
5|$|In December 1993, Moore {{was again}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> she was dressed in two straps and a large red bow and was sitting on David Letterman's lap while he was dressed up as Santa Claus.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Roman {{expansion}} into Spain and Gaul occurred as {{a mix of}} alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century BC, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{in the face of}} major powers that could rival Rome. According to Polybius, who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate the Greek east in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the Macedonian kingdom and Seleucid Empire in the face of destabilisation created by the weakening of Ptolemaic Egypt. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by major empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires that further weakened them and therefore created an unstable power vacuum that only Rome could fill. This had some important similarities to (and important differences from) the events in Italy centuries earlier, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> on a global scale.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} and better-known version of Compert Con Culainn, Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the {{previous}} version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she lets}} them outside again, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> Russetfur walks in on them. Instead of {{forcing her to}} give them up to ShadowClan, she instead helps Sasha by giving her some prey, and warns her to leave as soon as possible. Later on, Sasha goes out hunting and the kits go out to find Ken {{because they want to}} make their mother happy.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> (unlike Thermopylae) had to rely on the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count. (Hale, John R.).|$|E

60|$|Peter fairly itched to ask Weechi {{where his}} nest was, <b>but</b> by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{he had learned}} a lesson, so wisely kept his tongue still.|$|R
5|$|The Bills {{posted a}} 7–6–1 record again in 1963, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{it was enough}} to tie with the Patriots for {{the best record in the}} eastern {{division}}. This set up the AFL's first-ever playoff game to decide which of the teams would win the division and compete in the championship. The Bills lost the game, 26–8.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Chris Benoit and Orlando Jordan continued. At SummerSlam, Benoit {{defeated}} Jordan for the WWE United States Championship in a {{match that}} lasted 25.5 seconds. On the September 1 edition of SmackDown!, Benoit once again defeated Jordan for the title, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> the match lasted 23.4 seconds. The following week on SmackDown!, Benoit defeated Jordan in another title match, where the match lasted 22.5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> the winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One {{of the men who}} had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E

5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> the lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> the train ran into a pile of stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of {{the way into the}} tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E
5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E
