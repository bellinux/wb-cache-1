As <b>bulk</b> <b>head</b> panels have so many cutouts and kinks and also the surface is non developable, the wastage of prepreg material is minimised by using the tape of different width.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} used the dynamic {{susceptibility}} contrast enhanced (DSCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique to measure cerebral perfusion in adults. Objective: To assess the feasibility of the technique in a heterogeneous cohort of sick human infants and identify cerebral perfusion abnormalities. Methods: Perfusion measurements were made by characterising the changing concentration of an injected bolus of contrast agent using a series of MR images acquired during the first pass of the contrast bolus. Qualitative values of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were then calculated from these data on a pixel by pixel basis to generate parametric maps of perfusion. Results: Images of perfusion were successfully calculated from 12 out of 27 neonates and infants, all with established cerebral pathology. Normal vascular anatomical structures such as the circle of Willis were identified within all calculated images. Values of rCBF were generally larger in grey matter than in white matter. In several patients, perfusion abnormalities resulted in structural abnormalities which were detected in conventional MR imaging at follow up. The acquisition of perfusion data was most difficult when the least mature brains were examined because of motion artefacts and a smaller head size with {{a lower level of}} rCBF than adults. Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that: (a) maps of rCBF can be acquired from neonates and infants; (b) characterisation of the bolus passage becomes progressively easier as the brain matures; (c) early abnormalities in cerebral perfusion may have negative prognostic implications; (C the main difficulty when using the DSCE technique to study neonates relates to image artefacts resulting from <b>bulk</b> <b>head</b> motion...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown an {{increase}} in the frequency of traumatic brain injuries related to blast exposure. However, the mechanisms that cause blast neurotrauma are unknown. Blast neurotrauma research using computational models has been one method to elucidate that response of the brain in blast, and to identify possible mechanical correlates of injury. However, model validation against experimental data is required to ensure that the model output is representative of in vivo biomechanical response. This study exposed porcine subjects to primary blast overpressures generated using a compressed-gas shock tube. Shock tube blasts were directed to the unprotected head of each animal while the lungs and thorax were protected using ballistic protective vests similar to those employed in theater. The test conditions ranged from 110 - 740 kPa peak incident overpressure with scaled durations from 1. 3 - 6. 9 ms and correspond approximately with a 50 % injury risk for brain bleeding and apnea in a ferret model scaled to porcine exposure. The <b>bulk</b> <b>head</b> acceleration and the pressure at the surface of the head and in the cranial cavity were measured. Immediately after the blast, 5 of the 20 animals tested were apneic. Three subjects recovered without intervention within thirty seconds and the remaining two recovered within 8 minutes following bagging and administration of the respiratory stimulant doxapram. Gross examination of the brain revealed no indication of bleeding. Intracranial pressures ranged from 80 - 685 kPa {{as a result of the}} blast and were notably lower than the shock tube reflected pressures of 300 - 2830 kPa, indicating pressure attenuation by the skull up to a factor of 8. 4. Peak head accelerations were measured from 385 - 3845 G’s and were well correlated with peak incident overpressure (R 2 = 0. 90).

40|$|The {{damage-tolerant}} design {{philosophy as}} used by aircraft industries enables aircraft components and aircraft structures to operate safely with minor damage, small cracks, and flaws. Maintenance and inspection procedures insure that damages developed during service remain below design values. When damage is found, repairs or design modifications are implemented and flight is resumed. Design and redesign guidelines, such as military specifications MIL-A- 83444, have successfully reduced {{the incidence of}} damage and cracks. However, fatigue cracks continue to appear in aircraft well before the design life has expired. The F 16 airplane, for instance, developed small cracks in the engine mount, wing support, <b>bulk</b> <b>heads,</b> the fuselage upper skin, the fuel shelf joints, and along the upper wings. Some cracks were found after 600 hours of the 8000 hour design service life and design modifications were required. Tests on the F 16 plane showed that the design loading conditions were close to the predicted loading conditions. Improvements to analytic methods for predicting fatigue crack growth adjacent to holes, when multiple damage sites are present, and in corrosive environments would result in more cost-effective designs, fewer repairs, and fewer redesigns.

The methods are implemented with a general-purpose finite element package. Several proof-of-concept examples are given. With further development, the methods could be extended for analysis of multi-site damage, creep-fatigue, and corrosion fatigue problems...|$|R

Synthetic populations that produced higher grain yield than both TAM 111 and TAM 112 were able to maintain their large seed size and weight while improving their seed per head and head number traits. Poorer performance in environments with harsh winters could be {{due to a lack of}} winter-hardiness in the primary synthetics. This clearly demonstrates that improving yield, through utilization of common wheat by synthetic crosses, could result from selecting for larger seed per head and heads per unit area in lines driven from these populations.

5000|$|The revolutionary year of 1849 also {{represents}} the endowment {{year for the}} - as of today existing - Corps Rhenania IV. In renunciation to sectionalism and a system of mini-states in Germany the members of Nassovia dissolved their Corps by January 15, 1849 and endowed {{on the same day}} a new Rhenania IV. Constitution, motto ("Virtuti semper corona!") and tradition were inherited from Nassovia. In the following years their recruitment area extended over the whole of Germany. Also students from European foreign countries (Switzerland, Greece, England, etc.) and from overseas (United States, Canada, South Africa, etc.) became active at Rhenania. Corps Rhenania is member of the Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (KSCV) since its endowment in 1848. The period during the German Empire can be accounted for the greatest time of prosperity for the Corps by far. Contrary to the SC-Corps Saxo-Borussia, Guestphalia and Vandalia, which were dominated by East-Elbian, Hanoveranian and Mecklenburgian capacious landowners and civil servants, Rhenania developed during this time frame to the Corps of the large scale industrials and the capital with the focal point of recruiting in the areas of Rhine-Ruhr, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and in the mid-German industrial zone. Rhenania therefore belonged to the Corps' which were perceived as extraordinary exclusive. The first printed Corps chronicles (semester reports) were sent out to the external members in 1875. The last living Alte Herren of Rhenania II acknowledged the existing Corps in 1882 as the legitimate successor of the old Rhenania of 1802/20. Living members of Rhenania II and Nassovia II were integrated in the Corps. The German novelist Theodor Fontane used the death of Rhenanian Emil Hartwich (1843- 1886; district judge in Düsseldorf) during a duel with Baron Léon Armand von Ardenne as guideline for his novel Effi Briest in 1894. The active Corps was suspended during 1914-1919 due to World War I. An effect of politicization of the student body during {{the early days of the}} Republic of Weimar was less significant among the Corps, as the SC of Heidelberg had chosen a self-imposed isolation and <b>bulk</b> <b>headed</b> off against the influence of the rest of the student body.

40|$|Numerous {{models of}} the oculomotor {{neuronal}} integrator located in the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) involve both highly tuned recurrent networks and intrinsic neuronal properties; however, there is little experimental evidence for the relative role of these two mechanisms. The experiments reported here show that all PHN neurons (PHNn) show marked phasic behavior, which is highly oscillatory in approximately 25 % of the population. The behavior of this subset of PHNn, referred to as type D PHNn, is clearly {{different from that of}} the medial vestibular nucleus neurons, which transmit the <b>bulk</b> of <b>head</b> velocity-related sensory vestibular inputs without integrating them. We have investigated the firing and biophysical properties of PHNn and developed data-based realistic neuronal models to quantitatively illustrate that their active conductances can produce the oscillatory behavior. Although some individual type D PHNn are able to show some features of mathematical integration, the lack of robustness of this behavior strongly suggests that additional network interactions, likely involving all types of PHNn, are essential for the neuronal integrator. Furthermore, the relationship between the impulse activity and membrane potential of type D PHNn is highly nonlinear and frequency-dependent, even for relatively small-amplitude responses. These results suggest that some of the synaptic input to type D PHNn is likely to evoke oscillatory responses that will be nonlinearly amplified as the spike discharge rate increases. It would appear that the PHNn have specific intrinsic properties that, in conjunction with network interconnections, enhance the persistent neural activity needed for their function...|$|R
