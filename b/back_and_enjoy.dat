[...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on Discipline, and while {{none of it is}} exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list for a little while longer." ...|$|E

Both Yarwood and Morecambe and Wise signed up with Thames TV, with mixed results; Morecambe and Wise fared better than Yarwood and their ratings remained relatively high.
