The <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children's Theatre {{tell the}} story of a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby Triceratops. The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional {{creatures of the}} 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had been introduced in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E

5|$|Artemis Fowl: The Graphic Novel is {{a graphic}} novel {{based on the}} book. Written by Colfer and adapted by Andrew Donkin, the graphic novel was {{released}} on 2 October 2007. The plot remains {{the same as the}} book's except some minor details. Some characters' appearances differed from their description in the book; Holly Short's hair is longer than described in the <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> darker brown, as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book. Haven City's roof is stalactites and rock as opposed to the computer-generated sky described by the book. The graphic novel does not contain many word balloons, showing each character's story in first-person. Graphic novels for subsequent books in the series were released in 2009, 2013, and 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> part of the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about {{the structure of the}} novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E

5|$|The {{screenplay}} for Whisky Galore! {{was written by}} Compton Mackenzie and Angus MacPhail, based on Mackenzie's own novel; he received £500 {{for the rights to}} the <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> further £1,000 because of the film's profitability. Mackendrick and Danischewsky also worked on the script before further input from the writers Elwyn Ambrose and Donald Campbell, and the actor James Robertson Justice, who also appeared in the film. The film and novel's story was based on an incident in the Second World War, when the cargo ship SS Politician ran aground off the north coast of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Local inhabitants from the island, and from nearby South Uist, heard that the ship was carrying 22,000 cases of whisky; they rescued 7,000 from the wreck before it sank. Mackenzie, a Home Guard commander on the island, took no action against the removal of the whisky. The plot underwent some modification and condensation from the novel, {{with a lot of the}} background removed; in particular, much of the religious aspect of the novel was left out, with the novel's Protestant Great Todday and Roman Catholic Little Todday being merged into the single island of Todday.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E
