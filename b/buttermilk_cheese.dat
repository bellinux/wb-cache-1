40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{occurrence}} and diversity of mold species in raw milk and its products along with the identification of potential contamination sources. For this reason, a total of 260 samples consisting of 80 raw milk, 100 dairy products (i. e., pasteurized milk, yoghurt, cheese and buttermilk) and 80 environmental (i. e. ingredients, packaging materials, surface of processing equipments and air) specimens were collected. Using culture assay and microscopic observation, the occurrence {{as well as the}} diversity of mold species was investigated. According to the results, 82. 3 % of the samples were identified as positive for mold contamination. The percentage of mold contamination for raw milk was estimated as 97. 5 %. In the case of pasteurized milk, yoghurt, <b>buttermilk,</b> <b>cheese</b> and environmental samples, it was determined as 52 %, 76 %, 52 %, 56 % and 96. 25 %, respectively. Mold diversity among various samples consisted of Aspergillus, Geotrichum, Penicillium, Mucor, Alternaria, Rhizopus, Stemphylium, Cladosporium, and Fusarium. Results revealed a significant (p < 0. 01) correlation between kind of mold species isolated from raw milk and dairy products. Similarly, a correlation was observed between dairy products and environmental sources. Regarding the high occurrence of mold contamination in raw milk and environmental sources, it seems that in some instances heat treatment was not effective enough to inactivate all molds; whereas in some other cases, cross contamination may have resulted in mold contamination. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain hygienic conditions during raw milk handling as well as processing steps.

40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} become integral part of human nutrition and belong to common food. Milk is very valuable because it contains complete proteins. Its disaccharide lactose is a source of energy. Butterfat is easily digestible. Besides potassium, sodium, magnesium, chlorine and sulfur milk contains also dietary elements like calcium and phosphorus. Milk also contains many trace elements like iron, zinc, iodine, selenium, manganese, fluorine, chromium, cobalt, and molybdenum. Milk is {{an important source of}} vitamins. It contains significant amounts of water soluble B and C vitamins alongside fat soluble vitamins E and A and smaller amounts of vitamins K and D. Milk {{and dairy products}} are an important source of calcium. Lack of calcium is the main cause of osteoporosis. Regular consumption of milk and dairy products may reduce the risk of cancer. Nevertheless disproportionate consumption of dairy products containing unsaturated fats can lead to higher incidence of certain types of cancer, higher risk of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. Milk contains also compounds that prevent aforementioned diseases. Milk is the only source of nutrients for newborn children and suckled infants. It is convenient source of nutrients in times of higher nutrient demands especially during pregnancy, nursing and senescence. Milk, milk cream, fermented milk products, <b>buttermilk,</b> <b>cheese,</b> whey, curd cheese, whey proteins, frozen creams, cream, condensed and powdered milk belong to most important products. Fermented milk products are very beneficial to human health. Those products are sources of complete proteins, calcium, phosphor and vitamins, especially B vitamins. Lactose is decreased making fermented milk suitable for lactose-intolerant subjects. The fermentation process increases the shelf-life of the product while improving the digestibility and microbiological safety. Milk and dairy products consumption can also have negative impact on human health. Lactase deficiency or lactase insufficient activity in small intestine results in lactose intolerance. Milk can also cause food allergy to the cow's milk...|$|E

40|$|The {{proteins}} and polar lipids present in milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) fragments are gaining attention for their technological and nutritional properties. These MFGM fragments are preferentially enriched in side streams of the dairy industry, like butter serum, buttermilk, and whey. The {{objective of this}} study was to recover MFGM fragments from whey by tangential filtration techniques. Acid <b>buttermilk</b> <b>cheese</b> whey was chosen as a source for purification by tangential membrane filtration because it is relatively rich in MFGM-fragments and because casein micelles are absent. Polyethersulfone and cellulose acetate membranes of different pore sizes were evaluated on polar lipid and MFGM-protein retention upon filtration at 40 degrees C. All fractions were analyzed for dry matter, ash, lipids, proteins, reducing sugars, polar lipid content by HPLC, and for the presence of MFGM proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. A fouling coefficient was calculated. It was found that a thermocalcic aggregation whey pretreatment was very effective in the clarification of the whey, but resulted in low permeate fluxes and high retention of ash and whey proteins. By means of an experimental design, the influence of pH and temperature on the fouling and the retention of polar lipids (and thus MFGM fragments), proteins, and total lipids upon microfiltration with 0. 15 mu M cellulose acetate membrane was investigated. All models were highly significant, and no outliers were observed. By increasing the pH from 4. 6 to 7. 5, polar lipid retention at 50 degrees C increased from 64 to 98 %, whereas fouling of the filtration membrane was minimized. A 3 -step diafiltration of acid whey under these conditions resulted in a polar lipid concentration of 6. 79 g/ 100 g of dry matter. As such, this study shows that tangential filtration techniques are suited for the purification of MFGM fragments...|$|E

40|$|Milk fat is {{encapsulated}} in a {{milk fat}} globule membrane (MFGM) that contains bioactive glycoproteins and glycolipids. The MFGM inhibits infectivity of rotavirus (RV), activity {{that has been}} attributed to its glycoprotein and carbohydrate components. However, previous studies of proteins and oligosaccharides in the MGFM have not accounted for all the bioactivity associated with the complete MFGM. The lipid fraction of the MFGM accounts for half of its composition by weight, and we postulate that this fraction should be tested by itself to determine if it plays a role in antiviral activity. Herein, the anti-RV activity of an organic extract of MFGM was tested. Natural and whey buttermilk powders containing bovine MFGM enriched in polar lipids were prepared by microfiltration and supercritical fluid extraction treatment to reduce the triglyceride content of the powders. Lipid fractions were then extracted from the MFGM using both single- and dual-phase extraction methods. Whole MFGM and organic extracts were screened in MA- 104 cells for anti-infective activity against a neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using a focus- forming unit assay. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for whole <b>buttermilk</b> and <b>cheese</b> whey MFGM against the rotavirus. In general, buttermilk MFGM exhibited greater RV percentage inhibition than cheese whey MFGM. Organic-soluble anti-RV compounds were identified in bovine MFGM. The most active fraction, isolated by dual-phase extraction and iatrobead chromatography, was free of proteins and highly nonpolar. Further separation of this fraction in a less polar solvent (30 : 1 chloroform:methanol) resolved at least 5 lipid-containing compounds, which likely contribute to the anti-RV activity associated with bovine MFGM.

40|$|The serP 1 and serP 2 genes found adjacently on the {{chromosome}} of Lactococcus lactis strains encode {{two members}} of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily of secondary transporters that share 61 % sequence identity. SerP 1 transports L-serine, L-threonine, and L-cysteine with high affinity. Affinity constants (Km) are in the 20 to 40 M range. SerP 2 is a DL-alanine/DL-serine/glycine transporter. The preferred substrate appears to be DL-alanine for which the affinities were found to be 38 and 20 M for the D and L isomers, respectively. The common substrate L-serine is a high-affinity substrate of SerP 1 and a low-affinity substrate of SerP 2 with affinity constants of 18 and 356 M, respectively. Growth experiments demonstrate that SerP 1 is the main L-serine transporter responsible for optimal growth in media containing free amino acids as the sole source of amino acids. SerP 2 is able to replace SerP 1 in this role only in medium lacking the high-affinity substrates L-alanine and glycine. SerP 2 plays an adverse role for the cell by being solely responsible for the uptake of toxic D-serine. The main function of SerP 2 is in cell wall biosynthesis through the uptake of D-alanine, an essential precursor in peptidoglycan synthesis. SerP 2 has overlap-ping substrate specificity and shares 42 % sequence identity with CycA of Escherichia coli, a transporter whose involvement in peptidoglycan synthesis is well established.

40|$|Lactococcus lactis is an {{important}} lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species that {{is used for the}} manufacture of dairy products, such as <b>cheese,</b> <b>buttermilk,</b> and other fermented products. The predominant function of this bacterium in dairy fermentation is the production of lactic acid, as its major fermentation end-product that contributes to preservation and microbial safety of the product. Moreover, L. lactis is frequently encountered in natural ecosystems such as in (rotting) plant material. Due to restricted energy source availability, natural microbial communities commonly live in a situation that can be characterized as ‘hunger’, which is different from strict nutrient-starvation. As a consequence, environmental microbes commonly grow at very low-growth rates as compared to laboratory cultures. Analogously, microorganisms can experience such nutrient-poor conditions in diverse industrial fermentation applications. For example, LAB encounter extreme low or no energy source availability during the extended ripening process of cheeses or dry sausages, which can take months. Despite these harsh environmental conditions, many LAB are able to remain viable in these processes for months and sustain a low-level metabolic activity, which plays {{an important}} role in their contribution to flavor and aroma formation in the product matrix. In this thesis, the quantitative physiology of L. lactis at near-zero specific growth rates was studies, employing both metabolic and genome-wide transcriptome studies in an experimental set-up of carbon-limited retentostat cultivation. Chapter 2 describes how retentostat cultivation enables uncoupling of growth and non-growth related processes in L. lactis, allowing the quantitative analysis of the physiological adaptations of this bacterium to near-zero growth rates. In chapter 3, transcriptome and metabolome analyses were integrated to understand the molecular adaptation of L. lactis to near-zero specific growth rate, and expand the studies in chapter 2 towards gene regulations patterns that play a profound role in zero-growth adaptation. Chapter 4 describes the enhanced robustness to several stress conditions of L. lactis after its adaptation to extremely low-specific growth rate by carbon-limited retentostat cultivation. In this chapter correlations were modelled that quantitatively and accurately describe the relationships between growth-rate, stress-robustness, and stress-gene expression levels, revealing correlation coefficients for each of the varieties involved. Chapter 5 evaluates the distinction between the transcriptome responses to extended carbon-limited growth and severe starvation conditions, where the latter condition was elicited by switching off the medium supply of the retentostat cultures described in chapter 1. Chapter 6 highlights the comparison of the physiological and molecular adaptations of industrially important microorganisms towards carbon-limited retentostat conditions. In conclusion, this thesis describes the quantitative physiological, metabolic, and genome-wide transcriptional adaptations of L. lactis at near-zero specific growth rates induced by carbon source limited retentostat cultivation, and compares these molecular adaptations to those elicited by strict carbon-starvation conditions...|$|R
