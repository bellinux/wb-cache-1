5000|$|Although this seabird once bred on steep mountainsides of the Greater Antilles, {{only three}} {{confirmed}} breeding areas {{remain in the}} high mountains of Hispaniola (in Sierra de Bahoruco in the Dominican Republic, and Massif de la Selle and Massif de la Hotte on the Haitian side of the island). In 2015, birds were also confirmed nesting on a second island (Dominica) which had long been suspected given historical nesting there. [...] Records of <b>Black-capped</b> <b>Petrels</b> from Cuba suggest that at least small populations of these birds may also persist there. A mountain peak where it formerly bred in Haiti (and another in Dominica, Lesser Antilles) is still named [...] "Morne Diablotin" [...] {{in reference to the}} [...] "little devils".|$|R

These areas serve as important "hotspots" of marine life, by aggregating weakly swimming lower and mid-trophic level species which, in turn, attract foraging predators. Despite {{the importance of}} these dynamic features, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how they create foraging habitat for seabirds and other marine predators. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, I review current knowledge of how seabirds use oceanographic features with an emphasis on developing a more mechanistic understanding of these features, and identify important considerations for future studies. I use the findings of this review to inform two field research projects in the Bay of Fundy, Canada and Onslow Bay, North Carolina. In these two projects, I examined seabird abundance and distribution in relation to oceanographic features that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. In the first project, I examined foraging habitat of red-necked phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus) in relation fine-scale tidal forcing near the Brier Island ledges in the Bay of Fundy. This research demonstrated the importance of biophysical interactions in creating phalarope habitat, and characterized red-necked phalarope habitat in both space and time. In Onslow Bay, I investigated the effects of Gulf Stream fronts and eddies on the abundance and distribution of seabirds using both remotely sensed and in situ data. I used fisheries acoustics surveys to investigate prey distribution within Gulf Stream frontal eddies. I then developed habitat models for the six most commonly sighted species or species groups (Cory's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea; greater shearwaters (Puffinus gravis; Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus; Audubon's shearwaters, Puffinus lherminieri; <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrels,</b> Pterodrama hasitata; and red and red-necked phalaropes, grouped together as Phalaropus spp.) using multivariate modeling techniques. Gulf Stream frontal eddies influenced the abundance and distribution of seabirds in Onslow Bay, although frontal features were not as important in predicting seabird habitat as demonstrated in previous studies in the South Atlantic Bight. Prey availability in Gulf Stream frontal eddies was highest in eddy cold core regions, particularly in those regions close to the Gulf Stream. Taken together, the results of my dissertation: underscore the importance of conducting standardized surveys to assess dynamic environmental variables; demonstrate the use of multivariate methods to examine seabird foraging in relation to oceanographic features; emphasize the need to evaluate both prey distributions and physical regimes within oceanographic features at depth; and highlight the importance of temporal aspects of oceanographic features, such as the persistence and age of the features, when assessing the role that these features play in creating seabird foraging habitat.

50|$|Morne Diablotins shares {{its name}} {{with the local}} term for the rare <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> (Pterodroma hasitata).|$|E
50|$|The species, once {{abundant}} in the Caribbean, has declined significantly and {{is now one of}} the most endangered seabirds in the North Atlantic along with the bermuda petrel. In the early 20th century, there was speculation that the <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> was extinct, but more current population estimates range from 2,000-4,000 individuals. Most of the threats facing the <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> are on its nesting grounds, where causes for its demise include habitat loss, introduced predators, and direct harvesting by humans. Human predation appears to have become more limited in scope than in historic times, due in part to the species' current scarcity. Deforestation from wildfires and direct human use have likely decreased the amount of suitable nesting habitat available to the <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel.</b> This is especially true on Haiti, which has suffered severe loss of forest cover in recent years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> is nocturnal on its {{breeding}} grounds, {{possibly to}} avoid predation by gulls, hawks or crows. Like most petrels, its walking ability {{is limited to}} a short shuffle to the nest burrow.|$|E
50|$|Pic Macaya is {{a source}} of water {{generation}} and has rich soil that support its dense pine forests. It has a high concentration of biodiversity with numerous endemic species and is also a nesting location for the endangered <b>Black-capped</b> <b>petrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like other gadfly petrels, the <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> nests in burrows {{in remote}} {{highland}} areas of islands. These burrows are typically located on forested cliffs, {{and are very}} difficult to locate. They visit burrows at night, so as to avoid detection by predators. Eggs are typically laid in January, which will subsequently hatch sometime in March. Fledglings will then depart the nest in either June or July.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> (Pterodroma hasitata) {{is a small}} seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, Pterodroma. It is {{also known}} as the diablotín. It is a long-winged petrel with a grey-brown back and wings, with a white nape and rump. Underparts are mainly white apart from a black cap (that in some {{individuals}} extends to cover the eye) and some dark underwing markings. It picks food items such as squid from the ocean surface.|$|E
50|$|The Jamaican petrel (Pterodroma caribbaea) is (or was) a small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, Pterodroma. It is {{also known}} as the Blue Mountain duck. It is related to the <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> P. hasitata, and often {{considered}} a subspecies.This species was last collected in 1879, and was searched for without success between 1996 and 2000. However, it cannot yet be classified as extinct because nocturnal petrels are notoriously difficult to record, and it may conceivably occur on Dominica and Guadeloupe.|$|E
50|$|In the Massif de la Hotte alone {{there are}} 42 {{globally}} threatened mammals, birds, {{reptiles and amphibians}} which need conservation efforts. The coastal zone ecosystem has been fairly well preserved and has coral reefs, mangrove forests and estuaries. Coral reefs {{are not part of}} the national parks. There are 38 species under the threatened and endangered list and some of them may have been extirpated too. Of these, nearly 50% are endemic and threatened with extinction and three are critically threatened. The critically endangered species are <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel,</b> Ridgway's hawk (also endemic), stygian owl, and western chat-tanager and eastern chat-tanager, both endemic.|$|E
50|$|The warm {{waters of}} the Gulf Stream serve as the primary {{foraging}} area for this species. Most birds during the non-breeding season are concentrated off the United States coast between Florida and North Carolina, though they {{have been known to}} wander far to the north and east toward Europe. The species has been seen year-round in the Gulf Stream. The birds that visit these waters during the breeding season either represent non-breeders or are making long foraging trips away from the nest. The <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> is almost strictly pelagic away from the breeding grounds and is known to join loose flocks with other seabirds such as shearwaters and terns.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-capped</b> <b>petrel</b> {{is large}} {{compared}} to other gadfly petrels. The most similar species within its range is the Bermuda petrel which is smaller and has a narrower white rump patch and an extensive gray cowl. The great shearwater is also superficially similar. The probably-extinct Jamaica petrel (P. caribbaea) was a related dark form, often considered a subspecies of this bird. The local Spanish name, Diablotín, means [...] "little devil" [...] because of its night-time habits and odd-sounding mating calls, which may have suggested to locals the presence of evil spirits in the dark. The petrel will occasionally utter other croaks and sounds while foraging at sea.|$|E
