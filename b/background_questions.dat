40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that lie detection can be improved by asking the interviewee unexpected questions. The present experiment investigates the effect of two types of unexpected questions: <b>background</b> <b>questions</b> and detail questions, on detecting lies about topics with which the interviewee is (a) familiar or (b) unfamiliar. In this experiment, 66 participants read interviews in which interviewees answered background or detail questions, either truthfully or deceptively. Those who answered deceptively could be lying about a topic they were familiar with or about a topic they were unfamiliar with. The {{participants were asked to}} judge whether the interviewees were lying. The results revealed that <b>background</b> <b>questions</b> distinguished truths from both types of lies, while the detail questions distinguished truths from unfamiliar lies, but not from familiar lies.

40|$|In {{the recent}} {{debate on the}} Brazilian growth model, the {{accuracy}} of the economic tripod (inflation targeting, primary fiscal target and floating exchange rate regimes) was pointed out as being responsible for the lowering of Brazilian economic growth and as a hindrance to its development. However, over time the macro regime has proved to be flexible and allowed changes in the form of management of policies, within the same institutional framework, especially after the 2008 crisis. Within this context, the present chapter aims to discuss the relationships between these macroeconomic policy fronts and a social oriented development strategy for the Brazilian economy. The <b>background</b> <b>question</b> is if the actual macroeconomic regime, inherited from an orthodox perspective, is compatible with the deepening of a social oriented development, which depends on a strong role of the State, income distribution and expansion of social infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in unethical work behavior. Several types of survey instruments to collect information about unethical work behavior are available. Nevertheless, to date little {{attention has been paid to}} design issues of those surveys. There are, however, several important problems that may influence reliability and validity of questionnaire data on the topic, such as social desirability bias. This paper addresses two important issues in the design of online surveys on unethical work behavior: the response scale for questions regarding the frequency of certain types of unethical work behavior and the location of the <b>background</b> <b>questions</b> in an online survey. We present the results of an analysis of a double split-ballot experiment in a large sample (n = 3, 386) on governmental integrity. We found that, when comparing response scales that have labels for all categories with response scales that only have anchors at the end, the latter provided answers with higher validity. The study did not provide support for the conventional practice of asking <b>background</b> <b>questions</b> at the end. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
