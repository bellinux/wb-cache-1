40|$|The phylogenetic {{placement}} of the red panda (Allurus fulgens) and the giant panda (Alluropoda melanoleuca) has been an evolutionary enigma since their original descriptions in the nineteenth century. A series of recent molecular analyses led to a consensus that the giant panda 2 ̆ 7 s ancestors were derived from early <b>bears</b> (<b>Ursidae),</b> but left unsettled the phylogenetic relationship of the red panda. Previous molecular and morphological phylogenles were inconclusive and varied among {{placement of}} the red panda within the raccoon family (Procyonidae), within the <b>bear</b> family (<b>Ursidae),</b> or in a separate family of carnivores equidistant between the two. To examine a relatively ancient (circa 20 – 30 million years before the present, MYBP) phylogenetic divergence, we used two slowly evolving genetic markers: mitochondrial 12 S rRNA sequence and 592 fibroblast proteins resolved by two dimensional gel electrophoresis. Four different carnivore outgroup species, including dog (Canidae: Canis famillaris), cat (Felidae: Fells catus), fanaloka (Viverridae: Fossa fossa), and mongoose (Herpestidae: Galidia elegans), were selected to identify {{the root of the}} phylogenetic topologies. Phylogenetic reconstruction by distance-based methods, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood clearly indicate a distinct bifurcation forming the Ursidae and the Procyonidae. Further, our data consistently place the red panda as an early divergence within the Procyonidae radiation and confirm the inclusion of giant panda in the Ursidae lineage...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{includes}} {{a review of}} the geographic and stratigraphic distribution of short-faced <b>bears</b> (<b>Ursidae,</b> Tremarctinae) in South America. In addition, the authors discuss biogeographic hypotheses regarding the origin of South American tremarctines. The Tremarctinae subfamily is distributed exclusively in America, from Alaska to southern Patagonia. Its biochron comprises the temporal lapse between Late Miocene and recent times; the first record of Tremarctinae in North America corresponds to the Hemphillian and the last to the Rancholabrean. In South America, the first record corresponds to the Ensenadan. In the present day, it corresponds to the only living tremarctine, the "Andean Bear," but short-faced bears became extinct during the early Holocene. The extinction of short-faced bears in North and South America appears to have been approximately synchronous. Finally, the fossil record in South America indicates species turnover between the Ensenadan and Bonaerian, during which time the giant species Arctotherium angustidens was replaced by Arctotherium tarijense, Arctotherium bonaeriense, and Arctotherium vetustum (and probably Arctotherium wingei) ...|$|R

40|$|A large {{microsatellite}} {{data set}} from three species of <b>bear</b> (<b>Ursidae)</b> {{was used to}} empirically test the performance of six genetic distance measures in resolving relationships {{at a variety of}} scales ranging from adjacent areas in a continuous distribution to species that diverged several million years ago. At the finest scale, while some distance measures performed extremely well, statistics developed specifically to accommodate the mutational processes of microsatellites performed relatively poorly, presumably because of the relatively higher variance of these statistics. At the other extreme, no statistic was able to resolve the close sister relationship of polar bears and brown bears from more distantly related pairs of species. This failure is most likely due to constraints on allele distributions at microsatellite loci. At intermediate scales, both within continuous distributions and in comparisons to insular populations of late Pleistocene origin, {{it was not possible to}} define the point where linearity was lost for each of the statistics, except that it is clearly lost after relatively short periods of independent evolution. All of the statistics were affected by the amount of genetic diversity within the populations being compared, significantly complicating the interpretation of genetic distance data...|$|R

Bacular length, maximal diameter and mass increased from 109 mm, 5. 93 mm and 2. 68 g respectively in 1 -year-old bears (n = 34) to 190 (maximum 222) mm, 18. 7 (24. 4) mm, and 20. 4 (31. 9) g respectively in bears ≥ 10 years of age (n> 200). Bacular length is ∼ 8 % of body length in adults. Bacula were moderately variable in size: coefficient of variation for length, diameter, and mass 1 / 3 were 5. 2, 10. 0 and 5. 4 % respectively (16. 3 % for mass). No geographic variation in size was apparent. Bacula reached asymptotic size at 8 – 9 years of age. At physiological sexual maturity (∼ 6 years of age), bacula were at 89, 73 and 62 % of asymptotic length, diameter and mass respectively (compared with body length at ∼ 95 %).

40|$|Locomotion of {{plantigrade}} generalists {{has been}} relatively little studied compared to more specialised postures even though plantigrady is ancestral among quadrupeds. <b>Bears</b> (<b>Ursidae)</b> are a representative family for plantigrade carnivorans, they have {{the majority of the}} morphological characteristics identified for plantigrade species, and they have the full range of generalist behaviours. This study compares the locomotion of adult grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis Linnaeus 1758), including stride parameters, gaits and analysis of three dimensional ground reaction forces, to previously studied quadrupeds. At slow to moderate speeds grizzly bears use walks, running walks, and canters. Vertical ground reaction forces demonstrated the typical M-shaped curve for walks, however this was significantly more pronounced in the hind limb. The rate of force development was also significantly higher for the hind than the forelimbs at all speeds. Mediolateral forces were significantly higher than would be expected for a large erect mammal, almost to the extent of a sprawling crocodilian. There may be morphological or energetic explanations {{for the use of the}} running walk rather than the trot. The high medial forces (produced from a lateral push by the animal) could be caused by frontal plane movement of the carpus and elbow by bears. Overall, while grizzly bears share some similarities with large cursorial species, their locomotor kinetics have unique characteristics. Additional studies are needed to determine if these characters are a feature of all bears or plantigrade species...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bear</b> family, <b>Ursidae,</b> {{is thought}} to have split off from other carnivorans about 38 million years ago. The Ursinae {{subfamily}} originated approximately 4.2 million years ago. The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004. Fossils show that between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, the polar bear's molar teeth changed significantly from those of the brown bear. Polar bears are thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula).|$|R
40|$|Indarctos spp. {{were the}} first large−bodied bears with omniv− orous tendencies. Two Indarctos fossils {{assigned}} to I. arcto− ides ssp. by Bernor, Feibel, et al. (2003) and Viranta and Werdelin (2003) show that the genus had a wide geographic range in Europe in theMiddleMiocene andwas represented by at least two contemporaneous species. Present work shows that the two species of Indarctos lived {{in a mixture of}} environments, and were not clearly separated into distinct habitats. Indarctos seems to have evolved during an interval of faunal turnover in Europe. The appearance of Indarctos coincided with an extinction of small omnivorous mammals and was accompanied by the appearance of other large omnivores. Modern <b>bears</b> (<b>Ursidae)</b> have an omnivorous diet. Only the po− lar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is a very late descendent of a brown bear (Ursus arctos) like ancestor (Kurtén 1964), is a spe− cialized hunter. Nevertheless, the first large bodied ursids in the early Neogene were all carnivorous. Vallesian (Late Miocene, 11. 2 – 9 Ma) Indarctos spp. {{were the first}} bears showing a ten− dency towards bunodont dentition, that is typical of modern Ursidae and a clear adaptation to omnivory. Indarctos was prob− ably part of the ancestral stock that gave origin to the modern ur− sine bears. Hunt (1998) included Indarctos in Ursavini, which is a sister tribe for the tribes of the modern bears. Alternatively, Indarctos is a sister taxon of Ursus and in the same clade with the modern great panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) (Ginsburg and Morales 1998; Ginsburg 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|While many {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} done on siliceous and metamorphic rocks for both use-wear and post depositional surface modification (PDSM) events, little is known about such experiments on volcanic materials (other than obsidian), and on basalt in particular. Here we present the preliminary results of several experiments related to: a) evidence for basalt use (e. g., butchery and fresh hide scraping) and the subsequent characteristic use-wear patterns that can be seen; and b) post-depositional surface modifications caused by <b>bear</b> (<b>Ursidae)</b> trampling on experimental basalt flakes and subsequent use of these flakes for a tumbling experiment in a special tumbling machine. The results of these experiments were compared to better understand some surface modifications noted on the Middle to Upper Pleistocene lithic assemblages of the Azokh Cave site (Nagorno Karabagh, Lesser Caucasus). Although some aspects of both events (use-wear and PDSM) remain to be studied in depth, the experiments have improved our understanding of the effects of use-wear and post-depositional trampling and tumbling on basalt lithic artefacts. In particular, it has allowed us to recognise mechanical alterations (e. g., cracks, striations, fractures, edge damage) caused by trampling and tumbling and to note differences between these modifications and those caused by use. In particular, the experiments have shown that macroscopic modifications are rarely diagnostic, especially those observed after use. Microscopic wear features such as edge rounding, polish, abrasion and striations were the most evident types of alteration on basalt flakes, although occurring at different times and from different types of use. Distribution and orientation of alterations may be key in distinguishing use-wear from post-depositional alterations on basalt artefacts. </p...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis surveys {{topic of}} taxonomic {{diversity}} and phylogeny of <b>bears</b> (Mammalia, <b>Ursidae)</b> and aspects of its contextual setting under effects of changing conceptual and methodological viewpoints.

The perspective of material approach is exemplified by a material-based study of taxonomical and phyletic status of selected Pliocene to Middle Pleistocene ursine taxa. Along with deconstruction of some traditional hypotheses this produced a model explaining species diversification in ursine bears and its discussion in terms of factual relevance of included background concepts. In the pre-evolutionary period the bear species were usually understood broadly, as incipient immanent entities, yet exhibiting obvious certain infraspecific variability.

Here we report the development and analyses of the first large scale Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) resource for the American black bear (Ursus americanus). Results Comprehensive analyses of molecular functions, alternative splicing, and tissue-specific expression of 38, 757 black bear EST sequences were conducted using the dog genome as a reference. We identified 18 genes, involved in functions such as lipid catabolism, cell cycle, and vesicle-mediated transport, that are showing rapid evolution in the bear lineage Three genes, Phospholamban (PLN), cysteine glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP 3) and Troponin I type 3 (TNNI 3), are related to heart contraction, and defects in these genes in humans lead to heart disease. Two genes, biphenyl hydrolase-like (BPHL) and CSRP 3, contain positively selected sites in bear. Global analysis of evolution rates of hibernation-related genes in bear showed that they are largely conserved and slowly evolving genes, rather than novel and fast-evolving genes.

40|$|Dramatic {{environmental}} changes associated with global cooling {{since the late}} Miocene, and the onset of glacial-interglacial cycles in the Pleistocene served as a backdrop to the evolutionary radiation of modern <b>bears</b> (family <b>Ursidae).</b> These {{environmental changes}} likely prompted changes in food availability, and triggered dietary adaptations that served as motive forces in ursid evolution. Here, we assess correspondence of dental microwear textures of first and second lower molars with diet in extant ursids. We use the resulting baseline data to evaluate {{the hypothesis that the}} Pleistocene giant short-faced bear, Arctodus simus, was a bone consumer and hyper-scavenger at Rancho La Brea, California, USA. Significant variation along the tooth row is consistent with functional differentiation, with the second molar serving as a better dietary recorder than the first. Results evince significant variation among species: carnivorous and omnivorous ursids (Ursus maritimus, U. americanus) have significantly higher and more variable complexity (Asfc) than more herbivorous ones (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, Tremarctos ornatus, U. malayanus), and A. melanoleuca is differentiated from U. maritimus and U. americanus by significantly higher and more variable anisotropy (epLsar) values.

40|$|The <b>bear</b> family (<b>Ursidae)</b> {{presents}} {{a number of}} phylogenetic ambiguities as the evolutionary relationships of the six youngest members (ursine bears) are largely unresolved. Recent mitochondrial DNA analyses have produced conflicting results {{with respect to the}} phylogeny of ursine bears. In an attempt to resolve these issues, we obtained 1916 nucleotides of mitochondrial DNA sequence data from six gene segments for all eight bear species and conducted maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses on all fragments separately and combined. All six single-region gene trees gave different phylogenetic estimates; however, only for control region data was this significantly incongruent with the results from the combined data. The optimal phylogeny for the combined data set suggests that the giant panda is most basal followed by the spectacled bear. The sloth bear is the basal ursine bear, and there is weak support for a sister taxon relationship of the American and Asiatic black bears. The sun bear is sister taxon to the youngest clade containing brown bears and polar bears. Statistical analyses of alternate hypotheses revealed a lack of strong support for many of the relationships. We suggest that the difficulties surrounding the resolution of the evolutionary relationships of the Ursidae are linked to the existence of sequential rapid radiation events in bear evolution. Thus, unresolved branching orders during these time periods may represent an accurate representation of the evolutionary history of bear species...|$|R
50|$|The largest {{subspecies}} are the Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi) and the questionably distinct peninsular or coastal {{brown bear}} (U. a. gyas). Also the extinct California grizzly (U. a. californicus) was rather large. Once mature, the typical female Kodiak bear can range in body mass from 120 to 318 kg and while from sexual maturity onward male ranges from 168 to 675 kg. According to Guinness Records the average male Kodiak bear is 2.44 m in total length (head-to-tail) {{and has a}} shoulder height of 1.33 m. When averaged between their spring low and fall high weights from both localities, males from Kodiak island and coastal Alaska weighed from 312 to 389 kg with a mean body mass of 357 kg while the same figures in females were 202 to 256 kg with a mean body mass of 224 kg. By the time they reach or exceed eight to nine years of age, male Kodiak bears tend to be much larger than newly mature 6-year-old males, potentially tripling their average weight within three years’ time, and can expect to average between 360 and 545 kg.

40|$|Evolution of the <b>bear</b> family <b>Ursidae</b> is well {{investigated}} {{in terms of}} morphological, paleontological, and genetic features. However, several phylogenetic ambiguities occur within the subfamily Ursinae (the family Ursidae excluding the giant panda and spectacled bear), which may correlate with behavioral traits of female philopatry and male-biased dispersal which {{form the basis of}} the observed matriarchal population structure in these species. In the process of bear evolution, we investigate the premise that such behavioral traits may be reflected in patterns of variation among genes with different modes of inheritance: matrilineal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), patrilineal Y chromosome, biparentally inherited autosomes, and the X chromosome. In the present study, we sequenced 3 Y-linked genes (3, 453 bp) and 4 X-linked genes (4, 960 bp) and reanalyzed previously published sequences from autosome genes (2, 347 bp) in ursid species to investigate differences in evolutionary rates associated with patterns of inheritance. The results describe topological incongruence between sex-linked genes and autosome genes and between nuclear DNA and mtDNA. In more ancestral branches within the bear phylogeny, Y-linked genes evolved faster than autosome and X-linked genes, consistent with expectations based on male-driven evolution. However, this pattern changes among branches leading to each species within the lineage of Ursinae whereby the evolutionary rates of Y-linked genes have fewer than expected substitutions. This inconsistency between more recent nodes of the bear phylogeny with more ancestral nodes may reflect the influences of sex-biased dispersal as well as molecular evolutionary characteristics of the Y chromosome, and stochastic events in species natural history, and phylogeography unique to ursine bears...|$|R
