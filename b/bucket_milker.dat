50|$|Following milking each cow, the <b>bucket</b> <b>milker</b> {{would be}} {{dumped into the}} {{receiver}} cart. A foot pedal {{on the base of}} the cart lifted the cover, which kept contaminating dust and debris out of the cart, and allowed the farmer to hold the heavy <b>bucket</b> <b>milker</b> with both hands while pouring. A diffuser plate {{in the top of the}} cart prevented milk from splashing out while rapidly pouring the milk, and a large filter disk under the diffuser removed any debris from the milk.|$|E
50|$|As barns {{began to}} {{increase}} in size from perhaps 6 to 12 cows to 30 or 40 cows, the <b>bucket</b> <b>milker</b> became a very laborious milking system. As the barn length increased, the farmer had to walk an increasing distance from the cow to the milk bulk tank to dump the collected milk. An early vacuum milk-transport system known as the Step-Saver was developed to save the farmer the trouble of carrying the heavy steel buckets of milk {{all the way back}} to the storage tank in the milkhouse. The system used a very long vacuum hose coiled around a receiver cart, and connected to a vacuum-breaker device in the milkhouse.|$|E
50|$|The Washer/Releaser {{could be}} used in {{association}} with both dairy pipelines and the Step-Saver, a milk transfer cart used with <b>bucket</b> <b>milkers.</b> The Step-Saver and the Washer/Releaser were once extremely common in the 1960s to 1980s on small family dairy farms in the United States, to reduce the labor of bucket milking before the milk pipeline became more popular.|$|R
