25|$|When {{the wave}} {{front of the}} emitted beam has perturbations, only the {{transverse}} coherence length (where the wave front perturbation is less than 1/4 of the wavelength) {{should be considered as}} a Gaussian <b>beam</b> <b>diameter</b> when determining the divergence of the laser beam. If the transverse coherence length in the vertical direction is higher than in horizontal, the laser beam divergence will be lower in the vertical direction than in the horizontal.|$|E
25|$|PAR {{lights are}} often used in {{theatrical}} or live music shows. Commonly {{they are used to}} generate colours by fitting them with colored sheets called gels. The cans are arranged into rows of different colours and identical rows placed on different sides of the stage. Due to their affordability, they are ideal for colour washes in several different colours. However, {{because of the lack of}} control over the <b>beam</b> <b>diameter,</b> shape and sharpness, PARs are rarely used as front of house lights other than for front washes but can be used for special effect lighting such as lighting from directly above or from extreme angles as well as general wash lights overhead/above stage. If used cleverly, par cans can provide low budget productions with good effects.|$|E

40|$|The ISO 11254 {{standard}} for LIDT tests suggests two possible beam profiles for damage testing. In {{the case of}} the Gaussian beam an effective area {{on the basis of the}} 1 /e² diameter is given, and for a top-hat profile the full diameter is incorporated. To match measurements from test benches working with Gaussian and top-hat laser beams, a comparative test campaign at varying <b>beam</b> <b>diameters</b> is of major interest for an evaluation of analogies or deviations. In order to obtain experimental LIDT, data adequate tests were performed in two testing institutions. An equal set of samples was tested with a Gaussian TEM 0, 0 as well as with a top-hat beam profile at different <b>beam</b> <b>diameters.</b> This contribution will present results of these investigations at the Nd:YAG wavelength and harmonics in the ns regime. ...|$|R
50|$|Spot size, or {{the width}} of the laser beam, {{directly}} affects the depth of penetration of the light energy due to scattering effects in the dermal layer. Larger <b>beam</b> <b>diameters</b> result in deeper deposition of energy and hence can induce higher temperatures in deeper follicles.

25|$|Antler <b>beam</b> <b>diameter,</b> not {{the number}} of tines, {{indicates}} age. In North America moose (A. a. americanus) antlers are usually larger than those of Eurasian moose and have two lobes on each side, like a butterfly. Eurasian moose antlers resemble a seashell, with a single lobe on each side. In the North Siberian moose (A. a. bedfordiae), the posterior division of the main fork divides into three tines, with no distinct flattening. In the common moose (A. a. alces) this branch usually expands into a broad palmation, with one large tine at the base {{and a number of}} smaller snags on the free border. There is, however, a Scandinavian breed of the common moose in which the antlers are simpler and recall those of the East Siberian animals. The palmation appears to be more marked in North American moose than in the typical Scandinavian moose.|$|E

If , the setup acts as a positive-dispersion stretcher and if , it is a negative-dispersion stretcher. And the case [...] is used in the pulse shaper. Usually, the focusing element is a spherical or cylindrical mirror rather than a lens. As with the configuration in Figure 1, it is possible to use an additional mirror and use a single grating rather than two separate ones. This setup requires that the <b>beam</b> <b>diameter</b> is very small compared to the length of the telescope; otherwise undesirable aberrations will be introduced. For this reason, it is normally used as a stretcher before the amplification stage, since the low-intensity seed pulses can be collimated to a beam with a small diameter.|$|E

40|$|In {{laser welding}} and other processes, such as {{cladding}} and additive manufacturing, the weld bead geometry (depth of penetration and weld width) {{can be controlled}} with different parameters. A common practice is to develop process parameters for a particular application based on an engineering approach using the system parameters i. e. laser power and travel speed. However, {{in such a case}} the process is optimised for a particular system only. This study is focused on understanding of the phenomena controlling the weld profile in conduction welding {{for a wide range of}} <b>beam</b> <b>diameters</b> from 0. 07 mm to 5. 50 mm. It has been shown that the weld bead geometry can be controlled by the spatial and temporal distribution of laser energy on the surface of workpiece, such as power density, interaction time and energy density. This means that similar depths of penetration can be achieved with various optical set-ups. It has been also found that it is more difficult to achieve pure conduction welds with small <b>beam</b> <b>diameters,</b> which are typically used in powder bed additive manufacturing, due to high conduction losses and low vaporisation threshold...|$|R

Thus, high-power DPSSLs generally have a larger <b>beam</b> <b>diameter,</b> as the 1064 nm laser is expanded before it reaches the KTP crystal, reducing the irradiance from the infrared light.

40|$|A simple, {{fast and}} {{efficient}} method is demonstrated for the fabrication of very homogeneous periodic nano-cone arrays on planar Si substrates by {{focused ion beam}} milling. The approach makes use of the actual shape of the ion beam by simply milling lines in vertical and horizontal direction with the lines separated by the targeted periodicity. If beam currents and, thus, <b>beam</b> <b>diameters</b> are chosen appropriately, this patterning approach results in nano-cone arrays with apex radii of 25 nm and below.

To a certain extent, height, aspect ratio, apex radius and shape of the individual cones can b e varied using different <b>beam</b> <b>diameters.</b> While constant dwell times are used for planar samples, it is shown that homogeneous nano-cone arrays can only be realized on the whole surface of protruded rectangular mesa structures if the patterning strategy is adapted appropriately.
