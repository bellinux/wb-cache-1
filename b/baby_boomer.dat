This Brief examines various measures and finds: The number of Social Security beneficiaries per 100 covered workers will increase from 30 in 2005 to 46 in 2030 and to 50 in 2050.

40|$|<b>Baby</b> <b>boomers</b> (those born c. 1945 to c. 1965) are {{entering}} later life. As a result, by 2035, {{almost a quarter}} of the UK population will be over 65. Current policy and practice in the UK is that people should, wherever possible, age at home, but there is no research into what home means to <b>baby</b> <b>boomers.</b> Therefore, this researcher asks two questions. Firstly, how can the meaning of home for <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> be explored? Secondly, what influence does the life course have on the meaning of home for six <b>baby</b> <b>boomers?</b> Existing literature informed the research. For example, some literature suggests methodology for researching issues similar to the meaning of home; other research explores meanings of home amongst groups other than baby boomers; and research into the life course of <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> has attributed to them characteristics which could influence their meaning of home. As a result, this researcher adopts a qualitative methodology which participant generated images, photo elicitation interviews and reflective review panels. This enabled the meaning of home for six participants to emerge from stories and photographs of their own homes and their individual life course. The six stories are published as a separate volume. Although based on only six <b>baby</b> <b>boomers,</b> the research suggests important conclusions. The first research question produced unique methodology for revealing deep layers of understanding of the meaning of home for these <b>baby</b> <b>boomers.</b> The second research question showed that, despite what one might expect from reading other research, the unique life course of six <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> has not created a meaning of home which is markedly different from earlier cohorts. However, what is acknowledge is that choice which is a key concept for the meaning of home, is influenced by the broader social context of demographic changes and changes in living arrangements. Further investigation of the meaning of home for <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> is necessary to help influence policy and practice; this research proposes important ideas about the methodology for that work, also suggestions for further research based on the findings from this study...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the PPACA, {{hospitals}} and medical care facilities are forced to rethink the demand for nurses and non-physician providers. This is mainly because this new Act drew millions of people the opportunity at medical attention that did not have it before, and {{because there are so many}} new people in need of medical attention, the need for medical professionals also grows. With the combination of this new Act, and the aging <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> population, there is expected to be a large increase in the need for medical staff, especially physicians. Unfortunately, the Act did not account for the need for increased physician residency expansion thus creating an artificial shortage of physicians in an already-overloaded system. According to a study published in American Medical News (an online publication that no longer exists), nurse practitioners' jobs are expected to grow up to 130 percent from 86,000 in 2008 to 198,000 in 2025 through aggressive lobbying. Though there is some skepticism to these vast figures, they are backed up by many studies and the opinions of very well known medical professionals.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that Americans have six {{lifestyle}} choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time. An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension programs will be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people. The reasons that some people choose to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and fringe benefits, expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual’s work force participation decision.|$|E
