5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years ago. A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic <b>bottlenecks</b> in their history, the first about 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering their genetic variability.

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{indiscriminate}} breeding practices, as of 2001 only a few thousand purebred Marwaris existed. Research studies have been conducted to examine the genetics of the Marwari and its relationship to other Indian and non-Indian horse breeds. Six different breeds have been identified in India: the Marwari, Kathiawari, Spiti pony, Bhutia pony, Manipuri Pony, and Zanskari. These six are distinct from each other in terms of unique performance traits and different agroclimactic conditions in the various areas of India where they originated. A 2005 study was conducted to identify past genetic <b>bottlenecks</b> in the Marwari. The study found that, in the DNA of the horses tested, {{there was no evidence of}} a genetic bottleneck in the breed's history. However, since the population has decreased rapidly in past decades, <b>bottlenecks</b> may have occurred that were not identified in the study. In 2007, a study was conducted to assess genetic variation among all Indian horse breeds except the Kathiawari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Marwari was found to be the most genetically distinct breed of the five studied, and was most distant from the Manipuri; none of the breeds were found to have close genetic ties to the Thoroughbred. The Marwari was distinguishable from the other breeds in terms of both physical characteristics (mainly height) and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari are closely associated with the Arabian horse, while the four other breeds are supposedly descended from the Tibetan pony.|$|E

5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become <b>bottlenecks</b> at such times. The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues.

When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bottleneck</b> shiftiness is an {{important}} managerial problem that negatively affects shop floor manageability. It has therefore received much research attention. Yet {{research has focused on}} how protective capacity can be used to influence <b>bottleneck</b> shiftiness rather than on assessing its operational impact. The latter is complex to evaluate since changing the degree of <b>bottleneck</b> shiftiness influences utilization, which makes the results of different experimental settings non-comparable. To overcome this problem, we take a different approach. <b>Bottleneck</b> shiftiness is decomposed by investigating its underlying phenomenon: the impact of the <b>bottleneck</b> position. Using simulation, we demonstrate that tighter control can be exercised, and better performance achieved, the further upstream the <b>bottleneck</b> is positioned. It is consequently important {{to be aware of the}} direction of the <b>bottleneck</b> shift. If the <b>bottleneck</b> shifts upstream, performance is likely to improve rather than deteriorate as is implicitly assumed in the literature...|$|R

We propose three implementations of <b>bottleneck</b> permits for Pareto-improving: (1) merging priority rule is included in the <b>bottleneck</b> permits scheme by creating different market for each origin; (2) the permit revenues are refunded as monetary compensation to drivers whose cost is increased; and (3) the permit revenues are used to expand <b>bottleneck</b> capacity.
