40|$|Computer-assisted sperm analyzers (CASA) {{have become}} the {{standard}} tool for evaluating sperm motility and kinetic patterns because they provide objective data for thousands of sperm tracks. However, these devices are not ready-to-use and standardization of analytical practices is a fundamental requirement. In this study, we evaluated the effects of some settings, such as frame rate and frames per field, chamber and time of analysis, and samples preparations, including thawing temperature, sperm sample concentration, and media used for dilution, on the kinetic results of <b>bovine</b> frozen-thawed <b>semen</b> using a CASA. In Experiment 1, the frame rate (30 - 60 frame/s) significantly affected motility parameters, whereas the number of frames per field (30 or 45) {{did not seem to}} affect sperm kinetics. In Experiment 2, the thawing protocol affects sperm motility and kinetic parameters. Sperm sample concentration significantly limited the opportunity to perform the analysis and the kinetic results. A concentration of 100 and 50 x 10 (6) sperm/mL limited the device's ability to perform the analysis or gave wrong results, whereas 5, 10, 20, and 30 x 10 (6) sperm/mL concentrations allowed the analysis to be performed, but with different results (Experiment 3). The medium used for the dilution of the sample, which is fundamental for a correct sperm head detection, affects sperm motility results (Experiment 4). In this study, Makler and Leja chambers were used to perform the semen analysis with CASA devices. The chamber used significantly affected motility results (Experiment 5). The time between chamber loading and analysis affected sperm velocities, regardless of chamber used. Based on results recorded in this study, we propose that the CASA evaluation of motility of <b>bovine</b> frozen-thawed <b>semen</b> using Hamilton-Thorne IVOS 12. 3 should be performed using a frame rate of 60 frame/s and 30 frames per field. Semen should be diluted at least at 20 x 10 (6) sperm/mL using PBS. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the type of chamber used and perform the analysis within 1 or 2 min, regardless of the chamber used. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of different cooling rates on the post-thawing quality of <b>bovine</b> spermatozoa. Ejaculated <b>semen</b> from a 24 -month-old Jersey bull was collected using an artificial vagina and diluted in a commercial extender to evaluate spermatozoan concentration and motility subjectively before cooling and freezing and after thawing. Straws were allocated to four cooling curves: rapid (RD), semi-rapid (SRD), semi-slow (SSLW) and slow (SLW). The temperature was decreased from 25 ºC to 4 ºC in 10, 50, 110 and 135 min, which represents a cooling rate of 2. 06, 0. 40, 0. 18 and 0. 15 ºC/min, respectively. Then straws were frozen and stored at - 196 ºC. After thawing, one aliquot of each straw was used for evaluation. Spermatozoan integrity and mitochondrial function were evaluated {{using a combination of}} fluorescent probes containing 100 mg/mL FITC-PSA, 0. 5 μg/mL PI and 153 μM JC- 1. At the end of cooling, spermatozoan motility did not differ among RD (63. 3 %), SRD (66. 7 %), SSLW (66. 7 %) and SLW (80. 0 %). However, normal spermatozoan morphology was lower in SRD (84. 8 %) compared to RD (91. 7 %), SSLW (91. 7 %) and SLW (90. 3 %) (P< 0. 05). In thawed semen, spermatozoan motility and normal morphology did not differ among RD (40. 0 %; 88. 8 %), SRD (43. 3 %; 82. 5 %), SSLW (40. 0 %; 87. 2 %) and SLW (36. 7 %; 88. 0 %). The percentage of damaged spermatozoa, including plasma and acrosome membrane damage and low mitochondrial potential, was higher in RD compared to the others (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, a rapid cooling curve is detrimental to the spermatozoa and affects the post-thaw spermatozoan integrity of <b>bovine</b> frozen <b>semen...</b>|$|R

50|$|Artificial {{insemination}} (AI) is {{the deliberate}} introduction of sperm into a female's uterus or cervix {{for the purpose}} of achieving a pregnancy through in vivo fertilization by means other than sexual intercourse. It is a fertility treatment for humans, and is common practice in animal breeding, including dairy cattle (see Frozen <b>bovine</b> <b>semen)</b> and pigs.|$|E
50|$|Semen in {{the early}} days of {{artificial}} insemination was delivered everyday to technicians by bull studs as semen was not frozen at this point. It was not until the addition of glycerol to semen extenders that semen could be frozen. In those early days semen was extended by bulls stud into a type of bottle, or test tube, kept at low temperatures, and delivered to technicians usually everyday. The freezing process was discovered by a man named Polge. It was placed in containers called glass ampules, sealed, frozen in dry ice and alcohol and kept in that type of solution until it was needed for insemination. Later the liquid nitrogen refrigerator was invented by Union Carbide with money given to them by John Rockefeller Prentice, who used it exclusively for his bull stud before a number of years later giving it to the entire A.I. industry at no charge or royalty. Liquid nitrogen temperature is 320 degrees below zero, thus almost an absolute temperature that allows very little deterioration of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen.</b> It is also a safe product as it is not flammable. The ampules were fastened to a cane which was placed inside the canister. When the technician needs to inseminate the cow he merely opens the tank, pulls up the desired canister, selects the cane and puts the ampule in a water bath usually of an ice cube and water mixture. The ampule thaws for several minutes and the top is broken off by either the ampule being pre-scribed or cut with a scribe. Then the semen is drawn up into a pipette. A polybulb or syringe is attached to the end of the pipette to facilitate this.|$|E

40|$|Brucellosis is a {{bacterial}} disease, which, although affecting cattle primarily, {{has been associated}} with human infections, making its detection an important challenge. The existing gold standard diagnosis relies on the culture of bacteria which is a lengthy and costly process, taking up to 45 days. New technologies based on molecular diagnosis have been proposed, either through dip-stick, immunological assays, which have limited specificity, or using nucleic acid tests, which enable to identify the pathogen, but are impractical for use in the field, where most of the reservoir cases are located. Here we demonstrate a new test based on hybridization assays with metal nanoparticles, which, upon detection of a specific pathogen-derived DNA sequence, yield a visual colour change. We characterise the components used in the assay with a range of analytical techniques and show sensitivities down to 1000 cfu/ml for the detection of Brucella.

Therefore the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a multiplex PCR assay to detect M. bovis, M. californicum and M. bovigenitalium, and evaluate its analytical performance against traditional culture of <b>bovine</b> milk, <b>semen</b> and swab samples. The PCR specificity was determined and the limit of detection evaluated in spiked milk, semen and swabs. The PCR was then compared to culture on 474 field samples from individual milk, bulk tank milk (BTM), semen and swab (vaginal, preputial, nose and eye) samples. Specificity analysis produced appropriate amplification for all M. bovis, M. californicum and M. bovigenitalium isolates. Amplification was not seen for any of the other Mollicutes or eubacterial isolates. The limit of detection of the PCR was best in milk, followed by semen and swabs. When all three Mycoplasma species were present in a sample, the limit of detection increased. When comparing culture and PCR, overall there was no significant difference in the proportion of culture and PCR positive samples. Culture could detect significantly more positive swab samples. No significant differences were identified for semen, individual milk or BTM samples. PCR identified five samples with two species present. Culture followed by 16 S- 23 S rRNA sequencing did not enable identification of more than one species. Therefore, the superior method for identification of M. bovis, M. californicum and M. bovigenitalium may be dependent on the sample type being analysed, and whether the identification of multiple target species is required...|$|R

The most important finding of this study is the detection of the genome of BoHV- 1 and BoHV- 4 in semen of bulls maintained at artificial insemination centers. It is particularly relevant that BoHV- 1 DNA was also identified in one sample of international origin suggesting the need for extensive quality control measures on international transport of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Infection with bovine {{herpesvirus}} type 1 (BHV- 1) occurs {{worldwide and}} causes serious economic losses {{due to the}} deaths of animals, abortions, decreased milk production, and loss of body weight. BHV- 1 is frequently found in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> and is transmitted through natural service and artificial insemination. The detection of BHV- 1 in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> is a long-standing problem in veterinary virology which is important in disease control schemes. In the present study, ordered deletions of the full-length BHV- 1 glycoprotein open reading frame were used to identify an epitope recognized by a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb). A glycoprotein D fragment containing this epitope was then amplified using an in vitro protein amplification assay developed previously (J. Zhou, J. Lyaku, R. A. Fredrickson, and F. S. Kibenge, J. Virol. Methods 79 : 181 - 189, 1999), and the resulting peptide was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the specific MAb. This method detected 0. 0395 50 % tissue culture infective dose of BHV- 1 in raw <b>bovine</b> <b>semen,</b> which was 1, 000 -fold more sensitive than traditional PCR. We therefore conclude that this in vitro protein amplification assay combined with ELISA has superior sensitivity for direct virus detection in clinical samples. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the efficiency of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> cryopreservation using the controlled-rate freezing machine versus the conventional method (uncontrolled curve) by the parameters of sperm quality and viability in post-thaw period. Semen from four adult crossbreed bulls was cryopreserved in Tris-yolk-glycerol medium. The computer assisted analysis of thawed semen detected the following results: PM 56. 50 ± 22. 25 %; VAP 34. 77 ± 4. 25 μm/s; VSL 28. 17 ± 4. 25 μm/s; VCL 58. 45 ± 6. 85 μm/s; STR 82. 00 ± 2. 31 %; LIN 49. 50 ± 3. 32 %, to automated system and PM 57. 00 ± 13. 11 %; VAP 25. 75 ± 1. 66 μm/s; VSL 23. 32 ± 1. 99 μm/s; VCL 63. 32 ± 1. 79 μm/s; STR 82. 25 ± 3. 59 μm/s; LIN 50. 00 ± 4. 97 μm/s to conventional cryopreservation system. The results of plasma membrane and acrosome integrity evaluation were 54. 7 ± 12. 55 % and 36. 13 ± 22. 20 % for the automated system and 53. 22 ± 13. 22 % and 47. 26 ± 5. 74 % for the conventional system, respectively. The parameters evaluated demonstrated that there was no statistical difference between the cryopreservation systems. Thus, the choice of the <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> cryopreservation method to be used on a farm is a responsibility of the technician, and should be based on the reality of each farm. Therefore, it is always necessary to consider that the conventional system of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> cryopreservation can vary more than the automated system, which, despite the cost of the equipment, can ensure repeatability of the results and consequent quality of cryopreserved <b>bovine</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were done to demonstrate whether {{the presence of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> could affect fertilization and/or early embryonic development. In the first experiment, superovulated heifers were inseminated with semen naturally contaminated with P. aeruginosa (ADRI 102) or clean semen and seven day-old embryos were collected nonsurgically. The endometrium of treated heifers appeared {{more sensitive to the}} flush procedures. In experiment 2, heifers were inseminated at synchronized estrus with semen experimentally contaminated with P. aeruginosa (ADRI 102) and processed {{in the same way as}} commercial semen with antibiotics (gentamicin, lincomycin, spectinomycin and tylosin) or processed without antibiotics added. Embryos were recovered at slaughter seven days later. In general, there was no significant reduction in fertility or development of embryos in vitro as a result of relatively high numbers of P. aeruginosa in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{methods for}} the {{detection}} of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) RNA were rapidly developed after the emergence of this novel orthobunyavirus in Europe. The SBV epizootic wave has declined, but infectious SBV in SBV RNA–positive semen remains a possible risk for the distribution of SBV. However, the abilities of SBV molecular detection methods used at European laboratories have not yet been assessed, to our knowledge. The performances of extraction and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) methods used at 27 German and 17 other European laboratories for SBV RNA detection in the matrices of whole blood, serum, tissue homogenate, RNA eluates, and <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> were evaluated in 2 interlaboratory trials with special emphasis on semen extraction methods. For reliable detection of viral genome in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> samples, highly effective extraction methods are essential to cope with the potential inhibitory effects of semen components on PCR results. All methods used by the 44 laboratories were sufficiently robust to detect SBV RNA with high diagnostic sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (95. 8 %) in all matrices, except semen. The trials demonstrated that the published recommended semen extraction methods (Hoffmann et al. 2013) and a combination of TRIzol LS with an alternative extraction kit have a considerably higher diagnostic sensitivity to detect SBV RNA in semen up to a detection limit of Cq ≤ 35 compared to other extraction methods used. A thorough validation of extraction methods with standardized semen batches is essential before their use for SBV RNA detection in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>semen</b> samples {{spiked with}} bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) {{were used to}} compare dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and virus isolation for detection of BHV- 1 in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen.</b> The PCR amplification used primers targeting the BHV- 1 thymidine kinase gene and a nucleic acid releasing cocktail (GeneReleaser); the PCR product {{was used as the}} DNA probe in dot blot hybridization; virus isolation was done in primary bovine fetal testis (BFT) cell cultures. Semen diluted 1 : 20 in tissue culture medium had the least cytotoxicity and inhibition of viral cytopathic effects in BFT cells, allowing detection of 1 TCID 50 / 100 microL of BHV- 1 suspension by virus isolation. The presence of foreign DNA such as bovine sperm DNA or salmon sperm DNA increased the sensitivity of dot blot hybridization in detecting BHV- 1, allowing detection of 20, 000 TCID 50 / 100 microL of neat semen. The inhibition of PCR amplification of BHV- 1 DNA in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> was eliminated by diluting the samples 1 : 20 in tissue culture medium. The best PCR amplification was obtained when semen was diluted 1 : 20 and when a reaction buffer of pH 9. 0, with 1. 0 mM MgCl 2 was used. Under these conditions, the PCR followed by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels could detect 1 TCID 20 / 100 microL of sample, whereas PCR followed by Southern blot hybridization could detect 0. 01 TCID 50 / 100 microL of sample.
