40|$|A {{new kind}} of barrier {{materials}}, so called “chaotic” materials and involving interactions with nano-charges, is presented. By contrast with conventional use of nano-clays, the sought effect consists not in increasing the tortuosity to penetrants but in increasing the dwelling times of solutes around accessible clays designed on purpose. The paper reviews several theoretical models that explain why effective diffusion coefficients (D) decay due to entropic trapping. The physical concepts are applied to a simple material made of a deactivated glass column filled with montmorillonites and exposed to several gas phases enriched in organic solutes. In this simple physical model, a carrier gas replaces the polymer so that molecular effects can be visualized and analyzed almost in real time with a simple flame-ionization detector. The future directions to combine a <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>material</b> (PLA) and montmorillonites are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Re-design of casein {{micelles}} is {{a challenge}} in creating new functionalities to this <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>material</b> produced worldwide. Herein, we present a procedure to create stable casein microgel particles from casein micelles using a natural cross-linker named genipin. The reaction between genipin and casein micelles was characterized {{by the development of}} a blue color. The casein molecules formed a covalently linked protein matrix via cross-linking of lysyl and arginyl residues. The size and charge of casein microgel particles decreased, and their surfaces became gradually smother. Based on light scattering and rheological measurements, we showed that the cross-linking was only intra-micellar. These particles were stable in the presence of dissociating agents, but swelled {{as a consequence of the}} changes in solvent quality. Contrarily to native casein micelles, casein microgel particles did not dissociate at the interface air/water, and formed elastic interfaces. The potential use of these particles as adaptable nanocarriers is evocated in the article...|$|E
40|$|In today’s economy {{increased}} attention is given towards re-using of available resources and using of resources which are re-generable, {{to evaluate and}} reduce {{the impact on the}} environment. For the polymer industry, the development of alternative and renewable raw materials represents an essential task. The study evaluates the different choices of unsaturated polyester resins (UPR) for production of centrifugally-cast glass reinforced pipe (cc-GRP) systems. The environmental impacts of three types of resin were evaluated and compared. The resins are: UPR standard, UPR containing recycled PET material (rPET-UPR) and UPR containing <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>material</b> (BIO-UPR). The analysis focuses on comparing the variations in environmental indicators caused by resin selection for three increasingly complex product layers (Base plate of cc-GRP shaft, cc-GRP Shaft and 1 km cc-GRP Pipe-system). The study equally provides an insight onto R&D and LCA collaboration across the supply-chain. One of the main challenges in LCA today is using specific data from the suppliers instead of generic data. The paper indicates how LCA tools and established R&D processes can be employed to transfer LCA calculations across the supply-chain. BIO-UPR and rPET-UPR are alternatives which are realistic in terms of costs and which ensure the required quality for the manufactured products. rPET-UPR can be used for production of complete pipe systems, with positive environmental indicators. Mechanical proprieties of BIO-UPR restrict its usability and use of this resin presents similarities with the debate regarding use of bio-diesel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bio-sourced</b> <b>materials</b> made of xylan {{reinforced}} by cellulose whiskers do not generally express optimal mechanical performance; {{because of poor}} interfacial stress transfer. Molecular modeling is in principle a choice technique to study the interfacial organization. Unfortunately, with present computing, the time and space scales accessible in full-atoms simulations are not sufficient. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a coarse grain force field able to describe xylan and its interaction with crystalline cellulose. We then have generated atomistic and coarse grain models of cellulose xylan nanocomposites. In the interface, which was 1. 5 nm thick, the xylan chains {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the cellulose were oriented parallel to the surface, adopting a mixture of two-fold (dominant) and three-fold (minor) helical conformations interrupted by kinks, they were mainly aligned to each other and inclined with respect to the fiber axis. The models correctly reproduce the experimental data from various sources. The coarse grain approach holds great promises, it may be used not only to estimate the behavior of the interface under various stresses but also to study transport phenomenon in such bionanocomposites...|$|R
40|$|The {{life style}} of modern civilization is {{strongly}} {{dependent on the}} use of portable devices, which necessarily require safe and very efficient storage and conversion energy systems. Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) represent the most widely used storage technology. In order to lower their cost and environmental impact, efforts are devoted {{to reduce the amount of}} inactive components, to substitute synthetic polymer binders / separators and organic solvents with nano- and <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>materials</b> and to develop new eco-friendly production processes. Natural nanoscale-microfibrillated cellulose (NMFC) fibers are readily available; they show stiffness, impressive mechanical robustness, lightweight and their preparation process is easy and does not involve chemical reactions. Here we review the manufacturing of low cost, bio-inspired all-paper Li-ion polymer cells, constituted by NMFC-binded paper-electrodes, and NMFC reinforced polymer electrolytes. The use of NMFC as filler/binder leads to produce high performing, safe and extremely flexible LiBs. Green, biosourced materials and procedures are also extended to other "beyond-LiB" technologies (i. e., Na-ion and Li-S), as well as next-generation energy conversion devices such as green, water-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), thus demonstrating the possibility of obtaining "truly green" energy storage and conversion devices in the near future...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRationaleTo {{develop more}} {{eco-friendly}} laundry detergents, renewable surfactants synthesized from vegetal sources {{are increasingly being}} used. In a more stringent regulation context, the determination of bio-sourced surfactant origin thus appears essential to assess the claims of detergent manufacturers. Radiocarbon determination, the standard method {{for the analysis of}} <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>materials,</b> is an expensive technique, so {{there is a need for}} a cheaper method. MethodsHere, the use of an elemental analyzer linked to isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) is evaluated as an alternative approach to the official method. The O- 18, C- 13 and H- 2 isotope-ratio values were determined to investigate the bio-sourced origin of surfactant raw materials and mixtures. ResultsA sample library of 26 commercial surfactants representative of detergent raw materials was first analyzed by EA/IRMS. The O- 18, C- 13 and H- 2 values allowed discrimination of synthetic and bio-sourced surfactants. Moreover, in this latter group, C 4 plant-derived surfactants were distinguished by their C- 13 values. Binary and ternary mixtures made of synthetic and bio-sourced surfactants were also analyzed and indicated a linear relationship between mixture isotope-ratio values and surfactant proportions. ConclusionsIRMS represents a viable alternative to radiocarbon determination for the evaluation of surfactant bio-sourced origin. It is a faster and cheaper technique, allowing discrimination of petroleum- and biomass-derived surfactants and identification of their carbon sources (C 4 or C 3 plants...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{currently used}} in aviation {{have one thing}} in common: they are man-made and especially the carbon fibres are very energy intensive in the production. Renewable materials like bio-fibres (e. g. flax) and bio-resins are under investigation for a long time for their use in composites but they did not made it into a modern aircraft in high amounts yet. As safety is of primary importance in aviation, the lack of experience in the long-term performance of composites made of renewable materials is still an obstacle for their usage. It is therefore currently out of scope to substitute high performance and safety-relevant structural parts of the aircraft with <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>materials.</b> On the other side, interior parts and secondary structures which are not stressed on such high levels offer possible areas of application. When replacing state of the art materials like glass fibre reinforced phenolic resins it must be ensured to fulfil the high safety standards. Contrary to glass fibres the lignocellulosic natural fibres are flammable and susceptible to humidity. Therefore special provisions {{must be taken into account}} to protect bio-composites from fire and environmental influence. On the other side bio-resins with promising characteristics could substitute phenolic resins. The presentation will show possible applications of eco-materials and give an overview of obstacles and challenges by the special conditions in aviation. Fire properties of bio-composites with examples of recent results at DLR and suggestions for research topics in future projects will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{properties of}} an oxygen reduction catalyst {{based on a}} unique 3 -dimensional (3 D) nitrogen doped (N-doped) carbon composite are described. The composite material is synthesised via a two-step hydrothermal and pyrolysis method using <b>bio-source</b> low-cost <b>materials</b> of galactose and melamine. Firstly, the use of iron salts and galactose to hydrothermally produceiron oxide (Fe₂O₃) magnetic nanoparticle clusters embedded carbon spheres. Secondly, magnetic nanoparticles diffused out of the carbon sphere when pyrolysed {{in the presence of}} melamine as nitrogen precursor. Interestingly, many of these nanoparticles, as catalyst-grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs), resulted in the formation of N-doped CNTs and N-doped carbon spheres under the decomposition of carbon and a nitrogen environment. The composite material consists of integrated N-doped carbon microspheres and CNTs show high ORR activity through a predominantly four-electron pathway.

40|$|International audienceLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a product-oriented {{method to}} assess the {{environmental}} impacts of a product while accounting for its whole life cycle, "from the cradle to the grave". It is standardised by international norms (ISO, 2006). It was first mostly used for eco-conception in industrial productions, but has been widely spread in the agricultural sector in the last twenty years. By its holistic nature, LCA is a unique method to assess several environmental impacts while avoiding pollution trade-offs between production stages or impact categories. The most renowned impact categories are climate change or energy use, but several other impact categories can also be assessed such as eutrophication or human toxicity. With the growing awareness of the risks associated with climate change and the need to protect the environment, the design of eco-friendly production modes has become critical. Throughout the world, initiatives from both the private and public sectors promote the development of sustainable supply chains including the development of communication tools using LCA indicators. In France, a law was recently promulgated (Grenelle 1, 2009) that makes the eco-labelling based on LCA compulsory {{for a wide range of}} products such as food and pet food, automobile, clothes, electronics etc. Application of LCA to agricultural products or <b>bio-sourced</b> <b>materials</b> is not straightforward due to the variability in agricultural production systems. This variability is particularly important in the Tropics, where both pedo-climatic and socio-cultural conditions greatly vary. To account for the influence of these conditions on the field emissions and the final impacts within LCA, methodological developments are being carried out by the scientific community. Researchers at CIRAD especially focus on how to better account for tropical specificities and perennial crops within LCA (Bessou et al., 2012). They work together with several partners in France (www. elsa-lca. org) and abroad, and CIRAD is notably member of the LCA AgriFood ASIA Network ([URL] Undoubtedly, there is a good opportunity for the actors in the rubber supply chain to benefit from the researches at CIRAD and the dynamism of the LCA AgriFood ASIA Network. Environmental impacts of rubber products will necessarily need to be assessed in a short to medium term, for instance because of buyers requests, and LCA has become the most commonly used method in order to compare products. As a perennial crop, not used for food products, it is crucial {{to assess the}} assets and drawbacks of rubber production in order to define best management practices and supply chain strategies to limit environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|Product degradability, {{sustainability}} and low-toxicity {{are driving}} {{demand for the}} synthesis of biobased polymers and surfactants. Here we report the synthesis of novel surface active polymers using cyclic esters (D,L-lactide) and temperature sensitive polyols (D-sorbitol) as renewable building blocks. We highlight the modification of chain length and degree of branching to provide a route to tailoring the properties and application performance of these new compounds. High processing temperatures (≥ 180 °C) and harsh post-reaction treatments are often needed to remove residual monomer and catalysts and these can become barriers to creating materials based on renewable resources. Here we exploit supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) as a green solvent to overcome these challenges; significantly reducing reaction temperatures, targeting controlled molecular weights with narrow dispersities and reducing sideproduct formation. Additionally in the same pot, we can use supercritical extraction to purify the compounds and to efficiently remove unreacted reagents, which could be recovered and recycled. We believe that our approach to the production and purification of these novel branched poly(lactides) is a significant step towards {{the development of the}} next generation of biopolymers and green surfactants, combining both the use of <b>bio-sourced</b> raw <b>materials</b> and the potential to use sustainable, low energy processes and techniques...|$|R
