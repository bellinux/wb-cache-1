SUCCEED evaluated oral ridaforolimus, in patients with metastatic soft-tissue or bone sarcomas who previously had a favorable response to chemotherapy. In this patient population, ridaforolimus improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo, the primary endpoint of the study. The complete study results were presented by Sant P. Chawla, M.D., director, Sarcoma Oncology Center, Santa Monica, CA, during the 2011 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The SUCCEED (Sarcoma Multi-Center Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy of Ridaforolimus) trial was a randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind study of oral ridaforolimus administered at 40 mg/day (five of seven days per week) in patients with metastatic soft-tissue or bone sarcomas who previously had a favorable response to chemotherapy. Oral ridaforolimus was granted a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) by the FDA for the SUCCEED trial. Based on 552 progression-free survival (PFS) events in 711 patients, (ridaforolimus (N=347), placebo (N=364) determined by an independent radiological review committee, the study achieved its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS, with a statistically significant (p=0.0001) 28 percent reduction {{in the risk of}} progression or death observed in those treated with ridaforolimus compared to placebo (hazard ratio=0.72).

40|$|The {{two most}} common primary bone malignancies, {{osteosarcoma}} and Ewing sarcoma, are both aggressive, highly metastatic cancers that most often strike teens, though both {{can be found}} in younger children and adults. Despite distinct origins and pathogenesis, both diseases share several mechanisms of progression and metastasis, including neovascularization, invasion, anoikis resistance, chemoresistance and evasion of the immune response. Some of these processes are well-studies in more common carcinoma models, and the observation from adult diseases may be readily applied to pediatric <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Neovascularization, which includes angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, is a clear example of a process that is likely to be similar between carcinomas and sarcomas, since the responding cells are the same in each case. Chemoresistance mechanisms also may be similar between other cancers and the <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Since osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are mesenchymal in origin, the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation is largely absent in <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> necessitating different approaches to study progression and metastasis in these diseases.

40|$|Background: Radiation-induced <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with high doses of ionizing radiation from therapeutic or occupation-related exposures. However, the development of <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> following exposure to lower doses of ionizing radiation remains speculative. Methods: A cohort analysis based on the Life Span Study (n = 120, 321) was performed to assess the development of <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> in atomic-bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki followed from 1958 to 2001. The excess relative risk per gray of ionizing radiation absorbed by the bone marrow was estimated. Additional subject demographic, survival, and clinical factors were evaluated. Results: Nineteen cases of <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (in eleven males and eight females) were identified among the 80, 181 subjects who met the inclusion criteria, corresponding to an incidence of 0. 9 per 100, 000 person-years. The mean ages {{at the time of the}} bombing and at diagnosis were 32. 4 and 61. 6 years, respectively. Themean bonemarrow dose was 0. 43 Gy. Osteosarcoma was the most commonly identified <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> The most common <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> site was the pelvis. The overall unadjusted five-year survival rate was 25 %. A dose threshold was found at 0. 85 Gy (95 % confidence interval, 0. 12 to 1. 85 Gy), with a linear dose-response association above this threshold. The linear slope equaled an excess relative risk of 7. 5 per Gy (95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 to 23. 14 per Gy) in excess of 0. 85 Gy. Conclusions: On the basis of what we believe is one of the longest and largest prospective studies assessing the development of <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation, it appears that the development of radiation-induced bone sarcomamay be associated with exposure tomuch lower doses of ionizing radiation than have previously been reported. Such new insights may potentially improve <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> preventionmeasures and broaden our understanding of the role of ionizing radiation from various sources on the development of malignant tumors. This study stresses the need to become increasingly aware of the various health risks that may be attributable to even low levels of ionizing radiation exposure.

40|$|Bone sarcomas {{include a}} very large number of tumour subtypes, which {{originate}} form bone and more particularly from mesenchymal stem cell lineage. Osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and chondrosarcoma, the three main <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> entities develop in a favourable microenvironment composed by bone cells, blood vessels, immune cells, based on the 'seed and soil theory'. Current therapy associates surgery and chemotherapy, however, bone sarcomas remain diseases with high morbidity and mortality especially in children and adolescents. In the past decade, various new therapeutic approaches emerged and target the tumour niche or/and directly the tumour cells by acting on signalling/metabolic pathways involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis or drug resistance. The present review gives a brief overview from basic to clinical assessment of the main targeted therapies of <b>bone</b> <b>sarcoma</b> cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sarcomas are a {{heterogeneous}} group of malignant neoplasms arising from mesenchymal cells which encompass dozens of histological types and {{can occur in}} virtually any anatomic site. They form {{one of the principal}} groups of rare cancers in Europe as defined in the RARECARE project. We analysed 45, 568 incident cases diagnosed during 1995 – 2002 and registered by 76 population-based cancer registries. Total crude incidence was 5. 6 per 100, 000 per year with an estimated 27, 908 new cases per year in the EU 27 countries, of which 84 % were soft tissue sarcomas and 14 % were <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) were only widely recognised as an entity in the late 1990 s and consequently were under-registered. Their true incidence is believed to be about 1. 5 per 100, 000. Age-standardised incidence of soft tissue sarcomas ranged from 3. 3 per 100, 000 in Eastern Europe to 4. 7 per 100, 000 in Northern Europe. About 280, 000 persons were estimated to be alive at the beginning of 2003 with a past diagnosis of sarcoma, of which 83 % were soft tissue sarcomas and 16 % were <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Five-year relative survival for 2000 – 2002 by the period was 58 % for soft tissue sarcomas and 62 % for <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> The diversity and rarity of sarcomas combined with the quite large number of people affected by them mean that they provide a classic example of the importance of networking in diagnosis, therapy and research for rare cancers...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the basic biology and pathology of bone and soft-tissue tumors is essential for appropriate planning of their treatment. This chapter reviews the unique biological behavior of soft-tissue and <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> which underlies the basis for their staging, resection, {{and the use of}} appropriate adjuvant treatment modalities. A detailed description of the clinical, radiographic, and pathological characteristics for the most common sarcomas is presented...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic imaging of <b>bone</b> <b>sarcomas</b> of the {{pelvic girdle}} using {{computed}} tomograpgy, sonography and scintigraphy {{was performed on}} 59 patients with the aim to determine the precise tumor localization and to assess tumor spread. Features of tumor spread into the pelvic bones involving all layers of the bone were found. The main trends in spread of soft tissue component in bones of the pelvic girdle were studied...|$|R
