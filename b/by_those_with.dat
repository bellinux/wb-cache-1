5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> {{a wide range of}} speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E
5|$|Each team progressed {{through four}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. Manchester City were a First Division team chasing a league and cup double; Bolton Wanderers were a mid-table Second Division team. Consequently, most {{observers}} anticipated a Manchester City win. In a close match featuring strong defensive play, Manchester City won 1â€“0. The goal, scored by Billy Meredith, was disputed <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> Bolton sympathies, who believed Meredith to be offside. The victory gave Manchester City their first major honour.|$|E

5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} than at any time since the advent of Humanism. Work <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> {{scientific}} as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E
5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions {{have been reported in}} the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used}} as justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compares the}} results of cysticercus-specific IgG {{antibody}} levels, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with brain CT findings in suspected neurocysticercosis and to assess the clinical significance of ELISA. One hundred twenty-three neurologic patients were examined by both brain CT and ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity of ELISA in confirmed cases were 94 % and 91 %, respectively. Patients with multiple cysts without enhancement on CT, which were thought to represent viable cysticerci, were positive <b>by</b> ELISA. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> cysts with enhancement or poorly defined low densities or enhancing nodules, which represented cysticerci on degener-ation, were also positive <b>by</b> ELISA. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> multiple spotty calcifications, which represent cysticerci in the inactive stage, were negative <b>by</b> ELISA. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> mixed CT findings of the above, which represent the various stages of infection in a patient, were positive <b>by</b> ELISA. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> only enhancing nodules with surrounding edema, which {{were thought to be}} other inflammatory granulomas, were negative by ELISA. If patients with only hydrocephalus on CT are positive by ELISA, they can be confidently diagnosed as having ventricular cysticercosis...|$|R

5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
