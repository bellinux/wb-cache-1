5|$|In {{the ensuing}} ODIs, Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16.16. The Australian {{selectors}} sought to accommodate Hayden, {{who had been}} successful as a Test opener, into the ODI team <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> him with Gilchrist and Waugh, but this appeared to unsettle the team. With a newly fragile top-order, Australia failed {{to qualify for the}} finals, and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team, ending Gilchrist's four-year partnership with Mark. Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings is {{an amateur}} flight {{simulator}} {{game in which}} the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, {{and the use of}} a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> and scaling flat objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval European clockmakers were Christian monks. Medieval {{religious institutions}} required clocks because they regulated daily prayer- and work-schedules strictly, using {{various types of}} time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination. When mechanical clocks came into use, they were often wound {{at least twice a}} day to ensure accuracy. Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device, such as by a falling weight or <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> beater.|$|E

5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) works <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> {{the polarization}} {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage <b>by</b> <b>rotating</b> bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
