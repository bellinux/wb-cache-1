5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's <b>blurring</b> <b>of</b> Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, {{positively}} noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E

5|$|The K-T {{boundary}} {{is associated}} with abnormally high amounts of iridium, an element which is rare in Earth's crust, but relatively common in asteroids and in Earth's core. This {{has been used as}} evidence that a meteorite impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (the Alvarez hypothesis). However, some paleontologists attribute the extinction event and the iridium anomaly to more gradual climatic change caused by the volcanic activity of the Deccan Traps. The Nanxiong Basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains the K-T boundary. However, the position of boundary, as well as the duration of the extinction have been subject to debate. Zhao et al. (2002 and 2009) have postulated that there were at least two iridium-delivering events over a time period consistent with the Deccan Traps volcanism, correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from the Nanxiong Basin. According to their interpretation, Macroolithus survived 250,000 years into the early Paleocene. However, Buck et al. (2004) disputed these claims, arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked the sediments near the boundary, causing a <b>blurring</b> <b>of</b> the iridium anomaly and the appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept and}} {{scenario}} draft {{was written by}} Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Episode II was the last main Xenosaga game worked on by Saga prior to her leaving the project in 2005. Their draft was then turned into the game's full script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who was allowed by Takahashi to handle the storyline of the Xenosaga series following Episode I using his extensive notes. According to Takahashi, Yonesaka's role was to take his and Saga's notes {{and turn them into}} a workable game script, something which required parts of the planned scenario to be condensed or cut. According to Arai, the changes were made in consultation with Takahashi, with them treating his plan as a novel and the game as its movie adaptation. In a later interview, Saga said the changes made to the overall scenario for Episode II resulted in subsequent changes to the planned Xenosaga plotline. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of Beyond Good and Evil, a novel written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series; in the context of Episode II, the subtitle was said to represent the <b>blurring</b> <b>of</b> boundaries between concepts of right and wrong, in addition to symbolizing the complex relations between Jr. and Albedo. As with the other Xenosaga titles, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology.|$|E

The legal profession remained divided between barristers (or abhcóidí in Irish) and solicitors (or aturnaetha in Irish). There was some <b>blurring</b> <b>of</b> {{the distinction between}} their roles over the years.

In Portugal, the late 1960s paved the way to the experimentalism of the 1970s and the beginning of a dialogue that was more informed by international experiences and relationships between Portuguese artists and their foreign counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Excessive vitamin A {{consumption}} {{can lead}} to nausea, irritability, anorexia (reduced appetite), vomiting, blurry vision, headaches, hair loss, muscle and abdominal pain and weakness, drowsiness, and altered mental status.

Some of these symptoms are also common to acne treatment with Isotretinoin. Chronically high doses of vitamin A, and also pharmaceutical retinoids such as 13-cis retinoic acid, can produce the syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri. This syndrome includes headache, <b>blurring</b> <b>of</b> vision and confusion, associated with increased intracerebral pressure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> drifting sinusoidal gratings {{was compared}} to that <b>of</b> static, <b>blurred</b> “square wave” gratings before and after adaptation to a missing fundamental (MF) pattern. The {{results indicate that the}} perceived <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> a drifting sine grating is inversely related to its drift speed. However, after adaptation to a MF pattern, this effect is reduced. The adaptation effect is most profound for low contrast gratings. The results provide tentative evidence for a non-linear stage in motion processing which serves to introduce higher frequencies into the neural image which are not present in the original signal.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we develop}} a no-reference blur {{evaluation}} method for images based on edge analysis and segmentation in spatial domain. Blur mainly smoothes the image signal which causes {{the reduction of}} edge points. Consequently edge information of an image is estimated using canny edge detector. We believe perceptual <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> any image are strongly dependent on local features, such as plane and non-plane areas. Therefore, plane and non-plane areas based edge detection rate are evaluated in this method. Subjective experiments results are used to verify the method. The result indicates that the proposed method can efficiently predict <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> images...|$|R
