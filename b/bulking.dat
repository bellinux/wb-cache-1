5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before <b>bulking</b> up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the First World War, {{sales of}} peat began to decline, as working horses were {{replaced}} by motor lorries and tractors. The British Moss Litter Company bought up two other companies who were extracting peat in Crowle Moor in 1935. Most peat was sold as bales, with 'fine' peat being used by gardeners and the growing of mushrooms and 'litter' being used for animal bedding, while 'tailings' were used for floor covering at show-jumping events and for <b>bulking</b> up feed for cows. Around one-fifth was not baled, and was used for various purposes, including the production of firelighters, for health cures at Harrogate baths, and the purifying of gas by gas companies, for which it was mixed with iron ore at Creyke's Siding. By the late 1940s, it was finding a new market as litter for battery hen houses, and by then around 90 per cent was baled.|$|E

25|$|Dietary fibers {{have three}} primary mechanisms: <b>bulking,</b> {{viscosity}} and fermentation. Different fibers have different effects, {{suggesting that a}} variety of dietary fibers contribute to overall health. Some fibers contribute through one primary mechanism. For instance, cellulose and wheat bran provide excellent <b>bulking</b> effects, but are minimally fermented. Alternatively, many dietary fibers can contribute to health through more than one of these mechanisms. For instance, psyllium provides <b>bulking</b> as well as viscosity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bulking</b> fibers can be soluble (i.e., psyllium) or {{insoluble}} (i.e., cellulose and hemicellulose). They absorb {{water and}} can significantly increase stool weight and regularity.

25|$|Fiber {{is defined}} by its {{physiological}} impact, with many heterogenous types of fibers. Some fibers may primarily impact one of these benefits (i.e., cellulose increases fecal <b>bulking</b> and prevents constipation), but many fibers impact {{more than one of}} these benefits (i.e., resistant starch increases <b>bulking,</b> increases colonic fermentation, positively modulates colonic microflora and increases satiety and insulin sensitivity).

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} of the effects of a thermal <b>bulk</b> fluid in brane world models compactified on AdS 5. Our primary purpose is to study how such a fluid changes the <b>bulk</b> dynamics and to compare these effects with those generated by matter localized to the branes. We find an exact cosmological solution for a thermally excited massless <b>bulk</b> field, as well as perturbative solutions with matter on the brane and in the <b>bulk.</b> We then perturb around these solutions to find solutions for a massive <b>bulk</b> mode in the limit where the <b>bulk</b> mass (mB) is small compared to the AdS curvature scale and T < mB. We find that without a stabilizing potential there are no physical solutions for a thermal <b>bulk</b> fluid. We then include a stabilizing potential and calculate the shift in the radion as well as the time dependence of the weak scale {{as a function of the}} <b>bulk</b> mass. It is shown that, as opposed to a brane fluid, the <b>bulk</b> fluid contribution to the <b>bulk</b> dynamics is controlled by the <b>bulk</b> mass. 1 I...|$|R
