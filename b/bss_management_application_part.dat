The descriptions of the layer 3 protocols for the MS-MSC information exchange are contained in the 04- series of GSM Technical Specifications.The <b>BSS</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Application</b> sub-Part (BSSMAP) supports other procedures between the MSC and the BSS related to the MS (resource management, handover control), or to a cell within the BSS, or to the whole BSS. The description of the layer 3 protocol for the BSSMAP information exchange is contained in Recommendation GSM 08.08.Both connectionless and connection-oriented procedures are used to support the BSSMAP. Rec. GSM 08.08 explains whether connection oriented or connectionless services {{should be used for}} each layer 3 procedure. Connection oriented procedures are used to support the DTAP. A distribution function located in BSSAP, which is reflected in the protocol specification by the layer 3 header, performs the discrimination between the data related to those two subparts.|$|R

A BSMAP message (complete layer 3 information) is also used together with a DTAP message to establish a connection for an MS between the BS and the MSC, {{in response to the}} first layer 3 interface message sent by the MS to the BS for each MS system requests.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In network <b>management</b> <b>applications,</b> load balanc-ing has {{typically}} {{been achieved}} by manually configuring the appli-cation in-situ or using configuration information generated using offline tools. As networks increase in scale and heterogeneity, <b>management</b> <b>applications</b> are being {{designed to take}} advantage of scalable computer hardware and often have multiple instances, each of which bears a portion of the management load of the network elements or functions being managed. The communica-tion between <b>management</b> <b>applications</b> and the network elements they are managing is often stateful, posing a challenge for load balancing because connections must be managed if responsibility for managing some network elements change from one instance to another during load balancing. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that enables load balancing of telecommunication <b>management</b> <b>applications</b> for an arbitrary number of VNFs (Virtual Network Functions). The algorithm, triggered by NFV (Network Function Virtualisaton) orchestration, is horizontally scalable and there is no single point of failure once two or more <b>management</b> <b>application</b> instances are running.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} developing a secure, SNMP-based network management system specifically tailored for deployment in internetworks that rely on low-bandwidth backbone networks. The network management system developed uses a two-level hierarchy of network <b>management</b> <b>applications</b> consisting of one top-level <b>management</b> <b>application</b> communicating with several mid-level <b>management</b> <b>applications</b> strategically distributed throughout the internetwork. Mid-level <b>management</b> <b>applications</b> conduct routine monitoring chores {{on behalf of the}} top-level <b>management</b> <b>application</b> and report results {{in a way that makes}} intelligent use of the limited bandwidth available on the backbone network. The security framework is based on using SNMPv 2 c over IPSec. This research shows that the other security alternative considered, SNMPv 3, consumes as much as 24 percent more network capacity than SNMPv 2 c over IPSec. The management framework is based on the Management by Delegation (MbD) model and is implemented using the IETF DISMAN Script MIB. This research demonstrates that the MbD-based management framework consumes only 2 percent of the network capacity required by the traditional, centralized management scheme...|$|R
