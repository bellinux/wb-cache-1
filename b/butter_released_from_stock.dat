50|$|The magician then {{cuts through}} the box using either a saw or sword (although some {{performers}} skip this step), and dividers are placed into the box {{either side of the}} cut. With the dividers in place, the two halves of the table are unlocked and pulled apart. As the assistant has been {{in full view of the}} audience throughout the illusion, it appears that they have been separated into two halves, the impossibility of this situation helping to give the illusion its name. The halves of the table are then pushed back together, the dividers removed, and the unharmed assistant <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the <b>stocks</b> and boxes.|$|R

When Peter Parquagh and Virginia Dare find evidence he is plotting against the natives again, he kills Virginia and exposes Peter's secret identity as The Spider. He is sentenced to {{be sent back to}} England, where capital punishment is still practiced. When the Mayflower is attacked by the pirate Wilson Fisk, Osborne's cell is hit by a cannonball. Covered in gangrenous wounds, his sentence is abandoned since he is not expected to live long enough to stand trial in England. He contacts the natural philosopher Henri Le Pym, asking to be cured in return for helping Pym acquire some of Peter's blood for his experiments.|$|R

40|$|Monthly {{investigations}} on fish assemblages {{were carried}} out in rocky reef habitat (RRH) in the Ma’an Archipelago using multi-mesh trammel nets in 2009, {{in order to find}} out the role of RRH in support-ing local fish diversity. Fish taxonomic composition and ecological guild groups were used to examine spe-cies composition in detail. Indices such as Margalef’s species richness index, Whilm’s species diversity in-dex, Pielou’s species evenness index as well as Pinkas’s IRI were used to analyze the status of fish diversity in RRH. A total of 87 fishes, belonging to 2 classes, 14 orders, 50 families and 73 genera, were collected. Fifty-one fishes from the family Perciformes (accounting 58. 6 % of the total species), 49 reef fishes (56. 3 % of the total species) and 7 stocked fishes (8 % of the total species) were captured. Sixty-seven percent of total individuals were juveniles. There were 50 warm water fishes, 36 warm temperature fishes and 1 cold tem-perature fishes. Nineteen species lived on the reef surface, 46 lived in near-ground waters and 22 pelagic fishes frequently appeared in surface waters. Sebastiscus marmoratus was the most dominant ground fish, Nibea albiflora was the most dominant species in near-ground waters and Thryssa kammalensis dominated the surface waters during summer and autumn. We considered 32 fishes to be local species, 55 were seasonal species and another 11 were casual species. Significant seasonal variation was detected; the lowest and high-est diversity levels were found, respectively, in February and September. Our studies suggests that rocky reef habitat in Ma’an Archipelago was mostly used by reef fishes and warm water species. Juvenile fishes con-gregated in large numbers in these habitats during spring and summer. RRH also serves as habitat for fishes <b>released</b> <b>from</b> <b>stock</b> enhancement programs. We conclude that RRH are important coastal habitats because they offer feeding, spawning and nursing grounds for many fishes, especially juveniles of economi-cally-important species. However, fish diversity has dropped in comparison to its original status in RRH habitats. We suggest that more attention should be paid to the management and conservation of rocky reef habitat...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} colour {{forms of the}} male common pheasant, ranging in colour from nearly white to almost black in some melanistic examples. These are due to captive {{breeding}} and hybridization between subspecies and with the green pheasant, reinforced by continual <b>releases</b> of <b>stock</b> <b>from</b> varying sources to the wild. For example, the [...] "ring-necked pheasants" [...] common in Europe, North America and Australia do not pertain to any specific taxon, they rather represent a stereotyped hybrid swarm.

50|$|The thin model sawing {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{variants}} performed by contemporary magicians. The basic arrangement and sequence of events is similar to that described for the Goldin box sawings (see above). However the box appears very shallow in comparison to Goldin's, which was large by modern standards. The ends of the box are initially open when the assistant climbs in. Once the assistant is lying down she is secured in place by having stocks placed over her neck and ankles. The stocks form the ends of the box. The shallow box adds to the impression that the assistant could not possibly find room to evade the saw blade even if she could <b>release</b> herself <b>from</b> the <b>stocks</b> and try to curl up in one half of the box.|$|R

5000|$|On Saturday, 29 February 1908, three Model Ks {{from the}} 1907 Cadillac {{production}} were <b>released</b> <b>from</b> the <b>stock</b> of the Anglo-American Motor-car Company, the UK agent for Cadillac automobiles, at the Heddon Street showroom in London (these were engines Nos. 23391, 24111 and 24118). The three cars, all registered in London under the numbers A2EO, A3EO and A4EO, were driven 25 {{miles to the}} Brooklands race track at Weybridge. There, the cars completed ten laps of the track, or approximately 30 miles, before being locked away until Monday, 2 March 1908, when they were released and disassembled completely, using only wrenches, screwdrivers, hammers, and pliers. Each car {{was reduced to a}} pile of 721 component parts, which were then scrambled into one heap by the RAC. Eighty-nine parts requiring extreme accuracy were withdrawn from the heap, locked away at the Brooklands club house and replaced with new parts <b>from</b> Anglo-American's showroom <b>stock.</b> The parts were then sorted into three piles, each with all the parts needed to assemble a car. A mechanic - Mr. E. O. Young - reassembled the cars {{with the help of his}} assistant - Mr. M. M. Gardner. Sometimes they had to work ankle-deep in water, using only wrenches and screwdrivers. The third car was re-assembled by Thursday morning, 12 March. With the painted parts on the original cars not being identical in color or style, the reassembled cars were mismatched in appearance, gaining the nickname [...] "harlequin cars". By 2 p.m. on Friday 13 March the three cars had completed the mandatory 500-mile run with singular regularity. Only one point was lost owing to a broken cotter pin in the ignition lever (promptly replaced <b>from</b> <b>stock).</b> During the event, it was reported that one of the sheds where the parts were stored became partly flooded during a heavy storm and some parts became rusted. Only oily rags could be used to remove all traces of the immersion. On completion of the test, one of the cars was locked away until the start of the 2000-miles reliability trials in June 1908. It came out the winner of the R.A.C. Trophy for its class. Parts interchangeability had been publicly demonstrated and field tested.|$|R
40|$|According to the December 2003 USDA semi-annual {{review of}} the EU grain and feed market, EU cereals {{production}} was severely affected by drought and hot weather across southern Europe, reducing E- 15 grain production from 210 million tonnes to 184. 8 million tonnes. This has created a shortage of feed grain in Europe, which has boosted prices and reduced exports. In addition poor harvests {{in central and eastern}} Europe and the Black Sea area have reduced import availability. In response the EU has suspended export refunds on cereals, <b>released</b> grain <b>from</b> <b>stocks</b> and reduced set-aside for next year from 10 % to 5 %. A continued tight market situation is expected until the summer of 2004. EU- 15 wheat output fell from 103. 7 million tonnes to 92 million tonnes while coarse grain production fell from 105 million tonnes to 93. 5 million tonnes. EU- 15 grain stocks are expected to fall from 33 million tonnes to 19 million tonnes. Additional imports may be need in January and February 2004. High EU wheat prices are making EU flour exports uncompetitive on African markets, with Belgian flour exported to central Africa now costing US$ 310 per tonne compared to US$ 230 per tonne for flour from Argentina. Comment: These climatic developments make it difficult to demonstrate the direction of the impact of changes initiated under the CAP-reform process. It also demonstrates the difficulties of planning agricultural production in the EU. According to the December 2003 USDA semi-annual {{review of the}} EU grain and feed [...] ...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundInflammasome-activated IL- 1 ß plays a {{major role}} in lung neutrophilic {{inflammation}} induced by inhaled silica. However, the exact mechanisms that contribute to the initial production of precursor IL- 1 ß (pro-IL- 1 ß) are still unclear. Here, we assessed the implication of alarmins (IL- 1 ¿, IL- 33 and HMGB 1) in the lung response to silica particles and found that IL- 1 ¿ is a master cytokine that regulates IL- 1 ß expression. MethodsPro- and mature IL- 1 ß as well as alarmins were assessed by ELISA, Western Blot or qRT-PCR in macrophage cultures and in mouse lung following nano- and micrometric silica exposure. Implication of these immune mediators in the establishment of lung inflammatory responses to silica was investigated in knock-out mice or after antibody blockade by evaluating pulmonary neutrophil counts, CXCR 2 expression and degree of histological injury. ResultsWe found that the early release of IL- 1 ¿ and IL- 33, but not HMGB 1 in alveolar space preceded the lung expression of pro-IL- 1 ß and neutrophilic inflammation in silica-treated mice. In vitro, the production of pro-IL- 1 ß by alveolar macrophages was significantly induced by recombinant IL- 1 ¿ but not by IL- 33. Neutralization or deletion of IL- 1 ¿ reduced IL- 1 ß production and neutrophil accumulation after silica in mice. Finally, IL- 1 ¿ released by J 774 macrophages after in vitro exposure to a range of micro- and nanoparticles of silica was correlated with the degree of lung inflammation induced in vivo by these particles. ConclusionsWe demonstrated that in response to silica exposure, IL- 1 ¿ is rapidly <b>released</b> <b>from</b> pre-existing <b>stocks</b> in alveolar macrophages and promotes subsequent lung inflammation through the stimulation of IL- 1 ß production. Moreover, we demonstrated that in vitro IL- 1 ¿ <b>release</b> <b>from</b> macrophages can be used to predict the acute inflammogenic activity of silica micro- and nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the protein expression of gelatinases [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 2 and - 9] and collagenases (MMP- 8 and - 13) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with bacterial (BM, n = 17) and aseptic (AM, n = 14) meningitis. In both, MMP- 8 and - 9 were increased in 100 % of patients, whereas MMP- 13 was detectable in 53 % and 82 % respectively. Three patients with clinical signs of meningitis, without CSF pleocytosis, scored positive {{for all three}} MMPs. MMP- 8 appeared in two isoforms, granulocyte-type [polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) ] and fibroblast/macrophage (F/M) MMP- 8. Analysis of kinetic changes from serial lumbar punctures showed that these MMPs are independently regulated, and correlate only partly with CSF cytosis or levels of the endogenous inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase- 1. In vitro, T cells, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) and granulocytes (PMN) release MMP- 8 and - 9, whereas MMP- 13 could be found only in the former two cell types. Using models of exogenous (n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, T cell receptor cross-linking) and host-derived stimuli (interleukin- 2), the kinetics and the release of the MMP- 8, - 9 and - 13 showed strong variation between these immune cells and suggest <b>release</b> <b>from</b> preformed <b>stocks.</b> In addition, MMP- 9 is also synthesized de novo in PBMCs and T cells. In conclusion, invading immune cells contribute only partially to MMPs in CSF during meningitis, and parenchymal cells are an equally relevant source. In this context, in patients with clinical signs of meningitis, but without CSF pleocytosis, MMPs seem to be a highly sensitive marker for intrathecal inflammation. The present data support the concept that broad-spectrum enzyme inhibition targeting gelatinases and collagenases is a potential strategy for adjunctive therapy in infectious meningitis...|$|R
