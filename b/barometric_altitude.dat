50|$|Label {{guidelines}} are provided {{as part of}} the ARINC 429 specification, for various equipment types. Each aircraft will contain a number of different systems, such as flight management computers, inertial reference systems, air data computers, radar altimeters, radios, and GPS sensors. For each type of equipment, a set of standard parameters is defined, which is common across all manufacturers and models. For example, any air data computer will provide the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft as label 203. This allows some degree of interchangeability of parts, as all air data computers behave, for the most part, in the same way. There are {{only a limited number of}} labels, though, and so label 203 may have some completely different meaning if sent by a GPS sensor, for example. Very commonly needed aircraft parameters, however, use the same label regardless of source. Also, as with any specification, each manufacturer has slight differences from the formal specification, such as by providing extra data above and beyond the specification, leaving out some data recommended by the specification, or other various changes.|$|E
5000|$|An airport {{surveillance}} radar (ASR) is a radar system used at airports to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area, the airspace around airports. It is the main {{air traffic control system}} for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems, the primary and secondary {{surveillance radar}}. [...] The primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface. In the US the primary radar operates at a frequency of 2.7 - 2.9 GHz in the S band with a peak radiated power of 25 kW and an average power of 2.1 kW. The secondary surveillance radar consists of a second rotating antenna, often mounted on the primary antenna, which interrogates the transponders of aircraft, which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft's identification, <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude,</b> and an emergency status code, which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radar.

50|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the VX-7R a design flaw was {{discovered}} related to the radio's waterproof housing. Due to the watertight housing of the radio, it was also airtight. This resulted in a pressure differential between the inside of the radio and the atmosphere, caused by changes in <b>barometric</b> pressure or <b>altitude.</b> This pressure differential prevented proper oscillation of the speaker diaphragm, resulting in reduced and muffled audio output. Yaesu remedied the problem by adding a small valve under the bottom left rubber armor, which allows equalization of the interior pressure with the atmosphere.

40|$|The use of {{barometric}} altimetry is to {{some extent}} a limiting factor on safety, predictability and efficiency of aircraft operations, and reduces {{the potential of the}} trajectory based operations capabilities. However, geometric altimetry could be used to improve all of these aspects. Nowadays aircraft altitude is estimated by applying the International Standard Atmosphere which differs from real altitude. At different temperatures for an assigned <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude,</b> aerodynamic forces are different and this has a direct relationship with time, fuel consumption and range of the flight. The study explores the feasibility of using sensors providing geometric reference altitude, in particular, to supply capabilities for the optimization of vertical profiles and also, their impact on the vertical Air Traffic Management separation assurance processes. One of the aims of the thesis is to assess if geometric altitude fulfils the aeronautical requirements through existing sensors. Also the thesis will elaborate on the advantages of geometric altitude over the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> in terms of efficiency for vertical navigation. The evidence that geometric altitude is the best choice to improve the efficiency in vertical profile and aircraft capacity by reducing vertical uncertainties will also be shown.

Twenty-two healthy volunteers were investigated at sea level and at 5, 050 m before and after random double-blind intake of the endothelin A receptor blocker sitaxsentan (100 mg/day) vs. a placebo during 1 wk. PVR was estimated by Doppler echocardiography, and exercise capacity by maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2 max)). The diffusing capacities for nitric oxide (DL(NO)) and carbon monoxide (DL(CO)) were measured using a single-breath method before and 30 min after maximal exercise. The membrane component of DL(CO) (Dm) and capillary volume (Vc) was calculated with corrections for hemoglobin, alveolar volume, and <b>barometric</b> pressure. <b>Altitude</b> exposure was associated with unchanged DL(CO), DL(NO), and Dm but a slight decrease in Vc. Exercise at altitude decreased DL(NO) and Dm. Sitaxsentan intake improved Vo(2 max) together {{with an increase in}} resting and postexercise DL(NO) and Dm. Sitaxsentan-induced decrease in PVR was inversely correlated to DL(NO). Both DL(CO) and DL(NO) were correlated to Vo(2 max) at sea level (r = 0. 41 - 0. 42, P < 0. 1) and more so at altitude (r = 0. 56 - 0. 59, P < 0. 05).

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{information}} the ability to navigate persons and equipment has become increasingly important. A rising number of applications and services depend on the precise positioning that is provided by global satellite positioning systems such as the GPS. However, most people using satellite-based positioning services {{are living in the}} most challenging surroundings for the satellite positioning systems - densely populated cities. Fundamentally, satellite navigation is based on distance measurements from the receiver to satellite vehicles in orbit of the Earth. The receiver determines its location - latitude, longitude, and elevation - and the system time using the satellite positioning system. The determined location is only an estimate: residual errors induce inaccuracies to the determination process. At worst, the receiver {{may not be able to}} determine its position if not enough signals could be acquired. The performance of the receiver could be greatly improved if one or more of the geographic coordinates or the precise time could be obtained from another source with smaller error. One such source is Earth's atmospheric pressure which is relative to the altitude and from which a receiver can deduce its altitude if a reference pressure level is known. To address the problem of unavailability and inaccuracy of positioning in urban environment, a barometric assistance service was designed and a respective software application was implemented. The implemented assistance service generates continuously time and location-dependent reference pressure data from high resolution weather forecasts that are calculated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Receivers with the barometric sensor can download the assistance data from the service and utilize it to determine the current <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> consistently and more accurately than a conventional receiver. <b>Barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> measurements improve the availability of the positioning service and reduce the time required for the first position estimate by decreasing the number of required satellite measurements...|$|E

40|$|The EFT- 1 {{mission is}} the {{unmanned}} flight {{test for the}} upcoming Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). During entry, the EFT- 1 vehicle will trigger several Landing and Recovery System (LRS) events, such as parachute deployment, based on onboard altitude information. The primary altitude source is the filtered navigation solution updated with GPS measurement data. The vehicle also has three barometric altimeters {{that will be used}} to measure atmospheric pressure during entry. In the event that GPS data is not available during entry, the altitude derived from the barometric altimeter pressure will be used to trigger chute deployment for the drogues and main parachutes. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the impact of error sources on the pressure measured by the barometric altimeters and on the altitude derived from that pressure. There are four primary error sources impacting the sensed pressure: sensor errors, Analog to Digital conversion errors, aerodynamic errors, and atmosphere modeling errors. This last error source is induced by the conversion from pressure to altitude in the vehicle flight software, which requires an atmosphere model such as the US Standard 1976 Atmosphere model. There are several secondary error sources as well, such as waves, tides, and latencies in data transmission. Typically, for error budget calculations it is assumed that all error sources are independent, normally distributed variables. Thus, the initial approach to developing the EFT- 1 <b>barometric</b> altimeter <b>altitude</b> error budget was to create an itemized error budget under these assumptions. This budget was to be verified by simulation using high fidelity models of the vehicle hardware and software. The simulation barometric altimeter model includes hardware error sources and a data-driven model of the aerodynamic errors expected to impact the pressure in the midbay compartment in which the sensors are located. The aerodynamic model includes the pressure difference between the midbay compartment and the free stream pressure as a function of altitude, oscillations in sensed pressure due to wake effects, and an acoustics model capturing fluctuations in pressure due to motion of the passive vents separating the barometric altimeters from the outside of the vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{can only}} survive the low <b>barometric</b> {{pressure}} of <b>altitudes</b> above 6000 m {{by making a}} complex series of adaptations. The energetics of human survival at such extreme altitudes have not been widely studied. Objectives were to compare the doubly labelled water (DLW) and intake-balance (IB) methods to estimate daily energy expenditure while climbing between 6000 and 8046 m and to investigate the putative metabolic cost involved {{with the process of}} acclimatization to extreme altitude. Reliability of the DLW method to provide an accurate and portable means to measure human energy expenditure depends upon a series of assumptions regarding the flux of tracer and tracee across the physiological compartments of measurement. Additional objectives were to review and examine the proficiency of these assumptions to account for perturbations experienced while using DLW while climbing at extreme altitude. Findings suggest that the use of DLW at extreme altitudes requires special consideration towards elevated rates of fractional isotope loss, inter-subject isotope transfer, alterations in total body water, changes in background isotopic abundance, and choice of sampling technique. Revised strategies directed at achieving these aims are calculated. Results from extreme altitude indicate that IB and DLW techniques each provide similar estimates of group mean energy expenditure despite substantial changes in body weight and composition and that the metabolic cost for the process of acclimatization accounts for roughly 12 % of total daily energy expenditure. Problems associated with maintaining energy balance while climbing at extreme altitude are related to low energy intakes, approximately only 70 % of energy demands, and energy expenditure values that are comparable to those of highly trained endurance athletes at sea-level...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of sport}} {{performance}} can provide effects {{of environmental and}} other venue-specific factors in addition to estimates of within-athlete variability between competitions, which determines smallest worthwhile effects. Purpose: To analyze elite long-track speed-skating events. Methods: Log-transformed performance times were analyzed with a mixed linear model that estimated percentage mean effects for <b>altitude,</b> <b>barometric</b> pressure, type of rink, and competition importance. In addition, coefficients of variation representing residual venue-related differences and within-athlete variability between races within clusters spanning 8 d were determined. Effects and variability were assessed with magnitude-based inference. Results: A 1000 -m increase in altitude resulted in very large mean performance improvements of 2. 8 % in juniors and 2. 1 % in seniors. An increase in barometric pressure of 100 hPa resulted in a moderate reduction in performance of 1. 1 % for juniors but an unclear effect for seniors. Only juniors competed at open rinks, resulting in a very large reduction in performance of 3. 4 %. Juniors and seniors showed small performance improvements (0. 4 % and 0. 3 %) at the more important competitions. After accounting for these effects, residual venue-related variability was still moderate to large. The within-athlete within-cluster race-to-race variability was 0. 3 - 1. 3 %, with a small difference in variability between male (0. 8 %) and female juniors (1. 0 %) and no difference {{between male and female}} seniors (both 0. 6 %). Conclusion: The variability in performance times of skaters {{is similar to that of}} athletes in other sports in which air or water resistance limits speed.
