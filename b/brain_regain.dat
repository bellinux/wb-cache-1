50|$|On September 6, he {{was sent}} to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for {{treatment}} by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Dr. Walter Dandy, but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his <b>brain.</b> Without <b>regaining</b> consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. His last writing, a journal of his two-week trip through the national parks, was found among his belongings hours after his death.|$|R
50|$|While {{playing golf}} in October 1984, Casey {{collapsed}} from a ruptured artery in his abdomen. He suffered several setbacks {{during a long}} recovery, and delegated {{the administration of the}} Archdiocese to his vicar general. On March 1, 1986, he was stricken with a cerebral aneurysm at his residence and then taken unconscious to St. Joseph Hospital. He underwent surgery the next day to remove a blood clot from his <b>brain.</b> Never <b>regaining</b> consciousness, Casey died nearly two weeks later, aged 71.|$|R

5000|$|Nootropics, also {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "smart drugs", are drugs that are claimed to improve human cognitive abilities. Nootropics are used to improve memory, concentration, thought, mood, learning, and many other things. Some nootropics are now beginning to be used to treat certain diseases such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. They are also commonly used to <b>regain</b> <b>brain</b> function lost during aging.|$|R
50|$|In August 2015, Jason {{stands up}} for Sarah against Callum Logan (Sean Ward), {{but the result}} of this leads to Jason getting beaten up by Callum and two of his goons. Jason is left in a {{critical}} condition as a result, having to receive vital surgery on a clot on his <b>brain.</b> He <b>regains</b> consciousness a week later and tells Tony and the Police he thinks he heard Callum's voice. Jason spends 2 more weeks in hospital. In September, he gets Callum's home address from David Platt and hides in his flat. However, Denton arrives and demands money from Callum, but Jason's phone rings, causing them to find him. Jason punches Callum after Tony arrives to take him home.|$|R

5000|$|Based {{in part on}} {{his work}} with the Silver Spring monkeys, Taub went on to develop novel {{physical}} therapy techniques to help stroke victims, and those with other forms of <b>brain</b> injury, <b>regain</b> the use of affected limbs. The American Stroke Association regards Taub's therapy, known as constraint-induced movement therapy (CI), as [...] "at the forefront of a revolution" [...] {{in the treatment of}} stroke survivors. [...] With CI therapy, the patient is forced to use the affected limb, to whatever minimal extent he can, by having the unaffected one restrained. The affected limb is then used intensively for three to six hours each day for at least two weeks. As a result of engaging in repetitive movements with the affected limb, the brain grows new neural pathways that control the limb's use, as a result of which stroke victims who were seriously disabled for many years have reportedly regained the use of limbs that were almost completely paralysed.|$|R
50|$|Back in the apartment, Jarrod {{believes}} the open water {{would be a}} safer place, {{since there are no}} machines over the sea. They attempt to reach the marina by car, splitting into two cars: Terry and Denise in the first, followed by everyone else in the other. They encounter a bickering couple, Colin and Jen, also getting ready to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the garage it is flattened by a massive two-legged alien. Denise is killed but Terry escapes. As he begins to run he is abducted. The others run back into the garage, where they encounter another alien lifeform {{in the shape of a}} large multi-tentacled squid that takes Colin. It corners the rest of the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV. They find Colin is still alive inside the creature. As they try to free him, the squid creature comes back to life, sucking out Colin's <b>brain</b> and <b>regaining</b> its energy. As they run back into the building, Jen is abducted.|$|R
50|$|In early 1943, Gibson {{fell into}} a coma and was {{diagnosed}} with a <b>brain</b> tumor. After <b>regaining</b> consciousness, he refused the option of surgical removal and lived the next four years with recurring headaches. In 1944, Gibson was hospitalized in Washington, D.C. at Gallinger Hospital for mental observation. On January 20, 1947, Gibson died of a stroke in Pittsburgh. Some people believe the stroke was linked to drug problems that plagued him in his later years. He was buried at the Allegheny Cemetery in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where he lay in an unmarked grave until a small plaque was placed in 1975.|$|R

5000|$|The {{story begins}} with Mary Pearl {{receiving}} {{a note from}} her one-week departed husband, William. The letter tells how Landy, a doctor, approaches William, a well-regarded philosopher, about his cancer, six weeks before William's death. He suggests that William undertake a procedure, which he explains in great detail, that would mean his brain being transplanted from his body after death, and attached to an artificial heart. The brain would be bathing in a Ringer's solution. One of his eyes could also be hooked up {{so that he would}} be able to see. Although the doctor is uncertain whether the <b>brain</b> would <b>regain</b> consciousness, he remains hopeful. The brain, he says, could probably live as long as 200 years connected to the machine. William initially reacts violently to this suggestion, but by the end of their discussion has lightened up to the idea more. Thinking it over later, he is initially concerned with the idea of phantom limb, believing that as a brain alone he may be in terrible trauma, wishing for the use of his body. However, he writes, he eventually embraced the idea, being very fond of his brain and liking the suggestion that it could live on.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Stroke {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of adult {{disability}} with high economical and societal costs. In recent years, novel rehabilitation paradigms have been proposed to address the life-long plasticity of the <b>brain</b> to <b>regain</b> motor function. We propose a hybrid brain–computer interface (BCI) —virtual reality (VR) system that combines a personalized motor training in a VR environment, exploiting brain mechanisms for action execution and observation, and a neuro-feedback paradigm using mental imagery as a way to engage secondary or indirect pathways to access undamaged cortico-spinal tracts. Furthermore, we present the development and validation experiments of the proposed system. More specifically, EEG data on nine naïve healthy subjects show that a simultaneous motor activity and motor imagery paradigm is more effective at engaging cortical motor areas and related networks to a larger extent. Additionally, we propose a motor imagery driven BCI-VR version of our system that was evaluated with nine different healthy subjects. Data show that users are capable of controlling a virtual avatar in a motor imagery training task that dynamically adjusts its difficulty to the capabilities of the user. User self-report questionnaires indicate enjoyment and acceptance of the proposed system.

40|$|Neural stem/progenitor cell {{proliferation}} and differentiation {{are required to}} replace damaged neurons and <b>regain</b> <b>brain</b> function after hypoxic-ischemic events. DNA base lesions accumulating during hypoxic-ischemic stress are removed by DNA glycosylases in the base-excision repair pathway to prevent cytotoxicity and mutagenesis. Expression of the DNA glycosylase endonuclease VIII-like 3 (Neil 3) is confined to regenerative subregions in the embryonic and perinatal brains. Here we show profound neuropathology in Neil 3 -knockout mice characterized by a reduced number of microglia and loss of proliferating neuronal progenitors in the striatum after hypoxia-ischemia. In vitro expansion of Neil 3 -deficient neural stem/progenitor cells revealed an inability to augment neurogenesis and a reduced capacity to repair for oxidative base lesions in single-stranded DNA. We propose that Neil 3 exercises a highly specialized function through accurate molecular repair of DNA in rapidly proliferating cells...|$|R
40|$|To review {{clinical}} outcomes in patients referred for confirmation of brain death by (99 m) Tc-labelled exametazime scintigraphy {{and to assess}} any tangible benefit. A retrospective casenote review {{in the intensive care}} unit and nuclear medicine department of a tertiary-level acute care hospital. 66 consecutive patients, in whom a clinical diagnosis of brain death was not possible, undergoing (99 m) Tc-labelled exametazime scintigraphy from February 1993 to March 2002, and for 56 of whom casenotes were available for review. Brain death was confirmed in 77 % on the basis of absent supratentorial and infratentorial uptake. Where brain death was not confirmed, a normal scan was seen in 30 %, the remainder showing patchy reduced infratentorial and/or supratentorial uptake. All patients with the scintigraphic appearance of brain death subsequently died. Even when brain death could not be confirmed, 11 of 13 patients died soon afterwards. Two patients with normal <b>brain</b> scintigraphy <b>regained</b> consciousness and survived for an extended period. When brain death was not confirmed by scintigraphy, elapsed time to certification of death was longer (44. 7 vs. 7 h) and organ donation was less common even when a subsequent clinical diagnosis was made. The results indicate that patient prognosis remains poor regardless of the findings on (99 m) Tc-labelled exametazime scintigraphy, but that the scan result influences the elapsed time to withdrawal of therapy or organ donation, providing a significant cost benefit, and occasionally a long-term survivor is seen...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 10, 1912, just {{three days after the}} finish of Eugene V. Debs' 4th — and arguably most {{successful}} — campaign as the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the United States, [...] Wayland retired upstairs to his bedroom. There he opened a drawer and removed a loaded handgun. He carefully wrapped the revolver with a sheet to muffle the sound of the explosion. He drew a breath, placed the gun in his hand, raised it to his open mouth, and shot himself in the <b>brain.</b> Wayland never <b>regained</b> consciousness, dying shortly after midnight, November 11, 1912. Harried by the government, despondent over the failure of the Socialist movement to win the support of more than {{a small fraction of the}} laboring classes, tired of life, Wayland left an epitaph tucked into a book on his bedside table: [...] "The struggle under the competitive system is not worth the effort; let it pass." ...|$|R
2500|$|After WrestleMania V, Demolition {{started a}} feud with The Twin Towers (Akeem and The Big Bossman) {{and then a}} feud with the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), who were managed by Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan. On the May 27, 1989 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, the Brain Busters {{defeated}} Demolition by disqualification. [...] They finally dropped the titles to the Brain Busters in a {{two out of three}} falls match on the July 29 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event following outside interference from André the Giant with a chair. As well as looking to regain the belts, Demolition sought revenge on André and closure on The Twin Towers. At SummerSlam 1989, King Duggan and Demolition defeated André and the Towers in a six-man tag team match (already advertised prior to the title change) where Darsow showcased his strength by body slamming both of the Twin Towers. Demolition focused on regaining the tag titles and restarted their feud with the Brain Busters. On the November 4 edition of Superstars (taped on October 2), Demolition defeated the <b>Brain</b> Busters to <b>regain</b> their tag titles and win their second WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} "brain drain” seems {{gradually}} reversed to "brain circulation" (Saxenian, 2000, Saxenian, 2005) or even "brain gain" (Pan, 2011) in some developing nations. One example is China, {{which has been}} the largest international students sending country for over decades, has now started to <b>regain</b> <b>brain</b> power through design and implementation of policies to attract overseas students to work or start up new ventures in their home country. This paper focuses on Chinese government's policies towards returnee entrepreneurs whose critical role of transferring much needed technology know-how in strengthening the country’s innovation capacity have been widely reorganised as key strategic assets by the Chinese government. A set of policies have been developed and evolved over the last decade to promote such type of entrepreneurship. This study traces the origin and development of those policies and summarises the major policy measures that have been introduced at both national and local levels. An initial assessment of the impact of those policies shows the policies are successful in terms of creating awareness among Chinese overseas and they also work well in certain industries and certain cities, but the policies reside on the premises that those who can benefit from such favourable policies need to be verified and approved by government and their businesses also need to be in so-called “strategically important” sectors. The policies' highly selective nature means a large number of returnee entrepreneurs are excluded from benefiting from those policies and this also further fuel the debate whether the state should be using policy tools to deliberately favour certain types of entrepreneurs in certain sectors over others...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE In CSWS (continuous spike waves during sleep) {{activation}} of spike waves during slow wave sleep has been causally linked to neuropsychological deficits, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms are still unknown. In healthy subjects, the overnight decrease {{of the slope}} of slow waves in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep {{has been linked to}} <b>brain</b> recovery to <b>regain</b> optimal cognitive performance. Here, we investigated whether the electrophysiologic hallmark of CSWS, the spike waves during sleep, is related to an alteration in the overnight decrease of the slope, and if this alteration is linked to location and density of spike waves. METHODS In a retrospective study, the slope of slow waves (0. 5 - 2 Hz) in the first hour and last hour of sleep (19 electroencephalography [EEG] electrodes) of 14 patients with CSWS (3. 1 - 13. 5 years) was calculated. The spike wave "focus" was determined as the location of highest spike amplitude and the density of spike waves as spike wave index (SWI). RESULTS There was no overnight change of the slope of slow waves in the "focus. " Instead, in "nonfocal" regions, the slope decreased significantly. This difference in the overnight course resulted in a steeper slope in the "focus" compared to "nonfocal" electrodes during the last hour of sleep. Spike wave density was correlated with the impairment of the overnight slope decrease: The higher the SWI, the more hampered the slope decrease. SIGNIFICANCE Location and density of spike waves are related to an alteration of the physiologic overnight decrease of the slow wave slope. This overnight decrease of the slope was shown to be closely related to the recovery function of sleep. Such recovery is necessary for optimal cognitive performance during wakefulness. Therefore we propose the impairment of this process by spike waves as a potential mechanism leading to neuropsychological deficits in CSWS.

40|$|Patients {{surviving}} severe <b>brain</b> injury may <b>regain</b> consciousness without recovering {{their ability}} to understand, move and communicate. Recently, electrophysiological and neuroimaging approaches, employing simple sensory stimulations or verbal commands, have proven useful in detecting higher order processing and, in some cases, in establishing some degree of communication in brain-injured subjects with severe impairment of motor function. To complement these approaches, {{it would be useful}} to develop methods to detect recovery of consciousness in ways that do not depend on the integrity of sensory pathways or on the subject's ability to comprehend or carry out instructions. As suggested by theoretical and experimental work, a key requirement for consciousness is that multiple, specialized cortical areas can engage in rapid causal interactions (effective connectivity). Here, we employ transcranial magnetic stimulation together with high-density electroencephalography to evaluate effective connectivity at the bedside of severely brain injured, non-communicating subjects. In patients in a vegetative state, who were open-eyed, behaviourally awake but unresponsive, transcranial magnetic stimulation triggered a simple, local response indicating a breakdown of effective connectivity, similar to the one previously observed in unconscious sleeping or anaesthetized subjects. In contrast, in minimally conscious patients, who showed fluctuating signs of non-reflexive behaviour, transcranial magnetic stimulation invariably triggered complex activations that sequentially involved distant cortical areas ipsi- and contralateral to the site of stimulation, similar to activations we recorded in locked-in, conscious patients. Longitudinal measurements performed in patients who gradually recovered consciousness revealed that this clear-cut change in effective connectivity could occur at an early stage, before reliable communication was established with the subject and before the spontaneous electroencephalogram showed significant modifications. Measurements of effective connectivity by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography can be performed at the bedside while by-passing subcortical afferent and efferent pathways, and without requiring active participation of subjects or language comprehension; hence, they offer an effective way to detect and track recovery of consciousness in brain-injured patients who are unable to exchange information with the external environment.
