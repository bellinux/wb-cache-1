5|$|The Sinan Erdem Dome, {{among the}} largest indoor arenas in Europe, hosted {{the final of the}} 2010 FIBA World Championship, the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, as well as the 2011–12 Euroleague and 2016-17 EuroLeague Final Fours. Prior to the {{completion}} of the Sinan Erdem Dome in 2010, Abdi İpekçi Arena was Istanbul's primary indoor arena, having hosted the finals of EuroBasket 2001. Several other indoor arenas, including the Beşiktaş Akatlar Arena, have also been inaugurated since 2000, serving as the home courts of Istanbul's sports clubs. The most recent of these is the 13,800-seat Ülker Sports Arena, which opened in 2012 as the home court of Fenerbahçe's basketball teams. Despite the construction boom, five <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Summer Olympics—in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2020—and national <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016 have ended unsuccessfully.|$|E

50|$|NSW-Sydney did not <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2010 conference. The {{opportunity}} to bid therefore passed to South Australia as the bidder next in line. South Australia's decision to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> 2010 {{means that it}} will not be eligible to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> 2011 (for which it was originally scheduled to bid), and the <b>bidding</b> rights <b>for</b> 2011 will pass to Eastern (Victoria).|$|R
5|$|A second auction was held, with <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> {{natural gas}} given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would {{be obliged to}} maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bids</b> <b>for</b> {{construction}} were {{forwarded to}} the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister Alfred Deakin approved the submission by John Brown & Company {{to construct the}} hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to Armstrong and Vickers for the battlecruiser's armament. The total cost of construction was set at £2million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, and a close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain Francis Haworth-Booth, the Australian Naval Representative in London.|$|E
5|$|In France Wilbur met Frank P. Lahm, a {{lieutenant}} in the U.S. Army Aeronautical Division. Writing to his superiors, Lahm smoothed the way for Wilbur to give an in-person presentation to the U.S. Board of Ordnance and Fortification in Washington, D.C. {{when he returned to}} the U.S. This time, the Board was favorably impressed, in contrast to its previous indifference. With further input from the Wrights, the U.S. Army Signal Corps issued Specification #486 in December 1907, inviting <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> construction of a flying machine under military contract. The Wrights submitted their bid in January.|$|E
50|$|Rome first <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1908 Summer Olympics and was {{ultimately}} awarded the games. However {{the eruption of}} Mount Vesuvius in 1906 forced Italy to return the hosting rights to the IOC. The IOC transferred the 1908 Games to London. Rome later <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1924 Summer Olympics but lost to Paris. They then <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1936 Games but lost to Berlin. They <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1944 Summer Olympics which were awarded to London, then cancelled due to World War II. Rome successfully <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|R

5|$|In the May 2012 {{municipal}} election, Mohammed Hameeduddin won {{a second}} term in office (with 4,374 votes) and was the only incumbent to win re-election, with challengers Mark Schwartz (3,150) and Henry Pruitt (2,872) taking the seats of Barbara Toffler (2,526) and Monica Honis (2,238), who lost their <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> re-election and came in fourth and fifth respectively, while Alexander Rashin came in sixth (1,049).|$|E
5|$|The {{alignment}} of SR-103, {{outside of the}} roadway renumbering, have received some technical changes as well. In November 1992, UDOT confirmed that the interchange of I-15 and SR-103 (exit 335) was to be given traffic lights to help monitor traffic. The mayor at the time, Neldon Hamblin, approved of the project, and put the project up for <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> construction. The interchange was holding up motorists needing to turn left up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|After delays due to {{concerns}} over nearby wetlands {{and the appearance}} of the ramps from street level, the Town of Winchester granted approval in March 2011. In April 2011, the MBTA began soliciting <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the primary construction work on the station, worth $1.525 million. The scope of work included construction of the mini-high platforms and ramps from street level, as well as adding lighting, rehabilitating the low level platforms, and creating accessible parking spaces. After bids came in higher than expected, a $2.503 million contract was awarded in July 2011 with notice to proceed in August.|$|E
50|$|In February 2008, FFA {{formally}} {{announced their}} intention to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. In 2010, {{the decision was made}} by FFA to withdraw its World Cup <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> 2018, instead focusing on a <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2022 tournament. FFA failed in its $45.6 million <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2022 World Cup having received only one vote from the FIFA Executive.|$|R

5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E
5|$|Byrd {{resigned}} from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd campaigned on his stance of separate but equal. McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd took all of the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, McCreary {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a legislator, he was an advocate of free silver and a champion of the state's agricultural interests. After two failed <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> election to the Senate, McCreary secured the support of Governor J. C. W. Beckham, and in 1902, the General Assembly elected him to the Senate. He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully challenged him for his Senate seat in 1908. The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E

5|$|In Lillehammer's <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, it was {{announced}} that the All India Football Federation, the national federation for football in India, and IMG-Reliance would be accepting <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> ownership of eight of nine selected cities for the upcoming Indian Super League, an eight-team franchise league modeled {{along the lines of the}} Indian Premier League cricket tournament. On 13 April 2014, it {{was announced}} that Sourav Ganguly, Harshavardhan Neotia, Sanjiv Goenka, Utsav Parekh, and Spanish La Liga side Atletico Madrid had won the bid for the Kolkata franchise. It turned out to be the most expensive franchise, being purchased for 18 crore (around US$3 million). On 7 May 2014, the team was officially launched as Atlético de Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Nunn {{served on}} the boards of regents of Morehead State University and Kentucky State University. He served as a {{lecturer}} at Western Kentucky University, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999. During the late 1980s, he criticized Senator Mitch McConnell, one of the emerging leaders of the state's Republican party, for not doing more to support other Republicans in their <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> office; McConnell maintained that he had to focus on his own reelection campaign in 1990. In 1988, Nunn unsuccessfully challenged Congressman Jim Bunning in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky's Republican national committeeman.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} factor in successful <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> large events is a track record, and the winning of the <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2012 Games, undoubtedly, contributed to London being awarded the 2017 World Athletics Championships.

Also losing <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Republican at-large seats were real estate assessor F. Raymond Heuges and former magistrate Hobson R. Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Many of Istanbul's sports {{facilities}} {{have been built}} or upgraded since 2000 to bolster the city's <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Summer Olympic Games.

5|$|Ohio had {{completed}} the stretch of highway between I-70 to just before the SR7 interchange by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions of highway {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that year. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to fund the project again. <b>Bids</b> <b>for</b> construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated construction time of 37months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.|$|E
