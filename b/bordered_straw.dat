50|$|At {{the city}} limits, the seven dwarves, led by Grumpy/Leroy (Lee Arenberg), congregate {{at the line}} of the town's <b>border.</b> They pick <b>straws</b> to see who will be the one to cross it and Sneezy is the unfortunate winner. As the first victim of what happens when {{residents}} leave Storybrooke, he loses the memories of his fairytale life and completely becomes his Storybrooke persona, Tom Clark. Meanwhile, as the residents are trying to clean up after the wraith's attack, Geppetto/Marco (Tony Amendola) is putting missing person signs up, hoping to find Pinocchio. Prince Charming/David (Josh Dallas) goes to Regina's house to demand answers about the Mad Hatter/Jefferson's (Sebastian Stan) hat and how to get Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and Snow White/Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) back, but Regina pretends she doesn't know how and says she is more concerned about Henry (Jared S. Gilmore). When Charming asks the Blue Fairy/Mother Superior (Keegan Connor Tracy) if there is any way that can send them back, she tells him that there is no fairy dust to make it work. At that moment, the dwarves return and explain what happened to Sneezy after he crossed the city limits, causing the displaced characters to panic. Charming tells the citizens to meet back in two hours and he will tell them his plan.|$|R
50|$|The cotton bollworm, {{corn earworm}} or Old World (African) bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, (also {{known as the}} scarce <b>bordered</b> <b>straw</b> in the UK, where it is a migrant) is a moth, the larvae of which feed {{on a wide range}} of plants, {{including}} many important cultivated crops. It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species. It should not be confused with the similarly named, related species Helicoverpa zea.|$|E
