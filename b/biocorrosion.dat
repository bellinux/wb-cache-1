5000|$|In {{the article}} titled [...] "iDynoMiCS: {{next-generation}} individual-based modelling of biofilms", an agent-based model is presented that models the colonisation of bacteria onto a surface, {{leading to the}} formation of biofilms. The purpose of iDynoMiCS (standing for individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator) is to simulate the growth of populations and communities of individual microbes (small unicellular organisms such as bacteria, archaea and protists) that compete for space and resources in biofilms immersed in aquatic environments. iDynoMiCS can be used to seek to understand how individual microbial dynamics lead to emergent population- or biofilm-level properties and behaviours. Examining such formations is important in soil and river studies, dental hygiene studies, infectious disease and medical implant related infection research, and for understanding <b>biocorrosion.</b> An agent-based modelling paradigm was employed to make it possible to explore how each individual bacterium, of a particular species, contributes {{to the development of the}} biofilm. The initial illustration of iDynoMiCS considered how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. The study explores the hypothesis that the existence of diverse strategies of denitrification in an environment can be explained by solely assuming that faster response incurs a higher cost. The agent-based model suggests that if metabolic pathways can be switched without cost the faster the switching the better. However, where faster switching incurs a higher cost, there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations. This suggests that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different biological environments. Since this introduction the applications of iDynoMiCS continues to increase: a recent exploration of the plasmid invasion in biofilms being one example. This study explored the hypothesis that poor plasmid spread in biofilms is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate of the plasmid donor agent. Through simulation, the paper suggests that plasmid invasion into a resident biofilm is only limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth. Sensitivity analysis techniques were employed that suggests parameters relating to timing (lag before plasmid transfer between agents) and spatial reach are more important for plasmid invasion into a biofilm than the receiving agents growth rate or probability of segregational loss. Further examples that utilise iDynoMiCS continue to be published, including use of iDynoMiCS in modelling of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm with glucose substrate.|$|E

30|$|The {{hindrance}} of SRB cell attachment {{on glass}} and metal surfaces, {{and the ability}} to remove pre-established biofilms was also seen when LEO was applied at sub-MIC, MIC and supra-MIC levels. Although the effect of essential oils on biofilms has already been reported in for medically important bacteria, this is the first study that shows the antimicrobial activity of an essential oil against anaerobic bacteria of relevance to the petroleum industry. In addition, LEO was shown to prevent <b>biocorrosion</b> (weight loss) of carbon steel coupons by inhibiting the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio alaskensis biofilm formation. Biofilms are an agglomeration of microbial cells that adhere to a surface and are imbibed in a polymeric matrix built by the microorganisms themselves (Costerton 1999). This structure changes the physiological state when compared to their planktonic counterparts, and then these sessile cells have a better fitness in natural environments (Golby et al. 2012). In petroleum environments, SRB biofilms have been associated with <b>biocorrosion</b> of metal surfaces of the petroleum production line (Jayaraman et al. 1999). Therefore, the use of LEO, or citral, at MIC and supra-MIC levels to control SRB biofilms fits the golden rule that should be applied to all industrial systems described by (Videla et al. 2002), which is to keep the system clean in order to avoid <b>biocorrosion.</b>|$|E
40|$|Various {{authors have}} shown that some amino acids can act as {{corrosion}} inhibitors, which has generated an increasing interest in these compounds as substitutes to conventional corrosion inhibitors that are usually toxic [1, 2]. Nevertheless, {{in the field of}} <b>biocorrosion</b> amino acids have been demonstrated to be able to enhance the corrosion process. Their role in <b>biocorrosion</b> is considered to be of two types: an acidifying role at the vicinity of the metal, or a chelating role that binds the metal ions issued from the corrosion process and can result in the formation of ion concentration cells, causing further corrosion on the metal surface [3, 4]. The present study proposed another possible role of amino acids in anaerobic <b>biocorrosion</b> of steels. Voltammetric and potentiometric experiments were carried out with 316 L stainless steel in solutions containing leucine or lysine at different concentrations and pH. The results demonstrated that the cathodic reaction was enhanced by the presence of amino acids, certainly because of the reduction of the hydrogen atoms linked to the amine or carboxylic acid groups.

40|$|When a {{material}} {{is used in}} a non-sterile natural environment, microorganisms colonize its surface and grow to form a biofilm. The local conditions beneath the biofilm may induce severe biodeterioration and <b>biocorrosion</b> phenomena. Mechanisms in aerobic natural waters are still discussed although it is commonly agreed that the biofilm catalyses the reduction of oxygen. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this catalysis: the formation of hydrogen peroxide, the modification of the oxides on the material surface {{and the presence of}} biological molecules (enzymes as peroxidase, catalase …) that contribute to the different steps of oxygen reduction. In this work, this last hypothesis has been investigated. Generally studies in <b>biocorrosion</b> are based on the measure of global parameters (corrosion potential versus time, current under polarisation …). On the contrary, the aim of the work presented here was to develop a local approach to study material/biofilm interfaces. The SVET was used to put in light coupling between physico-chemical conditions, local mass transfers, surface state and electrochemical behaviour, which led to aerobic <b>biocorrosion.</b> 	The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the ability of the SVET to probe catalysis phenomena induced by biofilm. In order to simplify the studied system, the activity of natural biofilm on surface was simulated by immobilising hemic proteins (hemin or myoglobin) on the material. The hemic protein was chosen as model of the enzymes that are able to catalyse oxygen reduction. Two systems were tested: •	Adsorption of hemin from DMSO on a stainless steel surface •	Successive deposits of myoglobin and Poly(EthyleneImine) on a graphite surface. To perform SVET analysis, galvanic coupling was prepared on sample surface: it was obtained by immobilising the catalyst only on a defined area of the sample.

This study systematically investigated the degradation behaviors of novel Mg-Zr-Sr alloys using electrochemical techniques, hydrogen evolution, and weight loss in simulated body fluid (SBF). The microstructure and degradation behaviors of the alloys were characterized using optical microscopy, XRD, SEM, and EDX. The results indicate that Zr and Sr concentrations in Mg alloys strongly affected the degradation rate of the alloys in SBF. A high concentration of 5 wt% Zr led to acceleration of anodic dissolution, which significantly decreased the <b>biocorrosion</b> resistance of the alloys and their biocompatibility. A high volume fraction of Mg 17 Sr 2 phases due to the addition of excessive Sr (over 5 wt%) resulted in enhanced galvanic effects between the Mg matrix and Mg 17 Sr 2 phases, which reduced the <b>biocorrosion</b> resistance. The average Sr release rate is approximately 0. 15 mg L - 1 day - 1, which is much lower than the body burden and proves its good biocompatibility.

40|$|Abstract. Microbial biofilms produce {{electrochemical}} {{interactions with}} metal surfaces by following {{a wide variety}} of different electron exchange pathways. Reviewing the mechanisms identified in the <b>biocorrosion</b> of steels leads us to distinguish direct and indirect mechanisms for biofilm-catalysed cathodic reactions. Indirect mechanisms are due to the production of metal oxides or hydrogen peroxide (aerobic corrosion) or metal sulphides (anaerobic corrosion), which further react with the metal surface. Direct mechanisms involve adsorbed biocompounds, generally enzymes or their active sites, which catalyse the cathodic reduction of oxygen for aerobic <b>biocorrosion</b> or the proton/water reduction in anaerobic processes. Recent studies dealing with the role of hydrogenases in anaerobic corrosion have shed light on the important role of phosphate species via so-called cathodic deprotonation.
