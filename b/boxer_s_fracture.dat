These studies were performed in part to unravel details of the previously observed isolated rupture of dye-labeled PC vesicles on glass (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys. J. 2002, 83, 3371 - 3379), specifically to differentiate partial rupture, that is, pore formation and leakage of entrapped dye, from full rupture to form bilayer disks. In addition, the adhesion potential of PC vesicles on glass was calculated based upon the adhesion-driven flattening of adsorbed vesicles and a newly developed theoretical model. The vesicles were found to flatten considerably upon adsorption to glass (width-to-height ratio of approximately 5), which leads to an estimate for the adhesion potential and for the critical rupture radius of 1. 5 × 10 - 4 J/m 2 and 250 nm, respectively. Independent of vesicle size and loading with dye molecules, the adsorption of intact vesicles was observed at all concentrations below a threshold concentration, above which the formation of smooth lipid bilayers occurred. In conjunction with previous work (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys.

The absorption spectrum in the 1000 - 1450 nm region is essentially identical whether P+ is generated by chemical oxidation or continuous illumination. The Stark effect on the 1250 nm band of P+ is relatively small compared to the Stark effect seen for the Qv transition of P.

We propose that the negative anisotropy is a result of unidirectional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a dimer of YFP, with the donor chromophore in the neutral form and the acceptor chromophore in the anionic form. This unusual mechanism is supported by studies of a monomeric YFP (A 206 K YFP) and transient-absorption spectroscopy of YFP 10 C.

The electric field {{effect on the}} charge recombination rate constant of the state P+QA- in photosynthetic reaction centers has been measured in polymer film samples {{at a number of}} temperatures. This extends an earlier study at 80 K in which a small field-induced slowing of the rate constant was reported [Franzen, S.; Goldstein, R. F.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. J. Phys.

At temperatures greater than 160 K, evidence is presented for an electric-field-induced activated recombination pathway similar to that observed in reaction centers which have nonnative quinones of low reduction potential substituted for ubiquinone. However, it is shown that this pathway alone cannot account for the electric-field-induced changes in kinetics observed at higher temperatures. The data analysis used to obtain the log(ket) vs AGet curve at 80 K is extended to include changes in the steady-state population of P+QA- observed at higher temperatures with a continuous wave probe beam. This field dependence is analyzed in terms of electron-transfer theory including the entropy of reaction and the temperature dependences of the reorganization energy and the local field correction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} {{electric}} field modulated absorption spectroscopy (Stark effect) study of isolated photosystem II reaction center complexes, including a preparation {{in which the}} inactive pheophytin HB was exchanged for 131 -deoxo- 131 -hydroxy-pheophytin. The results reveal that the Stark spectrum of the Qx and Qy transitions of the pheophytins has a second-derivative line shape, indicating that the Stark effect is dominated by differences in the dipole moment between {{the ground and the}} electronically excited states of these transitions (¢í). The ¢í values for the Qx and Qy transitions of HB are small (¢í) 0. 6 - 1. 0 D f- 1), whereas that of the Qx transition of the active pheophytin HA is remarkably large (¢í) 3 D f- 1). The Stark spectrum of the red-most absorbing pigments also shows a second-derivative line shape, but this spectrum is considerably red-shifted as compared to the second derivative of the absorption spectrum. This situation is unusual but has been observed before in heterodimer special pair mutants of purple bacterial reaction centers [Moore, L. J., Zhou, H., and <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 11949 - 11960]. The red-shifted Stark spectra can be explained by a mixing of exciton states with a charge-transfer state of about equal energy.

Ultrasonic {{spot welding}} of {{galvanized}} steel sheets {{has been conducted}} to investigate formation process of the weld microstructure, and effect of zinc coat on joint property. The joint strength showed a rapidly increase at the weld time of 0. 8 s, {{and it has the}} maximum value over 1. 0 s.

In contrast, the fracture partially occurred in the base steel in the weld time over 1. 0 s, and concaves in which the steel substrate of one specimen partially remains on the other specimen were observed. The formation process of weld microstructure of ultrasonic welding was proposed to be a two-steps process. First, zinc coat in the interface was mechanically removed by the vibration and clamping force, and some zinc particles dispersed in the weld interface. Second, the zinc particles melted due to the friction, and partially bonded regions were simultaneously formed around the zinc particles. The partially bonded regions were stirred with the steel substrate as the weld time increased. The joint strength increased by development of the stirred zone. At the weld time over 1. 2 s, the joint strength decreased due to growth of crack around the stirred zone...|$|R

40|$|Vibrational Stark effects, {{which are}} the effects of {{electric}} fields on vibrational spectra, were measured previously for the C-N stretch mode of several small nitriles, yielding difference dipole moments, difference polarizabilities, and transition polarizabilities for each species [Andrews, <b>S.</b> S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. J. Phys. Chem. A 2000, 104, 11 853]. This paper explains the physical origins of the observed Stark effects using two theoretical models and, in the process, computes several molecular parameters for each nitrile. A model with a single vibrational mode, developed with perturbation theory, is found to explain most of the experimental Stark effects. Because it cannot account for coupling between modes, which is ubiquitous and important for resonant vibrations and for combination mode absorption, another model is developed which considers multiple vibrational modes and three spatial degrees of freedom. It is found that difference dipole moments arise {{from a combination of}} mechanical anharmonicity and electronic perturbations of chemical bonds, where the two factors have about equal magnitudes for nitriles. Transition polarizabilities are dominated by the effects of electronic polarizability of the sample molecule, which alters the partial charges on atoms in an electric field. Stark effects of resonant transitions are found to be equal to linear combinations of the effects for the basis states, which explains an experimental observation. For overtone and combination transitions, Stark shifts are predicted to be the sums of the shifts of the component transitions. Absolute overtone intensities can be calculated from difference dipole results, which is experimentally verified. In summary, these theories largely explain the physical origins of observed vibrational Stark effects and can predict Stark effects {{for a wide variety of}} other systems...|$|R

In the DLL mutant the D helix of the M subunit {{has been}} substituted with the D helix from the L subunit, {{and in the}} DLL-FYLFM mutant, three additional mutations are incorporated that facilitate electron transfer to the M side of the RC. In both cases the helix swap {{has been shown to}} yield isolated RCs that are devoid of the native bacteriopheophytin electron carrier HL (Chuang, J. I.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G.; Holten, D.; Kirmaier, C. Biochemistry 2006, 45, 3845 - 3851). For DLL, depending whether the detergent Deriphat 160 -C or N-lauryl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) is used to suspend the RCs, the excited state of the primary electron donor (P*) decays to the ground state with an average lifetime at 77 K of 330 or 170 ps, respectively; however, in both cases the time constant obtained from single-exponential fits varies markedly {{as a function of the}} probe wavelength. These findings on the DLL RC are most easily explained in terms of a heterogeneous population of RCs. Similarly, the complex results for DLL-FYLFM in Deriphat-glycerol glass at 77 K are most simply explained using a model that involves (minimally) two distinct populations of RCs with very different photochemistry. Within this framework, in 50 % of the DLL-FYLFM RCs in Deriphat-glycerol glass at 77 K, P * deactivates to the ground state with a time constant of 400 ps, similar to the deactivation of P * in the DLL mutant at 77 K.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of fractures and faults in slightly deformed Werfenian quartzitic sandstones, which in the Polish part of the Tatra Mts. begin the sedimentary succession of the autochthonous cover overlying directly the crystalline core. Investigations including geometric and genetic analysis of fractures and faults have enabled to reconstruct the evolution of the palaeostress field in relation to the generally accepted stages of structural evolution of the Tatra Mts. The oldest fractures are represented by the S system of shear fractures, which originated due to SSW–NNE compression in almost horizontal or slightly N-tilted beds. The F 1 fault set could have also originated in this stage as a result of slip along the bedding planes or along planes sub-parallel to bedding. This stage took place after the Early Turonian and before the Coniacian. The formation of main zones of strike-slip faults, including the Ornak dislocation zone, could have taken place in the terminal part of this stage or directly after it. The following stage was linked with rotational uplift of the Tatra Mts., taking place since the Late Miocene. As a result of SSW–NNE extension, the L set of fractures appeared in the gradually uplifted Werfenian rocks. Additionally, the F 2 set of normal faults originated along with the simultaneous opening of some <b>S</b> <b>fractures</b> and reactivation of the F 1 fault set.

40|$|Objectives: Incomplete {{excavation}} {{reduces the}} risk of pulpal complications, but doubts remain regarding the mechanical properties of incompletely excavated teeth. Remaining carious dentine is suspected to not sufficiently support the restoration and to reduce bond strengths between the tooth and the restoration, with effects possibly varying depending on the depth of the remaining caries lesion. This study investigated fracture resistance (FR) and cuspal deflection (CD) of premolars after leaving or removing demineralized dentine in vitro. Methods: In 48 premolars, shallow and deep artificial lesions (depths [mean ± SD] of 64 ± 18 µm and 771 ± 176 µm) were created on pulpo-axial walls of standardised mesial- distal-occlusal cavities. Demineralized dentine was either removed or left before adhesively restoring the tooth (n = 12 /group). Restored teeth were submitted to thermo-mechanical cycling. CD was subsequently measured at loads of 200 N and 400 N, and teeth submitted to occlusal-perpendicular loading until fracturing occurred. Results: FR was not significantly different between teeth with or without remaining demineralized dentine regardless of the lesion depth (p > 0. 30, t-test). Irrespective of the removal technique, teeth with deep lesions showed significantly decreased FR (p ≤ 0. 001). In contrast, CD was significantly increased in teeth with remaining demineralized dentine compared with completely excavated teeth (p ≤ 0. 05; Mann–Whitney test). Conclusions: Remaining demineralized dentine did not significantly decrease the fracture resistance of premolars in vitro. Effects of increased cuspal deflection on restoration margins should be assessed. This study showed no indication that incomplete excavation increases the risk of non-pulpal complications.

Interestingly, during a recent panel at the 2013 Intellectual Property Symposium at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, judges from the Federal Circuit suggested that they would like to see more policy arguments made in appellate briefs. Policy arguments are generally not emphasized in Federal Circuit briefs, but if a litigant does advance policy arguments before the Federal Circuit, it is instructive to observe (1) how the policy arguments are constructed, and (2) whether the Federal Circuit expresses a policy preference in its opinion.

40|$|Safer bridges {{are among}} a number of spinoff {{benefits}} from NASA procedures for testing 'cfracture toughness" of a structural part, meaning its ability to -~sis~cracktsh at might cause failure. The New River Bridge in West Virginia, shown under construction, is the world's largest single span bridge. U. <b>S.</b> Steel <b>fracture</b> toughness requirements for such bridges include NASA-developed test procedures. Bridge materials and other metal structures may develop flaws during their service lifetimes. Such flaws can affect the structural integrity of the part. Thus, {{it is important to know}} the "fracture toughness" of a structural part, or its ability to resist cracks. NASA has long experience in developing fracture toughness tests for aerospace hardware. Since 1960, NASA-Lewis has worked closely with the American Society for Testing & Materials. Lewis and NASA-funded industrial contractors have made many important contributions to test procedures, now recommended by ASTM, for measuring fracture toughness...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{materials}} used for construction, yet it still poses fundamental problems for engineers and researchers. The most critical problem is the propagation of cracks in concrete structures, but the mere presence of cracks does not necessarily mean that the concrete structure has reached the limit of its service life; however, instability caused by the propagation of these defects could result in the failure of a concrete structure. Thus, the focus of fracture mechanics is on assessing the stability of a structure, rather than detecting the presence of cracks. An accurate analysis of the progress of a fracture is required for assessing the integrity of a concrete structure and to predict its future performance. Accordingly, finite element analysis was used to model the performance of cracked concrete structures using available damage models, which require accurate evaluation of the mechanical and fracture properties. While concrete 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties are well known, the identification of concrete 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fracture</b> parameters poses an ongoing challenge. Concrete is a heterogeneous material with complicated fracture patterns. Therefore, sensors attached directly to the specimen to measure the crack opening do not provide accurate measures. The objective of this research is to develop a new methodology to study a cracked concrete structure 2 ̆ 7 s performance using a non-contact technique to monitor the development of the fracture process zone without causing interference during fracture. Consequently, Digital Image Correlation was chosen and applied successfully to the Wedge Splitting Test to study a cracked structure 2 ̆ 7 s response, represented by the mean of the load-crack tip opening displacement. Since the WST is an indirect fracture test, the experimental data was used to identify concrete fracture parameters by means of inverse analysis based on the cohesive crack model. The associated forward problem is based on the cracked hinge model, which is capable of accounting for the softening phenomenon. The use of Digital Image Correlation made it possible to study the dynamics of crack propagation. Experimental observations are thoroughly discussed, with special attention being placed on the monitoring of the crack 2 ̆ 7 s evolution, and the variation of dissipated energy and tensile damage along the crack path...|$|R
30|$|Patient VL was a 28 -year-old {{homeless}} male. He {{was admitted}} to the emergency room after a fall while cycling. He complained of pain in his right shoulder and an impaired range of motion. An X-ray showed a fracture of the acromion and the coracoid process with a slight dislocation of the fragments. This fracture was classified as an <b>S</b> 2 c <b>fracture</b> according to the lateral scapula suspension system (LSSS) introduced by Lambert et al. (2013). These fractures together with concomitant ligamentous lesions of the acromioclavicular (AC) ligament caused instability of his shoulder, which made an operation necessary.|$|R

40|$|Merrill Skaggs {{explains}} in her introduction {{that we are}} to hear her provocative title, Axes, {{in at least two}} ways: as the intersecting axes of these two writers 2 ̆ 7 very different careers (as when Joseph R. Urgo termed Cather and Faulkner as 2 ̆ 2 the horizontal and vertical axes of American literature 2 ̆ 2), but also as actual weapons, 2 ̆ 2 battle-axes. 2 ̆ 2 Skaggs reads these authors 2 ̆ 7 novels and stories as word-weapons they wielded at one another, hoping to wound. They may ultimately have judged each other worthy opponents, but they never laid down their arms, remaining combative until Cather 2 ̆ 7 s death and even after (her posthumously published story 2 ̆ 2 Before Breakfast, 2 ̆ 2 in Skaggs 2 ̆ 7 s reading, is a final slap at Faulkner, who gets in the last word and final blow with The Reivers, even though Cather wasn 2 ̆ 7 t there to receive it). Cather and Faulkner made surprisingly few comments about each other. In the handful of known references, Faulkner seems generally respectful of the older and revered Cather, and Cather seems generally oblivious to her emerging challenger, mentioning him in print only once. These two writers, born a generation apart, are both regionalists whose works transcend regionalism, but otherwise they seem as different in style and thematic concerns as two contemporary authors can be. Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fractured</b> and vast-syntaxed narrations have seemed for many as embedded in Southern Gothic traditions as Cather 2 ̆ 7 s pellucid prose has seemed reflective of Great Plains vistas. But readers of Skaggs 2 ̆ 7 s book need to prepare themselves for entry into an alternative universe where, far from ignoring or warily avoiding each other, Cather and Faulkner were obsessed with each other and spent a good part of their careers sending coded messages {{back and forth in the}} form of stories and novels-more like letter bombs-that scolded, mocked, secretly acknowledged, and even occasionally offered a grudging compliment to the other writer. No one cracked the code, Skaggs insists, until Skaggs. To enter this Bizarro world, we must, as Skaggs warns us, wander into 2 ̆ 2 an intricate labyrinth, holding tight to a thread. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Background Previous {{analysis}} of jaw fracture hospitalisations in Western Australia (WA) indicated disproportionately {{high rates of}} hospitalisations for Aboriginal people. This study was to follow-up on the earlier analysis to determine if inequalities in terms of jaw fracture hospitalisation rates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people have changed. Aims This study, done over a 10 -year period from 1999 / 2000 to 2008 / 2009, aimed to determine rates of hospitalisations for jaw fractures in WA, trends over the 10 –year period, and direct costs associated with these hospital admissions. Methods Hospitalisation data {{were obtained from the}} Western Australian Hospital Morbidity Data System (HMDS). Episodes were {{selected on the basis of}} an ICD 10 -AM code being <b>S</b> 02. 4 (<b>Fracture</b> of the malar and maxillary bones) and <b>S</b> 02. 6 (<b>Fracture</b> of the mandible). Self-reported Aboriginality were used to compare Aboriginal to non-Aboriginal populations. Estimated cost of care was determined for each episode using the national standard diagnostic-related group (DRG) average price. Results Our findings indicate that inequalities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in terms of hospital admissions for jaw fractures exist in WA, and continued over a decade-long period. Higher fracture rates occurred amongst males, Aboriginal people, younger adult age-groups, those from low socioeconomic areas, and those from remote and very remote areas. The DRG cost per person for jaw fractures ranged between AUD 842 and 109, 002, with a median cost of 4, 965. Conclusion Hospital admission rates for the treatment of maxillary and mandibular fractures is very strongly divided along racial and socioeconomic lines in WA...|$|R
