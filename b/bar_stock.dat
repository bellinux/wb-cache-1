25|$|By 1834, {{documents}} {{show that the}} railroad attempted to sell the Stourbridge Lion and its early sisters to the Pennsylvania Canal Commission, but the deal was not finalized. The locomotives were deemed too unsuitable for the now expanding railroads; American locomotive manufacturers had begun producing their own locomotives of improved designs as early as 1830. The four locomotives were used as sources of English wrought-iron <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> {{until the middle of}} the 1840s.|$|E

25|$|Cutting fluids degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the lubrication system. A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.|$|E
25|$|In 1821, Colonel Richard Borden {{established}} the Fall River Iron Works, along with Maj. Bradford Durfee {{at the lower}} part of the Quequechan River. Durfee was a shipwright, and Borden was the owner of a grist mill. After an uncertain start, in which some early investors pulled out, the Fall River Iron Works was incorporated in 1825. The Iron Works began producing nails, <b>bar</b> <b>stock,</b> and other items such as bands for casks in the nearby New Bedford whaling industry. They soon gained a reputation for producing nails of high quality, and business flourished. In 1827, Col. Borden began regular steamship service to Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|In 1956 Martín Fox {{arranged}} a special Club Tropicana tourist package: Cubana Airlines' Tropicana Special began a round-trip flight that ferried club customers from Miami to the Tropicana and returned them to Florida at 4am the following morning.

50|$|The {{cocktail}} {{has fallen}} out of fashion. In June 2003, the Washington Post published an article that chronicled two writers' quest to find a Jack Rose in a Washington, D.C. bar.

25|$|Roll forging is {{a process}} where round or flat <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to {{the next set of}} grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.|$|E

2500|$|Vibraphone {{bars are}} made from {{aluminum}} <b>bar</b> <b>stock,</b> cut into blanks of pre-determined length. [...] Holes are drilled through {{the width of the}} bars so they can be suspended by a cord.

For a uniform bar, the nodal points are located 22.4% from each end of the bar.|$|E

2500|$|Bandsaws {{dedicated}} to industrial metal-cutting use, such as for structural steel in fabrication shops and for <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> in machine shops, {{are available in}} vertical and horizontal designs. Typical band speeds range from 40 feet (12 meters) per minute to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) per minute, although specialized bandsaws are built for friction cutting of hard metals and run band speeds to 15,000 feet per minute. [...] Metal-cutting bandsaws are usually equipped with brushes or brushwheels to prevent chips from becoming stuck in between the blade's teeth. [...] Systems which cool the blade with cutting fluid are also common equipment on metal-cutting bandsaws. [...] The coolant washes away swarf and keeps the blade cool and lubricated.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the various}} {{additive}} processes matured, {{it became clear}} that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer. [...] The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end use parts such as engine brackets and large nuts would be grown (either before or instead of machining) in job production rather than [...] being machined from <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> or plate. [...] It is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are more prevalent than AM in metalworking, but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads, and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing, it is clear to engineers that much more is to come.|$|E
2500|$|Horizontal {{bandsaws}} {{hold the}} workpiece stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. [...] This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. [...] Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. [...] When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. [...] The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. [...] More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.|$|E

50|$|A {{bar feeder}} feeds {{a single piece}} of <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> into the cutting machine. As each part is machined, the cutting tool creates a final cut to {{separate}} the part from the <b>bar</b> <b>stock,</b> and the feeder continues to feed the bar for the next part, allowing for continual operation of the machine. There are two types of bar feeds used in lathe machining: Hydrodynamic bar feeds, which rest the <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> in a series of channels whilst clamping down on {{the top and bottom of}} the bar, and hydrostatic bar feeds, which hold the <b>bar</b> <b>stock</b> in a feed tube using pressurized oil.|$|E
