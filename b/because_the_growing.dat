500|$|The 68th {{began the}} second day in a more {{defensible}} position on Cemetery Hill. [...] This placed them {{at the center of}} the Union line, and most of the day's early action was on the flanks. [...] In the evening, however, Early's forces attacked again; the charging Confederates quickly reached the top of the hill and some hand-to-hand combat broke out, but losses were light <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> darkness made it difficult for soldiers on both sides to shoot accurately. [...] Reinforcements from the II Corps arrived and helped the XI Corps hold the position. [...] On the third day, the 68th remained in that position, but the major attack of the day, Pickett's Charge, was to their left. [...] The 68th performed better than they had at Chancellorsville, participating in their first Union victory. [...] They paid the price with much higher casualties, 8 killed and 63 wounded; 67 were made prisoners of war, many on the first day during the retreat to Cemetery Hill. [...] In the thick of the action for two out of three days, the 68th lost more men at Gettysburg than in any other battle.|$|E

50|$|Around {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{people started to}} pay {{attention}} to eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides, as a good productive forage in summer, since eastern gamagrass is productive, palatable and easily digestible by almost all cattle. For these reasons, gamagrass is ideally suitable for feed crops, including hay and pasture forage for which rotation of grazing seasons is controlled. It is used as forage <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season of the grass is earlier compared to other warm-season grasses and later compared to cool-season grass and legumes.|$|E

50|$|Public rhetoric {{refers to}} {{discourse}} both within {{a group of}} people and between groups, often centering on the process by which individual or group discourse seeks membership in the larger public discourse. Public rhetoric can also involve rhetoric being used within the general populace to foster social change and encourage agency on behalf of the participants of public rhetoric. The collective discourse between rhetoricians and the general populace is one representation of public rhetoric. A new discussion within the field of public rhetoric is digital space <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> digital realm complicates the idea of private and public, as well as previously concrete definitions of discourse. Furthermore, scholars of public rhetoric often employ the language of tourism to examine how identity is negotiated between individuals and groups and how this negotiation impacts individuals and groups on a variety of levels, ranging from the local to the global.|$|E
5000|$|Interest {{in using}} algae for {{nutrient}} control once again increased, {{this time in}} the form of keeping the algae in a [...] "sump" [...] or other small aquarium which was connected to the main aquarium via plumbing. With added lighting and flow, algae would grow in this area, and the algae would consume nutrients from the water just as Dr. Adey's algae scrubber units did. Sumps or other small aquariums used for this purpose became known as [...] "refugiums". The name [...] "refugium" [...] was used <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> algae provided a safe place for small and microscopic animals to breed and grow, and thus was a [...] "refuge" [...] from the large fish and invertebrates in the main aquarium that would otherwise consume them. However while the refugiums did indeed consume nutrients from the water, they did not consume them fast enough in all situations; this caused many hobbyists to continue to have nuisance algae problems in their main aquariums.|$|E
