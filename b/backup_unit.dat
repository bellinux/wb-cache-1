5|$|The Bellaire Fire Department {{is housed}} at 5101 Jessamine Street. The fire station {{includes}} two fire engines (a main engine and a volunteer/backup engine), two medic units (a main medic unit and a <b>backup</b> <b>unit),</b> an on shift commander vehicle, {{a vehicle for}} each the chief and assistant chief, a cascade unit, and a hazardous materials trailer. The fire department operates the Citizens Fire Academy, a fire and life safety program for Bellaire citizens held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The old fire station was demolished on December 4, 2009, with demolition continuing on Monday December 7, 2009, and operations are temporarily relocated at the Chevron building. A new fire station was scheduled to in {{the location of the}} previous fire station. The groundbreaking for the new station was held on December 17, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomination}} in April 2005 {{of a new}} NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since {{a failure of the}} <b>backup</b> <b>unit</b> would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.|$|E
25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} often {{employed}} for extremely deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much {{more efficiently than}} air, {{which means that the}} diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a <b>backup</b> <b>unit</b> cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes; depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.|$|E

Bender soon discovers that he suffers from a terminal manufacturing defect: he is built without a <b>backup</b> <b>unit,</b> making him mortal. He is devastated by the revelation of his mortality and of Inspector , believing the inspector's careless error resulted in him being sent {{out into the world}} only to die. He becomes determined to find Inspector No. 5 and demand an answer to why he allowed Bender to exist despite his fatal flaw.|$|E

[...] In 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, and in 1966 he and the Wrecking Crew played on the Pet Sounds album.

Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya (Russian National Liberation Army) made up of Russian collaborators and Battle Group Reinefarth (commanded by SS-Gruppenführer Heinz Reinefarth) consisted of Attack Group Dirlewanger (commanded by Oskar Dirlewanger), Attack Group Reck (commanded by Major Reck), Attack Group Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt) and various support and <b>backup</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{developed}} various mathematical models {{to analyze the}} effects of disruptions of Critical Infrastructures (CIs). Their tools focus on improving efficiencies in response to CI disruptions. This stems from emergency response units to the placement of <b>backup</b> <b>units</b> for restoring energy/power. A drawback however {{is the absence of}} the most critical elements of a system. The critical element is the one thing that affects the system the most. By knowing this, it permits decision makers (DMs) to plan and allocate resources efficiently. Hence, we use the systems engineering approach to propose and develop a methodology and mathematical framework for identifying the most critical elements of a CI. Specifically we apply our concept to the transportation sector, highways...|$|R

50|$|The {{sites were}} {{inherited}} by the Ahrensfelde guard regiment in mid-January 1989.

These units were the uniformed {{as well as the}} guard and security units of the units of the Stasi (BV), not a subdivision of the guards regiment. Part of these units were merged in January 1989 into the guard regiment, which is why the site was taken over by the Ahrensfelde guard regiment. Until 1989, the guard regiment had no locations in the districts. The service objects there were guarded by the WSE, which were placed under the respective BV.|$|R
