5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, <b>be</b> <b>within</b> a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E

5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source.

5|$|In 1955 the US Army began {{considering}} {{the possibility of}} further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead {{while it was still}} far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to <b>be</b> <b>within</b> the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times.

The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.|$|E

Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
