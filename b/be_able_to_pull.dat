5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

Occasionally, phimosis may be caused by an underlying condition such as scarring due to balanitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans. This can typically be diagnosed by seeing scarring of the opening of the foreskin.|$|E

Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering.

Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.|$|E
25|$|The two leads, Hansard and Irglová, {{are both}} {{professional}} musicians. Director Carney, former bassist for Hansard's band The Frames, had asked his long-time friend to share busker anecdotes and compose songs for the film, but had intended the male lead {{to be played}} by actor Cillian Murphy, who was an almost-signed rock musician before turning to acting. Murphy was {{also going to be}} one of the film's producers. But Murphy declined the prospect of acting opposite non-actor Irglová (then 17 years old) and also felt that he hadn't the vocal capabilities to belt out Hansard's octave-leaping songs, so he pulled out, as did the film's other producers along with their financial resources. Carney then turned to songwriter Hansard, who'd previously done only one acting job, a supporting role as guitarist Outspan Foster in the 1991 ensemble film The Commitments, the story of a Dublin soul music cover band. Hansard was initially reluctant, fearing that he wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> it off, but after stipulating that he had to be fully involved in the filmmaking process and that it be low-budget and intimate, he agreed.|$|E

"The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise" [...] is {{a comedy}} sketch that first aired on May 29, 1976, during episode 22 {{of the first}} season of the NBC variety show, Saturday Night Live.

Dress rehearsal was difficult, with the writer doubting whether Belushi would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off an effective parody of William Shatner's performance as Captain James Kirk. However, the result was a success, and O'Donoghue immediately congratulated Belushi after his performance and reflected that he had perfectly parodied Shatner as Kirk.|$|E
500|$|Harry Parsons, {{founder of}} the Working Sealyham Terrier Club, has stated that, [...] "To sustain a breed...you need between 300 to 500 puppies a year". The Kennel Club has blamed {{the decline of the}} breed on the {{availability}} of designer dogs and newer breeds such as the Shih Tzu, and the banning of tail docking which has reduced their ability as working dogs. Paul Keevil, formerly of the Kennel Club's vulnerable breeds committee explains: [...] "Traditionally, soon after Sealyhams were born, their tails were docked by half their length, because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes, meaning that they required short, strong tails for the owner to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> them out." [...] As of 2010, the breed is ranked 152nd out of 168 breeds according to registrations by the American Kennel Club.|$|E

2500|$|Heatley {{has been}} voted into the NHL All-Star Game five times, and played {{in four of}} them, most {{recently}} in 2009. His first appearance in the All-Star Game was in 2003, where he scored four goals, tying a single-game All-Star record (held by four other players, including Wayne Gretzky). The game went to a shootout where Heatley scored the only goal for the Eastern Conference in a 6–5 loss. The shootout goal did not, however, count towards his regulation total of four, leaving him tied for the record. Heatley also added an assist for a game-high five points and was named the All-Star Game MVP. In response to Heatley's impressive performance in just his second NHL season, Eastern Conference teammate Jeremy Roenick commented, [...] "Twenty-two years old?

2500|$|Magicians {{are able}} to cast spells, summon spirits, and create magical {{artifacts}} called [...] "foci". All magicians follow traditions that determine their understanding of magic, including hermetic mages (whose control of magic comes through study and manipulation of magical energy or mana, and who summon and bind elementals in lengthy and expensive rituals to be called on later) and shamans (whose magic derives from a connection to nature via a totem spirit, and who can summon the nature spirits associated with a particular place). Adepts use magic internally in order to accentuate their natural physical abilities. Adepts can run on walls, use mundane objects as deadly thrown projectiles, shatter hard objects with a single unarmed blow, and perform similar feats of incredible ability. All adepts follow a very personal path (Path of the Warrior, Path of the Artist, etc.) that normally determines their abilities which might be very different for any two adepts (while one might demonstrate increased reflexes and facility with firearms, a second might possess unparalleled mastery of the katana, and a third might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off incredible vehicular stunts). Mystic adepts, also known as physical mages, are part magician and part adept who distribute their magic power between the abilities of both aspects.|$|E
