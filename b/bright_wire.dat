40|$|Death {{moves through}} my {{work with the}} {{destructive}} teeth of barbed wire and the sensual hand of silk. It seduces, punctures, bludgeons, strangles. It grows tumors and ciphers senility. It scars the past and threatens the future. The work is a memoir and a memorial seeking formal structure. The structure is tense with antitheses: the barbed wire???s rigid containment against the silk???s supple fragility, the grey grid???s horizontal and vertical stability against the <b>bright</b> <b>wire???s</b> diagonal tipping, the texture???s tactile invitation against its pointed threats. Warm and cool greys emphasize surface, quiet and mystery. Colors used under veils of grey fabric or as linear elements woven on the surface create contradiction and ambiguity. The linear qualities come from strands of barbed wire, covered wire, strips of China silk and of silk screen ???Silk,??? which is really transparent polyester. Plaster is used for its dull roughness and as an adhesive to hold wire and fabric to the canvas. (See more in text. ...|$|R

5000|$|Modern pickups are {{tailored}} to the sound desired. A commonly applied approximation used in selection of a pickup is that less wire (lower DC resistance) = <b>brighter</b> sound, more <b>wire</b> = [...] "fat" [...] tone. Other options include specialized switching that produces coil-splitting, in/out of phase and other effects. Guitar circuits are either active, needing a battery to power their circuit, or, as in most cases, equipped with a passive circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The Reichswehr's visual {{acknowledgement}} of the new National Socialist reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Defense Ministry ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now Germany's National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May. The design adopted, in silver for the Reichsheer (army) and in gold for the Reichsmarine (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile Hakenkreuz, later {{to be called the}} Wehrmachtsadler ("armed forces eagle"). On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9 cm (3⅝") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven ("BeVo") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or <b>bright</b> aluminum <b>wire,</b> and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion. The backing was [...] "badge-cloth" [...] (Abzeichentuch), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally Reichsheer grey, but in late 1935 the renamed Heer changed its Abzeichentuch color to a dark blue-green called flaschengrün (bottle-green).|$|R
6000|$|That {{mischief}} {{had been}} intended was obvious, {{for a piece}} of iron <b>wire,</b> <b>bright</b> as if cut with nippers at one end and broken off short at the other, had been driven right through the centre of the cable, so as to touch the inner wires--thus forming a leak, or conductor, into the sea. There could be no doubt that it had not got there by accident; neither had it been driven there during the making or shipping of the cable, for in that case the testings for continuity would have betrayed its presence before the starting of the expedition. The piece of wire, too, was the same size as that which formed the protecting cover, and it was of the exact diameter of the cable. There was also the mark of a cut on the Manilla hemp, where the wire had entered. It could have been done only by {{one of the men who}} were at work in the tank at the time the portion went over, and, strange to say, this was the same gang which had been at work there when the previous [...] "fault" [...] occurred.|$|R
