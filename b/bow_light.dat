50|$|The most {{important}} {{change in the}} series occurred during this season when a notably redesigned Seaview interior was introduced, along with the Flying Sub, a yellow, two-man mini-submarine with passenger capacity, armed with a laser gun. It could leave the ocean and function as an airplane. The Flying Sub was referred to by the initials FS-1. The futuristic craft greatly increased the Seaview crews travel options. The Flying Sub was launched from a bay with automatic doors added in {{the lower part of}} the bow section of Seaview that was apparently built between Seasons One and Two (though stock color footage from the 1961 film that was used in Season Two occasionally showed a Seaview minus this addition, despite it being present in later color footage included in the same episodes). The Seaviews private observation deck from the first season was never seen again. The ships eight smaller observation windows became four large windows giving the sub a sleeker, more futuristic look. The control room was made larger and more open-plan showing the bow windows beyond the control room area (previously this was both closed off by a bulkhead and doorway and on another level in the black-and-white first season), while a memorable large rectangular panel screen of flickering lights was moved across the control room, and access to the Flying Sub via a sealed hatch stairway at the bow section was added. The Seaview also now had a powerful laser beam in its <b>bow</b> <b>light.</b> The small mini-sub ridden by two men from the first season was retained and occasionally still used in the color episodes. The ships enlisted men were also given more colorful uniforms (red or light blue jumpsuits) and white Keds Champion sneakers, evidently to take advantage of the changeover from black-and-white to color. The officers and petty officers, however, retained their khaki works from the first season. The traditional sailor uniforms worn in the first season were only seen in stock footage from the first season and on characters who were newly filmed to match up with that footage. All these changes occurred between seasons. The Flying Sub was showcased in the shows closing credits for the entire season, while the initial opening was a color version of the first season sequence, though this was soon replaced by a new color sequence of Seaview descending beneath the surface.|$|E
40|$|In {{a letter}} to a friend Leibniz likens the {{material}} (i. e. physical) effects of monadic (i. e. nonphysical) aggregates to the phenomenon of refraction/ diffraction in the perception of a rainbow. [monads are the nonphysical, nonspatial, metaphysical units, the ‘simple substances’ of Leibniz’s philosophical system] In much the same way light is prismatically dispersed through droplets of water in a mist, giving rise to an arc of spectral colors, for Leibniz matter {{is the result of a}} comparable monadic refraction. <b>Bow,</b> <b>light,</b> mist. All part of the same network. Baudrillard’s real chimera: the thing perceived already an aggregate effect. Buddhism’s real chimera: the skandhas (five aggregates) and the causal interplay of emptiness and form.

In the Dark Realm, Link battles the Demon Train, Cole and Malladus, securing Zelda's body and destroying the Demon Train. As Zelda prepares to rejoin her spirit to her body, Malladus attempts to possess her body again, but Byrne interferes and helps Zelda rejoin her body. Malladus instead destroys Byrne. Without a vessel, Malladus takes over Chancellor Cole against his will, completing his resurrection. However, Cole's body is unable to contain Malladus' spirit for long, though he vows to destroy the world before he is completely rejected. Once again, Link and the restored Zelda work together to defeat Malladus with Zelda's magic, the <b>Bow</b> of <b>Light</b> and the Lokomo Sword, destroying the entity along with Cole forever.|$|R

50|$|Double bass bows vary in length, {{ranging from}} 60 to(-) 75 cm. In general, a bass bow is shorter and heavier than a cello bow. Pernambuco, {{also known as}} Brazilwood, is {{regarded}} as an excellent quality stick material, but due to its scarcity and expense, other materials are increasingly being used. Inexpensive student bows may be constructed of solid fiberglass, which makes the <b>bow</b> much <b>lighter</b> than a wooden <b>bow</b> (even too <b>light</b> to produce a good tone, in some cases). Student bows may also {{be made of the}} less valuable varieties of brazilwood. Snakewood and carbon fiber are also used in bows of a variety of different qualities. The frog of the double bass bow is usually made out of ebony, although snakewood and buffalo horn are used by some luthiers. The frog is movable, as it can be tightened or loosened with a knob (like all violin family bows). The bow is loosened {{at the end of a}} practice session or performance. The bow is tightened before playing, until it reaches a tautness that is preferred by the player. The frog on a quality bow is decorated with mother of pearl inlay.|$|R

5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the <b>bow,</b> and <b>light</b> gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|R

50|$|The {{etiquette}} surrounding bowing, {{including the}} length and depth of bow, and the appropriate response, is exceedingly complex. For example, if the other person maintains his or her bow for longer than expected (generally {{about two or three}} seconds), it is polite to bow again, upon which one may receive another bow in return. This often leads to a long exchange of progressively <b>lighter</b> <b>bows.</b>|$|R

50|$|Horse archers may {{be either}} light, such as Scythian, Hun, Parthian, Cuman or Pecheneg horsemen, or heavy, such as Byzantine kavallarioi, Turkish timariots, Russian druzhina and Japanese samurai. Heavy horse archers {{typically}} fought as disciplined units. Instead of harassing without ever making contact, they shot in volleys, weakening the enemy before they charged. In addition to bows, they often also carried close combat weapons, such as lances or spears. Some nations, like medieval Mongols, Hungarians and Cumans fielded both light and heavy horse archers. In some armies, {{such as those}} of the Parthians, Palmyrans, and the Teutonic Order of Knights, the mounted troops consisted of both super-heavy troops (cataphracts, knights) without <b>bows,</b> and <b>light</b> horse archers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} warfare {{that might be}} called firepower were the slingers of ancient armies (a notable example being the biblical story of David), and archers. Eventually, the feared Huns employed the composite <b>bow</b> and <b>light</b> cavalry tactics to shower arrows on the enemy forces, a tactic that also appeared in a less mobile form in Britain, with its famed longbowmen, used during the various Anglo-French conflicts collectively known as the Hundred Years' War during the Middle Ages. The Battle of Crécy is often {{thought of as the}} beginning of the [...] "age of firepower" [...] in the west, where missile weapons enabled a small force to defeat a numerically superior enemy without the need for single combat.

50|$|The {{technique}} of bowing a Hardingfele also {{differs from that}} used with a violin. It's a smoother, bouncier style of <b>bowing,</b> with a <b>lighter</b> touch.

The strings of the fiddle are slimmer than those of the violin, resembling the strings of violins from the baroque period.|$|R
