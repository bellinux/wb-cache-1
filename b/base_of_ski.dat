It began operation in 1961 opened by Dwight and Jean Miller with a blue Pomagalski (now Poma of America) double chair with shield. In 1967 a platter lift was installed, yielding better access to the north ski runs and giving first-time skiers an easier way to access the slopes. At the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ski</b> Idlewild was which was Idlewild Guest Ranch, a hotel built three years before the ski area opened. The Idlewild Lodge hotel, {{not to be confused}} with the Ski Idlewild base lodge, was a part of the Idlewild Guest Ranch and featured tennis courts, a swimming pool, a disc golf course, cross country ski trails, and the Idlewild Barn, an ice skating rink. After many years of providing novice skiers with fun and affordable skiing, Ski Idlewild closed on March 20, 1986.|$|E

Can sometimes be marked as a Green circle.|$|R
50|$|A private {{ski area}} is a {{membership}} <b>based</b> type <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> resort developed primarily for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. Like a country club, private ski areas in North America offer exclusive memberships, usually based on an initiation fee and annual dues. In this context, it {{is the presence of}} exclusive memberships rather than private ownership that makes a ski area private.|$|R

50|$|Race day saw a {{gathering}} of approximately 300 riders moving from Race Central to the start and finish area, at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Hammarby <b>Ski</b> Hill. Just over 200 participants from 15 different countries were issued race passes. The race course covered two 12 km loops, consisting primarily of root covered rocky technical single-track, through an area called Hellasg√•rden.|$|R
50|$|Dry slope users often {{improve the}} {{performance}} of their equipment by using the hardest grade <b>of</b> <b>ski</b> wax. The wax wears off quickly, however, and must be renewed after one or two sessions. At least one company makes a hard wax that is intended for use on dry slopes. Some users apply aerosol furniture polish or other can based products to the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> their <b>skis</b> or boards as the silicone oil it contains is reputed to reduce friction. Other substances, such as dishwashing liquid, are sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the four}} resort <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the Perisher <b>Ski</b> Resort {{contained}} a skiable area of 1,245 ha and were serviced by 47 lifts, making Perisher the largest Australian ski resort.|$|R
50|$|A ski is {{a narrow}} strip of {{semi-rigid}} material worn underfoot to glide over snow. Substantially longer than wide and characteristically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins (originally made of seal fur, but now made of synthetic materials) can be attached at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main lodge {{is at the}} <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> runs and, {{being located}} in a river valley, {{at the end of}} a steep road. The upper lift {{stations}} are at the top of the river valley, in relatively flat prairie farmland. While unloading at the top of the triple chairlift, you see a working oil pump jack and often cattle grazing immediately in front of you.|$|R
50|$|Summer 2010 had two lift {{construction}} projects at Creekside <b>Base,</b> site <b>of</b> <b>skiing</b> at Vancouver 2010. The Timing Flats Express, used for passenger transport for the games, was removed and rebuilt as the Strawberry Express at Sunshine Village, Alberta, Canada.

It also displays equipment used in the polar expeditions of Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen.|$|R
50|$|Canopy tours {{often include}} a jeep or hike tour to the zipline site during which a guide tells you about {{wildlife}} and flora. At some mountain resorts, the ziplines {{are near the}} <b>base</b> <b>of</b> summer-green <b>ski</b> slopes and the first zipline is reached via a chairlift. These guided tours often last from one to three hours depending on the tour company. It will often include accommodation, meals, transport other activities such as rafting, mountain climbing, hiking and mountain biking.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} to the turning problem had already long {{been used in the}} ski industry, the used of spring steel edges. Normally these were thin strips held onto the ski using small screws, but this was not suitable for the laminated design. Head designed a version with a flange that extended sideways about 1/5 of the way into the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski.</b> The edges were laid up and bonded into the base as the ski was being glued together. The new version not only fixed the problem of soft edges, but was found to greatly improve the overall performance <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> as well.|$|R
500|$|The {{hills and}} terrain in the {{surrounding}} area met the competitive demands for an elite cross-country ski event. A notice board was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor {{the progress of the}} competitors. [...] The cross-country and nordic combined races began and ended at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> jump hill. The stands for the ski jump competition had to be removed during the cross-country races; spectators had only a small area from which to watch the races but were allowed on the course to cheer on the competitors.|$|R
50|$|During the Cold War, the {{mountain}} {{was the site}} of Cottonwood Air Force Station, an early warning radar installation of the U.S. Air Force. The project was made public in 1955, construction began in 1956, and it went operational in early 1959. The radar tower was at the summit and the cantonment of the station was at 4400 ft, about a mile (1.6 km) below the present <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> area on Radar Road. The 27-unit family housing area was built in the city of Cottonwood, on Butte Drive in the north end.|$|R
50|$|Telluride {{sits in a}} box canyon. Steep forested {{mountains}} and cliffs surround it, with Bridal Veil Falls {{at the head of}} the canyon. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free gondola connects the town with its companion town, Mountain Village, Colorado, at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in pop culture. It is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its ski resort and slopes during the winter as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the exact}} opening date is not known, {{the ski area}} was in {{operation}} {{by the end of}} the 1940s, serviced by surface lifts. In 1963 New Hampshire's second gondola lift was installed at Mt. Whittier. The gondola was unusual in that it had three terminals - a bottom terminal on the east side of [...] Route 16, a second lower terminal at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> area, and a top terminal near the summit of Nickerson Mountain. The remains of the gondola, including the towers and cables, still cross Route 16 today.|$|R
50|$|The {{slopes of}} Cerro Otto (1405 meters above sea level), right {{west of the}} city centre, often have deep snow cover: {{cross-country}} skiing and dog sledding can be practiced {{for a few months}} every year. The neighbourhood of Villa Catedral, at about 990 meters above sea level, sees colder temperatures and increased snowfall: on the coldest winters, this hub, which serves as the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ski</b> resort, can be snow-covered through the winter, sometimes with over 50 cm snow (in 2007, accumulations reached 100 cm). However, on most winters, this condition is only met above 1200 meters, where most of the slopes of the resort are located.|$|R
5000|$|San Giacomo {{has one of}} {{the three}} {{recreational}} downhill skiing slopes in the Province of Teramo, the other two being Prati di Tivo e Prato Selva. In addition to skiing, the village offers an assortment of other entertainment venues including hotels, bars, and restaurants. The <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> lifts is located at Monte Piselli, in the past well known for the cultivation of garden peas. On 2 September 1964 a cable car connecting San Giacomo with the <b>ski</b> lifts <b>of</b> Monte Piselli, was put into operation. It eventually reached the end of its useful service and was later dismantled. The trip is now typically made by car or bus.|$|R
50|$|Oberalppass {{railway station}} is located {{next to the}} Oberalppass road. It is at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the Oberalp <b>ski</b> area. The station is owned and run by the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn. It has 3 {{platform}}s, {{one of which is}} a bay platform from Andermatt, and is often closed during the winter. The railway {{on both sides of the}} station is a single line, so Oberalppass is an important passing place.|$|R
5000|$|Double Black Diamond Golf Course - The Double Black Diamond Golf Course at Holiday Valley is an 18 hole course which bends {{around the}} <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> mountain. The first nine holes {{were added to}} the area in 1962 to attract golfers during the spring, summer and fall. In 1987 the second nine holes opened making it a full course. The course opens near the end of April and closes for the winter at the end of October; the exact dates vary with each year due to {{uncertain}} weather patterns in the area during changing seasons. On June 24, 2017 Anthony [...] "Tiger" [...] Torres hit the longest putt in course history at 209 feet.|$|R
50|$|The main town in {{the valley}} is Kauns (1050 m), located near the Inn river, with its Schranz Chapel {{containing}} the Kauner Kreuz. The Kaunertal Glacier Road continues up to the Wei√üenseeferner glacier. This toll road is the fifth highest paved road in the Alps and reaches an elevation of 2750 m (9025 ft). With 29 180 degree turns, the road leads {{all the way to}} the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> area at 2750 m. The main source of income is this glacier ski area with 35 km slopes and 10 lifts, which was opened in 1982. Due to the <b>ski</b> area's elevation <b>of</b> 2200 - 3050 m, and the glacier, it is operational from mid-October to mid-June.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, {{its first}} season, Baldy {{operated}} as a ski cat area with McKinney T-Bar. A year later, the resort acquired a T-bar that traveled up {{the face of}} Mount Baldy. The T-bar base at 5650 ft above sea level is the highest <b>base</b> altitude <b>of</b> any <b>ski</b> resort in Canada. That T-bar was replaced with the old Blue Chair from Mount Washington on Vancouver Island. This lift is now called the Eagle Chair.|$|R
50|$|Prospect {{mountain}} is a mountain {{located in the}} town of Woodford, Vermont in Bennington County, Vermont. The {{mountain is}} located in the southern region of Vermont's Green Mountains. It is home to the Prospect Mountain Nordic Ski Area, which has the highest <b>base</b> elevation <b>of</b> any <b>ski</b> area in New England, accounting for its abundance of natural snow. Prospect Mountain can be counted on to provide a long season for cross-country skiing.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1980s, Bucky Kashiwa {{developed}} a new construction technique using a rolled stainless steel sheet forming three sides of a torsion box over a wooden core, with the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> forming the bottom. Introduced in 1989, the Volant skis proved expensive to produce, {{and in spite of}} numerous positive reviews, the company never became profitable. In 1990, the Salomon S9000 took the same basic concept but replaced the steel with plastics, producing a design they called [...] "monocoque". Now referred to as the [...] "cap ski" [...] design, the concept eliminates the need to wrap the core and replaces this with a single-step process that is much less expensive to produce. Cap ski construction dominates alpine ski construction today.|$|R
50|$|Located in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council, {{the valley}} {{is the site of}} one <b>of</b> four resort <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the Perisher <b>Ski</b> Resort, which also {{comprises}} Guthega, Blue Cow and Smiggin Holes. It is located within the Kosciuszko National Park between Jindabyne and Charlotte Pass on the Kosciuszko Road. Access to the Valley is via the Skitube Alpine Railway or by road. Although it is primarily a winter only resort village, year round accommodations are available, including great tours, and bush walks.|$|R
500|$|The ski jumping, {{cross-country}} skiing and Nordic combined events {{were held at}} Holmenkollbakken, [...] from the city center. Although upgraded several times since its opening in 1892, the former wooden superstructure was replaced with a concrete tower and in-run ahead of the Olympics, with the out-run being extended to [...] Stands were erected to seat 13,000 people, with capacity for an additional 130,000 standing spectators at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the hill. Cross-country races started and ended at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ski</b> hill. A switchboard was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor {{the progress of the}} competitors during the races. Most of the stands built for the ski jumping competition had to be removed for the cross-country races. As a result, there was little room for spectators to sit and watch the cross-country events. Spectators were therefore allowed to walk within the course.|$|R
