5|$|Historically, Albion's {{greatest}} rivals {{have always}} been Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham. The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently, however, most Albion fans have <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals, particularly between 1989 and 2002, when Albion and Villa were never in the same division but Albion {{were in the same}} division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. With Albion and Villa being in different divisions for so many years, however, the rivalry became less heated and Aston Villa supporters now consider Birmingham City as their main local rivals and not Albion despite geographical distance between the two clubs. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, as well as a semi-final in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth Ward in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three blocks would be added, with the new boundary following {{the west side of}} St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams. Two-story rowhouses predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the Federal period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some restoration efforts, such as some Greek Revival rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which will benefit from state tax credits should the area be added to the district.|$|E
25|$|To {{combat the}} oblast's {{economic}} {{problems such as}} high unemployment, in 1996 the Russian authorities granted Kaliningrad special economic status and tax advantages intended to attract investors. The oblast's economy has since benefited substantially {{and in recent years}} experienced a boom. A US$45 million airport terminal has been opened and the European Commission provides funds for business projects under its special program for the region. The oblast has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> increasing trade with the countries of the EU as well as increasing economic growth and rising industrial output.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1980s, the old {{business}} district centered on 7th Avenue (La Septima) began a slow recovery, {{first as a}} bohemian haven for artists and, by the early 1990s, as a popular nightlife and entertainment district. Since 2000, many historic structures near 7th Avenue have been renovated and restored, and construction has filled in most long-vacant lots. Among the new structures are hotels, office and retail space, and apartment complexes, leading to the Ybor City's first population increases in over half a century. Residential areas such as V.M. Ybor and Tampa Heights have also <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> gentrification, with older structures being restored and new ones built.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{was later}} in {{granting}} this permission {{than the rest}} of the Commonwealth. The British Mechanized Transport Corps had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the women of Canada as a great asset to the war effort, and began to look into the recruitment of these women for their purposes. In June 1941, they were officially given permission to recruit women in Canada for overseas duty. It quickly became apparent that it would look very odd for the British to be recruiting in Canada when, no there was no corresponding Canadian service. However, many of the women who were active in the various volunteer corps did not meet the requirements to be enlisted women. The majority of these women were older than the accepted age, would not pass the fitness test, or had physical or medical impairments. It was quickly realized that the women needed had jobs and were not free to join.|$|E
25|$|After issuing the {{challenge}} to McKinney, Joe begins to find himself becoming very popular around the office for his bravery. Meg and Natalie, however, do not feel fighting McKinney will solve anything, and both attempt to tell Joe as much, to no avail. Joe seeks out the aid of an ex B movie star-turned-martial arts instructor named Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi) to teach him to defend himself. Things seem to finally be going right for Joe, as he has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Meg and has even been given a promotion at work he had been hoping for. When Meg realizes Jeremy (Greg Germann), a colleague she works closely with for the company (who {{also happens to be}} attracted to her), only gave Joe a non-existing position at the office to prevent him from suing the company, she resigns in fear that she might one day have to demote or even fire Joe. Meg again tries to persuade Joe not to fight McKinney, and finally gives him an ultimatum: if he does not call off the fight with McKinney, their relationship is over.|$|E

Although she had been active with the socialist-leaning ILP in years past, Pankhurst had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> leftist {{politics}} as disagreeable, an attitude which intensified {{while she was in}} Russia. The meeting was uncomfortable for both parties; he felt that she was unable to appreciate the class-based conflict driving Russian policy at the time. He concluded by telling her that English women had nothing to teach women in Russia. She later told the New York Times that he was the [...] "biggest fraud of modern times" [...] and that his government could [...] "destroy civilisation." ...|$|E
500|$|Canning's honesty (or lack of it) and Fielding's {{handling}} of the case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by The London Daily Advertiser. [...] On {{the same day that}} Gascoyne ordered Canning's arrest an advertisement appeared in the Public Advertiser, asking its readers [...] "to suspend their judgement in the Case of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the whole, which is now being prepared by Mr. Fielding, is published." [...] Fielding had learnt of Hall's questioning by Gascoyne and had brought Canning to his house in Bow Street, to [...] "sift the truth out of her, and to bring her to confession if she was guilty." [...] Satisfied with her account, and unconcerned with Hall, his critique of Squires' supporters was published as A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning, in which he espoused the virtuous nature of the young maid and attacked those her detractors. [...] Copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later. [...] John Hill saw A Clear Statement as a direct attack on Gascoyne, and blasted Fielding with The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered, which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as: [...] "Who Sir, are you, that are thus dictating unto the Government? [...] Retire into yourself and know your station." [...] Fielding, however, played little part in the saga from thereon, believing that Canning's supporters had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as an obstacle to their case.|$|E

[...] Sudan has experienced two civil wars since 1955, the second of which lasted 22 years. During this time, the U.S. was the largest provider of foreign aid to Sudan, largely focused on humanitarian aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development.

2500|$|The woman's club {{movement}} {{became part}} of Progressive era social reform, which was reflected {{by many of the}} reforms and issues addressed by club members. Many women's clubs focused on the welfare of their community because of their shared experiences in tending to the well-being of home-life, according to Maureen A. Flanagan. Tending to the community was often called [...] "municipal housekeeping" [...] during the Progressive Era and reflected a shared belief by many club members that home and city life were linked through city hall. By constructing the idea of municipal housekeeping, women were also able to justify their involvement in government. Later, in 1921, Alice Ames Winter describes how women had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] "their homes as the units out of which society was built", and that home life and public life were linked. Women's clubs [...] "established the idea that women had a moral duty and responsibility to transform, define and shape public policy". Women's clubs were also [...] "training schools" [...] for women who wanted {{to get involved in the}} public sphere. They helped women attain both social and political power.|$|E
2500|$|Metro-North's Harlem Line, {{originally}} chartered as the New York & Harlem Railroad, is an 82-mile (132km) {{commuter rail}} line running north from New York City into eastern Dutchess County. The lower 53 miles (86km) from Grand Central Terminal to Southeast, in Putnam County, is electrified {{with a third}} rail and has two (or more) tracks; north of that point, trains use diesel locomotives on a single track. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on {{the northern end of}} the line except during rush hours, when they run as expresses to or from Grand Central. [...] There is also one direct roundtrip to Grand Central on weekends. [...] While the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from Westchester County to jobs in the city, in recent years it has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more [...] "reverse commuting", as Bronx residents use it to reach jobs in Southern Westchester where many stations are within walking distance of city centers. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to Western Massachusetts to enable residents of part of that region to commute to jobs in the city as well.|$|E
