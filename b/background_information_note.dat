40|$|From {{a survey}} of {{employer}} payroll / tax filing practices, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) determined that some businesses prepare their own tax reports using payroll/tax software developed internally or purchased or they contract with a third party. Subsequently, BLS developed an electronic data collection strategy for the quarterly Multiple Worksite Report (MWR), which is filed by 112, 000 legal entities representing 1. 2 million worksites. BLS has recently been {{working closely with the}} developers of payroll/tax software and with firms providing payroll/tax filing services to include the electronic transmittal of MWR data in their systems. In the past, employers that had multiple establishments in many states had to manually file paper MWRs with each state. With electronic reporting, data for all states are sent directly to BLS, which edits the data and forwards it to the proper state. This paper discusses the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>noted</b> above and the various approaches that BLS staff have used to solicit the cooperation of these firms to modify their systems to include electronic reporting as an option or additional service...|$|R

This book profiles 61 of the setting's most eminent characters, with each entry providing complete game statistics, <b>background</b> <b>information,</b> and campaign <b>notes,</b> drawn from novels and game products published {{through the end}} of 1995. There are around 60 heroes detailed throughout the 160 pages, including characters such as Elminster, Laeral Silverhand and King Azoun Obarskyr IV. After the stats for each character, proficiencies, equipment, magical items, combat tactics, companions, enemies, appearance, personality, location, history, motivations, campaign uses and sources for further reading are discussed at length. After this, there are sections which detail the special magical items which the heroes possess, and specialist spells which are mentioned throughout the book.|$|R
40|$|Concern {{about the}} {{relationship}} between small firms and clearing banks has resurfaced periodically over many years. In 1991 it has again been prominent, receiving considerable media attention. There {{is no doubt that the}} issues raised by the relationship are potentially very significant for the future development of the Scottish economy and accordingly warrant detailed and careful consideration. With this sort of thing in mind, in July 1991 the Association of British Chambers of Commerce commissioned our survey of small firms in Southern England, the English Midlands and Scotland. We posted a questionnaire to 1500 Chambers of Commerce members. This paper examines the 73 responses from small firm customers of Scottish clearing banks. These responses are discussed in Section 3. Section 2 provides <b>background</b> <b>information</b> by briefly <b>noting</b> major issues of concern (1) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{issues related}} to the training and provision of interpreters for deaf students 'at institutions of higher education in the United Kingdom. <b>Background</b> <b>information</b> provided <b>notes</b> the increasing numbers of deaf and partially hearing students, the existence of funding to pay for interpreters, and trends in the availability of interpreters. Financial support through the Disabled Students Allowance is discussed as are concerns about this allowance including eligibility, means-testing, special problems of students with multiple disabilities, and payment methods. Establishment by some universities of special support services for deaf students is noted. A survey of 46 deaf students at the University of Bristol (England) is summarized for type of secondary school attended, communication mode preferred, communication mode in their previous school, and support needs. The survey found that none of the students had used interpreters in elementary/secondary education settings. A final section reviews trends in training and qualifyint interpreters for the deaf. Other issues considered include social implications of interpreter use, the university experience, and alternatives to interpreting in the higher education setting.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted (a) to evaluate how providing background infor-mation at test may benefit retrieval and (b) to further examine how providing back-ground information prior to study influences encoding. Half {{of the participants}} read <b>background</b> <b>information</b> prior to study, {{and the other half}} did not. In each group, half were presented with <b>background</b> <b>information</b> at test. <b>Background</b> <b>information</b> at test improved recall for those who did not read information prior to study. Results from Experiment 2 suggested that this improvement was due to <b>background</b> <b>information</b> providing content cues to retrieve specific ideas from the text rather than topic cues to support top-down recall. Concerning encoding effects, secondary measures and con-struction-integration modeling of free recall support the hypothesis that <b>background</b> <b>information</b> presented prior to study influences the effectiveness of organizational processing during encoding. In many educational and professional training environments, instruction within a domain often begins with the presentation of <b>background</b> <b>information.</b> In general, <b>background</b> <b>information</b> involves the presentation of material prior to study of the to-be-learned content that provides information related to but not necessarily con-tained within that content. For example, <b>background</b> <b>information</b> may explicitly state new facts or ideas relevant to the text content (e. g., informational outlines, definitions, or instructed theories). Some forms of <b>background</b> <b>information</b> may support the activation of a reader’s prior knowledge relevant to the text content (e. g., thematic titles, reading perspectives, or advanced organizers that provid...|$|R
40|$|The study {{determined}} the methods adopted by teachers in prose literature-in-English classrooms, activities {{of teachers and}} students, teachers’ perceived effectiveness of techniques used. It also examined the objectives of teaching prose literature that teachers should address and the extent teachers believe in student-identified difficulties of studying prose literature. The study adopted the descriptive survey research design. Purposive sampling technique was used to select 85 schools in Owerri metropolis and in each school, all literature teachers of senior secondary I and II were involved. In all, 246 literature teachers participated out of which 15 were purposively selected for observation. The two instruments were: Teachers’ Questionnaire (r = 0. 87) and Classroom Observation Schedule (r = 0. 73). Data were analysed using frequency counts and percentages. Results revealed that teachers adopted lecture (28. 4 %), reading (10. 9 %) and discussion (7. 3 %) methods. Teacher’s activities during the lesson include: giving <b>background</b> <b>information,</b> summarizing, dictating <b>notes,</b> reading aloud and explaining and asking questions. The adopted techniques include: questioning, oral reading, silent reading and discussion. Teachers’ perceived questioning as the most effective technique followed by debating and summarizing. Teachers identified development of students’ critical faculties and analytical skills, literary appreciation and language skills to be of utmost concern. It was concluded that the methods adopted by teachers are not diverse enough to cater for the needs and backgrounds of students.

40|$|Program {{comprehension}} is a {{very important}} skill a software engineer need. Many researchers conduct experiments on program comprehension in order to improve tools, documentation, and maintenance guidelines supporting program comprehension. Individual programmers’ productivity might vary significantly even though they have similar background. Thus, the subjects’ background is very important when conducting and analyzing experiments on program comprehension. The survey presented in this short Master thesis identifies subjects <b>background</b> <b>information</b> reported in software experiments on program comprehension. The <b>background</b> <b>information</b> reported in 24 articles was systematically analyzed in order to answer what kind of <b>background</b> <b>information</b> is reported and how the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> was used in the analysis. The articles reports many different background variables, but the overall impression of the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> reported in program comprehension experiments is that it is rather arbitrary and small. The analysis shows {{that there is a need}} for standards and guidelines of how to collect and report subjects’ <b>background</b> <b>information.</b> The survey shows also that almost no <b>background</b> <b>information</b> of the subjects is used in the experiments’ analysis. The articles in this survey provide so little information about the subjects’ background that it is difficult to perform replications and meta-analysis. This thesis aims to make researchers more aware of the subjects’ background in their experiments and reports. On the basis of the results of the analysis I have suggested background variables that should be collected in comprehension studies and proposed a background questionnaire. The questionnaire was used in an experiment with 24 subjects from the industry. I report here experiences with the questionnaire...|$|R
