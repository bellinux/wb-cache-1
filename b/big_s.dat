All the slaughter variables like pH, weight, temperature, fat content, animal group and so on were recorded. Piece B (cut from proximal side of S. M.) and Piece A (cut from distal side of S. M) were vacuum packaged in the slaughter house and were left for 3 weeks in chilling room for maturation. A <b>big</b> <b>S.</b> M muscle (~ 5 kg) was divided into various pieces for measurements that were carried out the in slaughterhouse, namely; pH, mitochondrial isolation, permeablization and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Further measurements of the pieces were followed up three weeks later at our lab in IKBM, namely; tenderness, drip loss and cooking loss (using both piece A and B) and, color stability and OCR(using tissue from piece B). A small piece of S. M and Longismus dorsi (L. D.) muscle was used for pH measurements at time t 0 (~ 4 hrs postmortem), t 1 (~ 8 hrs postmortem) and t 2 (~ 4 hrs postmortem) with three replicate at different positions each time. Results from tenderness measurement showed that SM piece at proximal end (Piece B) was tendered than the distal end (Piece A). The rate of pH decline was different between the collected samples from number 1 - 20 and from 21 - 41. Most of the samples had good and acceptable amount of combined drip and cooking loss. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured on permeabilization fibers after 3 weeks vacuum and chilled storage of the muscle. Similarly our results showed that, OCR could had some prediction ability for classifying the tender and tough group of Piece B from sample 21 - 41 but not for the 1 - 20 sample group. Regression of OCRs and WB values showed that removal of oxygen from the electron transport chain has a positive effect on tenderness. For the spectral measurements of 3 weeks stored muscle, a calibration model (part II-taken from paper (I)) for myoglobin state was required. Fresh S. M muscles (vacuum packaged 4 days postmortem) were prepared to have deoxy (DMb), oxy (OMb) and metmyoglobin (MMb) state using Chemically induced myoglobin states (CHEM) method and oxygen partial pressure packaging (OPP) method. Absorbance spectra (400 - 1100 nm) were made on the 24 sample surface (8 samples for each myoglobin state) with 4 replicate readings at different positions of each sample for each preparation method (OPP and CHEM). Absorbance spectra were transformed by using different ways like using Kubelka-Munk (K/S) and extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC). Calibration and validation model were made from transformed spectra by using either selected wavelengths (SW) or partial least square (PLS) regression. Post-transformation steps were used to normalize the myoglobin states so that, none of them were larger than one or negative and ensured that, sum of three states was not more than one at particular time. Low Root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) and high correlation coefficient (Rc) was used as criteria to choose the best calibration model for myoglobin states. Use of OPP preparation method with EMSC transformation and PLS regression on absorbance gave the best model for calibration. The color stability of 3 weeks stored S. M muscle (Part III) were measured at different times from 0 - 7 days using absorbance spectra (400 - 1100 nm) and L*, a* and b* values. The calibration models were used to predict the change in myoglobin states after exposure to atmosphere using the absorbance spectra for all samples. N-partial least square (N-PLS) regression between variations in L*a*b* values and myoglobin states to OCR was carried out. The DMb concentration predicted from the calibration model decreased with time and indicated that with an increase in time of exposure to atmosphere, DMb first transforms transiently to OMb and then to MMb, whose level rose concomitantly. The change in a* values with time and OCR were highly related. It was found that pH t 0 and pH t 1 are important for color stability of the meat. In three weeks stored muscle, complex II of mitochondria was the most stable complex in the electron transport system and often the only viable site for accepting reducing equivalents, therefore color stability could be related to its activity. In conclusion, the activity of mitochondrial enzymes could be well related to color stability and also to tenderness for a subset of muscles that were characterized by a slower drop in pH early post mortem. No relation between mitochondrial enzyme activity and drip loss and cooking loss was found...|$|E

40|$|Tomato yellow leaf curl disease, {{a devastating}} disease of tomato, {{is caused by}} a complex of begomoviruses {{generally}} referred to as Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Almost all breeding for TYLCV resistance has been based on the introgression of the Ty- 1 and Ty- 3 resistance loci derived from Solanum chilense LA 1969 and LA 1932 /LA 2779 respectively. The aim of this thesis was to fine map, clone and characterize these two TYLCV resistance genes.   The Ty- 1 gene has been used in tomato breeding already for almost 20 years. Its exact genetic location was however unknown which made precise marker assisted breeding difficult. Here we have analysed the recombination behavior of the chromosomal region where Ty- 1 is introgressed by applying newly developed molecular markers in two F 2 populations obtained from two commercial Ty- 1 carrying hybrids. A <b>big</b> <b>S.</b> chilense introgression was detected in both populations that coveralmost the whole short arm and a part of the long arm of chromosome 6. In this introgression recombination suppression was detected and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed two chromosomal rearrangements between S. lycopersicum and S. chilense LA 1969. These rearrangements are most likely the cause of the observed recombination suppression. Using disease tests on progeny of informative recombinants Ty- 1 was mapped to a region of approximately 600 kb which partly overlapped with the mapped region for Ty- 3, which led to the indication that Ty- 1 and Ty- 3 could be allelic. Altogether these results nicely demonstrate the usefulness of FISH as a powerful tool to aid in the accurate mapping of genes that are introgressed from wild species into cultivated tomato (Chapter 2). To further fine map and ultimately clone Ty- 1 and Ty- 3 more plants were screened for recombination events and consequently recombinant inbred lines were generated. By developing new markers in combination with disease tests both genes were fine mapped to a very small, almost similar genomic region (approximately 70 kb). Using a Tobacco Rattle Virus-Virus Induced Gene Silencing approach, the resistance genes were finally identified. It was shown that Ty- 1 and Ty- 3 are allelic and that they code for a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) belonging to the RDRɣ type which has an atypical DFDGD motif in the catalytic domain. In contrast to the RDRαtype, characterized by a catalytic DLDGD motif, no clear function has yet been described for the RDRɣ type. With the identification of Ty- 1 /Ty- 3, a completely new class of resistance genes was unveiled (Chapter 3). The Ty- 1 /Ty- 3 allele is characterized by a 4 amino acid insertion at the 5 -prime part of the protein and by a catalytic DFDGD motif. The allelic variation of this gene was examined using cDNA from five S. chilense derived lines and using draft assemblies of whole genome sequences from more than 50 tomato cultivars, landraces and related wild species. Tobacco Rattle Virus induced gene silencing was used to silence Ty- 1 /Ty- 3 and altogether showed that resistance was compromised in three out of five S. chilense derived lines tested. One line with resistance derived from S. chilense LA 1971 remained resistance after silencing of Ty- 1 /Ty- 3. For another line (8783, derived from LA 1932) only 4 out of 13 plants showed symptoms after silencing,but silencing in this line was inefficient because only one out of three PDS controls showed photobleaching. Comparison of the two typical features of the Ty- 1 /Ty- 3 gene showed no sequence variation amongst S. chilense derived lines. The catalytic domain was found to be conserved among all tomato lines and species analysed, while the characteristic 4 amino acid insertion was also observed in three species closely related to S. chilense, e. g. Solanum corneliomulleri, Solanum peruvianum and Solanum huaylasense. This indicated that most S. chilense accessions most likely carry a functional TYLCV resistance locus on chromosome 6, allelic to Ty- 1 /Ty- 3, and Solanum species related to S. chilense could possibly be useful for future TYLCV resistance breeding (Chapter 4). The Ty- 1 gene encoded an RDR and for this reason most likely conferred resistance involving amplification of the siRNA signal. In the last experimental chapter (Chapter 5) this hypothesis was tested. It was shown that upon TYLCV challenging of resistant Ty- 1 and Ty- 3 lines low virus titers were detected concomitant with the production of relatively high levels of siRNAs. In contrast to the situation in susceptible tomato Moneymaker where high virus titers were observed, but the amount of siRNAs produced lower compared to those in Ty- 1 and Ty- 3. Analysis of the spatial genomic siRNA distribution showed a consistent and subtle enrichment for siRNAs derived from the CP (V 1) and C 3 gene in Ty- 1 and Ty- 3 lines compared with Moneymaker. In tomato plants containing the Ty- 2 resistance gene, included as a control and not an RDR, the virus was hardly detectable but the siRNA profile similar to the one observed in TYLCV-challenged susceptible tomato Moneymaker. Furthermore, genome methylation analysis revealed a relative hypermethylation of the TYLCV CP (V 1) promoter region in genomic DNA collected from Ty- 1 in comparison to susceptible tomato Moneymaker. Altogether this thesis describes the mapping, cloning and characterization of the TYLCV resistance genes Ty- 1 and Ty- 3. Future breeding efforts for TYLCV resistance can now exploit in-gene markers and the insights obtained can possibly direct future research and breeding efforts on plant virus resistance (Chapter 6) ...|$|E
