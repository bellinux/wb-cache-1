5|$|Multi-purpose {{version for}} the Indian Navy, {{equipped}} for anti-submarine warfare, with dipping sonar and advanced avionics, and anti-shipping operations, with two Sea Eagle missiles; 21 built (one crashing <b>before</b> <b>delivery).</b>|$|E
5|$|Three bids were {{submitted}} by the deadline of 1 April 1997, and the contract with Talbot, which had just been bought by Bombardier, was finalized on 27 November 1997. By this time the order had been extended to eleven units, which are variations of the Talbot Talent. <b>Before</b> <b>delivery</b> a further four units were purchased, so the trains could operate all the services on the Nordland Line, replacing most of the locomotive-hauled day trains. Only the night train would remain locomotive-hauled.|$|E

25|$|Tesla {{reported}} 520 {{reservations for}} the Model S {{during the first}} week they were available and by December 2012, a total 15,000 net reservations (after deliveries and cancellations) had been received by year-end. The special edition Model S Signature model was sold out <b>before</b> <b>deliveries</b> began in June 2012, and according to Tesla all models were sold out for that year shortly after. A car ordered in May 2012 would be delivered in early to mid-2013.|$|R
5|$|All {{production}} aircraft were flight tested <b>before</b> <b>delivery.</b> During the Second World War, Jeffrey Quill was Vickers Supermarine's chief test pilot, {{in charge of}} flight-testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine. He oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area. Quill devised the standard testing procedures which, with variations for specific aircraft designs, operated from 1938. Alex Henshaw, chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940, was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory. He co-ordinated a team of 25 pilots and also assessed all Spitfire developments. Between 1940 and 1946, Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires, more than 10% of total production.|$|E
5|$|The British Government {{ordered a}} total of four prototypes (two F-4K and two F-4M), {{together}} with a pair of pre-production F-4K aircraft. The first UK Phantom, a prototype F-4K (designated YF-4K), first flew on 27 June 1966 at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis. The second made its first flight on 30 August 1966. The two pre-production F-4K aircraft were constructed alongside the prototypes, and were initially used for fit check trials of the various systems to be fitted – the first was used for catapult/arrestor and deck landing trials, and the second was primarily for testing the radar and missile systems. All four were delivered to the UK from 1969 to 1970 for continued test work by both the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and British Aerospace. One of the pre-production examples was subsequently delivered to the RAF for operational use, but was lost in 1978. The first F-4M prototype (designated YF-4M) first flew on 17 February 1967, and was also used for fit checks <b>before</b> <b>delivery</b> to the UK.|$|E

50|$|In 1911 {{a bakery}} {{was added to}} the set of buildings. The bread oven had been {{supplied}} by T. Collins & Co of Bristol. The oven was fired using coke, as was the twenty gallon capacity boiler that supplied hot water and regulated the oven.The oven had a capacity to produce 208 1-lb loaves and was fired up twice <b>before</b> <b>deliveries</b> went out to the surrounding population. Water for the bread making was carried by bucket from a spring {{on the opposite side of}} the road.|$|R

25|$|The ship's keel {{was officially}} laid down on February 6, 2016, {{and the ship}} was {{launched}} on May 12, 2016. It underwent sea trials starting in June 2016 until <b>before</b> its <b>delivery.</b>|$|R
25|$|After {{completing}} service trials, and originally designated P-45, a {{first order}} for 80 aircraft was placed 10 August 1939; the designation reverted to P-39C <b>before</b> <b>deliveries</b> began. After assessing aerial combat conditions in Europe, {{it was evident}} that without armor or self-sealing tanks, the 20 production P-39Cs were not suitable for operational use. The remaining 60 machines in the order were built as P-39Ds with armor, self-sealing tanks and enhanced armament. These P-39Ds were the first Airacobras to enter into service with the Army Air Corps units and would be the first ones to see action.|$|R
25|$|On June 1, 1940, {{the first}} Douglas R3D-1 for the U.S. Navy, BuNo 1901, crashed at Mines Field, <b>before</b> <b>delivery.</b> The Navy later {{acquired}} the privately owned DC-5 prototype, from William E. Boeing as a replacement.|$|E
25|$|The Type 143 first flew on 11 June 1929, and {{successfully}} met all performance criteria. One {{of the six}} aircraft was evaluated by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A & AEE) at Martlesham Heath <b>before</b> <b>delivery</b> to Bolivia.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, average {{test flights}} <b>before</b> <b>delivery</b> {{decreased}} to 4.1 from 12 in 2014, {{with an average}} delay down to 25 days from 68. Its reliability reached 97.2% in 2015 and 98.3% in 2016, rising to 98.8% in June 2017, ahead of its 99% target for 2017.|$|E
25|$|Packaging {{sometimes}} {{must be made}} {{difficult to}} open. For example, regulations dictate that some over-the-counter drugs have tamper resistance to deter unauthorized opening <b>before</b> <b>delivery</b> to the intended customer and be in child-resistant packaging. Other packages are intentionally made difficult to open to reduce package pilferage and shoplifting.|$|E

30|$|The {{observed}} company typically assigns one {{driver to}} the same route. The route starts at the DC, which is about 3.5 [*]miles (5.63 [*]km) from all the delivery stops in downtown Seattle. <b>Before</b> <b>deliveries</b> began, the truck’s cargo compartment was at full capacity and held approximately 400 parcels. There are eight delivery stops on this route and they are located about 0.2 [*]miles (0.3 [*]km) from each other. Even though the stops are quite close to each other, it takes approximately 10 [*]h to complete all of the deliveries due to tall office towers where the courier had to make deliveries on almost every floor.|$|R
25|$|Jack {{threatened}} Bradburn, who {{arrested him}} again. Travis and Jack then began plotting their escape. They attempted to smuggle letters to David G. Burnet, a fellow instigator; the letters called on Texians to aid them, but {{stopped short of}} calling for armed rebellion. Bradburn intercepted the letters <b>before</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|E
25|$|Export {{version of}} the F.6 with pylons for bombs or unguided rocket pods, 44 × 2 in (50mm), total of 46 built and one {{converted}} from F.6 (12 F.53Ks for the Kuwaiti Air Force, 34 F.53s for the Royal Saudi Arabian Air Force, one aircraft crashed <b>before</b> <b>delivery).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is joined}} with the wings and landing gear, then moves down the assembly line for the engines, avionics, and interiors.

50|$|The Hollywood was {{available}} in a standard 6-cylinder version and a supercharged version. Each engine was manufactured by Graham-Paige itself. However, the Hollywood did not stop the company's slide. After its public introduction, orders poured in. However, manufacturing difficulties caused months of delay <b>before</b> <b>deliveries</b> began. Customers tired of waiting, {{and most of the}} orders were cancelled. Despite an enthusiastic initial public response, the car actually ended up being a worse flop in the sales department for both Graham and Hupmobile than either firm's respective preceding models. The company suspended manufacturing in September, 1940, only to reopen its plant for military production for World War II.|$|R
