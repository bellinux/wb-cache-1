The new RCC will provide a consolidated location for rental car company passenger processing functions, administration offices, and employee and rental car parking facilities. The building will allow a customer to be shuttled from the main airport terminals to a unified location of rental car companies where they may conduct rental business, pick up vehicles, and return vehicles. The proposed facility infrastructure consists of the main building, outlying separate rental car buildings, parking structures, and surface parking lots, {{all of which are}} proposed as impermeable surfaces. Landscape retention basins are proposed for the north and south ends of the site, allowing some softscape relief.

The RCC project team completed a schematic design phase using traditional development practices in December of 2002 and began the final architectural design phase in April of 2003. Stormwater impacts were initially proposed to be controlled in the final design phase “traditionally ” by conveying stormwater runoff from rooftops, parking areas, and roadways through sumps, underground storm drain pipe, catch basins, and lift stations, thereby controlling peak discharge via detention basins with <b>bleed-offs</b> to adjacent storm drains as well as pumping systems linked directly to the adjacent storm drains...|$|R
50|$|Stealth {{technology}} represents {{more than}} just a low RCS; noise reduction plays a huge role in naval stealth because sound travels much better in water than air. Some of the techniques used include muffled exhaust systems, modified propeller shapes, and pump-jets. The shape of the hull can also have a great effect on the reduction of the noise from a ship. Another major element is signal emission control. Modern warships emit lots of electromagnetic radiation in the form of radar, radio, and even <b>bleed-off</b> from the ships electrical systems. All of this can be used to track a ship and thus modern stealth ships often have a mode the switches as much of the electronic emissions off, the downside of course is that the ship then has to rely on passive sensors and can't easily send messages further than line of sight.|$|E

40|$|A {{major concern}} in the {{operation}} of present-day gas turbine engines is the ingestion of hot mainstream gas into rotor-stator disk cavities of the high-pressure turbine stages. Although the engines require high gas temperature at turbine entry for good performance efficiency, the ingested gas shortens the lives of the cavity internals, particularly that of the rotor disks. Steps such as installing seals at the disk rims and injecting purge (secondary) air bled from the compressor discharge into the cavities are implemented to reduce the gas ingestion. Although there are advantages to the above-mentioned steps, the performance of a gas turbine engine is diminished by the purge air <b>bleed-off.</b> This then requires that the cavity sealing function be achieved with as low a purge air supply rate as possible. This, in turn, renders imperative an in-depth understanding of the pressure and velocity fields in the main gas path and within the disk cavities.

40|$|AbstractA finite-volume {{model for}} the gas flow in a {{compressible}} flow driven system with two moving components is developed and applied. In this system, {{high pressure and temperature}} compressible flow propels one body along a main flow channel. When this body passes an opening in the main flow channel, some of the high pressure gas bleeds off, entering a secondary, telescoping, flow channel that empties into a plenum. The <b>bleed-off</b> flow causes the pressure in the plenum to increase, actuating the motion of a secondary (actuated) body that forms a bounding surface of the plenum, causing the plenum to expand and the secondary channel to lengthen. This model is used to characterize the basic flow effects in the system and to investigate the significance of the system parameters. For the parameters studied, the flow in the system consists of a series of pressure pulses rather than a continuous flow, with reflected pressure waves playing {{a significant role in the}} flow field development. For a given initial pressure, changing the size of the opening and secondary flow channel had a minimal effect on the motion of the propelled body.

This scheme uses only one power conditioning circuit to condition the combined output power harvested from both energy sources so as to reduce the power dissipation. In order to more accurately predict the instantaneous power harvested from the solar panel, an improved five-parameter model for small-scale solar panel applying in low light illumination is presented. The output voltage is increased by using the MEMS piezoelectric cantilever arrays architecture. It overcomes the disadvantage of traditional MEMS vibration energy harvester with low voltage output. The implementation of the {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) for indoor ambient light is implemented using analog discrete components, which improves the whole harvester efficiency significantly compared to the digital signal processor. The output power of the vibration energy harvester is improved by using the impedance matching technique. An efficient mechanism of energy accumulation and <b>bleed-off</b> is also discussed.

40|$|The {{nature of}} digital {{hydraulic}} systems may cause severe fluid-borne noise problems {{because of the}} pulsed nature of the flow. An effective method to reduce the noise that does not impair the system performance and efficiency is needed. This article reports on initial investigations of an active valve for pressure pulsation attenuation in switched inertance hydraulic systems (SIHS) based on in-series and by-pass structures. The in-series structure represents a valve arranged in line between the SIHS and the load providing a controlled pulsating pressure drop, whilst for the by-pass structure the valve was arranged in parallel with the load providing a controlled pulsating <b>bleed-off</b> flow. A high-performance piezoelectric valve {{was used as the}} active controller. Adaptive notch filters with the filtered-X least mean square algorithm were applied for pressure pulsation attenuation, while a frequency-domain least mean square filter was used for secondary path identification. Simulated and experimental results show that excellent cancellation was achieved using the proposed methods, which have several advantages over passive noise control systems. Comparison of the in-series and by-pass structures is discussed in terms of system performance, robustness and advantages. The proposed control structures are very promising for fluid-borne noise cancellation in fluid power systems or other fluid systems with severe noise or vibration problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to evaluate the potential utilization in road construction of wastes produced from the Coolside, LIMB (limestone injection multi-stage burner) and FBC (fluidized-bed combustion) processes, and to specify criteria for landfill disposal of waste from the Coolside process. These three processes {{are considered to be}} clean coal technologies. The Coolside process involves injecting an aqueous slurry of hydrated lime into the ductwork downstream of the air preheater in a coal-fired boiler. The hydrated lime captures sulfur dioxide from the flue gas producing anhydrous calcium sulfite and calcium sulfate, which are collected along with the unused hydrated lime and fly ash. The LIMB process involves injection of lime or hydrated lime directly into the furnace to capture sulfur dioxide. The waste consists principally of anhydrous calcium sulfate, lime, and fly ash. Both processes were demonstrated successfully at the Edgewater Station of Ohio Edison in Lorrain, OH, from 1989 to 1992. Circulating fluidized-bed combustion (FBC) is a commercial technology which combines steam generation with SO{sub 2 } control by burning coal in a circulating bed of limestone. The waste, chemically similar to LIMB waste, is produced by <b>bleed-off</b> of the bed material and by collection of the flue dust. All three processes produce a dry solid waste, which must either be used or disposed of and managed to ensure environmental compliance and economic feasibility.

The application of pas-sive methods allowed the detection of an aseismic transient of ap-proximately 35 days ’ duration that began with the onset of the reservoir stimulation. Peak deformation was reached some 15 days after the <b>bleed-off</b> and after the induced seismicity ceased. We resolved a significant increase in seismic velocities and a si-multaneous decorrelation of the noise correlation codawaveforms. The wavefield properties implied that the material response was monitored mainly in the sedimentary layer (< 2. 5 km) above the stimulated volume that was approximately 4. 5 km deep. We inverted the velocity-change and decorrelation data to estimate the spatial distribution of the medium changes. The resulting im-ages showed that the strong velocity variations and medium per-turbations were generally colocated with the lateral distribution of the induced seismicity. Positive velocity changes and damage around the injection site indicated subsidence, settling, and com-paction of the material overlying the stimulated volume. Our re-sults demonstrate that noise-based analysis tools can provide important observables that are complementary to results obtained with standard microseismicity tools. Passive monitoring and im-aging have the potential to mature into routinely applied observa-tion techniques that support reservoir management in a variety of geotechnical contexts, such as for mining, fluid injection, hy-draulic fracturing, nuclear waste management, and CO 2 storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{scale and}} {{magnitude}} of pressure perturbation and brine migration induced by geologic carbon sequestration is discussed assuming a full-scale deployment scenario in which enough CO{sub 2 } is captured and stored to make relevant contributions to global climate change mitigation. In this scenario, the volumetric rates and cumulative volumes of CO{sub 2 } injection would be comparable to or higher than those related to existing deep-subsurface injection and extraction activities, such as oil production. Large-scale pressure build-up {{in response to the}} injection may limit the dynamic storage capacity of suitable formations, because over-pressurization may fracture the caprock, may drive CO{sub 2 }/brine leakage through localized pathways, and may cause induced seismicity. On the other hand, laterally extensive sedimentary basins may be less affected by such limitations because (i) local pressure effects are moderated by pressure propagation and brine displacement into regions far away from the CO{sub 2 } storage domain; and (ii) diffuse and/or localized brine migration into overlying and underlying formations allows for pressure <b>bleed-off</b> in the vertical direction. A quick analytical estimate of the extent of pressure build-up induced by industrial-scale CO{sub 2 } storage projects is presented. Also discussed are pressure perturbation and attenuation effects simulated for two representative sedimentary basins in the USA: the laterally extensive Illinois Basin and the partially compartmentalized southern San Joaquin Basin in California. These studies show that the limiting effect of pressure build-up on dynamic storage capacity is not as significant as suggested by Ehlig-Economides and Economides, who considered closed systems without any attenuation effects...|$|E

To execute this flight regimen a highly reliable avionics system has been designed that includes three LN- 100 G Inertial Navigation System/Global Positioning System (INS/GPS) units as the primary navigation system for the X- 33. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) tested an INS/GPS system in real-time simulations to determine the ability of this navigation suite to meet the in flight and autonomous landing requirements of the X- 33 RLV. A total of sixty-one open loop tests were performed to characterize the navigation accuracy of the LN- 100 G.

This was achieved through the incorporation of new technologies, field data, numerical modeling and established theories in ground control analysis. All in all, {{a better understanding of}} the quasi-static behavior of underground coal mine roofs has been attained. Over the summer of 2010, the Department of Mining and Mineral Resource Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, in conjunction with Andy Hyett of YieldPoint Inc., Peabody and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), installed over one hundred and seventy instrumented extensometers, closure meters, shear-meters, passive rebar roof bolts, tension rebar roof bolts, and double lock rebar roof bolts at three coal mines. Two of the three coal mines were room-and-pillar mines and the other a longwall mine. Data was routinely collected over a nine-month period to analyze shearing, dilation, and axial bolt loading occurring within the rock mass, and entry closure occurring between the excavation hanging-wall and foot-wall. Based on bolt loadings, shear, axial behavior and statistical analysis, initial results indicate that active roof bolts do not show superior performance for the added cost. Active bolts seem to show no difference from passive bolts in the initial loading phase either, indicating that tension <b>bleed-off</b> is a concern soon after installation; however, this observation was not captured, as the data loggers were not intrinsically safe. Considering the modeling results, the trends in axial loading seem to be calibrated but the magnitudes are not. Computer modeling also shows the potential to accurately model in situ bolt performance; however, challenges remain in obtaining a good match between numerical modeling and field observations...|$|E

D.), School of Food Science, Washington State UniversityThe {{extraction}} into wine {{of selected}} phenolics as affected by season, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), fruit maturity, and selected maceration conditions was studied. Pomace recovery, color, and sensory aspects were also investigated. In {{addition to a}} control treatment (10 days of skin contact), the maceration techniques studied included extended maceration (EM, 30 days of skin contact) and <b>bleed-off</b> (i. e. saignée) applied to reduce must volume by 16 %. The influence of fruit maturity and ethanol were studied by producing wines from fruit with different sugar levels, and by artificially manipulating sugar levels before fermentation to generate different ethanol levels during maceration. Preparative HPLC fractionation of wine proanthocyanidins (PA) followed by HPLC-DAD-MS analysis was undertaken to determine PA distribution. Sensory properties were studied using Quantitative Flavor Profiling and Descriptive Analysis. Wines made from ripe fruit (ca. 24. 5 Brix) extracted 16 % of the available tannins (of which 79 % were seed-derived tannins) whereas in unripe fruit (ca. 20 Brix) this extraction was 12 % (76 % of seed-derived tannins). Ethanol differences as high as 2. 7 % v/v during maceration {{had no effect on}} tannin and anthocyanin extraction, or in the proportion of seed- and skin-derived tannins. Wines obtained from ripe fruit were characterized by attributes such as viscous mouthfeel, sweetness and fruit-derived aromas. Wines made from unripe fruit were characterized by attributes such as fresh vegetal, acidic and lower color saturation. Wine PA distribution followed a non-normal, Rayleigh-type distribution, with concentration peaks at mean degree of polymerization (mDP) 2 (22 to 27 % of total PA mass) and at mDP 6 - 7 (12 to 17 % of total PA mass). The overall effect of EM resulted in increased tannin extraction from seeds (73 to 80 % of seed-derived tannins), lower anthocyanin content, and decreased wine color saturation. This effect was independent of the maturity level and the EtOH concentration. EM increased astringency by 25 to 34 % relative to control wines, and either did not enhance aroma, or was found to decrease fruity aromas.

The toxic nature of the element, in all forms, together with its ability to shut-down large processing plants dictates a need for its accurate and precise measurement. The study which investigated the recovery of various mercury species, spiked into synthetic and real condensate samples using conventional and new digestion and/or extraction techniques showed recovery was dependent upon the speciation. Using the most efficient technique, L<cysteine with persulphate, recoveries of over 90 % were obtained for diphenyl mercury, ethyl and phenyl mercury chlorides and mercury chloride. The recovery of 15 % for the important dimethyl mercury species limits {{the use of this}} technique. A novel technique has been developed for the determination of total mercury in complex liquid hydrocarbons. Samples (up to 1. 0 ml) were vaporised (400 oC) and swept through a gold-coated silica trap maintained at 200 °C, which retained all mercury species and discarded the matrix. The trap when heated to 900 °C released the mercury for measurement by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS). The recoveries for eight mercury species spiked (10 to 50 ng ml into toluene and condensate were generally over 90 %. The instrumental limit of detection (LOD) was 11 pg. The total mercury content of gas condensates, gasolines and heavy oils were determined. Gas chromatograhy coupled, via a pyrolysis interface, with AF detection was able to determine mercury species in gas condensate, at picogram levels (LOD: 2. 5 to 7 pg) using a direct sample injection procedure. For a given column system the positive identification and quantification of up to eight mercury species was obtained. A maximum injector temperature of 125 oC was recommended, to avoid the conversion of species. Mass balance calculations show a strong correlation between the total mercury content and the sum of the lower dialkyl mercury species, for all condensate samples studied. Three commercially available mercury removal systems, A, B and C produced a reduction in the mercury content of hydrocarbon streams under pilot plant conditions. The two stage system, 'A', produced a minimum of 30 % conversion from organomercury to elemental mercury after the hydrogenation reaction in stage 1. While elemental mercury was adsorbed by the stage 2 reactor, the organomercury species were not removed. The single stage adsorber 'B' showed 100 % removal efficiency for three dialkyl mercury species in liquid hydrocarbon streams. The removal efficiency for adsorber 'C was species dependent.

40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} {{becoming}} an important clean energy source, however, the stimulation of a reservoir for an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is associated with seismic risk due to induced seismicity. Seismicity occurring due to the water injection at depth have to be well recorded and monitored. To mitigate the seismic risk of a damaging event, an appropriate alarm system {{needs to be in}} place for each individual experiment. In recent experiments, the so-called traffic-light alarm system, based on public response, local magnitude and peak ground velocity, was used. We aim to improve the pre-defined alarm system by introducing a probability-based approach; we retrospectively model the ongoing seismicity in real time with multiple statistical forecast models and then translate the forecast to seismic hazard in terms of probabilities of exceeding a ground motion intensity level. One class of models accounts for the water injection rate, the main parameter that can be controlled by the operators during an experiment. By translating the models into time-varying probabilities of exceeding various intensity levels, we provide tools which are well understood by the decision makers and can be used to determine thresholds non-exceedance during a reservoir stimulation; this, however, remains an entrepreneurial or political decision of the responsible project coordinators. We introduce forecast models based on the data set of an EGS experiment in the city of Basel. Between 2006 December 2 and 8, approximately 11 500 m 3 of water was injected into a 5 -km-deep well at high pressures. A six-sensor borehole array, was installed by the company Geothermal Explorers Limited (GEL) at depths between 300 and 2700 m around the well to monitor the induced seismicity. The network recorded approximately 11 200 events during the injection phase, more than 3500 of which were located. With the traffic-light system, actions where implemented after an ML 2. 7 event, the water injection was reduced and then stopped after another ML 2. 5 event. A few hours later, an earthquake with ML 3. 4, felt within the city, occurred, which led to <b>bleed-off</b> of the well. A risk study was later issued with the outcome that the experiment could not be resumed. We analyse the statistical features of the sequence and show that the sequence is well modelled with the Omori-Utsu law following the termination of water injection. Based on this model, the sequence will last 31 + 29 /− 14 years to reach the background level. We introduce statistical models based on Reasenberg and Jones and Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models, commonly used to model aftershock sequences. We compare and test different model setups to simulate the sequences, varying the number of fixed and free parameters. For one class of the ETAS models, we account for the flow rate at the injection borehole. We test the models against the observed data with standard likelihood tests and find the ETAS model accounting for the on flow rate to perform best. Such a model may in future serve as a valuable tool for designing probabilistic alarm systems for EGS experiment...|$|E
