40|$|M. Tech. (Environmental Health) Abstract: Bitumen {{is defined}} as black or dark brown {{material}} derived from distillation of crude oil. It contains small amounts of nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen and trace amounts of metals (Sabita, 2011). At solid state, bitumen does not present any health hazard. Bitumen is valuable to engineers, because it is strong, readily adhesive, waterproofing and durable material. It is mostly used in road construction and pipe manufacturing. During its manufacture, storage, transportation and use, <b>bitumen</b> is <b>heated,</b> giving off hydrocarbon emissions, to which workers may be exposed (Riley, 2004). When <b>bitumen</b> is <b>heated,</b> it releases fumes that employees can be exposed to when using it, thus the current study aimed to investigate the effects of bitumen exposure on the respiratory function of Rand Water employees at the Pipeline division; determine the level of exposure to employees; {{as well as the}} time it takes for employees to become exposed to <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen.</b> Bitumen is used in many applications; however 90 % is used as road paving material. Rand Water employees use bitumen at construction sites and fabrication shops to protect the outer layer of the pipe. The data was collected through the use of questionnaires and medical records. The results showed that 25 % of the employees suffered from respiratory-related illness, and the remaining 75 % did not report any respiratory problems. The findings also showed that there was no relationship between the years of exposure and the duration employees get exposed to bitumen, since some employees who used bitumen for more than ten years did not have respiratory problems. From the results, it can be concluded that {{there is little evidence that}} exposure to bitumen can have effects on the respiratory function of exposed employees. Even though the evidence is exploratory rather than comprehensive, good working practices still need to be considered when <b>heating</b> <b>bitumen</b> for commercial use. It was recommended that employers reduce their bitumen exposure to recommended level, and provide employees with proper PPE to protect them against chemicals released during <b>heating</b> of <b>bitumen...</b>|$|R

Determination of the required working thicknesses for different service requirements is however a complicated task in the product finishing field. A previous study has shown that Nigeria is blessed with abundant bitumen resources for sustained exploitation as common, economical and effective coat-inhibitors of steelwork corrosion in her economy. This paper presents a testdetermination of the expected range of working thicknesses of coatings with proper bitumens from the resources. Bitumen samples were harvested at three different critical bitumen resource sites in the country for the tests. 30 specimens of the steel were properly prepared. Coatings of different thicknesses were produced on the specimens by dipping a different pair of them in each <b>bitumen</b> sample <b>heated</b> to each of five different temperatures in the range of 170 – 230 O C and removing and cooling them to 38 O C-room-temperature. The thickness of each produced coating was properly determined with a micrometer through dimensional change before and after coating. Analysis of the overall obtained data shows that the average working thicknesses of coatings with any bitumens of comparable quality to the as-harvested from the resources using temperatures in the range will decrease with increase in temperature from about 1. 46 to 0. 81 mm respectively, and thicknesses of coatings with the separate bitumens using the same bath temperature will have minimal variations.

It was found that there is an optimum content of fibers for each sand-bitumen ratio, above which mastic cannot be heated any more. This optimum seems to coincide with the optimum electrical conductivity of the mixture shown in [1].

40|$|The reuse of {{recycled}} concrete aggregates in new hot-mix asphalt {{can be a}} more sustainable method of production, but these mixtures may need a heat treatment before compaction to improve their water sensitivity performance.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the effect of ageing on the stiffness of asphalt mixtures with different amounts {{of recycled}} concrete aggregates, before and after a heat treatment, which was analysed through the assessment of its bitumen properties. Moreover, this paper also aims to analyse whether the rolling thin-film oven test is able to simulate the ageing effect of the heat treatment. In the laboratory work, a paving grade bitumen B 50 / 70 has been used to produce asphalt mixtures with 0 % and 30 % recycled concrete aggregates, and the bitumen was later characterised (using penetration, softening point, dynamic viscosity and dynamic shear rheometer tests) in various situations, such as when using virgin bitumen, short-term aged bitumen, aged <b>bitumen</b> after <b>heat</b> treatment (simulated with 4 h of rolling thin-film oven test) and bitumen samples recovered from asphalt mixtures with different production mixes (0 % and 30 % recycled concrete aggregate) and heat treatment conditions (0 and 4 h of curing time in the oven). Based on the results obtained, it could be concluded that the ageing resulting from the heat treatment is the primary cause of the hot-mix asphalt's increased stiffness, while recycled concrete aggregate content has a small influence. Moreover, it could be concluded that when there is no curing time, the recycled concrete aggregate protects the bitumen against ageing. Additionally, it could be stated that the rolling thin-film test is able to adequately simulate the ageing effect of the heat treatment. Thus, this test is useful for determining the ageing suffered by the bitumen when the recycled concrete aggregate mixture is manufactured using a heat treatment.

40|$|Asphalt has an {{important}} share in the road construction {{as it is the}} major material used to build roads. Roads are assets to the society and an integral component {{in the development of a}} nation’s infrastructure. The production of asphalt and the different phases it goes through before it becomes a road have a massive impact on the environment. For the asphalt production bitumen binder is used. Bitumen is a complex mixture of organic compounds, primarily composed of high boiling point and high molecular weight hydrocarbons, whose molecules are combinations of the familiar petroleum structural building units. Its physical behavior can be explained by considering it a colloidal system whose properties are influenced by the interactions of various empirically defined generic compound classes. Bitumen overall composition depends on the composition of the crude petroleum oil from which it is obtained, as well as the techniques used to refine and process it. Bitumens are used to form produce for many applications, including the use of hot-mix, warm mix, reclaimed asphalt mixing in road construction and maintenance. At ambient temperatures bitumen is a stable, semi-solid substance and does not present any health risks. In road construction industry during manufacturing, storage, transportation and use <b>bitumen</b> is <b>heated</b> giving off hydrocarbon emissions, to which workers may be exposed. Bitumen emissions are complex and variable mixtures of inorganic particulate and organic compounds that include aliphatics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. In recent years there has been increasing interest in investigating the potential of bitumen emissions to cause health effects in exposed workers. Bitumen remains a focus for health effects research however, primarily due to the presence of small amounts of PAHs in the product and uncertainty about the associated health risks from exposure to emissions from hot bitumen. The bitumen industry is working closely with regulatory and scientific bodies to resolve remaining questions. Further studies are in progress, employing state of the art techniques, as Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), which should resolve finally the question whether exposure to bitumen emissions presents a cancer risk. In addition to the health effects research discussed has been active in promoting strategies to reduce worker exposure to emissions from hot bitumen work. Warm-mix asphalts are produced and placed at temperatures typically 10 - 40 °C lower that conventional rolled asphalt. With the decreased production temperature comes the additional benefit of reduced emissions from burning fuels, fumes, and odors generated at the plant and the paving site. Disadvantages of WMA are elevate costs and it is only about 3 to 8 years (depending on method) since the earliest WMA field tests were started and therefore its long-term performance is still unproven. Workers in road construction industry include asphalt plant workers, ground construction workers and road paving workers. These individuals can be exposed to a wide range of potentially hazardous substances emitted from hot bitumen. Modern road paving workers are typically exposed to 0. 1 to 2 mg/m 3 of bitumen fume which includes 10 to 200 ng/m 3 of benzo(a) pyrene. Information on determinants of other exposures in road construction is either absent or limited. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) historical cohort study of asphalt industry since 1993, evaluated in 2011 bitumen emissions as possible carcinogenic to humans during road paving. Bitumen fume exposures during asphalt plants or outdoor hot mix paving and surface dressing can be expected to be similar. This comparison can be confounded by presence on organic matter of non-bitumen origin. Exposure to PAH can be anticipated to be elevated, when coal tar is added to paving mixtures. There is also some evidence that the exposures have been higher in the past. However, misclassification of exposure in such grouping can be expected to be substantial and its magnitude and direction would be impossible to quantify. Assembling industrial hygiene measurements from various studies into a single database and obtaining access to unpublished data may help refine exposure assessment in road construction industry. Very little information is available regarding environmental exposure to asphalt emissions. Results from direct human exposure monitoring indicate that the physical character of asphalt emissions released to the atmosphere during paving operations is composed of mineral particulate matter and hydrocarbons, including higher molecular weight PAHs. Estimates of total atmospheric PAH emissions suggest that the contributions from the paving industry are very small. The PAHs that are released will primarily adsorb to airborne particulate matter. Some of these PAHs will be deposited in a few days, while some may remain in the atmosphere for several weeks. No information is available concerning the deposition of airborne asphalt emissions onto land. Various methods are used to monitor bitumen-derived vapors, aerosols and fumes from <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen.</b> The more conventional methods are Total Particulate Matter (TPM) or solvent soluble/organic particulate matter (e. g., Benzene-Soluble Matter (BSM)). Recently more often the amount of total organic matter (TOM) in both aerosol and vapor is determined. Different official methods for PAH analysis in bitumen fumes have been propose. Due to the existence of numerous structural isomers of the PAHs, chromatographic separation either by Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled with universal Flame Ionization Detection (FID), Mass Spectrometry (MS) or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with ultraviolet or Fluorescence Detection (FD) is generally employed for isomer-specific identification and quantification. At present, no international standard for the assessment of exposure to bitumen fume exists. As a result, reported values of exposures over time, between studies within the same country, and between the various countries vary significantly and must be considered carefully as to the intended use. In order to personal study of bitumen emissions, a special fume generation system has been developed to identify the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic compounds, emitted from different types of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) regarding two temperature regimes 300 °C and 500 °C. The ten types of heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and seventeen types of PAHs were identified and analyzed in this experiment. This study shows that increasing temperature leads to an increase of PAHs and heterocyclic aromatic compound emissions. Regarding the assessment of bitumen emissions as possible indicator of carcinogenic exposure, bitumen fumes generated at high temperatures (for 500 °C in our experiment) are more likely to generate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carcinogenic PAHs, Heterocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons than fumes generated at lower temperatures (for 300 °C in our experiment). However, from our results we can note that low temperature produces low emissions, but with higher percent of carcinogenic PAHs and benzene emissions of total emissions. This result seems quite surprising for us. The obtained results of Relative Carcinogenic Factor (RCF) show that decreasing of temperature leads to a decrease of RCF. Several studies have dealt with fumes from bitumen emissions, there was report that chemical composition of bitumen fumes varies and depends on crude petroleum sources, type of asphalt, temperature and mixing during the manufacturing process, unfortunately, we do not know the composition of RAP in this experiment, in that case we cannot give more well interpretation of fumes emitted from bitumen. We can just highlight that the temperature of <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen</b> is the key parameter in order to control the emission, and low temperature reduces the possible carcinogenic effect of <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen.</b> This study would be helpful to monitor health impacts of workers involved in road construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Bitumen fumes emitted during road paving and roofing contain {{polycyclic}} aromatic compounds (PACs) {{of potential}} health concern. Little information is available for an experimental device devoted to inhalation experiments with animals exposed to bitumen fumes, and in all studies the systems were never validated {{for a range of}} fume concentrations, which prohibited their use for toxicological concentration-effect studies. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to validate a new experimental device able to generate bitumen fumes at different total particulate matter (TPM) concentrations with a linear correlation between TPM and the concentrations of different PACs, thus allowing toxicological dose-response studies with fumes representative of those in the field. Atmosphere samples collected from an animal exposure chamber allowed the determination of TPM, toluene soluble matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and semi-volatiles. The particulate size distributions were determined in order to assess the deposition pattern in the respiratory tract. The temperature of 170 °C was chosen by analogy with the upper range of the temperature used during paving operations. The temperature of the air passing over the fume emission area was regulated to 20 °C and stirring of the <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen</b> was restricted to 90 r. p. m. The data show that the objective of developing a static fume generation system that reproducibly produces fumes in the inhalation chamber for specified target concentrations (TPM) were successful. The within-day variation coefficients for TPM were between 2. 5 and 6. 1 %. The day-to-day variations for TPM concentration were between 4. 1 and 5. 8 %. The concentrations of the 4 - 5 ring PAHs and the polycyclic aromatic sulphur heterocycles were proportional to the TPM concentration. The 2 and 3 ring PAH concentrations showed a deviation from proportionality with the TPM, probably due to their re-evaporation during sampling. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of airborne particles varied from 1. 4 µm at a fume concentration of 5 mg/m 3 to 3. 2 µm at 100 mg/m 3. In conclusion, this equipment was suitable for nose-only inhalation studies in the 5 - 100 mg/m 3 range of TPM.

6000|$|I {{have called}} it a stale {{expedient}} on Bernard Longueville's part to [...] "go to Europe" [...] again, like the most commonplace American; and it is certain that, as our young man stood and looked {{out of the window}} of his inn at Havre, an hour after his arrival at that sea-port, his adventure did not strike him as having any great freshness. He had no plans nor intentions; he had not even any very definite desires. He had felt the impulse to come back to Europe, and he had obeyed it; but now that he had arrived, his impulse seemed to have little more to say to him. He perceived it, indeed--mentally--in the attitude of a small street-boy playing upon his nose with that vulgar gesture which is supposed to represent the elation of successful fraud. There was a large blank wall before his window, painted a dirty yellow and much discolored by the weather; a broad patch of summer sunlight rested upon it and brought out the full vulgarity of its complexion. Bernard stared a while at this blank wall, which struck him in some degree as a symbol of his own present moral prospect. Then suddenly he turned away, with the declaration that, whatever truth there might be in symbolism, he, at any rate, had not come to Europe to spend the precious remnant of his youth in a malodorous Norman sea-port. The weather was very hot, and neither the hotel nor the town at large appeared to form an attractive sejour for persons of an irritable nostril. To go to Paris, however, was hardly more attractive than to remain at Havre, for Bernard had a lively vision of the <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen</b> and the glaring frontages of the French capital. But if a Norman town was close and dull, the Norman country was notoriously fresh and entertaining, and the next morning Bernard got into a caleche, with his luggage, and bade its proprietor drive him along the coast. Once he had begun to rumble through this charming landscape, he was in much better humor with his situation; the air was freshened by a breeze from the sea; the blooming country, without walls or fences, lay open to the traveller's eye; the grain-fields and copses were shimmering in the summer wind; the pink-faced cottages peeped through the ripening orchard-boughs, and the gray towers of the old churches were silvered by the morning-light of France.|$|R
40|$|During {{the service}} life of {{flexible}} asphalt pavements, asphalt concrete degrades due to traffic loading and environmental conditions like temperature, rain, oxidation, ultraviolet-radiation from the sun. All these environmental factors have {{adverse effects on}} the performance of bitumen, which is the binder of asphalt concrete. They are known to cause ageing and eventually lead to hardening of bitumen. As a result, ravelling (i. e. release of stones from asphalt concrete) and cracking are observed as main distress mechanisms in asphalt concrete. These distress phenomena reduce the life span of the asphalt pavement, necessitate frequent maintenance and eventually complete replacement of the asphalt. Innovative solutions with a focus on better binder properties can improve this situation. Bituminous materials with improved properties can make the rate of deterioration slower and may offer fast, efficient and cost effective repair methods. Self-healing is a desirable property in this respect, which can improve the service life as well as reduce the maintenance cost of the roads. Bitumen is self-healing by nature. Micro-cracks that occur in bitumen during service may heal at rest and the early stages of cracking are self-repairable. But the knowledge on the mechanism of damage, healing and also the fundamental properties of bitumen is inadequate. The aim of the thesis is to understand the phase-separation characteristics of bitumen at the microstructural level and their relation to damage and healing processes within the material. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been used to investigate the bitumen morphology, phase-separation and mechanical response properties at nano to micro meter length scale. From the AFM investigation, microstructure is found to be a unique fingerprint of the bitumen type. Typical bitumen microstructure possesses a two-phase morphology: the domains (i. e. bee-structures) and the matrix phase. Chemical composition of bitumen is the key parameter which influences the microstructure properties, while wax and asphaltene fractions are responsible for most of the structuring observed. The wax component has been found to induce the phase separation of bituminous materials. Temperature during construction of asphalt and its change during the service life influence the properties of bitumen to a great extent. Thus, the influence of environmental conditions like temperature, thermal history and humidity on bitumen microstructure have been investigated. From the temperature and thermal history study, hysteresis in microstructure properties of <b>bitumens</b> between <b>heating</b> and cooling cycles has been observed. The rate of cooling of the material influenced the microstructure properties. Besides, high humidity conditions can be detrimental to bitumen performance as it can introduce regions of heterogeneous properties within the material. The mechanical response properties of bitumen at the fundamental length scale have been investigated. The mechanical property maps of modulus and AFM probe-sample adhesion force of the individual phases of bitumen at the microstructural level are obtained using a special mode of AFM. The domains are found stiffer than the matrix phase, whereas the matrix phase has shown greater adhesion property. These individual phase properties have been used and a mechanics based approach has been followed to derive the composite modulus property of bitumen. With the change of temperature, changes in the mechanical properties of the individual phases and the subsequent composite response of the material are observed. Microstructural change at the onset of crack formation in bitumen has been probed during mechanical loading. After application of tensile load, micro-cracks or crazes tend to originate at the interface between the phases and localize in the domain phase- leading to a significant microstructural change. By allowing rest periods or moderate thermal changes, re-arrangement of the microstructures are observed; resulting in disappearance of cracks. The extent of blending between reclaimed binder and the fresh bitumen in the case of recycling of asphalt has been investigated. It is proposed that the degree of interaction between the binders depends on the temperature and the mixing time of the materials in the recycling process. During the process of ageing, bitumen is hardened and the adhesion property deteriorates. For service life extension of asphalt pavement, additives (i. e. rejuvenators) are used to improve the adhesion of the aged bitumen and to decrease the viscosity of the binder. This process of rejuvenation has been probed at the microstructural level. The addition of rejuvenators to the aged bitumen has shown property restoring performance from both the rheological data and microstructural properties of the binders. Understanding the micro-scale material properties can help to understand the long term macro-scale material response properties. The research presented in this thesis will guide {{to a better understanding of}} the material response in relation to both environmental and mechanical changes at microstructural level. The microscale assessment of bitumens is a step forward towards associating the observed structures with the material's mechanical response properties.

40|$|Heavy oil and {{tar sands}} are {{important}} hydrocarbon {{resources that are}} destined to play an increasingly {{important role in the}} oil supply of the world. A huge proportion of total world oil resources are in the form of these highly viscous fluids. The main recovery mechanism for these kinds of reservoirs is to somehow reduce their viscosity by the application of heat. In these extra heavy oil reservoirs, the reservoir has almost no injectivity, and therefore conventional steam flooding is hard to conduct. Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), however, reduces the viscosity of bitumen in place and the <b>heated</b> <b>bitumen</b> drains due to gravity forces towards the production well, where it is produced. Modeling and evaluating the production mechanisms in this process requires a thorough understanding of multi-phase flow parameters like relative permeability. Relative permeability data depend on a number of different parameters among others temperature and fluid viscosity. Viscosities of the flowing fluids drop with temperature, which can affect the relative permeability data. There has been a long debate on the actual impact of temperature on the relative permeabilities. Although some authors have reported saturation range shifts and relative permeability curve variations by temperature, others have attributed these variations to artifacts inherent in the methods used and the systems tested. Viscous instabilities and fingering issues have been blamed for temperature dependencies reported, and some researchers have reported that relative permeability data changes due to oil/water viscosity ratio changes at different temperatures. The variations in the experimental conditions have resulted in different and even contradictory results. There is specifically few experimental works conducted on Athabasca oil systems, and previously reported trends mainly apply to less viscous oils. This implies that the actual effect of temperature on flow behavior of fluids in the rock is case specific. Due to the contradictory reports and conclusions, which are due to variation in the systems being tested, it seemed necessary to conduct our own core flooding experiments, and investigate the curves of relative permeability. The objective was to obtain the imbibition relative permeability curves in an Athabasca oil type reservoir at different temperatures and oil viscosities, and figure out any possible trends of variations with temperature. Before conducting the core flooding experiments, some fluid behavior experiments were done to figure out the properties of bitumen used in this study. These include fluid compositions, density, viscosity, molecular weight and oil/steam interfacial tension. These properties were further used in numerical simulation studies. Core floodings were conducted on glass bead packs and sand packs saturated with heavy oils with varying viscosities. Displacement experiments with water were performed at different temperatures, and unsteady-state method of relative permeability measurement was conducted. The relative permeability data were determined by history matching the oil production data and pressure differential data in each experiment. Results indicated a change in the water saturation range in the oil-water relative permeability curves. The shift was towards higher water saturations, meaning an increase in irreducible water saturation and a decrease in residual oil saturation. Regarding the shape of relative permeability data, no unique trend of either rising or falling with temperature was found for oil and water relative permeability curves. The viscous instabilities are believed to be present in the experiments. As the same saturation range shift occurs by comparing the results at the same temperature level and by only changing the oil viscosity, this suggests that the temperature dependency of relative permeabilities {{can be attributed to the}} drop in oil to water viscosity ratio by temperature. The variations of relative permeability data with temperature was therefore found to be more related to artifacts in the experimental procedures like viscous fingering, and fluid viscosity changes than fundamental flow properties. Numerical simulations were accomplished on field scale SAGD and ES-SAGD (Expanding Solvent SAGD) operations testing the effect of relative permeability curves. Temperature dependent relative permeability data were tested and Oil production was found to be strongly dependant on the end point data. It is therefore suggested to use this option as a matching criterion when trying to history match SAGD field data. Since the main experimental part of this study deals with temperature dependency of relative permeability data, the introduction of this thesis is totally devoted to introducing this concept and its measurement methods and a literature review on the works performed so far. The main thesis is composed of three main parts, the fluid behavior experiments on bitumen, one-dimensional flow studies and multi-dimensional flow part. The results of fluid behavior experiments are given in chapter 2. Chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to one-dimensional flow works and chapters 5 and 6 present the part of this thesis dealing with two and three-dimensional flow. It should, however, be mentioned that chapters 4 to 6 can be read independently, as the contents of these chapters are taken from previously published papers with some minor revisions.
