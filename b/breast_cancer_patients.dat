A 2006 study compared two groups of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> at high risk for lymphedema in whom LVA was used to prevent the onset of clinically evident lymphedema. Results showed a statistically significant {{reduction in the number of}} patients who went on to develop clinically significant lymphedema. Other studies showed LVA surgeries reduce the severity of lymphedema in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> In particular, a clinical study of 1,000 cases of lymphedema treated with microsurgery from 1973 to 2006 showed beneficial results. Clinical reports from microsurgeons and physical therapists documented more than 1,500 patients treated with LVA surgery over a span of 30 years showing significant improvement and effectiveness.|$|E
30|$|Cancer antigen 15 - 3 (CA 15 - 3) {{has been}} {{utilized}} {{as a marker}} for <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> recurrence and therapeutic effect in <b>patients</b> with metastatic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> However, elevated CA 15 - 3 levels are also observed in other malignancies and nonmalignant diseases, although less frequently.

We encountered a case where an early <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> had an elevated CA 15 - 3 level due to pernicious anemia during the postoperative course.|$|R

25|$|The brand ties {{together}} fear of cancer, {{hope for}} early identification and successful treatment, {{and the moral}} goodness of women with breast cancer and anyone who visibly identifies themselves with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> This brand permits and even encourages people to substitute conscientious consumption and individual symbolic actions, like buying or wearing a pink ribbon, for concrete, practical results, such as collective political action aimed at discovering non-genetic causes of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|High mammographic breast density, {{which is}} a marker of {{increased}} risk of developing breast cancer, may not mean {{an increased risk of}} death among <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> according to a 2012 report of a study involving 9232 women by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

In a <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> who had undergone an excision or mastectomy with axillary clearance, a foreign body granuloma in the axilla may be misinterpreted as an axillary lymph node. We report our experience with a case of cotton-ball granuloma of the axilla in a <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patient,</b> which mimics a lymph node radiologically from the CT scan, mammogram and ultrasonography.

50|$|C8orf46 {{has been}} {{associated}} with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in humans. The gene has been researched in connection with estrogen receptor 1- enhancer (ESR1), whose expression determines if a <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> receives endocrine therapy.

30|$|However, our data, {{together}} with similar retrospective analyses conducted in daily care conditions, {{are consistent with}} the results observed in the registrative study EMBRACE, and support the use of eribulin in heavily pretreated metastatic <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patient.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{breast cancer}} CD44+CD24−/low cells are {{detectable}} in metastatic pleural effusions. By contrast, an {{increased number of}} CD24+ cells {{have been identified in}} distant metastases in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> It is possible that CD44+CD24−/low cells initially metastasize and in the new site change their phenotype and undergo limited differentiation. The two-phase expression pattern hypothesis proposes two forms of cancer stem cells - stationary (SCS) and mobile (MCS). SCS are embedded in tissue and persist in differentiated areas throughout tumor progression. MCS are located at the tumor-host interface. These cells are apparently derived from SCS through the acquisition of transient EMT (Figure 7).|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{is usually}} {{given for the}} {{probability}} of progression-free survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS). These predictions are based on experience with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> with similar classification. A prognosis is an estimate, as patients with the same classification will survive a different amount of time, and classifications are not always precise. Survival is usually calculated as an average number of months (or years) that 50% of patients survive, or the percentage of patients that are alive after 1, 5, 15, and 20 years. Prognosis is important for treatment decisions because patients with a good prognosis are usually offered less invasive treatments, such as lumpectomy and radiation or hormone therapy, while patients with poor prognosis are usually offered more aggressive treatment, such as more extensive mastectomy and one or more chemotherapy drugs.|$|E
25|$|Effective caregiving {{requires}} {{knowledge about}} how to support others, as well as sufficient cognitive and self-regulatory resources. For example, caregivers {{must be able to}} regulate the negative emotions aroused by witnessing another person in distress. Failure of this emotional regulation may lead the caregiver to become overcome by their personal distress, adopt the role of a needy person rather than the caregiver, or to distance him- or herself from the partner as a way of regulating that distress. Research shows that particularly severe or chronic stressors may overwhelm the caregiver and decrease his/her ability to provide support to the partner. For example, Bolger, Foster, Vinokur, and Ng (1996) found that <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> who experienced the highest levels of distress in the month immediately following their diagnosis were less likely to receive support from their husbands over the following six months.|$|E

30|$|The {{limitations}} of this study include its retrospective design and a relatively small sample size.

25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|When {{the patient}} is {{unsatisfied}} with {{the outcome of the}} augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants’ limited product life, it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. Common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, capsular contracture, shell rupture, and device deflation. Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the anatomical borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external radiation therapy. Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient’s pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3.0 per cent at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20 per cent at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E

The dataset was originally taken from one of Oncology Hospital in East Java, Indonesia, which consists of 1097 samples, 21 attributes and 2 classes.
