5000|$|Sliding <b>back</b> <b>band.</b> In a two-wheeled vehicle, {{the shafts}} are {{fixed to the}} vehicle to hold it level.

5000|$|Fixed back-band. In a four-wheeled vehicle, {{the shafts}} or pole {{must be allowed}} to hinge up and down, to allow the horse and vehicle to pass over {{hillocks}} and dips. Often the shafts are independently hinged, and on a side-slope these will each hinge to follow the horse, and a sliding <b>back</b> <b>band</b> is not needed. However, if a sliding <b>back</b> <b>band</b> was used with independent shafts it might allow one shaft to ride up higher than the other, and so for such shafts the back-band is normally fixed to the harness saddle. On other four-wheeled vehicles, the two shafts hinge together, and a sliding <b>back</b> <b>band</b> is needed as for two-wheeled vehicles.|$|R
5|$|In {{support of}} the album, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and Harvey Brooks from his studio crew and Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm, former members of Ronnie Hawkins's <b>backing</b> <b>band</b> the Hawks. On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an {{audience}} still annoyed by Dylan's electric sound. The band's reception on September 3 at the Hollywood Bowl was more favorable.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} music of both {{sessions}} for its free, relaxed sound, but the lyrics {{were considered to be}} simple compared with those of his previous work. Morrison had intended to record the album a cappella with only vocal backing by a vocal group he called the Street Choir, but the songs released on the album that included the choir also featured a <b>backing</b> <b>band.</b> Morrison was dissatisfied with additional vocalists to the original quintet that made up the choir, and these changes and others have led him to regard Street Choir poorly in later years.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many commending the band for making {{music with a}} darker tone. However, the album was criticized for lacking a stand-out lead single. Commercially, the album was not as successful as Flood (1990), peaking at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and spending only six weeks on that chart. In addition, some fans were upset that and Flansburgh and Linnell opted to use a <b>backing</b> <b>band</b> for the album's tour, with some even boycotting shows.|$|E

It is the follow-up to Hunt's 2006 album On the Jungle Floor and follows a period of label conflict and mainstream obscurity for Hunt.

5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live <b>backing</b> <b>band,</b> the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E

This tour included the band's first appearance at New York City's Madison Square Garden. Unlike other tours, this one featured a full <b>backing</b> <b>band.</b> Konesky and Spiker resumed their roles from the album, and Brooks Wackerman was added as drummer. Each member used a pseudonym; Konesky as the Antichrist, Spiker as Charlie Chaplin, and Wackerman as Colonel Sanders. JR Reed also toured as Satan. Black has said that the band lost money on the tour due to the cost of touring with a full band for the first time.|$|E
5|$|During the hiatus, the Loaded members {{continued}} to work on various projects.

50|$|The saddle {{is held in}} {{position}} by a girth strapped firmly around the heartgirth area of the horse. When traces are used, a <b>back</b> <b>band</b> runs through the saddle, joining at the sides to a loose strap under the belly, the 'belly band'; both attach to loops around the shafts or to a pole. The <b>back</b> <b>band</b> may be fixed {{or it may be}} free to slide through the saddle from side to side; it is normally fixed for a four-wheeled vehicle with independently hinged shafts, but sliding for a vehicle with rigid shafts (such as a two-wheeled cart). This allows the horse to twist in the shafts on a side-slope.|$|R
