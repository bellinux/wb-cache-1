5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the {{subsequent}} development of the Trafford Park industrial estate {{in the north of}} the town– the first planned industrial estate in the world– had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> work in the new industries at Trafford Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many {{opposition}} figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe {{was sentenced to death}} in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.|$|E
50|$|In February 1953 UIF and Viet Minh forces ambushed {{and killed}} the {{governor}} of Prey Veng.

5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence {{of money in the}} film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|The pink whipray is {{valuable}} to ecotourism at {{sites in the}} Maldives, French Polynesia, and elsewhere; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> food. The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray ecotourism by banning all exports of ray products in 1995. In 2005, stingray ecotourism at Moorea brought in over €500,000. However, a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism {{in the form of}} bite and impact injuries, stemming from artificially high ray density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pink whipray as Vulnerable overall. Although the species has a wide distribution that includes refuge regions with few conservation threats such as the population off northern Australia. By contrast the Southeast Asian population is heavily fished.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from the endeavor led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, eight percent of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area {{with the rest of the}} United States, established a truly national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region.|$|E

With these, partly by argument, {{but much more}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promises</b> <b>of</b> handsome pay for their exertions, Malchus established an understanding, and {{paved the way for}} a popular agitation among the working classes of the waterside in favour of Hannibal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The growing {{importance}} of exchanges and collaborations in all business areas calls for fast, efficient, and flexible models of computer-supported cooperation. As the traditionnal client-server paradigm is ham-pered by its structural limitations, {{the interest of}} the Information System Community is aroused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promises</b> <b>of</b> alternatives known as peer-to-peer approaches. This paper introduces a generic architecture, designed for the execution of collaborative business processes. Basic motivations of the model are discussed, as well as major contributions notably in terms of service-oriented routing and failure handling. ...|$|R
60|$|A {{marriage}} of policy it evidently was; for, unlike the generous love {{that had caused}} Malcolm to espouse the friendless exile Margaret, Henry was a perjured usurper, and dark stories were told of his conduct in Normandy. Christina strongly and vehemently opposed the marriage, as the greatest calamity that could befall her niece: she predicted that, if Edith persisted in it, only misery could arise from it; and when she found her determined, tried to prove her to be already bound <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promises</b> <b>of</b> a nun.|$|R
25|$|Despite his popularity, Wain {{suffered}} financial difficulty {{throughout his}} life. He remained responsible for supporting {{his mother and}} sisters, and had little business sense. Wain was modest, naive and easily exploited, ill-equipped for bargaining {{in the world of}} publishing. He often sold his drawings outright, retaining no rights over their reproduction. He was easily misled, and occasionally found himself duped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> a new invention or other money-making scheme.|$|E
25|$|In 1737 a fresh dispute arose {{among the}} Mughal officers. Momin Khan the Viceroy had his {{appointment}} cancelled {{in favour of}} Abhesingh's deputy Ratansingh Bhandari. Refusing to obey the second order, Momin Khan <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> half of the revenues of Gujarat and half of Ahmedabad, won Damaji Rao Gaekwad to his side, and bombarding the city, after a siege of some months, captured it in 1738.|$|E
25|$|A {{building}} boom in South Brooklyn started in about 1902 and 1903. Thousands of people started {{coming to the}} area from Manhattan and from other places. In 1905 and 1906 realty values increased by about 100 percent, and land values increased. This growth was spurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> improved transportation access.

25|$|A {{railway station}} was opened in 1903 {{a few hundred}} yards west of its current {{position}} and railway companies often ran excursions to the town, bringing people to marvel at the social experiment and sometimes to mock it: Letchworth's founding citizens, attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> a better life, were often caricatured by outsiders as idealistic and otherworldly. John Betjeman in his poems Group Life: Letchworth and Huxley Hall painted Letchworth people as earnest health freaks.|$|E
25|$|Bakunin {{thought that}} {{religion}} originated {{from the human}} ability for abstract thinking and fantasizing. According to Bakunin, religion is sustained by indoctrination and conformism. Another factor in the survival of religion is the existence of poverty, suffering and exploitation in real life, from which religion promises the salvation in the afterlife. Oppressors take advantage from religion, according to Bakunin, because many religious people reconcile themselves with injustice on earth <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> happiness in heaven.|$|E
25|$|Fueled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> {{increasing}} returns, {{competition in}} two-sided network industries can be fierce. Platform leaders can leverage their higher margins {{to invest more}} in R or lower their prices, driving out weaker rivals. As a result, mature two-sided network industries are usually dominated {{by a handful of}} large platforms, {{as is the case in}} the credit card industry. In extreme situations, such as PC operating systems, a single company emerges as the winner, taking almost all of the market.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} a neglected structural transformation in European finance: the growing importance of government debt as collateral for Europe's repo markets, where banks borrow cash against collateral. Seduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promises</b> <b>of</b> repo market-driven financial integration, the EU institutions and Member States encouraged private finance to generate its own architecture for the European repo {{market in the}} early years of the euro, sidelining known problems about systemic fragilities. These fragilities materialized after Lehman Brothers’ collapse and were exacerbated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ECB's collateral policies. The European sovereign debt crisis shows that governments, just like private asset issuers, can rapidly become vulnerable to repo pro-cyclicality and collateral crises...|$|R

50|$|In Europe, {{since the}} fall of the Iron Curtain, the former Eastern bloc {{countries}} such as Albania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine have been identified as the major source countries for trafficking of women and children. Young women and girls are often lured to wealthier countries <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promises</b> <b>of</b> money and work and then reduced to sexual slavery.It is estimated that two thirds of women trafficked for prostitution worldwide annually come from Eastern Europe and China, three-quarters of whom have never worked as prostitutes before.

25|$|The {{discipline}} {{and organization of}} a Roman legion made it a superb fighting unit. The Romans preferred infantry to cavalry because infantry could be trained to retain the formation in combat, while cavalry tended to scatter when faced with opposition. While a barbarian army could be raised and inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> plunder, the legions required a central government and taxation to pay for salaries, constant training, equipment, and food. The decline in agricultural and economic activity reduced the empire's taxable income and thus its ability to maintain a professional army to defend itself from external threats.|$|E

After the claimant filed for the land, they had gained full ownership {{after five years of}} residence or by paying $1.50 per acre within six months. Each claim was for 160 acres, a quarter section of free government land. The first to file a land patent was Micheal Pfeiffer on January 20, 1883, who claimed two sections of land he already resided on near and immediately north of the mouth of Sycamore Canyon. They had six more children later on.|$|E

He arrived in Jalalabad sometime between 1696 and 1703, and {{spent some time with}} Jalal Khan's family. During a birthday celebration, a fight broke out between Dost and one of Jalal Khan's sons, over one of the young housemaids.

The marriage probably took place in 1283, when Jeanne was still of child-bearing age.

In August 1876, Star and Bullock, attracted to Deadwood <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> a great deal of business stemming from the gold rush, purchased a lot there from Al Swearengen and Henry Beaman. They opened the Office of Star and Bullock, Auctioneers and Commission Merchants. They later partnered in livestock ranching as the S Ranch Company, and with Harris Franklin in the Deadwood Flouring Mill, in 1880, where Star was the general manager. The duo expanded their business interests to the towns of Spearfish, Sturgis, and Custer.|$|E
25|$|The Admiralty {{were not}} {{initially}} encouraging to Hawker's approaches, {{in part due}} {{the presence of the}} in-development jet-powered Supermarine Attacker aircraft. However, the service was intrigued by the long-range capability of the P.1040, as well as <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> <b>of</b> increased power from the Nene engine. Thus, in May 1946, the Naval Staff authorised the manufacture of three prototypes and a further test specimen, one of these being the original prototype internally ordered by Hawker, in accordance with Naval Specification N.7/46. Hawker quickly found their development focus for the type being divided between the navy's P.1046 and the general-purpose P.1040, which was still hoped to be viable as an RAF fighter. The P.1040 would lead to the eventual development of the land-based swept wing Hawker Hunter fighter. Swept wing versions (P.1052 and P.1081) were built and experience gained with these were instrumental in developing the design of the Hunter.|$|E
