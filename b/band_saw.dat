5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

5|$|In late 2007 {{following}} the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{went on a}} hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason. The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when they started to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band {{for a second time}} on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public. He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career. Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009; however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010. With Klinghoffer, the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> this as a new beginning and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, I'm with You. During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.|$|E

However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belt will actually break.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} and application of expensive, difficult to cut metals and metal alloys, the minimization of waste material for final operations has, together {{with the quality of}} the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> process, become more and more important. As the onset of chatter can have a very detrimental effect {{on the quality of the}} cut, on the quality of the resulting surface, and on process performance in general, the prompt detection of chatter is of high importance. In the paper a multisensory approach is investigated for chatter detection in the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> process. In the experiments steel workpieces of geometrically different profiles were used. Based on an analysis of the acquired signals of the cutting forces, machine vibrations and emitted sound, a method involving a set of features for the detection of chatter in a cutting regime has been defined. The proposed method is not affected by the workpiece geometry or the process parameters. Analysis of the individual features extracted from the various process signals has been performed for chatter and chatter-free <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> regime classification. The paper presents the results obtained using a cross-validation approach, and summarizes the most informative extracted features with respect to the various process signals...|$|R

25|$|The Pawnee {{were divided}} into two large groupings: the Skidi / Skiri-Federation living in the north and the South Bands (which were further divided into several villages).

As was typical of many Native American tribes, each <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> to its own. In response to pressures from the Spanish, French and Americans, as well as neighboring tribes, the Pawnee began to draw closer together.|$|E

Cover Girl became Cover Boy, and then became Loverboy in Dean's dream later that night. After being told by Dean about the dream the next morning, Reno agreed to try it out and it stuck.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{takes the}} large <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> machine GB 42500 H as the {{research}} object, and establishes the dynamics models of its various parts.

The paper also studies preliminarily the dynamic characteristics of the large <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> machine GB 42500 H. During the analysis, the models of the parts and the whole are established using the finite element method to optimize the structures of the parts and the whole. That has undoubtedly a very important significance for improving the dynamic performance for the new machine tool’s structure, increasing the processing accuracy, and shortening the development cycle and costs...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the results of}} the {{characterization}} of the chatter phenomenon in the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> process are presented. In particular, the influence of the cutting speed and of the distance between the cutting blade supports on chatter characteristics was investigated. In addition to the cutting forces, and emitted sound, the machine vibrations described by the measured acceleration signals were used to characterize the chatter. Based on an analysis of these signals, a hysteresis of the chatter onset and chatter die out cutting speeds was observed. The observed cutting speed hysteresis indicates that the chatter onset in <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> is caused by a Hopf-like bifurcation, and that cutting speed is a promising parameter for chatter control. Additionally, the strong effect on chatter characteristics of the distance between the cutting blade supports was experimentally confirmed...|$|R

Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US. In 1969 an edited version of [...] "Whole Lotta Love", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the Billboard chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity.
