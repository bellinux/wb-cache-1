5|$|When Indonesian forces {{crossed the}} border into Sebatik Island, Sabah on 28 June 1965, HMAS Yarra was called on to carry out bombardments disrupting the {{withdrawal}} of the Indonesians. Yarra carried out two more bombardments of the <b>border</b> <b>area</b> on 5 and 10 July. During three runs, Yarra fired a total of 70 rounds on the enemy. On 13 August 1966, an agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia brought an end to the conflict.|$|E
40|$|Border dispute of Indonesia {{is not a}} new thing. Since Indonesia got its sovereignty, border {{had been}} {{becoming}} an unsolved problem until now. A problem that frequently happens is bordered disputes with neighboring countries that have a direct border with Indonesia either land or water borders. In addition, the Indonesian government should pay more attention to problems related to the welfare of {{people who live in the}} border. Development and facilities such as education, health, transportation, information and so on should be adequate. The Indonesian government should pay more attention to the needs of people in <b>border</b> <b>areas,</b> therefore they are not segregated from the external world. In accordance with that perspective, this paper would like to identify how the special autonomy of <b>border</b> <b>areas</b> could become the alternative solution to settle disputes in <b>border</b> <b>areas.</b> Generally, poverty and backwardness of people in <b>border</b> <b>areas</b> are the lack of their social and economic accessibility. <b>Border</b> <b>areas</b> have an important function since the complexity of problem that being faced. <b>Border</b> <b>areas</b> should be treated as a front yard, not the back yard of Republic of Indonesia. The treatment for <b>border</b> <b>areas</b> should be differentiated in accordance with the situation and condition of those areas. Therefore, metric decentralization should become the mindset of policy-making related to the relationship between the center and the region, especially related to the <b>border</b> <b>areas</b> and that is not reactive because of the demand of the region. Special autonomy in <b>border</b> <b>areas</b> is an option solution which is worth to be considered, to solve the complex problems in the <b>border</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

5|$|Colder October and November weather limited aerial {{activities}} {{over the}} NDH. The Partisan operations spread to eastern Serbian territory and the squadrons based at Sarajevo airfield made their {{appearance on the}} Bosnian-Serbian <b>border</b> <b>area.</b> The Partisans were trying to secure and expand their territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, which they had liberated in the autumn of 1941. The ZNDH flew daily supply missions with their Avia-Fokker F.39 and due to the lack of other aircraft also used the venerable Breguets and Potez. These could land on hastily prepared strips and performed very well in airlifting supplies to the surrounded garrison of Višegrad.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to inflicting significant casualties on Indonesian forces, the successful Australian ambushes on the Sungei Koemba, and later at Kindau, in May and June allowed 3 RAR {{to dominate the}} <b>border</b> <b>area,</b> while also providing early warning of Indonesian incursions into Sarawak. Following these actions Major General George Lea, the British Director of Operations, ordered a short pause in offensive operations in order to observe the effects. Indonesian mortar attacks on company bases in the 3 RAR area of operation, which had been heavy throughout May and June, ceased soon afterwards. Following the resumption of Claret operations the Australian battalion later followed this up with another profitable mission at Babang on 12 July, contributing to the wider success of the British-Commonwealth forces in slowly asserting control on the war.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the <b>border</b> <b>area</b> of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E

The countries had been declared independent in 1965, but the communists rejected their separation. From 1968 to 1974, the armed struggle included planting booby trap bombs in public places. The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine, explosives and assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the <b>border</b> <b>area</b> of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand.|$|E

Today, mammals of note include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse, are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed <b>border</b> <b>area.</b> Other animals of note include, otter, stoat and weasel. The pine marten which has had the occasional sighting, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s.

5|$|The {{maritime}} boundary between Bosnia–Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999, {{but a few}} issues are still contested—the Klek peninsula and two islets in the <b>border</b> <b>area.</b> The Croatia–Montenegro {{maritime boundary}} is disputed in the Bay of Kotor, at the Prevlaka peninsula. The situation was exacerbated by the peninsula's occupation by the Yugoslav People's Army and later by the Serbian-Montenegrin army, which in turn {{was replaced by a}} United Nations observer mission that lasted until 2002. Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay, and the dispute has become far less contentious since the independence of Montenegro in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{short time}} after the 1888 Act, Worcestershire's {{northern}} external boundaries began to alter (See Fig 3). The district of Balsall Heath, which had originally constituted the most northerly part of the Parish of King's Norton, was the first area of the county {{to be added to}} the newly designated City of Birmingham on 1 October 1891. This was followed by the small island of Edvin Loach near Bromyard, which was transferred to Herefordshire in 1893. Two years following the loss of Edvin Loach, the county gained the parish of Upper Arley, which was a Staffordshire parish nearly surrounded by Worcestershire and Shropshire (See Fig 2). Oldberrow parish, which was situated in the north east Worcestershire <b>border</b> <b>area</b> was transferred to Warwickshire County Council jurisdiction during 1896.|$|E
5|$|A {{month before}} his capture, U.S. {{authorities}} had been passing down information to {{their counterparts in}} Mexico that Treviño Morales was making frequent visits to the Nuevo Laredo <b>border</b> <b>area</b> to see his newborn baby. They got this intelligence from wiretaps, conversations, and informants' tips. Treviño Morales was apprehended by the Mexican Marines in Anáhuac, Nuevo León, near the border of Tamaulipas state, at around 3:45 a.m. on 15 July 2013 without a single shot fired. The truck he was traveling in was intercepted on the road by a Black Hawk helicopter from the Navy; when the Marines got off the helicopter and tried to apprehend him, the capo attempted to escape by running through some bushes but was later caught. He was in possession of US$2 million ($25,316,100 MXN) in cash, eight weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition; two other men were arrested with him and taken into custody. Rumors of Treviño Morales's arrest and a mugshot of him in custody began to circulate through Twitter and other social media outlets around noon that day, but the Mexican government did not confirm the arrest, nor did the U.S. authorities receive a formal confirmation until hours later.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and his men}} {{rested in}} Texas for several months before {{returning}} to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the <b>border</b> <b>area,</b> Anderson led raids in Cooper and Johnson County, Missouri, robbing local residents. On June 12, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and robbing 12. After the attack, one of Anderson's guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in Southeast Jackson County, Anderson's group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce to declare that rebels {{had taken over the}} area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed hand signals to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{had been}} invaded by Libyan-based Italian forces in September 1940, but by February of the {{following}} year a British counter-offensive had advanced well into Libya, destroying the Italian Tenth Army in the process. British attention then shifted to Greece, which was under the threat of Axis invasion. While Allied divisions were being diverted from North Africa, the Italians reinforced their positions and were supported {{by the arrival of}} the German Afrika Korps under Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel. Rapidly taking the offensive against his distracted and over-stretched opponent, by April 1941 Rommel had driven the British and Commonwealth forces in Cyrenaica back across the Egyptian border. Although the battlefront now lay in the <b>border</b> <b>area,</b> the port city of Tobruk— inside Libya—had resisted the Axis advance, and its substantial Australian and British garrison constituted a significant threat to Rommel's lengthy supply chain. He therefore committed his main strength to besieging the city, leaving the front line only thinly held.|$|E
5|$|In 1124, {{just before}} the final conquest of the Liao dynasty, a group of Khitans led by Yelü Dashi fled {{northwest}} to the <b>border</b> <b>area</b> and military garrison of Kedun (Zhenzhou), in modern-day northern Mongolia. Yelü Dashi convinced the people there, around 20,000 Liao cavalry and their families, to follow him and attempt to restore the Liao dynasty. Yelü Dashi proclaimed himself emperor in 1131, after which he moved further west into modern Kazakhstan and then occupied the Karakhanid city of Balasaghun (in modern Kyrgyzstan). After a failed attempt in 1134 to reclaim the territory formerly held by the Liao, Dashi decided instead to stay where he was and establish a permanent Khitan state in Central Asia. The state, known as the Qara Khitai or the Western Liao dynasty, controlled several key trading cities, was multicultural, and showed evidence of religious tolerance. The state survived {{for nearly a century}} before being conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1218.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir John Macdonald, {{made plans}} to create a 200-strong mounted police force to {{maintain}} order along the border; such a force, he thought, would enable the colonisation {{of the region and}} be much cheaper than deploying regular military units for the task. The implementation of this proposal was delayed, however, first by the rebellion of the Métis, and then by the threat of a Fenian invasion. Meanwhile, a survey conducted in 1871 by Lieutenant William Butler recommended establishing a mounted force of up to 150 men under a magistrate or commissioner, based along the northern trade routes, leaving the <b>border</b> <b>area</b> as a liminal, ungarrisoned zone. Colonel Patrick Robertson-Ross conducted another survey in 1872, and recommended an alternate strategy of recruiting a larger force of 550 men who would be tasked to push south into the border region itself and establish law and order there.|$|E

5|$|Later in the year, the U.S. {{launched}} its most intense and sustained attempt to force North Vietnam into peace negotiations. Almost {{all of the}} targets on the Joint Chiefs' list had been authorized for attack, including airfields that had been previously off limits. Only central Hanoi, Haiphong, and the PRC <b>border</b> <b>area</b> remained prohibited from attack. A major {{effort was made to}} isolate the urban areas by downing bridges and attacking LOCs. Also struck were the Thai Nguyen steel complex (origin of the Pardo's Push), thermal and electrical power plants, ship and rail repair facilities, and warehouses. North Vietnamese MiGs entered the battle en masse, as their capital was threatened and kill ratios fell to one U.S. aircraft lost for every two MiGs. During 1968, MiGs accounted for 22 percent of the 184 American aircraft (75 Air Force, 59 Navy, and five Marine Corps) lost over the north. As a result, operations against the last of North Vietnam's airfields, previously off-limits to attack, were authorized.|$|E
5|$|Operation Leap2 {{began on}} 4 June with {{the advance of}} the HV 4thGuards Brigade. HVO troops took Crni Lug and the {{mountain}} pass en route to Bosansko Grahovo, the operation's chief objective. Its left flank, in the <b>border</b> <b>area,</b> was protected by the 3rdBattalion of the 126thHome Guard Regiment and the Tactical Sniper Company attached to the HV Split Corps. The VRS counterattacked on 6–7 June, trying to roll back the 4thGuards Brigade. The VRS push failed, as did its efforts to contain the advance with close air support and M-87 Orkan rockets. On 6 June (the same day as the VRS counterattack), {{the second phase of}} Operation Leap2 began. The 1stBattalion of the 1stGuards Brigade supported by the HV 264th Reconnaissance Sabotage Company and elements of the HV 1st HGZ advanced north from Livno, capturing the high ground near Glamoč and blocking the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road by 10 June. To pin down the VRS on the right flank of the attack, the HVO 2nd Guards Brigade attacked VRS positions on Golija Mountain south-west of Glamoč.|$|E
