This Gal antigen is widely expressed in other mammals and is present on an array of current animal derived biomedical devices including <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> There is growing interest in using Gal-free animal tissues from Gal knockout pigs (GTKO) as these tissues would not be affected by anti-Gal antibody mediated injury. In this study we compare the composition and biophysical characteristics of glutaraldehyde fixed porcine pericardium from standard and GTKO pigs. We show that {{with the exception of}} the Gal antigen which is only present in standard pig tissue both GTKO and standard pig tissue have the same general morphology and collagen content. Moreover uniaxial stress testing and suture retention testing indicate the tissues are equivalent in tensile strength. These studies indicate that genetic disruption of the α-galactosyltransferase (GGTA- 1) which blocks synthesis of the Gal antigen has no significant impact on the structural integrity of porcine pericardium and suggest that this tissue could be directly substituted for standard pig pericardium in biomedical devices such as <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> Statement of SignificanceSurgical <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement is a proven life saving therapy to treat <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> dysfunction due to birth defects, infection and the effects of aging. <b>Bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> (BHV) made from glutaraldehyde fixed animal tissues are an effective durable therapy in older patients (> 60 years) but exhibit age-dependent structural valve degeneration (SVD) in younger patients (< 60 years).

40|$|ObjectivesHuman {{subjects}} and Old World primates have {{high levels of}} antibody to galactose-α- 1, 3 galactose β- 1, 4 -N-acetylglucosamine (α-Gal). Commercially available <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> of porcine and bovine origin retain the Gal antigen despite current processing techniques. Gal-deficient pigs eliminate this xenoantigen. This study tests whether binding of human anti-Gal antibody effects calcification of wild-type and Gal-deficient glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine pericardium by using a standard subcutaneous implant model. MethodsExpression of α-Gal was characterized by lectin Griffonia simplicifolia–IB 4 staining. Glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardial disks from Gal-positive and Gal-deficient pigs were implanted into 12 -day-old Wistar rats and 1. 5 -kg rabbits with and without prelabeling with affinity-purified human anti-Gal antibody. Calcification of the implants was determined after 3 weeks by using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy. ResultsThe α-Gal antigen was detected in wild-type but not Gal-deficient porcine pericardium. Wild-type disks prelabeled with human anti-Gal antibody exhibited significantly greater calcification compared with that seen in antibody-free wild-type samples (mean ± standard error of the mean: 111 ± 8. 4 and 74 ± 9. 6 mg/g, respectively; P = . 01). In the presence of anti-Gal antibody, a significantly greater level of calcification was detected in wild-type compared with GTKO porcine pericardium (111 ± 8. 4 and 55 ± 11. 8 mg/g, respectively; P = . 005). Calcification of Gal-deficient pericardium was not affected by the presence of anti-Gal antibody (51 ± 9. 1 and 55 ± 11. 8 mg/g). ConclusionsIn this model anti-Gal antibody accelerates calcification of wild-type but not Gal-deficient glutaraldehyde-fixed pericardium. This study suggests that preformed anti-Gal antibody present in all patients might contribute to calcification of currently used <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> Gal-deficient pigs might become the preferred source for new, potentially calcium-resistant <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tissue {{degeneration}} and calcification {{are the two}} chief {{obstacles to}} the successful application of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> To enable {{the study of the}} durability of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> and the efficacy of anti-calcification treatment, it has become necessary to develop animal models. The aim {{of this study is to}} validate a new model for implantation in the pulmonary position. METHODS: Three juvenile sheep underwent implantation of Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves in the pulmonary position (experimental group). These three valves were compared with three Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valves in the aortic position in patients which had been explanted due to primary tissue failure (clinical group). The valves were analyzed. RESULTS: The findings of macroscopic, X-ray and light microscopic examination were very similar between the two groups. Scattered irregular calcification was seen near the commissures and at the base of the cusps in both groups. Quantitative calcium content analysis showed that calcification of the cusps had progressed to almost the same degree in both groups (experimental group, 3. 7 +/- 0. 2 micro g/mg dry tissue; clinical group, 4. 3 +/- 0. 3; p> 0. 05). In the experimental group, calcification in the commissural area of the cusp was pronounced (6. 5 +/- 1. 0). In the clinical group, calcification had also progressed in the commissural area of the cusp (6. 0 +/- 1. 5), and extended to the base area of the cusp (6. 6 +/- 1. 2). CONCLUSIONS: This model is promising for preclinical evaluation of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> The degree of calcification is not significantly different between our experimental results after three months of implantation in sheep and clinical results after 10 years of implantation in elderly patients. However, the pattern of calcification is somewhat different between the two groups. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} and compare the midterm outcomes of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement in terms of survival, valve-related events, quality of life, and economic aspects of treatment in population age 45 years and above in females and 48 years in males and their comparison with mechanical valve recipients. Materials and Methods: The patient population under age group of 45 – 60 years is randomly divided into two groups: One receiving bioprosthetic valves and other receiving mechanical valves. Patients were followed up and data are analyzed. Results: The overall 10 -year survival was similar in patients receiving <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> and mechanical heart valves. The incidence of major bleeding episodes was very high with mechanical valves (mitral valve replacement [MVR] = 14. 3 % and aortic valve replacement [AVR] = 7. 2 %) as compared to 0. 6 % and 0. 8 % with bioprosthetic MVR and AVR, respectively. About 1. 02 % of patients with tissue valves have episodes of thromboembolism versus 8. 3 % patients with mechanical valves. Acute valve thrombosis rates were high in mechanical valve (3. 1 % vs. 0. 0 %). Incidences of endocarditis were also more with mechanical valve replacement group (2. 3 % vs. 0. 3 %). The quality of life was also better in patients with bioprosthetic valves.

40|$|<b>Bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{replacements}} often calcify and fail, {{particularly when}} {{used to treat}} pediatric patients. Even recent advances in processing methods have been insufficient to completely address the risk of complications in the pediatric population. Fully synthetic tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV) replacements have been suggested as an ideal replacement, {{as they can be}} seeded with autologous cells to form a viable tissue that is capable of somatic growth and hemostasis. However, this technology is still in development, and will not be available to patients within a short (5 - 10 year) time period. In the interim, some studies have investigated coating methods for current valve replacements to try to improve their biocompatibility in the short term. However, many of these proposed mechanisms face many regulatory issues because of the processing steps involved. In this work, we investigated the characteristics of pediatric valvular interstitial cells (VICs) and their comparability to a potential surrogate cell source, dermal fibroblasts, for long-term TEHV development. We found that these cells behave similarly, particularly when cultured on collagen type I substrates. This study provides additional guidance for the development of TEHVs specifically for pediatric patients and expands current knowledge about pediatric VICs, a previously understudied cell population. The next studies focused on advancing short-term solutions for biocompatibility in <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacements. Due to the individual variability and difficulty analyzing bioprosthetic tissue, a model surface was developed to aid the optimization of surface coating methods for tissue valves. The bioprosthetic valve surface model (BVSM) was shown to have comparable surface mechanical properties, residual toxicity from glutaraldehyde fixation, and content of reactive groups for surface coating. Additionally, the BVSM was easy to construct, highly reproducible, and allowed for fine-tuning of the surface characteristics which could be altered for future studies of cellular interactions with the surface. In general, the BVSM developed in this work can be applied to optimize and analyze surface coating methods quickly and easily and to answer questions related to cell behavior in response to the surface coatings. Finally, the BVSM was applied in a final study to optimize our proposed two-step surface coating method for <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacements. This two-step coating method involves non-toxic, mild reactants and conditions which create a thin, polyethylene glycol (PEG) -based hydrogel coating on the surface. This coating can also include other molecules of interest without changes to the reaction protocol. Through the optimization on the BVSM, we demonstrated the formation of a thin, continuous surface coating that successfully repelled protein adsorption and did not significantly affect the BVSM surface mechanical properties. Based on this success, the coating method was translated directly to bioprosthetic tissue samples. Results showed areas of coating formation of the coating on the tissue, confirmed by both SEM and XPS analysis, and that the areal coverage of the coating could be improved with an increase in catalyst concentration. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this proposed coating method for modifying the surface of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> tissue, which could improve the biocompatibility of these devices. In future studies, this coating can be easily modified with molecules to encourage in situ endothelialization for even better hemocompatibility, particularly for pediatric patients. The cell characterization, optimization tools, and coating method developed here could lead to breakthroughs in current device biocompatibility and will support the long-term development of TEHVs as an ideal pediatric valve replacement...|$|E

We found regions of high stress concentration at the commissure near the stent tip and {{at the base of the}} leaflet cusp. The structural behaviour in the first region was complex, while the stress in the second region acted radially because of high bending. Although leaflet tissue anisotropy and stent stiffness exerted a significant influence on the structural and functional behaviours, they had a contrasting effect on leaflet stress state, coaptation and valve opening. Therefore, a good optimization should take into account both structural and functional requirements when tuning tissue properties and stent stiffness...|$|R

The indications for anticoagulation in patients with valvular heart disease are chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm with a very large left atrium, severe left ventricular dysfunction or presence of heart failure or a history of previous thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy is administered to prolong the prothrombin time to 1. 5 to 2. 0 times control, using rabbit brain thromboplastin (standardized international normalized ratio = 3. 0 to 4. 5).

Osteopontin expression correlated with cell accumulation (rho = 0. 58, P = 0. 04) and calcification (rho = 0. 52, P = 0. 06) for bioprosthetic valves. Osteocalcin expression correlated with calcification (rho = 0. 77, P = 0. 04) and cell accumulation (rho = 0. 69, P = 0. 07) in native valves. Comparisons of calcified versus noncalcified native and bioprosthetic valves for averaged total matrix protein mRNA signal score revealed increased noncollagenous proteins mRNA levels in calcified valves (P = 0. 07, group I vs. group II; P = 0. 02, group III vs. group IV).

Valvular function after viv-TAVI was excellent with respect to valve competence, but increased transvalvular gradients ≥ 20 mm Hg were noted in 44 % of patients. Vascular access complications occurred in 6 (13 %) patients, and 5 (11 %) patients required new pacemaker implantation after viv-TAVI. Renal failure requiring dialysis occurred in 4 (9 %) patients. Mortality at 30 days was 17 % (1 procedural and 7 post-procedural deaths), with 3 of 8 fatalities the result of non–valve-related septic complications. ConclusionsValve-in-valve TAVI can be performed with high technical success rates, acceptable post-procedural valvular function, and excellent functional improvement. However, in these predominantly elderly high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities, viv-TAVI was associated with 17 % mortality, often because of septic complications arising in the post-operative phase...|$|R

This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] examinations of the temporal bones of implanted human patients and experimental animals have demonstrated various degrees of abnormal fibrous tissue or new bone formation within the cochlea; in some cases, extensive new bone formation was reported. The presence of new bone following cochlear implantation is undesirable, since it may adversely affect current distributions in the electrically stimulated cochlea. The pathogenesis of intracochlear osteoneogenesis {{as a direct result of}} cochlear implantation is unclear. The aim of this study is to use an experimental animal model to investigate some of the factors underlying the formation of new bone and fibrous tissue within the implanted cochlea, especially the role of insertion trauma and bone chips, and also a possible way of inhibiting such a process using an anticalcific agent of the diphosphonate family, disodium ethane- 1 -hydroxy- 1, 1 -diphosphonate(EHDP). The local release of EHDP from a polydimethylsiloxane (Silastic silicone rubber, Dow Corning Corp) controlled delivery system has been shown effective in the context of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve.</b> Its application within the cochlea has not been documented, to our knowledge.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> (BPHV) degeneration, {{characterized}} by extracellular matrix deterioration, remod-eling, and calcification, {{is an important}} clinical problem ac-counting for thousands of surgeries annually. Here we re-port for the first time, {{in a series of}} in vitro accelerated fa-tigue studies (5 – 500 million cycles) with glutaraldehyde fixed porcine aortic valve bioprostheses, that the mechanical function of cardiac valve cusps caused progressive damage to the molecular structure of type I collagen as assessed by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR). The cyclic fatigue caused a progressive loss of helicity of the bioprosthetic cus-pal collagen, which was evident from FTIR spectral changes in the amide I carbonyl stretching region. Furthermore, car-diac valve fatigue in these studies also led to loss of gly-cosaminoglycans (GAGs) from the cuspal extracellular ma-trix. The GAG levels in glutaraldehyde crosslinked porcine aortic valve cusps were 65. 2 ± 8. 66 mg uronic acid/ 10 mg of dry weight for control and 7. 91 ± 1. 1 mg uronic acid/ 10 mg of dry weight for 10 – 300 million cycled cusps. Together, these molecular changes contribute to a significant gradual decrease in cuspal bending strength as documented in a biomechanical bending assay measuring three point defor-mation. We conclude that fatigue-induced damage to type I collagen and loss of GAGs are major contributing factors to material degeneration in bioprosthetic cardiac valve deterio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> {{tissue and}} {{associated}} calcification were studied {{in their natural}} state, using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Energy dispersive X-ray micro-analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the various calcific deposits observed with ESEM. The major elements present in calcified valves were also analyzed by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy. To better understand the precursor formation of the calcific deposits, results from the elemental analyses were statistically correlated. ESEM revealed the presence of four broad types of calcium phosphate crystal morphology. In addition, two main patterns of organization of calcific deposits were observed associated with the collagen fibres. Energy dispersive X-ray micro-analysis identified the crystals observed by ESEM as salts containing mainly calcium and phosphate with ratios from 1. 340 (possibly octacalcium phosphate, which has a Ca/P ratio of 1. 336) to 2. 045 (possibly hydroxyapatite with incorporation of carbonate and metal ion contaminants, such as silicon and magnesium, in the crystal lattice). Raman and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy also identified the presence of carbonate and the analyses showed spectral features very similar to a crystalline hydroxyapatite spectrum, also refuting the presence of precursor phases such as β-tricalcium phosphate, octacalcium phosphate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate. The {{results of this study}} raised the possibility of the presence of precursor phases associated with the early stages of calcification. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background Calcification is a {{frequent}} cause of the clinical failures of glutaraldehyde-pretreated <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> (BPHV) fabricated from glutaraldehyde-cross-linked porcine aortic valves. 2 -Amino oleic acid (AOA) {{has been shown in}} previous in vivo studies to be a promising anticalci-fication agent. Our objective was to investigate the mechanism of calcification inhibition mediated by AOA pretreatment of porcine aortic valve bioprostheses. Methods and Results BPHV tissues were treated with an AOA solution for 72 hours before experimentation. The diffusion of AOA across both cusp and aortic wall was evaluated. The lag time for AOA to diffuse across the aortic wall was prolonged compared with that of the cusp. An extraction study was performed to determine the stability of AOA binding; the results indicated that the binding wa...|$|R
40|$|Glutaraldehyde {{crosslinked}} bovine pericardium {{has been}} used for fabrication of <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> as well as cardiac patches for soft tissue repair. However, calcification and limited mechanical stability result in shortened life for the prostheses. Previous research has shown that glutaraldehyde crosslinking does not stabilize glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and that GAGs are lost from porcine <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> valves[1]. Bovine pericardial tissue is composed of an amorphous network of collagen and elastin fibers, proteoglycans, and GAGs. The GAGs of bovine pericardium include dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronan [2]. It is hypothesized that Glut does not stabilize GAGs in pericardium and loss of GAGs {{may play a role in}} the degenerative failure of pericardial valves. Also stabilizing GAGs in the extracellular matrix of the pericardial valves may improve their function and extend their life. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the structure of bovine pericardium and determine the contribution of GAGs to the structure and mechanical behavior of the tissue; 2) determine the effectivness of glutaraldehyd...|$|R
40|$|Pericardial <b>bioprosthetic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> were intro-duced into {{clinical}} practice more than 30 years ago (1). Unfortunately, the long-term results were initially dis-appointing, {{particularly with regard}} to the limited durability of the prosthesis (2, 3). Clinical use of the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial (CEp) valve started in 1981, and a variety of new techniques of valve con-struction and anti-calcification treatments were applied {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of prosthesis failure (4). Subsequently, very satisfying long-term results have been achieved during the past years with the CEp valve (5 - 7). The study aim was to report the long-term outcome, of up to 18 years, with the CEp aortic valve at two Italian hospitals.
