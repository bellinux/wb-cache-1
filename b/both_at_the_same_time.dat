5|$|The studio {{launched}} into {{the production of}} new animated features, {{the first of which}} was Pinocchio, released in February 1940. Pinocchio was not initially a box office success. The box office returns from the film's initial release were both below Snow Whites unprecedented success and the studio's expectations. Of the film's $2.289 million cost– twice of Snow White– Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film's final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. However, Pinocchio was a critical success, winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Best Original Score, making it the first film of the studio to win not only either Oscar, but <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|Endpoint Discovery and Abstraction: Audio {{devices are}} {{expressed}} in terms of audio endpoints such as microphones, speakers, headphones.

25|$|Controversies {{concerning}} {{gifted education}} are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon {{the appropriateness of}} the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'.

25|$|A {{well-known}} thought experiment {{predicts that}} if particle detectors are positioned at the slits, showing through which slit a photon goes, the interference pattern will disappear. This which-way experiment illustrates the complementarity principle that photons can behave as either particles or waves, but cannot be observed as <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|A waist {{covering}} should {{generally be}} worn {{as part of}} a black tie ensemble. Either a low cut waistcoat or cummerbund may be worn, but never <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> Although the English authority Debrett's consider that wearing a waistcoat is smart, they no longer consider either waist covering to be essential. The American authority, The Emily Post Institute, considers them to be an essential component of proper black tie attire. Waist coverings shouldn't be matched to wedding theme colours.|$|E
25|$|Monument {{consists}} of 300 multi-layered glass plates {{placed on the}} same level with the stone-paved waterfront {{in the shape of a}} 22-meter diameter circle. Beside the main (Sun) installation, looking from the west side, above the Sea organ, are placed similar smaller installations representing other planets of the solar system. Sheet size of the Sun and planets are proportional, as well as the distance from the center of each plate for themselves, but not <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> because the planet installations would have to be from a few hundred meters to several tens of kilometers away from the Sun. Beneath the glass are photo-voltage solar modules with lighting elements which turn on at night, and produce show of light.|$|E
25|$|The Communist radical {{of today}} will be the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Australian Red Ensign, {{is a red}} {{version of}} the Australian Flag and is a {{reserved}} civil ensign. From 1901 to 1954 the flag {{was used as a}} civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, while the government used the Blue Ensign, reflecting British practice. In 1941, Prime Minister Robert Menzies stated {{that there should be no}} restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister Ben Chifley reaffirmed this position, but it wasn't until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia. Pleasure craft may use either the Red Ensign or the national flag, but not <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

[...] Striations that line up are examined more closely, looking for multiple consecutive matches. There is no set number of consecutive matches that equates to a match declaration, and examiners are trained to use the phrase [...] "sufficient agreement" [...] when testifying. The degree to which an examiner can make that determination is based on their training and expertise. [...] All findings by examiners are subject to questioning by both sides, prosecution and defense, during testimony in court.|$|E
500|$|Like all {{elementary}} particles, photons {{are currently}} best explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality, exhibiting properties of both waves and [...] For example, a single photon may be refracted by a lens and exhibit wave interference with itself, {{and it can}} behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position or momentum, though not <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> [...] The photon's wave and quanta qualities are two observable aspects of a single phenomenon, and cannot be described by any mechanical model; a representation of this dual property of light, which assumes certain points on the wavefront to be {{the seat of the}} energy, is not possible. The quanta in a light wave cannot be spatially localized. [...] Some defined physical parameters of a photon are listed.|$|E

500|$|New {{developments}} in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced {{stage of the game}} but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed [...] "Pan-focus", as I have been active for two years in its development and used {{it for the first time}} in Citizen Kane. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.)</b> Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
