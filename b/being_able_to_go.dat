5|$|Towards {{the end of}} March 1801, Jean-François left Figeac for Grenoble, {{which he}} reached on the 27th of March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room flat on the rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was then working as an {{assistant}} in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet taught his brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may {{have been part of}} the source of Champollion's interest in Egypt, since as a young man he wanted to join Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Often known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-François was often called Champollion le Jeune (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-François' genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living, and supported Jean-François for most of his life.|$|E

The flight was a success as a reconnaissance flight with LaMountain <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> where he would. But on his return he was threatened by Union troops who could not identify him. His balloon was shot down, and LaMountain was treated harshly until he was clearly identified.|$|E

25|$|To attain such speeds, Lockheed Martin {{has been}} collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne since 2006 on an {{appropriate}} engine. The company is developing the system from the scramjet-powered HTV-3X, which was canceled in 2008. The SR-72 is envisioned with an air-breathing hypersonic propulsion system that {{has the ability to}} accelerate from standstill to Mach6.0 using the same engine, making it about twice as fast as the SR-71. The challenge is to design an engine to encompass the flight regimes of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Using turbine compression, turbojet engines can work at zero speed and usually perform best up to Mach 2.2. Ramjets, using aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly under Mach 0.5 and are most efficient around Mach 3, <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up to around Mach 6. The SR-71's specially designed engines converted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting the airflow around the core and into the afterburner for speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Finally, scramjets with supersonic combustion cover the range of high supersonic to hypersonic speeds. The SR-72 is to use a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) system to use a turbine engine at low speeds and a scramjet engine at high speeds. The turbine and ramjet engines share common inlet and nozzle, with different airflow paths in between.|$|E

She fired her management team and began attending Bible study classes five days a week; she also stopped doing interviews, watching television and listening to music.

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

500|$|When Monkey Punch began Lupin III, he {{was already}} working on another series, Pinky Punky. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both Lupin III and Pinky Punky made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this {{made it easy for}} him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as Columbo and Agatha Christie novels, and was also {{inspired}} by The Three Musketeers and the movies of Alfred Hitchcock. He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko are similar to the characters of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and describes them as [...] "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other". Another influence on the manga was Mad magazine. Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.|$|E
500|$|England {{lost the}} series 2–1. The Australians were heavily {{dependent}} on the bowling of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly. At the time, O'Reilly was regarded as the best bowler in the world, and among {{the greatest of all}} time, but Leyland began a spell of relative dominance over him. In the second Test, Leyland scored 109 and shared a partnership of 129 with Les Ames; in the next match, he hit 153 runs, sharing large partnerships with Patsy Hendren and Ames, and in the final Test, he played an innings of 110. However, the rest of the England batting was unreliable; reviewing the season, the Wisden editor Sydney Southerton wrote: [...] "In nearly every match either Hendren, Leyland or Ames, instead of <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in and play a free, confident game, had to save or remedy a position seriously damaged by the quick fall of two or three wickets." [...] In addition to his batting successes, Leyland was generally the best outfielder in the England team. He also scored three centuries for Yorkshire, another for the Rest of England against Lancashire, the Champion County, and 80 for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. With the ball, he took 33 first-class wickets. He was given a benefit match against Nottinghamshire; his benefit eventually raised £3,648, at the time the third highest amount raised for a Yorkshire player.|$|E
500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is dimensionally stable, thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure {{as well as to}} house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|E

He wanted [...] "Kaddish" [...] to [...] "literally be about resurrection". Ariel creates an imperfect reflection of her husband by crafting the Golem from mud. In essence, she is trying to play God, a role that Gordon later likened to Victor Frankenstein, the scientist from Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1823). However, Ariel and Frankenstein differ in the fact that Ariel's flaw was related to her [...] "loving [...] too much, not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> let <b>go,</b> because of the cruelty and injustice of what she suffered." [...] In this manner, Ariel's motivation for creating the Golem are [...] "slightly more romantically skewed".|$|R

50|$|Various {{durations}} {{are recommended}} for power naps, {{which are very}} short compared to regular sleep. The short duration of a power nap is designed to prevent nappers from sleeping so long that they enter a normal sleep cycle without <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> complete it. <b>Going</b> beyond sleep stages I and II but failing to complete a full sleep cycle can result in sleep inertia, a phenomenon where one feels groggy, disoriented, and even more sleepy than before beginning the nap.

Emma and Fletcher get into an argument regarding Emma's maniac behavior of sabotaging Liv's wedding and their friendship, including how Emma has changed since they first met. Emma and Fletcher are shown to undergo strains in their relationship because of Emma's new found opinionated and confident trait, a depart from her usual people-pleasing characteristics.

30|$|Previous {{studies showed}} {{a variety of}} {{barriers}} to participation in physical activity. Teasing {{was one of these}} major barriers (Slater and Tiggemann 2010). Other barriers included concern over the question of their heterosexuality for girls (Slater and Tiggemann 2010), fear of weight criticism (Jensen and Steele 2009), body image concerns (Slater and Tiggemann 2010), and differences in physical abilities (Wrontniak et al. 2006). In the current study, participants had a desire to quit because of athletic clothes. The likelihood of not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> either <b>go</b> through the same ordering process as others or a uniform being too revealing led to the desire to not play the physical activity in question. Results from this study indicate that clothing concerns including fit, uniform size and availability, and specific physical activity uniforms may be barriers to physical activity participation for overweight {{children between the ages of}} 9 – 14. This finding is unique in the degree to which clothing problems were found to be barriers to physical activity in these children. All of these findings related to clothing as a barrier to physical activity participation are significant because reduced physical activity behavior patterns that develop during childhood often continue into adulthood (Kjonniksen et al. 2008; Patnode et al. 2011).|$|R

2500|$|ABC interviewed {{forensic}} psychiatrist Dr. James Knoll {{for psychological}} {{perspective on the}} case and he answered viewers' questions via video on April 23, 2009, and via site comments on April 27, 2009. He stated that while most suicide notes focus on themes of remorse and the person not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on with life, the note supposedly written by Ashley was focused on taking the blame off of Castor. He said that this theme was repeated fourteen times within the note and that he believes Castor will never admit to guilt of the murders. The code of murderers such as these, he said, is [...] "deny, deny, deny" [...] until the bitter end. When asked if Castor's behavior and body language on the stand shows any sort of clue about her mental state and guilt, Knoll reminded that body language and behavior can be affected by events during a trial (such as [...] "side effects of medications, anxiety, fatigue and attorney instructions to the defendant on how to behave") and that their interpretation is not always reliable.|$|E
2500|$|A {{movie of}} the same name, based on the novel, was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in June 2006, starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. The film grossed $27.5 million in its opening weekend, amassing total U.S. sales of nearly $125 million and total worldwide sales of $326 million, {{making it one of}} the top-grossing films of summer 2006. The film departs from the book in several ways. For example, Andrea is a graduate of Northwestern University in the film, not Brown. [...] The film shows Miranda requesting Andrea go to Paris with her because Emily is unwell. The book, in further detail, has Emily catching mono, thus not <b>being</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with Miranda. Further, Lily, Andrea's best friend, is the main reason Andrea leaves Paris in the book. Lily is an alcoholic and gets into a car crash. Andrea has to decide whether to stay with Miranda or go to her friend. The movie does not include any of these details and ends with Andy and Miranda viewing one another with mutual respect. The book affords Andrea no such gratitude as she curses Miranda to her face and is consequently fired.|$|E
