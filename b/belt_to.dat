5|$|Bret Hart later {{claimed that}} during a {{conversation}} with Vince McMahon, {{he was told that}} Hulk Hogan refused to drop the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to him. However, Hulk Hogan stated that, during {{a conversation with}} Vince McMahon, a deal was made for Hogan to drop the <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> the top heel at the time, Yokozuna, at the following King of The Ring. All three men eventually wound up in a meeting, where McMahon outlined the plan to have Hogan drop the <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> Yokozuna and denied telling Bret that Hogan refused to drop the championship to him.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.

As a result, Hogan lost the <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E

After {{defeating}} Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania X, Ramon dropped the <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> Diesel, Michaels' bodyguard. A rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam 1994.

5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E

5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E
5|$|Eric Young got his TNA X Division Championship {{match on}} the November 13 episode of Impact! against then-champion Sheik Abdul Bashir. Though he {{defeated}} {{him to become}} the new champion, a week later the decision was reversed and Young was forced to relinquish the title <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> Bashir due to a controversial ending to their match. Young and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution, with referee Shane Sewell interfering in the bout like he had done in the previous encounter, which allowed Young to gain the victory. Afterwards, Management Director Jim Cornette stripped Young of the championship. This set up a tournament for the title, ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E

González Báez allegedly sold the <b>belts</b> <b>to</b> undercover FBI agents. He alleges that Durán authorized {{the sale of the}} five <b>belts</b> <b>to</b> him during a time that Durán was facing financial trouble. On September 23, 2003, a federal judge in Florida ordered the five <b>belts</b> returned <b>to</b> Durán.|$|R
5|$|Ishikawa {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Giants on April 24. After languishing in the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, {{with the return of}} <b>Belt</b> <b>to</b> first base and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite being a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts in left field, Ishikawa became the Giants starting left fielder during the 2014 postseason.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc then {{returned}} to Florida, where he was kept mainly in the singles division. In October 1983, he was put over Scott McGhee to win the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship for a second time. He dropped the <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> Barry Windham the following month. In a rematch with Windham the following night, LeDuc won the belt once again. His final reign as Florida Heavyweight Champion was short-lived, however, as the bookers had him drop the belt in a rematch with Windham the next night.|$|E
5|$|Mountains {{continued}} to rise in the Sevier orogenic <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E

5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her succeed in the competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|E
5|$|The WWF also {{planned a}} match {{featuring}} The British Bulldog defending the WWF Intercontinental Championship against The Mountie at Survivor Series. The WWF released Smith due to steroid allegations, however, {{and he was}} made to drop the title <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> Shawn Michaels on the November 14 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. Ultimately, the WWF neglected to include an Intercontinental Championship match on the card as Michaels was already scheduled to challenge Bret Hart for the WWF Championship at Survivor Series. In this match, Hart's title was defended while Michaels' title was not.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between {{the orbits of}} the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The {{asteroid belt}} is also termed the main asteroid belt or main <b>belt</b> <b>to</b> distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half {{the mass of the}} belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200km).|$|E
