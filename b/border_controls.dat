40|$|The {{question}} {{raised in}} the article is how the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme concerning the EU’s asylum and migration policy might consolidate existing trends within the European <b>border</b> <b>control</b> regime. The regime is defined {{by a combination of}} three features: (i) a harmonisation of categories among the EU/Schengen member states, (ii) a growing use of new technology in networked databases and (iii) an increasing sorting of individuals based on security concerns. Although none of these features is new, the combination gives a new impetus to the European <b>border</b> <b>control</b> regime. The article concludes that the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm programme consolidate and strengthen existing trends. This implies that policies on <b>border</b> <b>control,</b> asylum, immigration, judicial cooperation and police cooperation are consolidated in a broader approach to <b>border</b> <b>control,</b> {{and that there is a}} strengthening of EU foreign policy within the European <b>border</b> <b>control</b> regime. The boundaries between previously dispersed policy areas are blurred. The combination of different aspects of security and various levels of authority requires coordination of policies with substantially different goals, and goes beyond mere <b>border</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|MM - P&DMThis {{research}} report examines institutional change in South Africa, with {{particular attention to}} the vexed issue of <b>border</b> management. <b>Border</b> <b>control</b> in South Africa is the responsibility of a range of government departments and agencies with unique and often overlapping mandates. The status of lead agency in <b>border</b> <b>control</b> has vacillated between main <b>border</b> <b>control</b> agencies over the years. Leadership has been handed from the South African Police Service to the Department of Home Affairs and, in February 2007, to the South African Revenue Service. The lead agent has always been at the mercy of voluntary cooperation from the other departments and agencies responsible for <b>border</b> <b>control.</b> It does not have statutory powers to enforce cooperation, resulting in individual <b>border</b> <b>control</b> departments and agencies retreating to narrow mandates to avoid “interference” from “outside”. Due to strong principal-agent relationships among political and bureaucratic elites {{as a result of the}} ruling party’s cadre deployment strategy, very little real change has been achieved during the last sixteen years. The current stalemate will only be broken through strong leadership at the top. A scan of the various models for integrated <b>border</b> <b>control</b> shows a great diversity in approaches. Consistent with all transformation of border management, is the attempt to make a clean break with the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of a proliferation of agencies or departments responsible for <b>border</b> <b>control.</b> Government must decide on the type of model it intends to follow to transform <b>border</b> <b>control.</b> Critically, a change in legislation to enable the required institutional change might very well be the first step out of this impass...|$|R
5|$|The Norwegian Border Commissioner {{is located}} in Kirkenes and is {{responsible}} for managing the Norway–Russia border and upholding the border agreement. Special consideration is needed {{as it is the}} only non-Schengen Area land border of Norway. <b>Border</b> <b>controls</b> are the responsibility of the respective police district. The National Police Computing and Material Service is responsible for managing the police's information and communications technology, procurement, security and real estate. Norway has two joint rescue coordination centers, one for Northern Norway located in Bodø and on one for Southern Norway located in Sola. Their jurisdiction border goes at the 65th parallel north (Nord-Trøndelag–Nordland border). Organizationally they are directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police, although their operations are subordinate to the chiefs of police in Salten and Rogaland, respectively. The Police Security Service is Norway's security agency; although considered a law enforcement agency, it is not subordinate to the National Police Directorate nor part of the Norwegian Police Service.|$|E
5|$|Discussions about patrols {{remained}} complicated. Britain and France {{offered to}} replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers believed these patrols {{would be too}} partial. Germany and Italy requested that land controls be kept, and belligerent rights {{be given to the}} Nationalists, so that rights of search could be used by both the Republicans and Nationalists to replace naval patrols. The French considered abandoning <b>border</b> <b>controls,</b> or perhaps leaving non-intervention. However, the French were reliant on the British, who wished to continue with patrols. Britain and France thus continued to labour over non-intervention; whilst they judged it effective, some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July. The air route had not been covered. The Nationalists' debt to Germany reached 150 million Reichmarks. On 9 July, the Dutch Ambassador suggested that Britain draft a compromise. Lord Plymouth did, called the 'compromise plan for the control of non-intervention'. Naval patrols would be replaced by observers in ports and ships, land control measures would be resumed. Belligerent rights would only be granted when substantial progress was made on volunteer withdrawal. The French were furious, considering that Britain was moving towards Germany and Italy. Grandi demanded the discussion of belligerent rights before volunteer rights; Maisky insisted that volunteers be discussed first.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane <b>border</b> <b>controls.</b> Two further deaths of West Germans in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E

I conclude <b>border</b> <b>control</b> invades autonomy even if it is not coercive, and thus, democratic justifications are needed. Ultimately, I suggest that open borders should be encouraged because it is the better alternative to what is required of democratic justification for close borders...|$|R
