5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E
25|$|The vibraphone {{resembles the}} xylophone, marimba, and glockenspiel. Each bar is {{paired with a}} {{resonator}} tube that has a motor-driven <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> at its upper end. The valves are mounted on a common shaft, which produces a tremolo or vibrato effect while spinning. The vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to that on a piano. With the pedal up, the bars are all damped and produce a shortened sound. With the pedal down, they sound for several seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E

50|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> is {{actuated}} through hydraulic linkages. This {{consists of a}} hydraulic pressure pump which {{is connected to the}} <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve.</b> This pump controls the operation of <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> in following manner:When brakes are applied by the driver, the cylinder reduces its pressure so that the valve closes and restricts the path of exhaust gases. In this position the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> remains perpendicular to the flow of exhaust gases and thus creates back pressure on the engine. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> has one to three holes in it so {{that there is not a}} complete blockage of the exhaust pipe. This assures the avoidance of damage due to high pressure. When the brakes are released by the driver, the cylinder generates pressure so that <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> is opened and allows the exhaust gases to flow into the exhaust pipe. In this position the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> remains parallel to the path of exhaust gases and thus releases the pressure on the engine and allows its speed to increase.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the design testing of large (36 -inch diameter) <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> under high flow conditions. The two <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> were pneumatically operated air-open, air-shut valves (termed valves 1 and 2). These <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> were redesigned to improve their ability to function under high flow conditions. Concern was raised regarding the ability of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> to function as required with high flow-induced torque imposed on the valve discs during high steam flow conditions. High flow testing was required to address the flow-induced torque concerns. The valve testing was done using a heavily instrumented piping system. This test program was called the Large Scale Steam Valve Test (LSSVT). The LSSVT program demonstrated that the redesigned valves operated satisfactorily under high flow conditions...|$|R

50|$|The 1998 {{redesign}} of the KV6 by Rover Group under BMW included replacing the original metal inlet-manifolds and <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves,</b> with plastic units manufactured in Germany. The redesign also involved replacing the metal thermostat housing {{with a plastic}} unit. A costly but uncommon side-effect to using plastic components are breakages in the VIS (Variable Inlet System) <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> that are mounted inside the non-serviceable inlet manifold. The second common fault is failure of the thermostat housing (often failing along the mould line), {{that will lead to}} gradual but rarely complete loss of coolant. A third common fault is oil contamination in the VIS motors that are mounted {{on the sides of the}} inlet manifold and control air intake. Damage to the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> or VIS motors is limited to causing a rattling noise in the manifold or minor loss of power at certain engine conditions.|$|R
50|$|V-Boost is {{a system}} that opens <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> in the intake {{manifold}} between the 1st and 2nd and between the 3rd and 4th cylinders starting from 5,750 rpm. The valves are opened gradually to match the rising engine speed with a signal provided by the ignition system. The valves are at the full open position at 8,000 rpm. A small black box sends a computed signal to a servo motor that pulls a wire to open the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves.</b> The V-Boost system adds 10 percent to the top power rating of the base engine.|$|R

5000|$|To {{control the}} amount of fuel/air mix {{entering}} the engine, a simple <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> (throttle plate) is generally fitted {{at the start of}} the intake manifold (just below the carburetor in carbureted engines). The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> is simply a circular disc fitted on a spindle, fitting inside the pipe work. It is connected to the accelerator pedal of the car, and is set to be fully open when the pedal is fully depressed and fully closed when the pedal is released. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>valve</b> often contains a small [...] "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own idle jet.|$|E

50|$|There was {{a design}} flaw {{with the new}} 1.8 and 2.0 L petrol units with the <b>butterfly</b> <b>valves</b> in the inlet manifold, which could cause severe engine damage when they failed.
