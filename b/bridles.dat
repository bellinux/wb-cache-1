5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were <b>bridles</b> of various sorts, which were invented nearly {{as soon as the}} horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse Trigger. A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, <b>bridles,</b> and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and <b>bridles</b> for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E
25|$|A longeing cavesson may be {{used with}} or without a <b>bridle.</b> When used with a <b>bridle</b> {{containing}} a snaffle bit, the noseband of the <b>bridle</b> is removed, and the <b>bridle</b> goes over the longeing cavesson, to prevent pinching.

5|$|A set of iron carpenter's tools {{from the}} 3rd-4th century, {{including}} a compass for marking circles, {{was found in}} Przywóz, Wieluń County, {{where there was a}} Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex. The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot, with spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. The better off fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of the short and broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in sheaths, some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze <b>bridles</b> with chain reins. Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver belt buckle were recovered at the Aleksandrowice, Kraków County settlement area; some relics there are dated possibly as late as {{the first half of the}} 6th century.|$|E

50|$|Dryocalamus davisonii, {{commonly}} known as Blanford's <b>bridle</b> snake, is a species of harmless colubrid snake endemic to Asia. The Blanford <b>Bridle</b> snake is so named because its slim body resembles the <b>bridle</b> used to control horses.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bridle</b> path: {{a section}} of mane, just behind the ears, is {{frequently}} clipped or shaved off. For practical purposes, this allows the <b>bridle</b> to lie comfortably on the across the poll, makes it slightly easier to <b>bridle</b> the horse, as the mane and forelock are separated and easier {{to keep out of}} the way. The length of the <b>bridle</b> path varies by breed and region of the world: for example, the American Saddlebred and the Arabian are commonly shown in the United States with <b>bridle</b> paths that are several inches long, while other breeds (such as the Friesian horse) are not permitted to have any <b>bridle</b> path. In the UK and continental Europe, <b>bridle</b> paths are generally rather short if clipped at all, though there is variation depending on breed.|$|R

25|$|Hunters have meticulous turnout {{and tend}} toward very quiet, {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, <b>bridles,</b> crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while {{caring for their}} horses and grooming them well, are not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range of}} equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout always is preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E

25|$|A type of <b>bridle</b> {{that carries}} two bits, a bradoon and a curb, and is ridden with {{two sets of}} reins is called a Weymouth or double <b>bridle,</b> after the {{customary}} use of the Weymouth-style curb bit in a double <b>bridle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>bridled</b> nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata), {{also known}} as the <b>bridled</b> nail-tailed wallaby, <b>bridled</b> nailtail wallaby, <b>bridled</b> wallaby, merrin, and flashjack, is a {{vulnerable}} species of macropod. It is a small wallaby found in three isolated areas in Queensland, Australia, and whose population is declining. The total population of the species is currently estimated to be less than 1,100 mature individuals in the wild.|$|R
5000|$|Halter <b>bridle,</b> {{also known}} as a [...] "trail bridle" [...] or [...] "endurance" [...] <b>bridle,</b> this design is a halter with {{additional}} quick release cheekpieces that hold a bit and reins. They are an alternative to using a bitted <b>bridle</b> over the top of a halter. During rest stops, instead of removing the <b>bridle,</b> the rider only needs to remove the bit and reins. Variations of this <b>bridle</b> are used by the Australian Light Horse, the Household Cavalry, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and some other mounted police units.|$|R
25|$|It {{consists}} of a bar that is held {{in place in the}} wearer's mouth by straps or other devices. Unlike the metal bit that is most common in horse <b>bridles,</b> the bar of a bit gag is usually a soft rubber cylinder. It is not very effective in preventing speech, unless combined with mouth stuffing, although it will make it somewhat more difficult for the wearer to produce coherent speech. Occasionally, reins are attached. Because of the possibility of injury to the lips, the bit gag is not suitable for rough play.|$|E
25|$|Perforated antler objects {{discovered}} at Dereivka and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo {{have been identified}} as cheekpieces or ‘’psalia’’ for horse bits. This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions. However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth rawhide thongs, and rawhide thongs might have been used to manufacture of rawhide cords and ropes, useful for horse tack. Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the thongs were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tack—bits, <b>bridles,</b> cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gear—are the antler disk-shaped cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites.|$|E
25|$|Horses were {{central to}} Cuman culture {{and way of}} life, and their main {{activity}} was animal husbandry. The knight, Robert de Clari, described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, furriery, shoe making, saddle making, bow making, and clothes making. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the <b>bridles</b> of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. They could go on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning. Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when {{they ran out of}} water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare's milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location).|$|E

50|$|Rogallo wing kites control pitch with a <b>bridle</b> {{that sets}} the wing's angle of attack. A <b>bridle</b> made of string is usually a loop {{reaching}} from the front {{to the end of}} the center strut of the A-frame. The user ties knots (usually a girth hitch) in the <b>bridle</b> to set the angle of attack. Mass-produced rogallo kites use a <b>bridle</b> that's a triangle of plastic film, with one edge heat-sealed to the central strut.|$|R
50|$|For {{all other}} breeds, {{only part of}} the mane is trimmed. This area, called the <b>bridle</b> path (the area of the mane just behind the horse's ears, where the <b>bridle</b> lies {{across the top of the}} horse's head), is often trimmed farther down the neck than in other {{disciplines}} in order to show off the clean throatlatch, length, and elegance of the horse's neck. While most show horses in the United States have a short <b>bridle</b> path (a <b>bridle</b> path less than six inches long or equal in length to the height of the horse's ear is a common rule of thumb), saddle seat horses often have a <b>bridle</b> path 8 to 12 inches long, depending on current fashion. There are variations in <b>bridle</b> path lengths: Arabian horse exhibitors are particularly prone to shaving extremely long <b>bridle</b> paths, while exhibitors of American Saddlebreds less so, and Morgan horse exhibitors typically fall in the middle.|$|R
500|$|There was {{a variety}} of {{headgear}} used to control horses, predominantly <b>bridles</b> with assorted designs of bits. [...] Many of the bits used during the Middle Ages resemble the bradoon, snaffle bit and curb bit that are still in common use today. [...] However, they often were decorated to a greater degree: [...] the bit rings or shanks were frequently covered with large, ornamental [...] "bosses." [...] Some designs were also more extreme and severe than those used today.The curb bit was known during the classical period, but was not generally used during the Middle Ages until the mid-14th century. [...] Some styles of snaffle bit used during the Middle Ages had the lower cheek extended, {{in the manner of}} the modern half-cheek or full cheek snaffle. Until the late 13th century, <b>bridles</b> generally had a single pair of reins; after this period it became more common for knights to use two sets of reins, {{similar to that of the}} modern double bridle, and often at least one set was decorated.|$|E
500|$|As {{the hosts}} sweep westward across Mide, Fer Loga hides in the heather and leaps into the chariot of Conchobar as it passes, seizing the king's head from behind.

[...] A year later, {{at the end of the}} tale, Fer Loga rides westward across Ath Luain with two of Conchobar's horses and golden <b>bridles</b> for them both.|$|E
