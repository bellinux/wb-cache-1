500|$|The {{voyage to}} Europe {{remained}} eventful. In the Indian Ocean Caesar caught fire and was almost destroyed, and after stopping at Cape Town, the Indiaman visited St Helena, where Amherst, Maxwell {{and the other}} officers {{were introduced to the}} former French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, then a prisoner on the island. At the meeting Bonaparte recalled Maxwell's conduct in the action of November 1811 and commended him on his victory, saying [...] "Vous êtes très méchant. Eh bien! Your government must not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the loss of the Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates".|$|E
500|$|Ternate {{returned}} to Batavia with the castaways, where Amherst chartered the ship Caesar {{for the journey}} to England. During a stop at St Helena, Maxwell met Napoleon, who remembered the action on 29 November 1811 when Alceste had captured La Pomone, and remarked, [...] "...your government must not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the loss of Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates." [...] The requisite court martial exonerated Maxwell, his officers, and his crew {{of the loss of}} Alceste. Maxwell received much praise for his actions, and £1500 from the East India Company. He was knighted in 1818.|$|E
500|$|In France, {{the action}} had more {{significant}} consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon {{was a serious}} blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his attention on Russia. In the French Navy, the flight of Pauline was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command. In 1817, when Murray Maxwell visited St Helena on his return from the East Indies where HMS Alceste had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words [...] "Your government must not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the loss of Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates".|$|E

500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, but if we are badly off we must <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies." ...|$|E

[...] "I do not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> wanting me dead," [...] said [...] [...] "But if you kill us, people will lose their taste for food. They will never know the pleasure of cooking and eating. But if we live, they will continue to plant seeds and harvest crops, and they will remain skilled hunters." [...] After hearing these words, Monster Slayer returned without a trophy.|$|E
