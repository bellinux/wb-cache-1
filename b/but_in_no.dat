5|$|According to the Florentine Ambassador, one of {{the guards}} of the conclave, as of 10 August there had been three {{unsuccessful}} ballots, favoring Costa and Carafa, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way indicating Borja might be chosen. According to Sigismondo de' Conti, papal secretary and chronicler, the vote was unanimous on the fourth ballot, taken early in the morning on 11 August although Borja had only 15 votes prior to the accessus; other accounts say Borja received all the votes except for his own, which he gave to Carafa.|$|E

The party was strongest in the West and South, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> state did Weaver receive more than 12% of the vote, and his nationwide total was just 3%. That figure represented {{an improvement over}} the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{homosexual}} {{activities from}} time to time {{came to the attention of}} the authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E

Injury to Archie MacLaren resulted in Denton's elevation to the Test team in July 1905, to play against Australia at Headingley, Leeds, but he {{failed to make the}} most of his opportunity and was dismissed for 0 and 12, being dropped from the team immediately thereafter. He was recalled for the tour to South Africa that winter, and played in all five Tests. He made just one fifty in ten innings, and was again dropped from the side, but nevertheless played five more matches for England on a second and final tour of South Africa, in 1909/10.

500|$|The maximum {{practical}} {{number of}} oar ranks a ship could have logistically was three (Greek and Latin tri-).

[...] Indeed, just because a ship was designated with a larger type number did not mean it necessarily had or operated all three possible ranks: the quadrireme may have been a simple evolution of a standard trireme, but with two rowers on the top oar; it may also have been a bireme with two men on each oar; or it may just have had a single rank with four men on a each single oar. [...] Classes of ship could differ in their configuration between regions and over time, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> case did a [...] "four" [...] ship have four horizontal ranks of oars.|$|E
500|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} {{that this type of}} preservation was possible only when sediments were not disturbed by burrowing animals or the anchors of plants.

This suggests that such bioturbation {{has little to do with}} the appearance and disappearance of Burgess Shale type preservation. Such preservation may depend on the presence of clay-like minerals that inhibit decomposition, and ocean chemistry may only have favoured the production of such minerals for limited periods of time. If so, it is impossible to be sure when the animals known as [...] "Burgess Shale fauna" [...] first appeared or when they became extinct. A few fossils of animals similar to those found in the Burgess Shale have been found in rocks from the Silurian, Ordovician and Early Devonian periods, in other words up to 100million years after the Burgess Shale.|$|E
