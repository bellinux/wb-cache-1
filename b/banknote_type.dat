25|$|The first Reichsmark {{banknotes}} {{were introduced}} by the Reichsbank and state banks {{such as those of}} Bavaria, Saxony and Baden. The first Reichsbank issue of 1924 came in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 1000 Reichsmark. This was followed by a second issue in the same denominations, dated between 1929 and 1936. A 20 Reichsmark note was introduced in 1939, using a design taken from an unissued Austrian 100 schilling <b>banknote</b> <b>type.</b> Five Reichsmark notes were issued in 1942. Throughout this period, the Rentenbank also issued banknotes denominated in Rentenmark, mostly in low denominations.|$|E

40|$|Banknote {{papers are}} {{automatically}} recognized and classified in various machines, such as vending machines, {{automatic teller machines}} (ATM), and banknote-counting machines. Previous studies on automatic classification of banknotes {{have been based on}} the optical characteristics of banknote papers. On each banknote image, there are regions more distinguishable than others in terms of <b>banknote</b> <b>types,</b> sides, and directions. However, there has been little previous research on banknote recognition that has addressed the selection of distinguishable areas. To overcome this problem, we propose a method for recognizing banknotes by selecting more discriminative regions based on similarity mapping, using images captured by a one-dimensional visible light line sensor. Experimental results with various <b>types</b> of <b>banknote</b> databases show that our proposed method outperforms previous methods...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the interrelation correlation of electrophysical properties of different currencies banknotes samples and there detioration stage. Research of the parameters such as surface and volume resistance, capacitance and {{dielectric loss tangent}} for three <b>banknote</b> currency <b>types</b> carried out. <b>Banknotes</b> electrical circuits for measuring of these indicators are shown. Research results show that electrophysical properties are a measure of degradation of banknotes. The most sensitive indicators identified. Perspective of using electrophysical properties of banknotes for evaluating of their deterioration was presented. ? ?????? ????????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????????? ????? ? ??????? ?? ??????. ????????? ???????????? ??????????, ?????, ??? ????????????? ? ???????? ?????????????, ??????? ? ??????? ???? ??????????????? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ????? ?????. ?????????? ???????????? ??????????, ??? ????????????????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ???????. ?????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????????????? ??????? ??????? ? ????? ?????? ??????? ?? ??????...|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{requirement}} sets the minimum reserves each bank must hold to demand deposits and <b>banknotes.</b> This <b>type</b> of regulation {{has lost the}} role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum reserve ratio. The purpose of minimum reserve ratios is liquidity rather than safety. An example of {{a country with a}} contemporary minimum reserve ratio is Hong Kong, where banks are required to maintain 25% of their liabilities that are due on demand or within 1 month as qualifying liquefiable assets.|$|R
500|$|The {{paper money}} of Zimbabwe were {{physical}} forms of Zimbabwe's four incarnations {{of the dollar}} ($ or Z$) from 1980 to 2009. The banknotes of the first dollar replaced those of the Rhodesian dollar at par in 1980 following the proclamation of independence. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued most of the <b>banknotes</b> and other <b>types</b> of currency notes in its history, including the Bearer cheques and Agro cheques ("Agro" [...] being short for Agricultural) that circulated between 15 September 2003 and 31 December 2008: the Standard Chartered Bank also issued their own emergency cheques from 2003 to 2004.|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) chemical imaging {{allows the}} collection of fingerprint images from backgrounds that have traditionally posed problems for conventional fingerprint detection methods. In this work, the suitability of this technique for the imaging of fingerprints on {{a wider range of}} difficult surfaces (including polymer <b>banknotes,</b> various <b>types</b> of paper, and aluminum drink cans) has been tested. For each new surface, a systematic methodology was employed to optimize settings such as spectral resolution, number of scans, and pixel aggregation in order to reduce collection time and file-size without compromising spatial resolution {{and the quality of the}} final fingerprint image. The imaging of cyanoacrylate-fumed fingerprints on polymer banknotes has been improved, with shorter collection times for larger image areas. One-month-old fingerprints on polymer banknotes have been successfully fumed and imaged. It was also found that FTIR chemical imaging gives high quality images of cyanoacrylate-fumed fingerprints on aluminum drink cans, regardless of the printed background. Although visible and UV light sources do not yield fingerprint images of the same quality on difficult, nonporous backgrounds, in many cases they can be used to locate a fingerprint prior to higher quality imaging by the FTIR technique. Attempts to acquire FTIR images of fingerprints on paper-based porous surfaces that had been treated with established reagents such as ninhydrin were all unsuccessful due to the swamping effect of the cellulose constituents of the paper...|$|R
