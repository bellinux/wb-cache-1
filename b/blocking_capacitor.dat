25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the output circuit, and its harmonics were leaking to the output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> and a controlling potentiometer between {{the output of the}} preamplifier and the earth, and shunted the preamplifier when triggered. In this scheme, the control signal did not leak to the output. Modulation depth was regulated by a low-impedance potentiometer placed on the front panel. The potentiometer significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus the preamplifier had to have reserves by amplification.|$|E
2500|$|Variable {{resistors}} {{can also}} degrade {{in a different}} manner, typically involving poor contact between the wiper and {{the body of the}} resistance. This may be due to dirt or corrosion and is typically perceived as [...] "crackling" [...] as the contact resistance fluctuates; this is especially noticed as the device is adjusted. This is similar to crackling caused by poor contact in switches, and like switches, potentiometers are to some extent self-cleaning: running the wiper across the resistance may improve the contact. Potentiometers which are seldom adjusted, especially in dirty or harsh environments, are most likely to develop this problem. When self-cleaning of the contact is insufficient, improvement can usually be obtained through the use of contact cleaner (also known as [...] "tuner cleaner") spray. The crackling noise associated with turning the shaft of a dirty potentiometer in an audio circuit (such as the volume control) is greatly accentuated when an undesired DC voltage is present, often indicating the failure of a DC <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> in the circuit.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the use of}} a {{varicap diode}} in a circuit {{requires}} connecting it to a tuned circuit, usually in parallel with any existing capacitance or inductance. Because a DC voltage must be applied reverse bias across the varicap to alter its capacitance, this must be blocked from entering the tuned circuit. This is accomplished by placing a DC <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> with a capacitance about 100 times greater than the maximum capacitance of the varicap diode in series with it and applying the DC from a high impedance source to the node between the varicap cathode and the <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> as shown in the upper left hand diagram, right.|$|E

50|$|A bias tee is used {{to insert}} DC power into an AC signal to power remote antenna {{amplifiers}} or other devices. It is usually positioned at {{the receiving end of}} the coaxial cable to pass DC power from an external source to the coaxial cable running to powered device. A bias “T” consists of a feed inductor to deliver DC to a connector on the device side and a <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> to keep DC from passing through to the receiver. The RF signal is connected directly from one connector to the other with only the <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> in series. The internal blocking diode prevents damage to the bias “T” if reverse supply voltage is applied.|$|E
50|$|Since two {{amplifiers}} {{are being}} used in opposite polarity, using the same power supply, {{there is no need}} for the use of a DC <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> between the amplifier and the load. This saves cost & space, and there is no power reduction at low frequency due to the capacitor.|$|E
50|$|A second circuit {{using two}} {{back-to-back}} (anode-to-anode), series-connected varicap diodes (shown lower-left in the image) is another common configuration. The second varicap effectively replaces the <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{in the first}} circuit. This reduces the overall capacitance and the capacitance range by half, but possesses the advantage of reducing the AC component of voltage across each device and symmetrical distortion should the AC component possess enough amplitude to bias the varicaps into forward conduction.|$|E
40|$|AIGaN/GaN HEMTs have {{attracted}} considerable interest as power devices in microwave applications, promising greater than a tenfold increase in power-density {{as compared with}} GaAs devices. Similarly, Ba,Srl.,TiOs (BST) thin films have been investigated for microwave circuit application because of their high dielectric constants, high tunability, relatively low loss, and fast switching speed. BST-based varactors are especially attractive for high-power RF circuits since they can sustain relatively large AC fields at low average DC fields, unlike diode technologies. Additionally, due to its high dielectric constant, BST {{is a candidate for}} very compact MMIC DC <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitors,</b> promising a 100 -fold reduction in capacitor area as compared,with SiN and Si 02 capacitors.

5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|R
50|$|Since no {{significant}} DC current flows in the varicap, {{the value of}} the resistor connecting its cathode back to the DC control voltage can be somewhere in the range of 22 kΩ to 150 kΩ and the <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> somewhere in the range of 5-100 nF. Sometimes, with very high-Q tuned circuits, an inductor is placed in series with the resistor to increase the source impedance of the control voltage so as not to load the tuned circuit and decrease its Q.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} the {{amplifier}} may be direct-coupled to the load, coupled by a transformer, or connected through a dc <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor.</b> Where {{both positive and negative}} power supplies are used, the load can be returned to the midpoint (ground) of the power supplies. A transformer allows a single polarity power supply to be used, but limits the low-frequency response of the amplifier.

5000|$|In electronics, direct {{coupling}} or DC coupling (also called conductive coupling) is {{the transfer of}} electrical energy by means of physical contact via a conductive medium, in contrast to inductive coupling and capacitive coupling. It {{is a way of}} interconnecting two circuits such that, in addition to transferring the AC signal (or information), the [...] also provides DC bias to the next. Thus, {{there is no need for}} a DC <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> to be used in order to interconnect the circuits.

50|$|Many mixer boards have {{a switch}} for turning phantom power on or off; in most {{high-end}} equipment {{this can be}} done individually by channel, or on smaller mixers all mic channels can be either on or off, also {{this can be done}} in groups in most mid-range boards and some smaller ones. If it is desired to disconnect phantom power from one channel only, this can be done by using a 1:1 isolation transformer or <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.|$|R

50|$|R-C coupled {{coupling}} is {{the most}} widely used method of coupling in multistage amplifiers. In this case the Resistance R is the resistor connected at the collector terminal and the capacitor C is connected in between the amplifiers.

50|$|After {{couple of}} years in service the radio might become {{insensitive}} to narrow-band FM signals {{as it has been}} reported by several users. Broadcast range FM reception and transmitting on all bands is not affected. This is usually caused by failure of one (or both) ceramic filters marked LTM450FW. The unit can be sent to the manufacturer or authorized service center for repairs, but skilled users reported successful repairs by replacing the filter(s) with same or equivalent part. Since design of the intermediate frequency path is similar to other VX-series radios, the failure mode is common with other models.

50|$|Most of {{the shield}} effect in coax results from {{opposing}} currents {{in the center}} conductor and shield creating opposite magnetic fields that cancel, and thus do not radiate. The same effect helps ladder line. However, ladder line is extremely sensitive to surrounding metal objects, which can enter the fields before they completely cancel. Coax does not have this problem, since the field is enclosed in the shield. However, {{it is still possible}} for a field to form between the shield and other connected objects, such as the antenna the coax feeds. The current formed by the field between the antenna and the coax shield would flow {{in the same direction as}} the current in the center conductor, and thus not be canceled. Energy would radiate from the coax itself, affecting the radiation pattern of the antenna. With sufficient power this could be a hazard to people near the cable. A properly placed and properly sized balun can prevent common mode radiation in coax. An isolating transformer or <b>blocking</b> <b>capacitor</b> can be used to couple a coaxial cable to equipment, where it is desirable to pass radio-frequency signals but to block direct current or low-frequency power.|$|E
