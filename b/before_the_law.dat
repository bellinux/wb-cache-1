5|$|Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore {{guarantees}} to all persons equality <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and {{equal protection of}} the law. The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications – religion, race, descent and place of birth – upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons. For example, discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.|$|E
25|$|Critics often talk of The Castle and The Trial in concert, {{highlighting}} {{the struggle of}} the protagonist against a bureaucratic system and standing <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law's</b> door unable to enter as in {{the parable of the}} priest in The Trial.|$|R

5|$|Congress overrode a Johnson veto to {{pass the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also {{introduced}} by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary.

5|$|The {{ideas that}} {{underpin}} our modern world–meritocracy, equality <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on–were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon.

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> to be punished. Much about the tower has changed.

5|$|As the war {{turned against}} the Austrians, the {{garrison}} in Bologna left {{early in the morning}} on 12 June 1859. By the end of the same day the papal colours flying in the squares had been replaced with the Italian green, white and red, the cardinal legate had left the city, and a group styling itself Bologna's provisional government had proclaimed its desire to join the Kingdom of Sardinia. Bologna was promptly incorporated as part of the province of Romagna. The Archbishop Michele Viale-Prelà attempted to persuade the citizenry not to co-operate with the new civil authorities, but had little success. One of the new order's first official acts was to introduce freedom of religion and make all citizens equal <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> In November 1859 the governor Luigi Carlo Farini issued a proclamation abolishing the inquisition.|$|E
5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{developed}} by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831. It guaranteed individual liberty, property rights, freedom of religion and the press, and equality <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Because of its perceived balance between freedom and rule of law, it was praised by liberals {{around the world and}} promoted as a model for future constitutions. Under the new constitution, Belgium had two chambers, a Chamber of Representatives and Senate, both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens. The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs, but was given little independent power in any other sphere, which was instead given to the elected chambers.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|While in government, Disraeli {{presided over}} a series of social reforms which {{supported}} his one-nation politics and aimed to create a benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between employers and employees, the result of which prompted Richard Cross to pass the Employers and Workmen Act of 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and the breach of contract a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act {{in the same year}} which enshrined the right to strike of workers by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers' group could not be indicted as conspiracy.|$|E

50|$|University of Florida criminologist Alex Piquero, who {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} legislation in 2006, noted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's joint anti-crime programs with local law enforcement, such as Operation T.H.U.G.S., along with the “use a gun and you’re done” public service announcement campaign. He also noted that the overall crime rate had been declining <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>law's</b> passage. Contrary to the FDC and FPC, Piquero stated that the drop in state crime since <b>the</b> <b>law's</b> passage was more likely attributable to the national decline in crime over the same time period.|$|R
