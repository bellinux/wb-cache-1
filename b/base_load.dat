25|$|Electricity demand {{can also}} be {{separated}} as <b>base</b> <b>load</b> and peak demand. <b>Base</b> <b>load</b> refers to constant, or unvarying, demand for electricity. In Ontario, <b>base</b> <b>load</b> amounts to approximately 13,000 MW and is met by nuclear and hydroelectric power. These supply options generally have low operating costs. Nuclear stations are limited in their capability to rapidly change their output. Hydroelectric stations can rapidly change their output and are typically used to adjust grid supply to match instantaneous demand.|$|E
25|$|Peak demand {{refers to}} fluctuating, or varying, needs for {{electricity}} {{above and beyond}} <b>base</b> <b>load</b> levels. Added to this <b>base</b> <b>load,</b> the peak load raises Ontario's maximum electricity demand to 27,000 MW. This peak is typically met by oil/natural gas-fired, coal and select hydro-electric power plants. These plants can respond to changes in demand rapidly, but have higher operating costs.|$|E

There are three more video games in the <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> NES series, <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II: Second Season, <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> 3 and <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> 4. There was also a Game Boy version of <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded.</b> The series continued onto the SNES platform with Super <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded,</b> Super <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> 2, and Super <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> 3. The final entry to the series was <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> '96: Double Header, released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II: Second Season, {{known in}} Japan as Moero!! Pro Yakyū '88 Kettei Ban (Burn!! Pro Baseball '88 Decision Version), is {{a video game}} for the Nintendo Entertainment System {{released}} in 1988. It is the sequel to <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> and is continued by <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> 3. As opposed to the original, <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II (and the sequels) was developed directly for Nintendo's consoles and never saw an arcade version. The game is the second installment of the <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> series. The game was novelized by Peter Lerangis, {{as part of the}} Worlds of Power series published by Scholastic Books.|$|R

25|$|Immediately {{above the}} {{downstream}} {{side of the}} dam is the Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station, a hydroelectric power plant using pumped storage to accommodate peak electrical load by storing potential energy in water pumped into an upper reservoir. It uses <b>base</b> <b>load</b> electricity, then reclaims that energy when needed by allowing the water to fall back down and drive generators along the way.|$|E
25|$|The OPA {{has been}} {{directed}} {{by the government to}} use nuclear energy to meet the <b>base</b> <b>load</b> of energy demand in Ontario, but that nuclear generation capacity should not exceed 14,000 MW. The result is that nuclear is projected to make up approximately 37% of generation capacity in Ontario and produce 50% of the power in 2025, similar to its role in the current supply mix.|$|E
25|$|The Tracy Thermal Generating Station {{was one of}} four {{peaking power}} plants on the Hydro-Québec grid. It was {{primarily}} used in winter to boost capacity, as required by the widespread use of electric heating and poor home insulation in Quebec. It was also sporadically operated as a <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power plant between 1989 and 1991, in 1998 and in 2003-2004 to mitigate low water conditions in the company's reservoirs.|$|E

In addition, one of Hawaii's pitchers is named Ho.), there are several noteworthy changes. One new feature was the [...] "biorhythm" [...] concept; players in the game had [...] "biorhythms" [...] that could be monitored to ensure optimal performance. <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II had a little faster play action than the original game, and the point of view once a ball was hit into play was also different. In <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> the view was from behind home plate, whereas in <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II the view was either from the first-base line if the home team was at bat, or from the third-base line if the visiting team was at bat.|$|R
25|$|British Energy {{bought the}} 2,000 MWe Eggborough coal fired station from National Power in 2000 {{to provide a}} more {{flexible}} power production facility and reduce penalty charge risks from the New Electricity Trading Arrangements introduced in March 2001. Despite this, the new arrangements led to a significantly lower electricity price for inflexible <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power stations such as British Energy had. The purchase of Eggborough occurred {{at the peak of the}} market for power stations, and in 2002 the value of the station was written down by half.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat engine}} gives greater {{efficiency}} when {{run with a}} large temperature difference. In the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the tropics, although still a modest 20 to 25°C. It is therefore in the tropics that OTEC offers the greatest possibilities. OTEC {{has the potential to}} offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other ocean energy options such as wave power. OTEC plants can operate continuously providing a <b>base</b> <b>load</b> supply for an electrical power generation system.|$|E

These devices, although consuming electricity, will transfer a heat output three to six {{times larger than the}} amount of electricity consumed. An example of a district system using a heat pump to source heat from raw sewage is in Oslo, Norway that has a heat output of 18 MW(thermal).|$|E

25|$|The {{displaced}} dispatchable generation {{could be}} coal, natural gas, biofuels, nuclear, geothermal or conventional hydro. Rather than starting and stopping nuclear or geothermal it is effective {{to use them}} as constant <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power, when that power is not needed it can displace heating fuels or be converted to storage for later use. Biofuels and hydro can be saved for later when intermittents are not generating power. Alternatives to burning coal and natural gas with the production of greenhouse gases may eventually make them a stranded asset that is left in the ground. Highly integrated grids favor flexibility and performance over cost, resulting in more plant capacity and lower capacity factors.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{water was}} {{originally}} obtained from Wascana Lake {{and later the}} Boggy Creek reservoir {{north of the city}} and supplemented by wells, however by the 1940s this was proving inadequate to meet the city's water supply needs. Today, drinking water is supplied from Buffalo Pound Lake in the Qu'Appelle Valley, an artificial reservoir on the Qu'Appelle River, since 1967 with water diverted into it from Lake Diefenbaker behind the Gardiner Dam on the South Saskatchewan River. Electricity is provided by SaskPower, a provincial Crown corporation which maintains a province-wide grid with power generated from coal-fired <b>base</b> <b>load,</b> natural gas-fired, hydroelectric and wind power facilities.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{marginal}} {{cost of electricity}} varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators. At one extreme, <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power plants such as coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants are low marginal cost generators, as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs. At the other extreme, peaking power plants such as gas turbine natural gas plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build, operate and maintain. To minimize the total operational cost of generating power, <b>base</b> <b>load</b> generators are dispatched most of the time, while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary, generally when energy demand peaks.
