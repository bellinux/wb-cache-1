2500|$|Constant {{exposure}} to media that presents body ideals may constitute {{a risk factor}} for <b>body</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> and anorexia nervosa.

Although the prevalence of <b>dissatisfaction</b> with <b>body</b> image is high among women (APA, 2000; Kruger, Lee, Ainsworth, 2 ̆ 6 Macera, 2008), few studies have done an in-depth investigation of interpersonal protective factors affecting <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction.</b> This study examines mindfulness, empowerment and feminist identity development as factors to protect women across the life span from developing <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Participants were 199 women {{from the general population}} and university students ranging in age from 18 to 67 years.

2500|$|The {{older women}} become the more {{satisfied}} with their body image {{they are likely to}} become because of the relief of stress from societal pressures.

2500|$|When {{exploring}} {{the etiology of}} bulimia through a socio-cultural perspective, the [...] "thin ideal internalization" [...] is significantly responsible. The thin ideal internalization {{is the extent to}} which individuals adapt to the societal ideals of attractiveness. Studies have shown that young females that read fashion magazines tend to have more bulimic symptoms than those females who do not. This further demonstrates the impact of media on the likelihood of developing the disorder. Individuals first accept and [...] "buy into" [...] the ideals, and then attempt to transform themselves in order to reflect the societal ideals of attractiveness. J. Kevin Thompson and Eric Stice claim that family, peers, and most evidently media reinforce the thin ideal, which may lead to an individual accepting and [...] "buying into" [...] the thin ideal. In turn, Thompson and Stice assert that if the thin ideal is accepted, one could begin to feel uncomfortable with their body shape or size since it may not necessarily reflect the thin ideal set out by society. Thus, people feeling uncomfortable with their bodies may result in suffering from <b>body</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> and may develop a certain drive for thinness. Consequently, <b>body</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> coupled with a drive for thinness is thought to promote dieting and negative effects, which could eventually lead to bulimic symptoms such as purging or bingeing. Binges lead to self-disgust which causes purging to prevent weight gain.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> is widespread amongst girls and women in Western societies (Cash & Henry, 1995; Dittmar, 2009; Grogan, 2008). Unfortunately, <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> strongly predicts a range of {{physical and mental health}} problems such as disordered eating, depression, and low self-esteem (Grabe, Hyde, & Lindberg, 2007; Johnson & Wardle, 2005; Neumark-Sztainer, Paxton, Hannan, Haines, & Story, 2006; Stice, 2002). It is also implicated {{in the development of a}} variety of restrictive eating behaviours that have potentially unhealthy consequences, such as fasting and unbalanced weight-loss dieting regimes (Grogan, 2008; Ogden, 2003; Stice & Shaw, 2002). According to the conventional wisdom women's <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction,</b> and thus the health costs related to it, is a consequence of a "tyranny of a thin-ideal" (Thompson & Stice, 2001). From this perspective, women's <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> is conceptualised as a product of being too distant from an idealised external or internal thinness standard (Thompson et al., 1999). htsncfsrcf (e. g. Dittmar, 2009; Harrison & Hefner, 2006; Thompson & Stice, 2001; Vartanian. 2009). In this thesis I have demonstrated that women's <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> and associated restrictive eating can also be a consequence of a "fear of fat". That is to say, in some circumstances women's <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> can also be said to be a product of being too close to an overweight reference standard. Thus, any associated restrictive eating can be seen as an attempt to assuage <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> by moving away from, or maintaining distance with, the unattractive, overweight physique. ...|$|R

2500|$|Gender {{differences}} {{related to}} body image are increasingly prevalent {{between men and}} women. Throughout all stages of life, women have more <b>body</b> <b>dissatisfaction</b> than men. Although dissatisfaction {{is more common in}} women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women. In a longitudinal study that assessed body image across time and age between men and women, men placed greater significance on their physical appearance than women, even though women report body image dissatisfaction more often. [...] Adolescence is where this difference is most notable. One reason for this is because males are being targeted in the media more heavily today. Historically, and for a much longer period of time, the media has immoderately targeted females, which may explain why they are becoming less sensitized to the effects. This information suggests that appearance pressure and concerns are continuing to affect both men and women in western culture.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{the need}} to be thin, young, and rich, there is also a weight {{prejudice}} within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. These high standards for women to follow and live up to mixed with the practical impossibilities of achieving such standards develops an attitude from women that thinness is extremely desirable. Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. [...] Actress/Comedian Amy Schummer spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in Glamour Magazine as a [...] "Plus Size Woman." [...] Upon the magazines publication, Schummer fired a tweet saying, [...] "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America.

[...] Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have <b>body</b> <b>dissatisfaction,</b> and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly see.

Participants consisted of 302 undergraduates from three ethnic groups: Caucasian, Hispanic American, and African American women who were administered self-report measures. Differences were not found between the groups in <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction.</b> Low self-esteem, internalization of the thin ideal, and family emphasis on weight and appearance were all related to more <b>body</b> image <b>dissatisfaction</b> {{for each of these}} groups; however, {{differences in}} degree of endorsement were also noted between the ethnic groups on these factors. Based on the interaction findings (body image x acculturation) separation from one's mother was found in the area of attitudes and emotions for the Hispanic sample but not for the African American sample on any of the parent scales. Areas for future research and implications for diagnosis and treatment of minority populations are also discussed...|$|R
