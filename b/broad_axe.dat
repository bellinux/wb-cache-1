500|$|Brütal Legend is a {{third person}} action/adventure game {{incorporating}} real time strategy elements. The game uses an open world that Tim Schafer has described as being approximately [...] in area. The player controls the protagonist Eddie Riggs, a roadie who one day finds himself transported into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world. Eddie acquires three tools that are used for combat and transportation: a <b>broad</b> <b>axe</b> called [...] "The Separator", his Flying V guitar [...] "Clementine" [...] from his own world which {{has the ability to}} cast magic spells in the heavy metal world, and a hot rod that Eddie builds called [...] "The Druid Plow", a.k.a. [...] "The Deuce". Spells, referred to as [...] "Solos", from Clementine are performed by playing a minigame akin to the note-matching aspect of Guitar Hero or Rock Band over a brief guitar riff; however, Eddie cannot use the metal generated by Clementine constantly, as prolonged usage of the guitar will cause it to overheat, and the player will have to wait for a cool-off period before using the guitar's power again. Eddie may also find more solos hidden throughout the world, ranging from support to offensive spells. The player can spend in-game currency called [...] "Fire Tributes", earned from completing missions, at the Motor Forge to gain new abilities and upgrades for each tool. These tools can be used in combination with each other to take out Eddie's foes; for example, the player can use his guitar Clementine to create pyrotechnics to launch a foe into the air and follow up by attack it with the Separator axe. In a case of a specific boss fight, the player must use the Deuce hot rod to lure the boss to a spiked gate held up by counterweights, and then play the [...] "Earthshaker" [...] move on Clementine to destroy the weights and sever the creature's head.|$|E

'I come,' said Fergus. Accordingly, supporting Edward by the arm and followed by Evan Dhu and the priest, he moved down the stairs of the tower, the soldiers bringing up the rear. The court was occupied by a squadron of dragoons and a battalion of infantry, drawn up in hollow square. Within their ranks was the sledge or hurdle on which the prisoners were to be drawn to the place of execution, about a mile distant from Carlisle. It was painted black, and drawn by a white horse. At one end of the vehicle sat the executioner, a horrid-looking fellow, as beseemed his trade, with the <b>broad</b> <b>axe</b> in his hand; at the other end, next the horse, was an empty seat for two persons.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of ‘globesity’, fat {{activism}} and Fat Studies have become important political players in countering negative stereotypes and the devaluation of fat bodies. Both groups are diverse, yet share a common goal to celebrate and/or accept fatness, and challenge practices and discourses that reinforce ‘normal’ bodies (such as diets, ‘fat talk’ and medicalisation). In this paper we reflect on our engagement with a Fat Studies conference, and critically interrogate the assumptions that underlie this particular space. It {{is not surprising that}} fat activists and Fat Studies scholars bring different ideologies to the table, yet the differences between them have not been adequately scrutinized or theorized. Drawing upon Linda Alcoff’s feminist philosophy, we examine how identity politics and intersectional perspectives are both used in fat activism, yet have the effect of creating unresolved tensions between singular and multiple embodied identities. We argue that an identity politics approach (exemplified through embodied visibility and declarations of ‘thin privilege’) creates boundaries for policing and exclusion, and is thus at odds with the much <b>broader</b> <b>axes</b> identified by intersectorial approaches. Rather than dismiss the power of identity politics, we argue for a careful reframing of the relationship between identity politics and intersectionality in fat activism and Fat Studies. To conclude, we suggest that unexamined contradictions that arise from this mismatch may be counterproductive to the subversive aims of the movement. Meredith Nash, Megan Wari...|$|R

Ontogenetic dietary shifts and asynchronous larval development {{in both of these}} gomphids may have contributed to intraspecific partitioning of food. E. decorata had the <b>broadest</b> niche <b>axes</b> along food and microhabitat dimensions; Z. iris were relatively specialized; H. scorpio and O. sinicus made similar use of resources.

40|$|The thesis {{traces the}} {{conditions}} of possibility for what we came to understand as ‘non-representational’ approaches to performing critique. In assessing different theatrical practitioners in Britain (in the form of case studies) that have challenged a politically prescriptive theatre, the thesis elaborates upon ideologically ‘incomplete’ ways of performing, in order to rethink the staging of critical practice beyond its subjection to mimesis, abstract significations and transcendental politics. Ways of rethinking theatre as a space in which politics is not transcendentally transmitted, but rather emerges within the performance-event, as well as questions of spectators’ emancipation from systems of power that have rendered them passive and immobile watchers of a spectacle are examined and challenged. In doing so, the research resonates with many ongoing discussions about the function and performance of critique, placing questions of spectatorship, de-objectification and representation {{at the heart of}} its analysis. Considering political theatre as a plateau on which critique can be actualised as a ‘becoming’ in the ‘here and now’ of the event, the thesis explores the question of non-representational performance along three <b>broad</b> theoretical <b>axes.</b> First, it unfolds and critically exposes the limits of interactivity within performance practices, by considering dialogical processes of performing not as ends-in- themselves, but as starting points of challenging the problem of representation in political theatre. Secondly, the thesis examines ‘incomplete’ and fragmentary performances, suggesting that non-representational approaches to theatre are, in effect, a critique of teleological outcomes and determinate meanings; therefore, theatrical incompleteness is theorised as a tool of critical practices that become non-representational. Thirdly, in destabilising the problematic opposition between conditioning the spectator as object or subject, the thesis argues that the power relations in performance need to be destratified and transformed into productive variations, as a way to endorse a politics of presence in political theatre...|$|R

The sediments have been strongly folded in four phases, and are now characterised by widespread steep dips and steeply plunging folds.

These folds were accompanied by a strongly developed axial plane slaty cleavage which, in many areas, led to a progressive transposition of the original sedimentary bedding into a new lamination. The final period of folding (B 4) was a minor one, affecting only a limited area in which the slaty cleavage of the B 3 folds is the dominant planar element.

40|$|The stratospheric {{temperature}} {{trend has}} only been measurable {{on a global scale}} since the late 1970 's during the satellite era. In the global annual mean, the stratosphere demonstrates a cooling over this time. This cooling is much greater than the warming at the Earth's surface and is therefore an important signature of climate change. Although models agree with the observations in terms of the sign of the temperature trend, there is inconsistency in the magnitude. In addition to the overall trend, the stratospheric temperatures demonstrate many scales of variability. One possible cause of this variability is the change in flux from the Sun over the 11 -year solar cycle. By use of realistic solar cycle flux perturbations, the solar maximum minus minimum annual mean result displays a peak response at the stratopause with a magnitude of 1. 6 K, an equatorial middle stratosphere minimum and a second peak in the lower stratosphere. This is in agreement with a previous multiple regression analysis of the ERA- 40 temperatures The result of this study appears different to a multiple regression of the solar cycle in satellite observations alone; however, when the results are degraded to the resolution of the satellite channels, the results are more similar and thus the <b>broad</b> weighting functions <b>axe</b> a large contributor to the discrepancy. The same modelling techniques are used to evaluate the temperature change associated with anthropogenic-induced carbon dioxide and ozone changes. A first order time-varying response is established and then weighted to each of the satellite channels. When compared to the observations, it is found that the addition of the solar cycle reduces the discrepancy compared to neglecting the solar response in most satellite channels. Additionally, the associated radiative forcings across the tropopause are also calculated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1977 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaOperational and {{deployment}} {{considerations are}} described {{to enhance the}} performance of jam resistant communications. The potential different ground propagation characteristics of spread spectrum and CW type waveforms are used {{to the advantage of}} the communication system. Emphasis is placed on the use of tactical relay to continuously optimize against the jammer. Tactics such as spoofing are described as a technique in confusing the intelligent jammer. The objective {{of this paper is to}} illustrate how anti-jam communications with nominal AJ performance improvement can effectively be employed in a ground environment. These include the brute force and the so-called intelligent or sophisticated jammer. For many years the utilization of anti-jam communications has been stifled in anticipation or the optimum solution against the optimum jammer. When evaluating a "one on one" scenario where the jammer is dedicated to jamming a specific link there is an unending subset of tradeoffs of optimum techniques to consider. However, when the jammer is trying to disrupt communications along a <b>broad</b> geographical <b>axes.</b> the techniques of jamming and communicating should be based on more general operating conditions. The ground communications environment in the presence of ground-based jamming presents the greatest opportunity for improving performance as a function of propagation anomalies and the use of relay. Airborne terminals within line of sight of the jammer have the most severe jamming environment. Ground based terminals generally will have an advantage of terrain against the ground based jammer. Those links that exhibit poor communications margin should always have the option of an alternate route in a jamming environment. The alternative to an alternate route is to provide excessive performance margins for worst case analysis. Unfortunately there is a significant cost factor associated with this latter approach. An important element of the scenario is the concept of position location. The use of position location and reporting equipment enables the apriori determination of appropriate links by different classes of users. As an example an aircraft can maneuver close to a ground terminal for communications to utilize the advantage of range ratio. This can be done in the worst case of a close Air Support Mission where the FO must provide voice or digital data to direct a strike at several mobile targets. At high altitudes the AC may be jammed but at low altitude the link may be viable. At low altitudes the aircraft A-G link will be constrained to a small geographic area and must therefore know which area to cover. The use of GPS can also be enhanced at low altitudes against the ground based jammer if acquisition of the GPS signal can be speeded up. The use of a digital matched filter (DMF) for CA code acquisition can provide this capability...|$|R
