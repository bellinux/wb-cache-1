25|$|Credit cards have {{a printed}} or {{embossed}} <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> number {{complying with the}} ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard.

25|$|The first {{significant}} bank credit card sale came to market in 1986 {{with a private}} placement of $50 million of outstanding <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> loans. This transaction demonstrated to investors that, if the yields were high enough, loan pools could support asset sales with higher expected losses and administrative costs than was true within the mortgage market. Sales of this type — with no contractual obligation by the seller to provide recourse — allowed banks to receive sales treatment for accounting and regulatory purposes (easing balance sheet and capital constraints), {{while at the same}} time allowing them to retain origination and servicing fees. After the success of this initial transaction, investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral, and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows.|$|E

25|$|In {{relative}} numbers {{the values}} lost in <b>bank</b> <b>card</b> fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 {{dollars worth of}} transactions (7 basis points). In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million. When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund {{some or all of}} the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.|$|E
