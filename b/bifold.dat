25|$|A <b>bifold</b> door is a {{unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E
60|$|The peculiarly <b>bifold</b> {{nature of}} Captain De Stancy, {{as shown in}} his conduct at {{different}} times, was something rare in life, and perhaps happily so. That mechanical admixture {{of black and white}} qualities without coalescence, on which the theory of men's characters was based by moral analysis before the rise of modern ethical schools, fictitious as it was in general application, would have almost hit off the truth as regards Captain De Stancy. Removed to some half-known century, his deeds would have won a picturesqueness of light and shade that might have made him a fascinating subject for some gallery of illustrious historical personages. It was this tendency to moral chequer-work which accounted for his varied bearings towards Dare.|$|E

60|$|At Bangor {{we went to}} a {{handsome}} hotel, and hired a carriage and two horses for some Welsh place, the name of which I forget; neither can I remember a single name of the places through which we posted that day, nor could I spell them if I heard them pronounced, nor pronounce them if I saw them spelt. It was a circuit of about forty miles, bringing us to Conway at last. I remember a great slate-quarry; and also that many of the cottages, {{in the first part of}} our drive, were built of blocks of slate. The mountains were very bold, thrusting themselves up abruptly in peaks,--not of the dumpling formation, which is somewhat too prevalent among the New England mountains. At one point we saw Snowdon, with its <b>bifold</b> summit. We also visited the smaller waterfall (this is a translation of an unpronounceable Welsh name), which is the largest in Wales. It was a very beautiful rapid, and the guide-book considers it equal in sublimity to Niagara. Likewise there were one or two lakes which the guide-book greatly admired, but which to me, who remembered a hundred sheets of blue water in New England, seemed nothing more than sullen and dreary puddles, with bare banks, and wholly destitute of beauty. I think they were nowhere more than a hundred yards across. But the hills were certainly very good, and, though generally bare of trees, their outlines thereby were rendered the stronger and more striking.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} design of an all‐reflective, <b>bifolded</b> Schmidt {{telescope}} aimed at surveys of extended astronomical objects with extremely low surface brightness. The design leads to a high image quality without any diffracting spider, a large aperture and field of view (FoV), and a small central obstruction that barely alters the point spread function (PSF). As an example, we design a high‐quality, 36 cm diameter, fast (f/ 2. 5) telescope working in the visible with a large FoV (1. 6 degrees x 2. 6 degrees). The telescope can operate with a curved detector (or with a flat detector with a field flattener) {{and a set of}} filters. The entrance mirror is anamorphic and replaces the classical Schmidt entrance corrector plate. We show that this anamorphic primary mirror can be manufactured through stress polishing, avoiding high spatial frequency errors, and testing with a simple interferometer scheme. This prototype is intended to serve as a fast‐track scientific and technological pathfinder for the future space‐based MESSIER mission. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America...|$|R
50|$|The former infants' school {{stands on}} the lowest part of the site near the corner of Rogers and Water Streets, {{separated}} from {{the main part of}} the school by a tall stone-faced retaining wall. Accessed from a curving driveway from Rogers Street, the long, narrow building is a two-storey, facebrick structure with a hipped, tiled roof. The area for the former infants' school is divided into two level areas by a large concrete retaining wall and the school building sits against the wall on the lower level, accessible at grade from both sides. The principal entry is from the driveway into the upper (formerly classroom) level. This entrance is emphasised by large porthole windows, a sweeping, cantilevered concrete awning and curved steps, and a set of large, <b>bifolding,</b> glazed, timber-framed entrance doors. A verandah, enclosed with more-recent glazing, runs along the length of the northern side and a stair at the entry and at the western end leads down to the lower level (formerly open play space). The classrooms and the understorey are subdivided by later, lightweight partitions to form offices; although the original layout is discernible. The walls between former classrooms and the verandah have been demolished. The upper level retains south-facing, timber-framed casement windows and fanlights and sheet-and-batten ceilings.|$|R
5000|$|Although the Shutter House {{is not a}} LEED {{certified}} building, many sustainable {{features are}} incorporated into the design. The most sustainable element is manifested in the architect’s design thesis of opening traditional Manhattan living space to the surrounding city. The perforated metal shutters, controlled by the tenant to allow or block daylight in each double height space, along with the glass garage-like <b>bifold</b> doors, are designated green features. The <b>bifold</b> doors, located on the southern façade, not only open the apartment to surrounding views, but also blur the boundary between interior and exterior to allow for natural air ventilation. Open facades on both {{the north and south}} sides of the Shutter House allow for daylight to be maximized in each apartment. The architectural and mechanical process of opening up to or closing off from fluctuating environmental conditions results in energy efficiency for each apartment.|$|E

50|$|Sitting on a plinth of blue bricks, the {{building}} is symmetrical about a parapeted projecting breakfront. The breakfront has two wide doorways with <b>bifold</b> doors for vehicle access at ground level and two large recessed arched windows at the upper level. The <b>bifold</b> doors to the right hand side doorway have been replaced with aluminium framed glass sliding doors. Prominent cream rendered banding wraps {{the building}} and gives emphasis to the corners and the breakfront. The double doorway main entrance is defined by a plain projecting cornice sitting on three heavy brackets. Plain rendered arches with prominent keystones frame the central upper level windows. The letters QATB sit {{at the top of}} the parapet below an entablature composed of a plain cornice and chunky dentils. The spandrels below the arched windows contain the words Wynnum Centre. The breakfront is flanked by bays framed by pilasters. At ground level each bay has a single doorway defined by a small plain projecting canopy. The building is crowned by a gambrel tiled roof. A flagpole rises above the parapet.|$|E

It rests on a small concrete pad, with the door facing the highway, and measures about 86.125 in in height, and 33.5 in in width and depth at its base. It is slightly larger at the top, with an aluminum roof that projects slightly beyond the walls. The interior of the booth houses an aluminum shelf, above which the original telephone is mounted. A swiveling directory holder is mounted in the shelf, and there is a fluorescent light fixture mounted in the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|A common story {{regarding}} the tragedy {{states that the}} doors {{at the bottom of}} the Italian Hall's stairs opened inward. According to the story, when the fleeing party goers reached the bottom of the stairs, they pressed up against the doors, preventing them from opening and causing many people to be crushed. All photos of the doors suggest a double set of doors with both sets opening outward. The book Death's Door: The Truth Behind Michigan's Largest Mass Murder pointed out that the doors were not mentioned as a contributing factor at the December 1913 coroner's inquest, the 1914 subcommittee hearing, or in any of the newspaper stories of the time. That book also included blueprints of the building drawn by an architect, showing the locations and configurations of the doors, the staircase, and the landings. A recent book by Alison K. Hoagland, Mine Towns (declared to be a Michigan Notable Book 2010), alleges there were two sets of doors opening onto a vestibule, and that the outer doors opened outward; and there may have been a set of inner <b>bifold</b> doors.|$|E

The watchroom is {{at the front of the}} Station off the engine room and opens into the adjacent dormitory. The fireman's pole terminated in a small hall in the centre of the building to the rear of the engine room. The pole has been removed. The kitchen, bathroom and dormitory open off this hall. The recreation room is to the rear of the Station off the engine room and opening to the rear yard. All ground floor rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted battened ceilings. The dormitory contains built-in timber cupboards and tilting fanlights to the engine room wall. The bathroom could not be unlocked but a terrazzo floor was evident under the closed door. A serving hatch has been cut into the wall between the kitchen and the recreation room.|$|E
30|$|The {{emerging}} {{domain of}} data-enabled science necessitates development of algorithms and tools for knowledge discovery. Human interaction with data through well-constructed graphical representation can take special advantage of our visual {{ability to identify}} patterns. We develop a data visualization framework, called <b>BiFold,</b> for exploratory analysis of bipartite datasets that describe binary relationships between groups of objects. Typical data examples would include voting records, organizational memberships, and pairwise associations, or other binary datasets. <b>BiFold</b> provides a low dimensional embedding of data that represents similarity by visual nearness, analogous to Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). The unique and new feature of <b>BiFold</b> {{is its ability to}} simultaneously capture both within-group and between-group relationships among objects, enhancing knowledge discovery. We benchmark <b>BiFold</b> using the Southern Women Dataset, where social groups are now visually evident. We construct <b>BiFold</b> plots for two US voting datasets: For the presidential election outcomes since 1976, <b>BiFold</b> illustrates the evolving geopolitical structures that underlie these election results. For Senate congressional voting, <b>BiFold</b> identifies a partisan coordinate, separating senators into two parties while simultaneously visualizing a bipartisan-coalition coordinate which captures the ultimate fate of the bills (pass/fail). Finally, we consider a global cuisine dataset of the association between recipes and food ingredients. <b>BiFold</b> allows us to visually compare and contrast cuisines while also allowing identification of signature ingredients of individual cuisines.|$|E
30|$|We {{begin with}} an {{introductory}} example of <b>BiFold</b> below, leaving {{the details of the}} approach and more examples to the later sections.|$|E
30|$|We {{focused on}} Hamming {{distance}} and Jaccard distance to compute within-in class dissimilarity, with each providing a natural interpretation for the datasets considered. We {{note that the}} <b>BiFold</b> framework is not dependent upon any particular choice of dissimilarity measure, and a reasonable practitioner may choose other methods for defining dissimilarities (and weights) that might be appropriate for their data. The <b>BiFold</b> approach - based on the joint dissimilarity matrix, will still provide a means to develop the joint visualization.|$|E
30|$|<b>BiFold</b> {{provides}} a procedural framework {{to produce a}} low-dimensional embedding from a binary data matrix. First, we create a joint dissimilarity matrix that appropriately fuses information from both within-class and cross-class relations. Secondly, we construct a weighting matrix to reflect the relative uncertainty associated with the dissimilarities. Finally, we minimize a weighted stress function to obtain a <b>BiFold</b> embedding, coordinates in R^d for each row and each column of the data matrix. In this section, we describe and explain this framework, leaving the detailed specification of the algorithms and parameters to Materials and Methods.|$|E
30|$|After formulating {{a stress}} {{function}} (8) and embedding dimension d, a <b>BiFold</b> {{representation of the}} data is obtained by minimizing the stress function over the coordinates of m+n points in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. This optimization problem is within the class of MDS problems, with several alternative tools available to find a local minimum [9, 10]. For the <b>BiFold</b> plots reported in this paper, the stress minimization is done via the (iterative) SMACOF algorithm [10]. For reproducibility of results, for the initial iteration of the algorithm, the starting configuration for the coordinates is obtained by a classical MDS solution of the joint dissimilarity matrix (without weighting). After applying the SMACOF algorithm to obtain a set of coordinates, we further perform a PCA (principal component analysis) to standardize the alignment, noting that the stress function is invariant under such transformations. As a consequence, in all <b>BiFold</b> plots the horizontal axis is the principal direction.|$|E
30|$|As an (almost trivial) extension, we {{note that}} {{interpretation}} of the data as representing a bipartite network implies that <b>BiFold</b> could act as a graph layout algorithm for bipartite network data.|$|E
30|$|The <b>BiFold</b> {{framework}} {{describes a}} general approach {{to produce a}} low-dimensional embedding from a data matrix, where that matrix encodes the relationship between two classes of objects. First, one needs to create a joint dissimilarity matrix using some appropriate within-class and cross-class dissimilarity measures as well as scaling to make the within-class and cross-class dissimilarities commensurate. Secondly, one needs to construct a weighting matrix to reflect the relative focus {{to be given to}} the computed dissimilarities. Finally, the <b>BiFold</b> embedding is obtained by minimizing a weighed stress function similar to the determination of an MDS solution.|$|E
30|$|In the {{following}} sections, we illustrate <b>BiFold</b> via three additional binary datasets: US presidential election results, US senate voting {{records from the}} 112 th Congress, and a food-recipe relational dataset from five major global cuisines.|$|E
30|$|For dynamic {{datasets}} (parameterized by time, for example) each data “snapshot” {{would yield}} a <b>BiFold</b> layout. A stress functional that incorporates a regularity condition in time could compute an optimal sequence of layouts, computed over many snapshots.|$|E
30|$|Some dataset might {{naturally}} {{contain more}} than two groups, such as actors, movies, and viewers. Such datasets can be treated as multipartite, rather than bipartite data. We envision {{a natural extension of}} <b>BiFold,</b> where the joint dissimilarity and weighting matrices must be appropriately constructed based on the within-group and between-group relationships.|$|E
30|$|We {{remark that}} any of the {{visually}} indicated hypothesis should be viewed as exploratory and be confirmed by additional quantitative analysis (as would also be appropriate for most other data visualizations). However, we note that the <b>BiFold</b> visualization motivates a rich palette of such hypotheses, many of which directly exploit the between-class information.|$|E
30|$|Comparing one <b>BiFold</b> {{layout to}} another (exploring {{parameter}} space) {{can be challenging}} in that the solution layout is rotation and reflection invariant. Normalizing {{the orientation of the}} generated solution is important. As additional complication, the configuration solution to the optimization problem is a local minimizer, so that solution may “jump” to a different minimizer under small changes in the data.|$|E
