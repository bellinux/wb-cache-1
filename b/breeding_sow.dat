40|$|This paper {{explores the}} factors that impact {{insurance}} choices. Specially designed survey questions allow one to fully observe the demand tendency by the farmers and partially observe the supply tendency by the insurance company. A joint estimation of insurance decision by both supply and demand sides suggested that factors performing different roles in affecting insurance participation game. Farmer’s age and education have positive impact on insurance demand, but are indifference to the insurance providers. Insurance suppliers care more about farmers’ experience in the field, but this experience occasionally results in overconfidence for the farmers and hence, impedes insurance purchasing. Production scales, proxy by sow inventory, is put more weight by the farmers than the suppliers when making decisions. Production efficiency measures, which performs as incentives for farmers to purchase insurance, acts as some disadvantages in the suppliers’ point of view. While the suppliers prefer customers who use vaccine, the hog producers tend to treat vaccine {{as a substitute for}} insurance so as to prevent disease risk. The study also generates discussion on the topics such as short-run vs. long-run factor impact by comparing past insurance choices and current choices.

The post-weaning sows (F 1 and F 2 of Large White × Landrace mated to Duroc boars (mean parity 3. 4 +/- 0. 7 SD; mean body condition 3. 01 +/- 0. 3 SD, previous lactation length of 28. 3 +/- 1. 5 d) were divided into four groups of similar body condition, lactation length and parity and were treated as follows: Group 1 : sows (n = 420) were injected subcutaneously with 400 I. U. of Gonadotropinum sericum (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, PMSG [eCG]) and 200 I. U. of Gonadotropinum chorionicum (human choriongonadotropin, HCG [hCG]) one day after weaning. Group 2 : sows (n = 405) received subcutaneously 4 ml of saline injection one day after weaning. Group 3 : sows (n = 425), purposely chosen from among animals that did not show heat within 7 days after weaning, were treated on day 7 post-weaning with PMSG and HCG as the animals in group 1. Group 4 : sows (n = 415) purposely chosen from among animals that did not show heat within 7 days after weaning, were treated on day 7 post-weaning as group 2. Sows expressing oestrus, sows ovulating after treatment, treatment to oestrus intervals and follicular sizes were evaluated. The number of sows expressing oestrus, sows ovulating, and treatment to oestrus intervals differed between the groups (group 1 vs. 2 : P < 0. 05, group 3 vs. 4 : P < 0. 01).

40|$|For swine {{production}} {{to be as}} efficient as possible and to value animal welfare, {{it is important to}} have robust and healthy pigs. A <b>breeding</b> <b>sow</b> that can thrive and nurture healthy piglets in different environments is a robust sow. There are very different ways to produce pork meat around the world, and to provide a healthy and hearty pig is essential to Topigs Norsvin to succeed in the world market. It is important to find traits that have an influence on production and are vital for economics, breeding and animal welfare, and to acquire an overview of the animals’ strengths and weaknesses. Records were used to estimate correlation and genetic parameters to find out whether the new traits in this project might be suitable to use in the breeding selection or not. Over a four-month-period, 1, 243 Norsvin Landrace breeding sows were recorded in this project in the US. The phenotypes used in this study are partly from my own data collection during my stay and partly from the InGris registration done at the same farm. The recording was divided in two phases; in the first phase, 34 traits were recorded, and after an evaluation, 23 traits were recorded in the second phase. In this MSc. Thesis, 19 traits were analyzed with a focus on leg and hoof traits. A medium heritability was estimated for the traits of dewclaw and toe length, at 0. 26 and 0. 49 respectively. Other leg traits, including assessment and swellings (bursitis tenosynovitis) was estimated to a low to medium (0. 17 and 0. 22) heritability. Traits indicating pain, as well as sow performance traits, gestation length and number of born piglets, was low h 2 (0. 16 and 0. 12). The traits may be genetically related to each other, so correlations were estimated. The genetic correlation between toe length and dewclaw length was highly positive (0. 95). The leg assessments were negatively correlated to hoof length (- 0. 09 and - 0. 44), while the front and hind assessment were highly correlated with each other (0. 74), and also correlated to bursitis/tenosynovitis. The arching of the back was correlated to hoof length and dew claw length (0. 35 and 0. 61), whereas the gestation length and number of piglets born were negatively correlated (- 0. 49). Of the 19 traits investigated, the front and hind leg assessment had a low heritability, and majority of the pigs were too soft in the joints at full growth, and negatively correlated to hoof soundness. Looking at the results from the breeding values in this study, we can conclude that it is possible to include hoof length traits in the breeding goal. M-H...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus in most diets for {{breeding}} sows is digested from 20 % to 40 %, thus {{leading to a}} relatively high amount of P in the manure. To enhance the P digestibility in diets for both lactating and gestating sows, two separate experiments were carried out to study the efficacy of phytase derived from Peniophora lycii. Thirty crossbred lactating sows and 24 gestating sows {{were used in the}} studies. Five treatments were imposed on the lactating sows: (1) the negative control, a low-P diet without added feed phosphate and microbial phytase. Treatments 2, 3 and 4 were the same as the negative control diet, except that an amount of 750, 1000 and 10, 000 U of phytase kg¿ 1 of diet, respectively, was added. Treatment 5 was the positive control diet, being treatment 1 with 1. 5 g of digestible P added kg¿ 1 of diet from monocalcium phosphate. The gestating sows received the same first three treatments and a positive control diet supplemented with 1. 0 g of digestible P kg¿ 1. The negative control diets were different in feedstuff composition. The ratio between Ca and digestible P was kept constant at 2. 9 : 1 and 3. 3 : 1 for the lactating and gestating diets, respectively. Feeding level of the sows was according to Dutch recommendations. Six sows per treatment were used. The lactating sows received the diets from 2 weeks before farrowing until weaning of piglets at 4 weeks of lactation and the gestating sows from day 49 to day 100 of pregnancy. Sampling of the faeces of the sows was done by rectal stimulation, and carried out at days 15 and 21 post-farrowing, and at days 70 and 99 of pregnancy. Digestibility coefficients of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ash and the minerals under investigation were calculated using Cr 2 O 3 as an indigestible marker. In addition, several performance characteristics were observed. Phosphorus digestibility was clearly enhanced by the addition of microbial phytase to the sow diets, as was the digestibility of ash, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cu and Zn. There was a positive relationship between dose of phytase and the amount of liberated digestible phosphorus in lactating sows. The difference in liberated amount of digestible P between 1000 and 10, 000 U kg¿ 1 was 0. 34 g/kg of lactating diet. An amount of 0. 77 and 0. 42 g digestible P kg¿ 1 was liberated by 750 U/kg in the lactation and gestating diets, respectively. No signs of any adverse effect of phytase was observed on sow or piglet health and performance, even at a dose of 10, 000 U kg¿ 1. The performance of piglets and sows at 10, 000 U phytase kg¿ 1 was comparable to or better than the positive control diet. If feed phosphates are (partly) replaced by 750 U phytase kg¿ 1 of diet, then P excretion can be reduced by 0. 75 ¿ 0. 90 kg per <b>breeding</b> <b>sow</b> per year...|$|E
40|$|It’s a great {{pleasure}} to have been asked to speak today, and on a subject that – while I can claim no expertise – has occupied my thoughts intermittently over the last 25 years. I did at one stage seriously consider whether your profession was the one I wished to follow. I attended agricultural college in the late 1970 s, and while my family had a farm, it seemed unlikely I would be the one asked to manage it. So I thought if I were to pursue a career in agriculture, either writing about it or researching how to improve it seemed very real career opportunities. I took a different route, {{for a variety of reasons}} – most of them not germane to our subject today. But it is true to say that much of what I saw then had the effect of turning me away from agricultural research. I first went to college shortly after the 1979 change of government, and some here will recall the incoming minister – Peter Walker – exalting the UK’s farmers to ever greater levels of production. I had looked for a college at which I could study organic agriculture – unsuccessfully, as the only place I could find as a small place in Sussex, which I didn’t think would fulfil the other needs typical of a male teenager. At Harper Adams, which I therefore chose, there was with one honourable exception no interest whatever among the 80 -odd staff in organic production. The college bursar, a well-respected figure, openly derided it as “muck and magic”. That was typical of the time and of the place. The quality of much that was taught was highly dubious. During my sandwich year, I looked after a herd of freerange pigs on fertile but heavy land in the English county of Buckinghamshire. I could not fail to note that the sows derived a significant proportion of their nutritional needs from grazing the rye grass on which they were folded. From memory, I think we concluded that a <b>breeding</b> <b>sow</b> could obtain about a third of her nutritional needs from grazing over the course of the production cycle. So I was surprised to be told by our lecturer in pig husbandry that this was physiologically impossible. Monogastric animals are incapable of digesting cellulose, we were informed, so all the nutritional needs of the domestic pig – whether kept indoors or out – had to be met by supplementary feed. To have written anything else in an examination would have been to court failure. We learned agronomy and modern techniques in pest and parasite control that relied very heavily on poisons. One such chemical – I recall its name as Temik – was so toxic, we were told by our lecturer with a quiver of excitement, that a single speck would be a fatal to a human being. It was incorporated in soil, to control nematodes in potatoes. At the time the college was involved in a range of agricultural research, including a project investigating the effects of feeding various unusual substances to cattle. I don’t think they included ruminant derived protein – an experiment conducted elsewhere with an ultimate price tag of over £ 4 billion. But I do remember considerable interest in the effects on growth rates of feeding beef cattle the dust scraped from the inside of power station chimneys. These are random recollections from a typical agricultural education a quarter of a century ago. To me they represent the perversion – almost the corruption, although I don’t think that is quite an accurate term – of what should be one of the noblest professions. And I find it very heartening that the priorities have changed so much in the intervening years as to fill a hall such as this to debate what is, I believe, genuinely the public interest in agricultural research. I have been asked to think about what would be my priorities for that research community. I’d like to outline four areas that I think each deserves far greater attention than they have received so far...|$|E

40|$|The optimal {{design of}} a pig {{improvement}} programme requires the choice of an appropriate breeding objective and relevant economic values for objective traits, the choice of selection criteria and consequent genetic and phenotypic parameters, determination of selection indices and predicted genetic gains, and choice of an appropriate population structure. A computer model simulating life cycle production of a <b>breeding</b> <b>sow</b> and growth performance of her offspring was developed to estimate economic values (EV's) of reproduction and growth performance traits. A biological growth model simulating the digestion and metabolism of dietary energy and nitrogen in growing pigs, based on the linear/plateau relationship between daily protein deposition and digestible energy intake, {{was part of the}} life cycle model. The upper limit to body protein deposition rate (Pd max), mean daily ad libitum digestible energy intake (DEi) and minimum lipid to protein deposition ratio (R min) were assumed the major genetic determinants of pig growth. EV's were calculated per gilt life cycle by simulating effects of genetic changes in several biological components, in a farrow-to-finish production system, assuming ad libitum feeding. For unimproved genotypes (Pd max, 30 MJ/day, R min ≥ 1), the EV of 1 g/day improvement in Pd max ranged from $ 12 to $ 22, DEi EV's ranged from $- 20 to $- 123 per 1 MJ/day increase, and EV's below $- 500 were found per one unit increase in R min. EV's for number born alive/litter (NBA) were below $ 12 per extra pig. For improved genotypes, EV's for Pd max had values below $ 14 per unit increase and became zero at high Pd max levels exceeding 180 g/day, when full expression of Pd max was restricted by insufficient digestible energy intakes. The DEi EV's for improved genotypes with insufficient amounts of metabolisable energy became positive. Improved genotypes had high EV's for NBA, exceeding $ 70 per 1 extra pig. Relatively low negative EV's were found for one unit increase in other reproduction traits: gilt age at first oestrus, interval weaning-oestrus, and pre-weaning mortality percentage. Results demonstrated EV's of traits depended on the average genetic merit in the pig herd and its interaction with the management circumstances (level of feeding, nature of the diet, life cycle length) of the production system. Multivariate animal models and Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) methods were used to estimate (co) variance components, heritabilities, genetic correlations and common environmental effects of reproduction and growth performance traits for on-farm tested Large White, Landrace and Duroc pigs. Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methods were applied for breeding value estimation allowing determination of genetic, environmental and phenotypic trends in the studied populations. The annual realised genetic gains ranged from 2. 1 to 4. 3 g/day for average daily gain (ADG) and - 0. 2 to - 0. 3 mm for ultrasonically-measured backfat thickness (BF). The realised genetic trends in ADG and BF compared favourably with the rate of improvement found in similar overseas studies but were substantially lower than the respective predicted gains of 4. 13 g/day/year and - 0. 88 mm/year, except for the Duroc ADG where predicted and actual gains were similar. The NBA genetic trends were negligible for Large White and Landrace, but favourable (+ 0. 07 pigs/litter/year) for the Duroc breed. Mixed model techniques (BLUP and REML) offered efficient and accurate prediction of breeding values and estimation of parameters, utilising all available information from relatives, traits and environments. Different selection strategies were investigated and predicted genetic gains were estimated, based on indices derived for a range of improved and unimproved pig genotypes. The effect of different sets of selection criteria on the efficiency of selection, use of restricted selection indices, and sensitivity to changes in the economic values and in the structure of future costs and returns were studied, and the effects of these changes on the predicted selection response were analysed. The increase in profit resulting from further selection was lower in pig populations representing improved genotypes, as a result of lower predicted genetic gains in growth and carcass traits. This reduced rate of increase in profit was partially offset by the increase in predicted genetic gains in reproductive performance. For improved genotypes, the predicted increase in profit per gilt life cycle after one generation of selection ranged from $ 26 to $ 98 for one standard deviation of index selection with a selection intensity of 1. For unimproved genotypes, higher genetic gains in growth and carcass traits resulted in profits exceeding $ 120 per generation of selection. Greater economic emphasis on litter size resulted in lower predicted genetic gains in growth and carcass traits...|$|E

At other times pigs {{are not allowed to}} roam on the forest, with the exception that <b>breeding</b> <b>sows</b> (known as [...] "privileged sows") are by custom allowed out, providing that they return to the owner's holding at night and are not a nuisance. The pigs each have several nose rings clipped into their noses to prevent them rooting too much and causing damage to grassland.|$|R

The CUSUM (cumulative sum) and the EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) control chart are used to detect small deviations in a process. Data from two sow herds, herd A and herd B, were collected from 1999 to 2004. Farm A had an average number of 530 <b>breeding</b> <b>sows,</b> Farm B {{had an average of}} 370 <b>breeding</b> <b>sows.</b> Both herds were diagnosed with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). The weekly means of the number of piglets weaned (NPW), the pre-weaning mortality (PWM) and return to service rate (RSR) were analysed with different settings of the CUSUM as well as the EWMA control chart to reveal a shift in the production process. For the pre-weaning mortality and the number of piglets weaned, the two charts detected a change in the process 4 weeks (Farm A) and 2 weeks before (Farm B) PRRS was diagnosed. The CUSUM and the EWMA chart revealed a shift in the return to service rate on Farm A 3. 5 months before PRRS was detected. On Farm B, the signal occurred 6 weeks before the infection was detected. The CUSUM and the EWMA control charts were effective tools for detecting small deviations in sow herd data. Compared with EWMA, the use of the CUSUM chart is more straightforward and the settings are more easily handled. The CUSUM chart is therefore the preferred option for use in practice...|$|R

Former studies have eliminated the problem of seasonality by using seasonally adjusted data. Recent developments in cointegration techniques allow the comprehensive modelling of error-correcting structures {{in the presence of}} seasonality. We consider a four-variables model for Austrian agriculture. Series on the producer price for soy beans, bulls and pigs, as well as the stock of <b>breeding</b> <b>sows</b> are included. A vector autoregression incorporating seasonal cointegration is estimated. A tentative interpretation of long-run and seasonal features is considered. The model is also used to generate forecasts for the supply of pigs in Austria. ...|$|R

40|$|The complement-fixation {{test was}} {{investigated}} {{as a means}} of detecting hog cholera virus in spleen from experimentally infected swine. Various methods of extracting the tissue for production of antigen are described and emphasis is placed on the necessity of using the modified direct complement-fixation test to obtain reactions. The tissue should be obtained from animals showing advanced clinical manifestations of the disease. Preferably, the tissue should be maintained frozen or at least well refrigerated. The results indicate that tissue from dead animals or from <b>breeding</b> <b>sows</b> should be avoided. The 77 per cent positive reactions obtained suggest the test could be of diagnostic value provided two or three samples are obtained from the same herd...|$|R

In 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 204 with 62% support; the legislation prohibits the confinement of calves in veal crates and <b>breeding</b> <b>sows</b> in gestation crates. In 2007, the Governor of Oregon signed legislation prohibiting the confinement of pigs in gestation crates and in 2008, the Governor of Colorado signed legislation that phased out both gestation crates and veal crates.

The {{results show that the}} 9 th swine farm is a family farm that has adopted the latest technology and has more than 300 <b>breeding</b> <b>sows.</b> In addition, a rapid business expansion is notable in swine farm C compared to the other farms. The factors appear to be the ensuring of a farm site that can be scaled up, the outsourcing of manure treatment, and increased revenue. According to the results, pig farms on rice paddy fields can be characterized as unable to have their scales expanded in plain areas or to move to forest areas due to the problem of odors and swine diseases...|$|R
