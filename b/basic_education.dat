40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. <b>Basic</b> design <b>education</b> is an {{important}} experience for design students, since {{they are expected to}} construct a basis for their further education and future career, and there are several objectives in <b>basic</b> design <b>education</b> to construct this basis. Moreover, during <b>basic</b> design <b>education</b> students begin to form their preferences on visual aspects of design which will determine the quality of design product. The methodology of <b>basic</b> design <b>education</b> is based on social interaction. However, social choice theory assumes that social interaction between people will result with similar preferences of individuals, as opposite to the objectives of <b>basic</b> design <b>education.</b> Thus, the main concern {{of this study is to}} investigate probable effects of social interaction in basic design studio on preference formation of basic design students in the case of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design department of Bilkent University to open up a discussion on the relevancy of basic methodology to its objectives, and the validity of the common consents of <b>basic</b> design <b>education.</b> The results of the research show that students form similar sets of preferences because of their social interaction with instructors and their perceptual tendencies, and this manifests a situation contradicted with the objective of <b>basic</b> design <b>education.</b> Koyuncugil, Hüseyin TolgaM.

5|$|During World War I, the interwar {{years and}} World War II, {{widespread}} poverty in Malta prevented {{the children of}} the lower classes from pursuing <b>basic</b> <b>education</b> in favor of staying home to assist parents with agricultural work and other income earning activities. To counteract this phenomenon, education was declared compulsory in 1946. In 1964, Malta became an independent nation, and in 1988 a new Education Act was passed, lowering the compulsory education age to five years, decentralising educational decision making and establishing a right for any person to apply for a licence to open a school. The Faculty of Arts, Sciences and Theology at the University of Malta was also reinstated.|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2009, the European Union (EU) {{adopted the}} Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). This {{contributed to an}} already {{on-going}} change amongst {{the armed forces of}} the Union. No previous research has examined how the skills required of young officers in the EU are taught at the <b>Basic</b> Officer <b>Education</b> within either Sweden or Austria. Purpose: This thesis examines to what extent the skills needed of young officers in a CSDP-environment are taught during the <b>Basic</b> Officer <b>Educations</b> in Sweden and Austria. The purpose is to conclude if the Swedish and Austrian <b>Basic</b> Officer <b>Educations</b> are complying with the political wills of their respective countries, to adapt their armed forces to the EU and CSDP. Method: The author compares the Swedish and Austrian <b>Basic</b> Officer <b>Education</b> by examining curriculums and syllabuses, as well as conducting expert interviews with officials at the schools and comparing the results. The educations are examined based on how they educated the concept of CSDP and how interoperability and a European culture of defence are promoted. Conclusion: The results show that both Sweden and Austria educate their cadets in the CSDP and take measurements to promote interoperability and a European culture of defence. The results suggest that Austria does so to a further extent. Based on the results, the author suggests increased exchanges, Pooling & Sharing during <b>Basic</b> Officer <b>Education</b> and further developments towards a common European <b>Basic</b> Officer <b>Education.</b> Erasmus</p...|$|R
5|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, {{there were}} three stages {{in the production of}} the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified <b>basic</b> <b>education</b> needs for {{children under the age of}} six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test children on the show's effects and for review by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts, who were invited to a seminar. Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic groups of children, between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during a seminar, Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.|$|E
5|$|Born to an Aymara {{family of}} {{subsistence}} farmers in Isallawi, Orinoca Canton, Morales undertook a <b>basic</b> <b>education</b> before mandatory military service, in 1978 moving to Chapare Province. Growing coca {{and becoming a}} trade unionist, he rose to prominence in the campesino ("rural laborers") union. In that capacity he campaigned against U.S. and Bolivian attempts to eradicate coca {{as part of the}} War on Drugs, denouncing these as an imperialist violation of indigenous Andean culture. His involvement in anti-government direct action protests resulted in multiple arrests. Morales entered electoral politics in 1995, became the leader of the MAS and was elected to Congress. His campaign focused on issues affecting indigenous and poor communities, advocating land reform and the redistribution of gas wealth. He gained increased visibility through the Cochabamba protests and gas conflict. In 2002 he was expelled from Congress for encouraging protesters, although he came second in that year's presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{attended}} {{public schools}} through eighth grade {{and received a}} <b>basic</b> <b>education.</b> He had not determined a career path {{for himself and his}} parents often criticized him for lacking ambition; they insisted that he seek employment. He began by working as a custodian at a local church and later for the railroad, hauling ballast to construction sites. At the church, he joined the choir where he met and began to court Bertha Lanterman. When Portland's first public high school was opened in 1876, Haynes returned to school at age 19 and completed two more years. Bertha and her family moved to Alabama during the spring of 1877, and Haynes began a regular correspondence with her. During the summer of that year, a series of revival meetings were held in Indiana by Francis Murphy, a leader of a national temperance organization known as the Murphy Movement. Haynes attended the meetings, probably at his parents' urging, and became interested in temperance. He took two of Murphy's pledge cards and carried one for most of his life; the other he mailed to Bertha.|$|E

When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a <b>basic</b> <b>education,</b> she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where <b>basic</b> <b>education</b> was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E
