If people act upon these whisperings, which call towards evil actions, people will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> are sinful. Therefore, {{this is more}} of a desperate {{situation}} for people's beliefs, thus this is the greater danger for mankind.|$|E
25|$|Painters Mikuláš Galanda (1895–1938), Martin Benka (1888–1971), Janko Alexy (1894–1970), Miloš Alexander Bazovský (1899–1968), Gustáv Mallý (1879–1952) and Jan Hála (1890–1959) are {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> laid foundations of the Slovak modern art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. The inspiration of their work stems mainly from the lives of everyday people in Slovak rurals which they admired and idealised. The painters influenced by Art Nouveau, symbolism and expressionism are Zolo Palugyay (1898–1935), Anton Jasusch (1882–1965), Edmund Gwerk (1895–1956) or Július Jakoby (1903–1985). Important also is Blažej Baláž (1958).|$|E
500|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} locked out and {{eventually}} cancelled {{because of a}} labour dispute between the league and its players. In January 2005, Bettman commented that he was hesitant to allow league participation in the Olympics {{because he did not}} like the idea of stopping play mid-season after the cancellation of the previous season. The lockout was resolved in July 2005 and the newly negotiated NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement allowed league participation in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics. Some NHL team owners were against their players participating in the tournament because of concerns about injury or exhaustion. Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider commented that [...] "I'm a believer in the Olympics and I think it's good for the NHL to participate, having said that, the people who participate should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> are absolutely healthy." [...] Some NHL players used the break as an opportunity to rest and did not participate in the tournament, and several players were injured during the Olympics and were forced to miss NHL games. Bettman said that several format changes were being discussed so that the tournament would be [...] "a little easier for everybody".|$|E

500|$|Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic {{recognized}} [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] {{as one of}} December 2010's best singles, {{placing it}} as number four on his [...] "December's 10 best singles" [...] list. He wrote, [...] "The Black Eyed Peas may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> earn the shout-out here. But every other element of 'Bass Down Low' feels custom-made for squeezing 15 extra minutes off that 'Tik Tok' clock." [...] Masley praised the spoken-word intro, the song's electropop groove and Dev's [...] "Valley Girl swagger" [...] vocals. Masley concluded his review by writing that the song sounds [...] "a whole lot" [...] like Far East Movement's [...] "Like a G6". About.com critic Ron Slomowicz wrote a positive review of the song and called it a [...] "slinky, sleazy, sexy affair". Slomowicz wrote, [...] "Dev proves she's got the cahones to challenge anyone on the scene with vulgar and seductive lyrics and a crazy hot beat provided by The Cataracs... With any justice, this track will dominate in 2011." [...] While reviewing The Night the Sun Came Up, Jamie Horne of The Border Mail said that [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] and [...] "In My Trunk" [...] are [...] "certainly Black Eyed Peas-esque but Dev... is no clone." ...|$|E

The Post called it [...] "a small but growing faction, including judges in Texas, Kansas, New York and Pennsylvania," [...] and said the judges deemed the requests overly broad and at odds with basic constitutional rights. Although some rulings were overturned, said the Post, their decisions have shaped when and how investigators can seize information detailing the locations, communications and online histories of Americans. Albert Gidari Jr., a partner at Perkins Coie who represents technology and telecommunications companies, told the Post that these judges [...] "don't want to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> approve an order that later becomes public and embarrassing…. Nobody likes to be characterized as a rubber stamp." [...] According to the Post, some legal observers have called this [...] "the Magistrates' Revolt," [...] which began several years ago; however, it gained power amid mounting public anger about government surveillance capabilities after the NSA disclosures.|$|E
