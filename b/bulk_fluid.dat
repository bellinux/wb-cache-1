25|$|Two {{things are}} {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: coolant loop separation from the steam system and pressure inside the primary coolant loop. In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one coolant loop, while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary coolant loop is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the <b>bulk</b> <b>fluid.</b> By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is designed to boil.|$|E

40|$|When {{particulate}} suspensions are sheared, perturbations in the shear flows {{around the}} rigid particles increase the local energy dissipation, {{so that the}} viscosity of the suspension is effectively {{higher than that of}} the solvent. For <b>bulk</b> (three-dimensional) <b>fluids,</b> understanding this viscosity enhancement is a classic problem in hydrodynamics that originated over a century ago with Einstein's study of a dilute suspension of spherical particles. Einstein 1 In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem of the effective viscosity of a suspension of disks embedded in a two-dimensional membrane or interface. Unlike the hydrodynamics of <b>bulk</b> <b>fluids,</b> low-Reynolds number membrane hydrodynamics is characterized by an inherent length scale generated by the coupling of the membrane to the <b>bulk</b> <b>fluids</b> that surround it. As a result, we find that the size of the particles in the suspension relative to this hydrodynamic length scale has a dramatic effect on the effective viscosity of the suspension. Our study also helps to elucidate the mathematical tools needed to solve the mixed boundary value problems that generically arise when considering the motion of rigid inclusions in fluid membranes.
