5|$|Pathfinder : This is {{the first}} real {{advancement}} badge. It focuses on basic Scout training, including the six basic knots (Reef Knot, <b>Bowline,</b> Sheet bend, Sheepshank, Figure-of-eight, and Clove hitch), basic first aid (treatment of open wounds and bleeding), and introduces Scouts to camping. The badge encourages a Scout to participate in patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E
25|$|Bowlines {{run from}} the leech (outer {{vertical}} edges) of a sail forward (towards the bow) and are used to control the weather leech, keeping it taut and thus preventing it from curling back on itself. To extend its spread it was often attached to a bridle and thence {{to three or four}} <b>bowline</b> cringles set upon the leech.|$|E
25|$|The city {{government}} of Selma {{consists of a}} mayor and a nine-member city council, elected from single-member districts. The current mayor is Darrio Melton. The city council members are: Corey D. Bowie, City Council President; Carl <b>Bowline,</b> Ward 1; Susan M. Keith, Ward 2; Miah Tolbert-Jackson, Ward 3; Angela Benjamin, Ward 4; Samuel L. Randolph, Ward 5; Johnnie Leashore, Ward 6; Jannie Thomas, Ward 7; Michael Johnson, Ward 8.|$|E

She flew round like a top; but, by Jove, we've caught her, gentlemen. Drag your <b>bowlines</b> again. What's the news from the chains?" ...|$|R

50|$|Records giving {{details of}} Tom <b>Bowline's</b> {{subsequent}} service {{have not been}} found, but the vessel was apparently sold in 1818.|$|R
500|$|Cattle {{may need}} to be {{deliberately}} thrown or tipped over for certain types of husbandry practices and medical treatment. [...] When done for medical purposes, this is often called [...] "casting", and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of [...] of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by non-slip <b>bowline</b> knots, it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to lie down in sternal recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.|$|E
60|$|Bowline.--The <b>bowline</b> (fig. 2) makes a knot {{difficult}} to undo; {{with it the}} ends of two strings are tied together, or a loop made {{at the end of}} a single piece of string, as in the drawing. For slip nooses, use the <b>bowline</b> to make the draw-loop. When tying a <b>bowline,</b> or any other knot for temporary purposes, insert a stick into the knot before pulling tight. The stick will enable you, at will, to untie the knot--to break its back, as the sailors say--with little difficulty. A <b>bowline</b> is firmer, if doubled; that is, if the free end of the cord be made to wrap round a second time.|$|E
6000|$|Elementary Knots.--The three {{elementary}} knots {{which every}} one should know are here represented--viz., the Timber-hitch, the <b>Bowline,</b> and the Clove-hitch. (See also [...] "Knots," [...] p. 49; [...] "Malay hitch," [...] p. 147.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With a {{weakened}} crew, {{it may be}} better for us that the people have no yards to handle, nor any <b>bowlines</b> to steady. All our care can be given to defence." ...|$|R
2500|$|UN, deux, troi, an exclamation, or song, used by seamen when hauling the <b>bowlines,</b> the {{greatest}} effort being {{made at the}} last word. English sailors, in the same manner, call out on this occasion,—haul-in—haul-two—haul-belay! ...|$|R
50|$|Shaping - <b>Bowlines</b> {{run from}} the leech forward towards the bow to control the weather leech, keeping it taut and thus {{preventing}} it from curling back on itself. Clewlines raise the clews to the yard above.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{single bend}} and figure of 8 are easy enough," [...] he sighed. [...] "But {{when you come}} to that sheep-shank and <b>bowline</b> upon the bight, as you term them, it grows confusing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are likely}} to have a thick night, Master Trysail," [...] said the young captain, without deeming it {{necessary}} to change his look, [...] "and we may yet be brought on a <b>bowline,</b> before yonder insolent is overhauled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might not}} give it to that effect, in safety;" [...] said Ludlow. [...] "It is no other than a half-rigged brigantine, on a taut <b>bowline,</b> though she bears no great show of canvas. Mr. Van Beverout, Her Majesty's cruiser is about to put to sea." ...|$|E
50|$|The knot is also popular {{to create}} a {{makeshift}} harness in rescue operations. The two loops are used as leg loops to sit in. The knot can be further improved by adding two <b>bowlines</b> around a person's body {{to create a}} three-point harness.|$|R
60|$|The Carnatic was {{scarcely}} {{out of the}} way, before the Achilles was ready to take her place. This ship, having more room, had easily luffed to windward of the Plantagenet, simply letting go her <b>bowlines,</b> as her bows doubled on the admiral's stern, in order to check her way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see his eyes," [...] {{cried the}} captain cheerily; [...] "take a drag at the <b>bowlines,</b> {{and let her}} head {{up as much as}} she will, Mr. Leach, and never mind those sham topsails Take them in at once, sir; they do us, now, more harm than good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There wasn't much of me, certainly, {{forty years}} ago, Stowel; but I well {{remember}} the knack you had of making every robin, sheet, <b>bowline,</b> and thread do its duty, then, {{as you do}} to-day. By the way, {{can you tell me}} any thing of the Dover, this evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Prince's Dock is {{generally}} {{so filled with}} shipping, that the entrance of a new-comer is apt to occasion a universal stir among all the older occupants. The dock-masters, whose authority is declared by tin signs worn conspicuously over their hats, mount the poops and forecastles of the various vessels, and hail the surrounding strangers in all directions:--"Highlander ahoy! Cast off your <b>bowline,</b> and sheer alongside the Neptune!"--"Neptune ahoy! get out a stern-line, and sheer alongside the Trident!"--"Trident ahoy! get out a <b>bowline,</b> and drop astern of the Undaunted!" [...] And so it runs round like a shock of electricity; touch one, and you touch all. This kind of work irritates and exasperates the sailors to the last degree; {{but it is only}} one of the unavoidable inconveniences of inclosed docks, which are outweighed by innumerable advantages.|$|E
6000|$|So it's up and its over to Stornoway Bay, Pack it on! Crack it on! Try {{her with}} the stunsails! It's off on a <b>bowline</b> to Stornoway Bay, Where the liquor is good and the lasses are gay: [...] Waiting for their bully Jack, [...] Watching for him sailing back, Right across the Lowland sea.|$|E
6000|$|The people forward {{looked at}} each other, as they listened to this novel admonition, though they called out the {{customary}} [...] "ay, ay, sir," [...] as {{they went to the}} sheets, braces and <b>bowlines.</b> To them the passage of no Hell-Gate conveyed the idea of any particular terror, and with the one they were about to enter, they were much too familiar to care anything about it.|$|R
5000|$|The braces, <b>bowlines</b> shot away several times, {{also the}} {{staysail}} halyards. The running rigging very much shattered. The main topsail yard shot ... the foremast shot through about {{the collar of}} the mainstay, and another wound in the after part of the mast ... the mainmast shot about two thirds up from the deck and divided to the starboard. Ship making 11 inches of water an hour occasioned by two shots in the counter, under the water line.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's lubberly {{work for}} you, Greenly!" [...] said Sir Gervaise, smiling. [...] "A {{commander-in-chief}} heading {{up with the}} <b>bowlines</b> dragged, and his second and third ahead--not to say fourth--running off with the wind abeam! Now, if we can knock the Comte off a couple of points, in passing, all his fellows astern will follow, and the Warspite and Blenheim and Thunderer will slip by like girls in a country-dance! Send Bury down to the main-deck, with orders to be ready with those eighteens." ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{finding the}} line-and-sinker, with the spare {{end of a}} <b>bowline</b> we rigged a substitute; and {{sounding}} the well, found nothing to excite our alarm. Under certain circumstances, however, this sounding a ship's well is a nervous sort of business enough. 'Tis like feeling your own pulse in the last stage of a fever.|$|E
6000|$|So it's up and it's over to Stornoway Bay, [...] Pack it on! Crack it on! Try {{her with}} stunsails! [...] It's {{off on a}} <b>bowline</b> to Stornoway Bay, [...] Where the liquor is good and the lasses are gay, [...] Waiting for their bully Jack, [...] Watching for him sailing back, [...] Right across the Lowland Sea.|$|E
60|$|About nine, the Montauk met a {{large ship}} {{standing}} on <b>bowline,</b> with every thing set that would draw, and heaping the water under her bows. A few minutes after, Captain Truck, whose attention {{had been much}} diverted from the surrounding objects by the care of his ship, came near the group of passengers, and once more entered into conversation.|$|E
6000|$|When {{once the}} boat's head {{had been turned}} towards the ship, and the oars had bent again to their work, they came soon within shelter. When they had got close enough ropes were thrown out, caught and made fast; and then came {{down one of the}} <b>bowlines</b> which the seamen held ready along the rail of the lower deck. This was seized by the boatswain, who placed it round him under his armpits. Then, {{standing}} with the child in his arms he made ready to be pulled up. Pearl held out her arms to Harold, crying in fear: ...|$|R
6000|$|Though Dana sailed from Boston only {{three-quarters of}} a century ago, much that is at present {{obsolete}} was then in full sway. For instance, the old word larboard was still in use. He {{was a member of}} the larboard watch. The vessel was on the larboard tack. It was only the other day, because of its similarity in sound to starboard, that larboard was changed to port. Try to imagine [...] "All larboard <b>bowlines</b> on deck!" [...] being shouted down into the forecastle of a present day ship. Yet that was the call used on the Pilgrim to fetch Dana and the rest of his watch on deck.|$|R
60|$|The first {{ship that}} drew near the Plantagenet was the Carnatic, {{as a matter}} of course, she being the next in the line. This vessel, remarkable, as the {{commander-in-chief}} had observed, for never being out of the way, was not long in closing, though as she luffed up on the admiral's weather-quarter, to pass to windward, she let go all her top-sail <b>bowlines,</b> so as to deaden her way, making a sort of half-board. This simple evolution, as she righted her helm, brought her about fifty yards to windward of the Plantagenet, past which ship she surged slowly but steadily, the weather now permitting a conversation to be held at that distance, and by means of trumpets, with little or no effort of the voice.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{them are}} kept {{scrupulously}} neat and clean, and remind one of a well-scrubbed wooden platter, or an old oak table, upon which much wax and elbow vigor has been expended. Before the wind, they sail well; but on a <b>bowline,</b> owing to their broad hulls and flat bottoms, they make leeway at a sad rate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then bundle out of her, my fine fellow, {{as fast as}} you can for not a brace or a <b>bowline</b> {{shall be}} touched here, with my consent, for any such purpose. The ship is cleared--my hour is come--my {{passengers}} are on board--and America is my haven.--Let them that want me, catch me. That is what I call Vattel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it's up and it's over to Stornoway Bay, [...] Pack it on! Crack it on! Try {{her with}} the stun-sails! [...] It's off on a <b>bowline</b> to Stornoway Bay, [...] Where the liquor is good and the lasses are gay, [...] Waiting for their bully Jack, [...] Watching for him sailing back, [...] Right across the Lowland Sea." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{now stood}} up, {{and began to}} look for a proper picket to make fast to, when, in gazing about, I caught sight of the mast-heads of the {{shipping}} at the yard, and of the ensign under which I had so long served! These came over me, as a light-house comes over a mariner in distress at sea, and I thought there must be friends for me in that quarter. The sight gave me courage and strength, and I determined no old shipmate should hear of a blue-jacket's hanging himself on a picket, in a fit of the horrors. Casting off the <b>bowlines,</b> I replaced the handkerchief on my neck, and made the best of my way towards those blessed mast-heads, which, under God's mercy, were the means of preventing me from committing suicide.|$|R
50|$|In 1804 he was {{appointed}} to the 38-gun frigate , and in May 1805 was serving as first lieutenant under the command of Captain the Honourable Courtenay Boyle, in the Mediterranean. On the 4 May 1805, Boyle sighted a convoy of Spanish ships loaded with gunpowder at San Pedro, an anchorage east of Cape de Gata. Though under the protection of a fort, two armed schooners, and three gun and mortar launches, Downie was sent in a cutter to board the vessels while covered by the guns of Seahorse. Downie boarded and brought out a Spanish brig, laden with 1,170 quintals of powder while the Spanish gun-boats continued to fire on the Seahorse, damaging the main topgallant mast, shooting away several braces and <b>bowlines,</b> and killing a crewman. Seahorse then discontinued the engagement, wishing to leave the coast while the breeze and daylight lasted.|$|R
60|$|The {{movement}} of the flag-ship was stately, measured, and grand. For five minutes she held her way nearly due east, with the wind on her starboard quarter, meeting the tide in a direct line; until, having drawn sufficiently ahead of the fleet, she let fall her courses, sheeted home top-gallant-sails and royals, set her spanker, jibs, and stay-sails, and braced up sharp on a wind, with her head at south-southeast. This brought the tide well under her lee fore-chains, and set her rapidly off the land, and to windward. As she trimmed her sails, and steadied her <b>bowlines,</b> she fired a gun, made the numbers of the vessels in the offing to weigh, and to pass within hail. All this did Bluewater note, with the attention of an amateur, {{as well as with}} the critical analysis of a connoisseur.|$|R
