500|$|Aaliyah, who {{maintained}} a perfect 4.0 {{grade point average}} when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important {{to have something to}} fall back on." [...] She did this in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, [...] "when you pick a career it has to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> love".|$|E

2500|$|Director Marc Webb has {{described}} the film {{as more of a}} [...] "coming of age" [...] story as opposed to a [...] "rom-com". He stated, [...] "We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title – it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt".|$|E
2500|$|In a Rolling Stone {{interview}} in 2000, Rose mentioned {{that part of}} the delay of the album was him [...] "educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock", stating, [...] "It's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> did on a computer." [...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process because you have to get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on infinitely, which is what they've done." [...] Geffen A Tom Zutaut stated the record [...] "could have been out by September 2002".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone in February 2000, Rose played several songs of the upcoming album to reporters, including [...] "Chinese Democracy", [...] "Catcher in the Rye", [...] "I.R.S.", [...] "The Blues", [...] "There was a Time" [...] and [...] "Oklahoma". Rose mentioned {{that part of the}} delay of the new album was him 'educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock', stating that [...] "it's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> did on a computer." [...] Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti remixed by Beck and Trent Reznor. Rose mentioned that the expense of the record would be negated by the recording sessions yielding multiple albums, including a record that is [...] "more industrial and electronica-influenced than Chinese Democracy". At that point, the album had gone through multiple producers, including Youth, Moby, Mike Clink, Roy Thomas Baker, Eric Caudieux. At the time, Sean Beavan was producing, but Caram Costanzo and Axl Rose became the final credited producers on the album. The album had been completely re-recorded several times with varying musicians and producers. In a 2001 interview, Rose described the album as having [...] "all kinds of styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs" [...] and said that it was [...] "not industrial".|$|E

2500|$|Frusciante's musical {{style has}} evolved {{over the course of}} his career. His guitar playing employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso {{influences}} can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this. Frusciante brought a more melodic and textured sound to albums such as [...] Californication (1999), By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006). This contrasts with his previous abrasive approach in Mother's Milk, as well as his dry, funky and more docile arrangements on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. On Californication (1999) and By the Way (2002), Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from post-punk guitarist Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column, and bands such as Fugazi and The Cure. On By The Way, he wanted lead guitar to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could sing, his guitar playing was then influenced by John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Johnny Marr of The Smiths and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division. He initially wanted to take another direction and [...] intended the record to be made up of [...] "these punky, rough songs", drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as The Germs and The Damned. However, this was discouraged by producer Rick Rubin, and he instead built upon Californications (1999) melodically driven style. During the recording of Stadium Arcadium (2006), he moved away from his New Wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Hendrix and Van Halen.|$|E

I was wrong to say that you had plotted to get me to meet him; it was not the literal truth, but I had good grounds to think it. All that has {{happened}} has been through your machinations. I should have gone on hating him always if you had not worked on my feelings in that way. You have made me forgive that man, and I almost hate you for it. If the result should <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> little expect--if it brings an end to our friendship--you will only have yourself to thank for it." ...|$|E

He understands my ways of doing business; and, in fact, carries things out in first-rate style. Why, he'd be worth his weight in gold, only for the knack he has of keeping the young men in the shop in order. Poor devils! they don't know how he does it; but there's a particular look of Mr. Mannion's that's as bad as transportation and hanging to them, whenever they see it. I'll pledge you my word of honour he's never had a day's illness, or made a single mistake, since he's been with me. He's a quiet, steady-going, regular dragon at his work--he is! And then, so obliging in other things. I've only got to say to him: 'Here's Margaret at home for the holidays;' or, 'Here's Margaret {{a little out of}} sorts, and going to be nursed at home for the half-year--what's to be done about keeping up her lessons? I can't pay for a governess (bad lot, governesses!) and school too.'--I've only got to say that; and up gets Mannion from his books and his fireside at home, in the evening--which begins to <b>be</b> <b>something,</b> <b>you</b> know, to a man of his time of life--and turns tutor for me, gratis; and a first-rate tutor, too! That's what I call having a treasure! And yet, though he's been with us for years, Mrs. S. there won't take to him!--I defy her or anybody else to say why, or wherefore!" ...|$|E
