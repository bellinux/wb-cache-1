40|$|As {{part of the}} National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS), USDA:APHIS:Veterinary Services {{conducted}} a national study of beef production, the Beef Cow/Calf Health and Productivity Audit (CHAPA). This {{study was designed to}} provide both participants and the industry with information on cow/calf health, productivity, and management practices. Data for Part III: Beef Cow/Calf Health & Health Management were collected by federal and state veterinary officers (VMO's) in 18 of the largest cow/calf producing states between January 4 and February 28, 1993. These 18 states represented 70 percent of the U. S. beef cow inventory. Participating producers had five or more beef cows or beef replacement heifers and fifty percent or more of their 1992 calf crop born between January 1 and June 30, 1992. Nearly forty-seven percent of operations removed bulls from the female breeding herd for at least one estrus cycle to manipulate calving dates. Forty-seven percent of operations that purchased, leased, or borrowed bulls semen tested the bulls. Thirty-two percent of operations fed replacement heifers separately {{from the rest of the}} herd. The average per-calf weaning weight of calves weaned in 1992 was 502 pounds; the average value was $ 451. 15. For breeding-age females, the average weight per animal sold was 988 pounds; the average value was $ 549. 44. For breeding-age males, the average weight per animal sold was 1, 494 pounds; the average value was $ 1, 154. 04. The largest single cause of total cattle death loss was calving problems (26 percent of death loss). Two of the top conditions producers believed had a significant economic impact on the cow/calf operation included internal and external parasites. Other such conditions included late reproduction, pinkeye, and calf scours. Operation-level vaccine usage varied by animal class.

40|$|Abstract Background Reproduction is {{the single}} {{greatest}} factor limiting beef cattle production. Previous research on beef suckler luteal activity has largely focused on the mechanisms, and duration, of postpartum anoestrus. However, the temporal pattern of luteal activity after resumption of post-partum ovarian activity, {{and the impact of}} pattern type on days open (DO) in purebred beef suckler cows, are unknown. Methods Progesterone concentration was measured in milk samples taken thrice weekly from 120 lactations, in 87 animals, on 3 farms, over two years. Onset of luteal activity (OLA) was defined as the first day milk progesterone concentration exceeded 3 ng/ml for two successive measurements, or exceeded 5 ng/ml once. It was defined as delayed if it occurred more than 61 days postpartum. A short initial luteal phase consisted of progesterone concentrations which exceeded 3 ng/ml for fewer than 4 sequential measurements. Temporal progesterone patterns were classified as: 1) Normal cyclicity; 2) Cessation of luteal activity; 3) Prolonged luteal activity; 4) Erratic phase: failure to conform to 1, 2 or 3. Data concerning parity, previous calving interval, <b>breeding</b> values, <b>calf</b> birth and 200 -d weight were obtained from the Norwegian Beef Cattle Recording System database. Results The mean (SD) OLA was 41 d (20). Parity and calf birth weight were inversely correlated with OLA. Delayed OLA occurred in 14. 4 % of lactations. A short first luteal phase occurred in 61. 5 % of lactations, but this was unrelated to irregular luteal phase occurrence, pregnancy or DO. Irregular luteal phases occurred in 22 % of lactations. The irregularities were: prolonged luteal phase (11 %); cessation of luteal activity (5 %); erratic luteal activity (6 %). Early OLA was associated with prolonged luteal phases. DO was positively correlated with irregular luteal phases and negatively correlated with calf 200 -d weight. Conclusions This study demonstrates that irregular luteal phases negatively affect reproductive performance in purebred beef suckler cattle. A moderate incidence of irregular luteal phases was seen in the study population. Whilst a positive relationship was seen between OLA and DO, unfavourable associations between early OLA and incidence of irregular luteal phases should be considered when developing breeding programmes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Four {{experiments}} evaluated protein supplementation in cow/calf {{systems and}} heifer development diets. In the first experiment, cows grazed dormant Sandhills range and received either supplement or no supplement in late gestation and were fed hay or grazed subirrigated meadow after calving. Heifers from supplemented cows were heavier from weaning through {{three years of}} age, had greater pregnancy rates, and more calved during the initial 21 days of calving. ^ A subsequent experiment evaluated effects of protein supplementation of cows grazing dormant range or corn crop residue on cow and progeny performance. Cows that grazed corn stalks were heavier and had greater BCS before weaning and the subsequent breeding season, and had higher pregnancy rates than cows that grazed winter range. Cow BW and BCS prior to calving and <b>breeding,</b> and <b>calf</b> weaning BW was greater for calves from supplemented cows that grazed range. Final BW of steer progeny was heavier if dams grazed corn residue. Dam supplementation increased the proportion of steers grading USDA Choice. Heifer pre-breeding BW was greater for heifers from supplemented cows that grazed range than unsupplemented cows. ^ Additional experiments compared protein source during heifer development on reproductive performance. Heifers in the first experiment were fed dried distillers grains (DDG) as an energy source during development. The control supplement contained similar crude protein, energy, and lipid but differed in protein degradability. Growth, BCS, and age at puberty were similar between treatments. Heifers fed DDG had greater conception and pregnancy rates. ^ A final experiment evaluated the effects of feeding soybeans or DDG on reproductive characteristics of heifers. Pregnancy rate was unaffected by supplement, but heifers fed soybeans had greater dominant follicle diameter. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) mRNA expression of the angiogenic isoform VEGF 120 and the anti-angiogenic isoform VEGF 164 b were greater in granulosa cells from heifers fed DDG compared to heifers fed soybeans, expression of the dominant angiogenic isoform VEGF 164 was not affected by treatment. ^ In summary, these experiments support a fetal programming effect of protein supplementation in cow/calf systems, increased fertility in heifers supplemented with DDG, and differential VEGF gene expression due to supplement. ...|$|R
40|$|Dairy cattle {{breeding}} systems {{have a common}} goal of improved milk production. Extensive research {{has been carried out}} to increase our understanding of the biology behind milk production. This biological information has then been used to improve the prediction of a cow 2 ̆ 7 s milk production. This thesis explores two ways in which milk production can be better understood and predicted. The first study investigates whether the sex of the calf that initiates a lactation has an impact on milk yield during that lactation as well as whether the sex of calves in different parities affects milk yield during that lactation. The second study investigates the additive and dominance effects of four quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) for milk fat yield and evaluates whether including the QTN in genomic prediction analyses as either a random covariate, fixed covariate or fixed class improves estimated <b>breeding</b> values (EBV). <b>Calf</b> sex was shown to have an effect on milk yield in each of the first three lactations, with heifer calves resulting in a higher milk yield than bull calves. Some of the effect of calf sex is explained by a greater number of days-in-milk for a cow when a female calf was born, as evidenced by a decrease in the effect of calf sex when days-in-milk was fitted in the model. While days-in-milk explained some of the effect, there was still some effect of calf sex within and across lactations. Dominance was observed at the majority of QTN, suggesting that milk fat yield EBV could be improved by the correct modeling of dominance in prediction models. Including QTN in genomic prediction models did not significantly change prediction accuracy, however including QTN significantly decreased bias in many cases, such as when AGPAT 6, a QTN with observed over-dominance, was included as a fixed class effect. There was evidence of epistatic interactions between the QTN PLAG 1 and AGPAT 6, PLAG 1 and GHR, and DGAT 1 and GHR. This thesis shows there is the potential to improve modeling of economically important traits.

The use of 28 d average daily gains as predictors of carcass traits is a new concept in the beef industry. This procedure could benefit feedyard managers in optimizing the performance of cattle being fed and in lower discounts from the packers. The cattle evaluated were part of the Angelton Project and consisted of 3 / 4 Angus 1 / 4 Brahman cattle, 3 / 4 Brahman 1 / 4 Angus cattle, and F 2 crosses (n = 440). These cattle are compromised of 35 full sib embryo transfer families and were evaluated over a five year period for growth and slaughter traits. The cattle were placed in simulated feedyard conditions for at least 140 d and weighed every 28 d for five periods to monitor gains and performance. After the feeding period was concluded, the cattle were slaughtered and data were collected. Among the traits measured were quality grade, marbling, and actual fat. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the viability and practicality of using the five 28 d average daily gain periods as predictors of carcass traits. The mean ADGs were calculated for the total population as well as by <b>calf</b> <b>breeding</b> code. The ADGs peaked at 56 d for the total population and for the 3 / 4 Angus 1 / 4 Brahman, and the 3 / 4 Brahman 1 / 4 Angus breed groups.

40|$|Two hundred forty dairy {{producers}}, both {{rural and}} urban producers in the four major towns representing the Shashemene-Dilla area in southern Ethiopia, were selected using a multi-stage sampling techniques, {{with the objective of}} characterizing dairy production, processing/handling, marketing systems as well as to prioritize constraints and opportunities for dairy development in the area. To characterize dairy marketing systems in the study area, a Rapid Market Appraisal (RMA) technique was employed. Dairy marketing systems were studied with the help of topical guidelines. Dairy producers were interviewed using a pre-tested and structured formal questionnaire. Two major dairy production systems, namely the urban and mixed crop-livestock systems were identified, and again classified into two categories based on the major crops grown as a cereal crop producing and enset-coffee producing areas. The average family size of urban and rural dairy producers was 7. 19 ± 0. 26 and 7. 58 ± 0. 23 persons, respectively. Dairy contributed about half of the income of urban producers but it made up only 1. 6 % of the total income of families in the mixed crop-livestock production system. Average farm size of households in the mixed system was 1. 14 ± 0. 99 ha, while more than 97 % of the urban producers use their own residence compound for dairying, which is only 200 - 400 square meters. Average herd size per household in the cereal based mixed system (3. 8 ± 0. 42) was higher than in the enset-coffee based systems (2. 3 ± 0. 36). Out of the total herds of urban producers, 32 % of cattle were local cows while 19 % were crossbred. Husbandry practices like feeding, watering, housing, <b>breeding,</b> milking, <b>calf</b> rearing, waste management, and record keeping were also different between the two productions systems. An estimated total of 9, 645, 020 litres of milk was produced annually from 4463 small and medium farms in the four towns. The majority of producers (61. 7 %) in the mixed crop-livestock system process milk at home, while the majority of urban producers (79. 2 %) produced milk for sale. An informal dairy marketing system was the only marketing system in the area. Different market channels and market outlets were identified for different dairy commodities, butter being the one having the longest channel. Prices of dairy commodities were influenced by different factors like season, access to market/distance from towns, fasting and non-fasting days, festivals and holidays, level of supply vs. purchasing ability of the urban dwellers, and quality of dairy products. Constraints for dairy development in the area included: availability and costs of feeds, shortage of farm land, discouraging marketing system, waste disposal problems, genotype improvement problem, poor extension and animal health services, and knowledge gap regarding improved dairy production systems. The rapid urbanization, subsequent increase in human population and standard of living of the urban dwellers especially the regional town Awassa as well as the rest three zonal towns can be considered as a good prospect for the development of dairy in the area. Dairying in the studied areas can be improved by solving major problems of smallholder dairy producers through services related to feed supply, access to land, good marketing systems, allocating place for waste handling and management and through provisions of veterinary, artificial insemination (AI), credit, extension, and training services at reasonable time and cost. Moreover, as market is the deriving force to the production and productivity of dairying, encouraging private investors to establish dairy processing plants in the area may be an option as a permanent market outlet for both {{rural and urban}} dairy producers through an organized milk collection schemes.
