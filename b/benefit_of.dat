40|$|Correlations {{between the}} returns of US stocks and {{international}} stocks were higher recently {{than in the}} past, reaching 0. 86 during the 60 months ending in December 2003. Today’s investors note the high correlations between US and international stocks and doubt the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> global diversification. We argue that the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> global diversification remain high and that the correlation between US and international stocks is a misleading measure <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> global diversification. This is for two reasons. First, the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> global diversification depend {{not only on the}} correlation between the returns of US and international stocks but also on the standard deviations of these returns. Second, we tend to have poor intuition about the link between correlation and the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> diversification. A 0. 86 correlation seems high enough to eliminate the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> diversification, but even correlations much higher than 0. 86 are associated with substantial <b>benefits.</b> Dispersion <b>of</b> returns is a better measure <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> diversification because it accounts for the effects of both correlation and standard deviation and because it provides an intuitive measure <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> diversification. We present the relationship between correlation, standard deviation, and dispersion. Anyone following the news cannot escape the impression that correlations among global stock returns are higher now than in the past. Rallies in U...|$|R
5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

The highest score of 1.00 was given to the “very strong” agreement with the “correct” statements about environmental effects of conventional and organic agriculture, and health effects of organic vegetables, which also implies that the concerned respondents perceived the environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> organic agriculture and health <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> organic vegetables highly and correctly. The lowest score of 0.2 was assigned to “very little” agreement with the “correct” statements, implying that the concerned respondents minimally perceived the environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> organic agriculture and health <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> organic vegetables. The calculated average scores of the perceptions <b>of</b> the environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> organic agriculture and health <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> organic vegetables were grouped and interpreted as follows: very low[*]=[*] 0.01 – 0.20, low[*]=[*] 0.21 – 0.40, moderate[*]=[*] 0.41 – 0.60, high[*]=[*] 0.61 – 0.80, and very high[*]=[*] 0.81 – 1.00.|$|R
