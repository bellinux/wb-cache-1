5000|$|An operand is two bytes long, {{typically}} representing {{an address}} as a 4-bit nibble denoting a <b>base</b> <b>register</b> and a 12-bit displacement {{relative to the}} contents of that register, in the range 000 - FFF (shown here as hexadecimal numbers). The address corresponding to that operand is {{the contents of the}} specified general-purpose register plus the displacement. For example, an MVC instruction that moves 256 bytes (with length code 255 in hexadecimal as FF) from <b>base</b> <b>register</b> 7, plus displacement 000, to <b>base</b> <b>register</b> 8, plus displacement 001, would be coded as the 6-byte instruction [...] "D2FF 8001 7000" [...] (operator/length/address1/address2).|$|E
50|$|The CPU had 15 index registers, a four-bit field (x) allowed {{selection}} of one index register as the <b>base</b> <b>register.</b> Operand addresses {{were determined by}} adding {{the contents of the}} selected <b>base</b> <b>register</b> and the 10-bit displacement field (m). Instructions that modified or stored index registers used a four-bit field (xo) to select that index register.|$|E
50|$|Loads {{and stores}} can access {{constants}} in code, local {{variables in the}} stack, or items in a data structure. They calculate the address by adding a 12-bit signed offset to a <b>base</b> <b>register.</b> If the <b>base</b> <b>register</b> is zero, the data or constants can be in low memory, or high (negative offset) memory, such as ROM.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the 32-bit 80386 processor, the 16-bit {{general-purpose}} <b>registers,</b> <b>base</b> <b>registers,</b> index registers, instruction pointer, and FLAGS register, but not the segment registers, were expanded to 32 bits. The nomenclature represented this by prefixing an [...] "E" [...] (for [...] "extended") to the register names in x86 assembly language. Thus, the AX register corresponds to the lowest 16 bits of the new 32-bit EAX register, SI corresponds to the lowest 16 bits of ESI, and so on. The general-purpose <b>registers,</b> <b>base</b> <b>registers,</b> and index registers can all be used as the base in addressing modes, and all of those registers except for the stack pointer can be used as the index in addressing modes.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to faster components, two significant design improvements were incorporated: <b>base</b> <b>registers</b> and additional hardware instructions. The two 18-bit <b>base</b> <b>registers</b> (one for instruction storage {{and one for}} data storage) permitted dynamic relocation: as a program got swapped {{in and out of}} main memory, its instructions and data could be placed anywhere each time it got reloaded. To support multiprogramming, the 1108 had memory protection using two <b>base</b> and limit <b>registers,</b> with 512-word resolution. One was called the I-bank or instruction bank, and the other the D-bank or data bank. If the I-bank and D-bank of a program were put into different physical banks of memory, a 1/2 microsecond advantage accrued, called [...] "alternate bank timing." [...] The 1108 also introduced the Processor State Register, or PSR. In {{addition to}} controlling the <b>Base</b> <b>Registers,</b> it included various control [...] "bits" [...] that enabled the various Storage Protection features, allowed selection of either the User or Exec set of A, X & R registers, and enabled [...] "Guard Mode" [...] for user programs. Guard Mode prevented user programs from execution of Executive Only [...] "privileged" [...] instructions, and from accessing memory locations outside the program's allocated memory.|$|R

It is a vital component to optimize for best performance, area and power dissipation. The purpose of this thesis is to implement a full custom, low power and area efficient register file for an Atmel 32 -bit microcontroller. The benchmark design is a flip-flop <b>based</b> <b>register</b> file. This thesis work is carried out in two phases – Literature study phase and Implementation phase. During the literature study phase, a number of cell topologies for SRAM <b>based</b> <b>register</b> files were explored. A few different cell topologies were selected for implementation and the power dissipation was estimated. Apart from different cell topologies, different register files architectures such as time-multiplexed and partitioned register files have been implemented.
