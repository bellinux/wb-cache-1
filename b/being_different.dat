5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of <b>being</b> <b>different,</b> becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as <b>being</b> <b>different</b> from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself {{with varying degrees of}} success. Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried to be seen as serious and determined.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during the}} time when Chris and Stewie {{were lost in the}} woods, Chris {{promises}} to ask out Ellen, a school classmate with Down syndrome. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly falls apart. Chris admits that he had bought into a stereotype of people with Down syndrome <b>being</b> <b>different,</b> and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had promised to do.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of extraordinary <b>beings,</b> <b>different</b> and even abominable, {{as is the}} case of toads, frogs and snakes, is a classic in anthropological research and has been studied in depth by Douglas (1996) who points out that these beings should be respected, not merely because they were filthy and disgusting but because they were emblematic victims.|$|R

5|$|The {{breakthrough}} with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory. They realised that a {{slow neutron}} reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce {{substantial amounts of}} plutonium-239 as a by-product. This is because uranium-238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a short-lived new isotope, uranium-239. The new isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with an atomic mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element's nucleus also emits an electron and becomes a new element with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissile—readily fissioned by both slow and fast neutrons, with the added advantage of <b>being</b> <b>different</b> from uranium, and therefore could be chemically separated from it. Bretscher even devised a chemical method to separate.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{different ways}} of understanding compositions of <b>being,</b> and <b>different</b> methods for discerning them. It considers non-metaphysical (physical, scientistic, phenomenological, abstractionist) interpretations in order to decide whether metaphysics can use them to discover and gain knowledge of the elements that determine the deepest structure of beings, and which set their mode of being. The paper also shows how much the metaphysical method for discerning the compositions of <b>being</b> is <b>different</b> from non-metaphysical methods...|$|R

25|$|Protons and {{neutrons}} {{were then}} grouped together as nucleons because {{they both have}} nearly the same mass and interact in nearly the same way, if the electromagnetic interaction is neglected.

25|$|Later reports {{claimed that}} the film was {{very similar to the}} game Assassin's Creed.

25|$|In {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics, isospin (isotopic spin, isobaric spin) is a quantum number {{related to the}} strong interaction.

25|$|A {{computer}} program in execution is normally treated as <b>being</b> <b>different</b> {{from the data}} the program operates on. However, in some cases, this distinction is blurred when a {{computer program}} modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed {{as part of the}} same program. Self-modifying code is possible for programs written in machine code, assembly language, Lisp, C, COBOL, PL/1, and Prolog.|$|E
25|$|Australian English {{began to}} diverge from British English after the {{founding}} of the Colony of New South Wales in 1788 and was recognised as <b>being</b> <b>different</b> from British English by 1820. It arose from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of mutually intelligible dialectal regions of the British Isles and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English.|$|E
25|$|Note {{further that}} the (directed) Dynkin {{diagrams}} Bn and Cn {{give rise to}} the same Weyl group (hence Coxeter group), because they differ as directed graphs, but agree as undirected graphs – direction matters for root systems {{but not for the}} Weyl group; this corresponds to the hypercube and cross-polytope <b>being</b> <b>different</b> regular polytopes but having the same symmetry group.|$|E

2500|$|All {{schools of}} Tibetan Buddhism rely on Mahākāla. He is {{depicted}} {{in a number of}} variations, each with distinctly different qualities and aspects.

25|$|In addition, {{there is}} no {{theoretical}} reason why non-tradable goods and services such as property costs should be equal in different countries: this is the theoretical reason for PPPs <b>being</b> <b>different</b> from market exchange rates over time.

25|$|Hay's tenure with Ealing was a {{box office}} success and his films were {{critically}} acclaimed.
