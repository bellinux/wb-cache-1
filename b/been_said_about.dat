25|$|Research into speech {{perception}} (SP) has by {{no means}} explained {{every aspect of the}} processes involved. A lot of what has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> SP is a matter of theory. Several theories have been devised to develop some of the above-mentioned and other unclear issues. Not all of them give satisfactory explanations of all problems, however the research they inspired has yielded a lot of useful data.|$|E

Spielberg responded, saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound {{military}} tactics and strict historical accuracy for dramatic effect. Some other technical errors were also made, often censored, including the mistaken reversed orientation of the beach barriers; the tripod obstructions with a mine at the apex.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E

500|$|Raymond Mortimer, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, said that [...] "James Bond is what every man {{would like to}} be, and what every woman would like between her sheets"; {{meanwhile}} the critic for The Times considered that after The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "On Her Majesty's Secret Service constitutes a substantial, if not quite a complete, recovery." [...] In {{the view of the}} reviewer, it was enough of a recovery for them to point out that [...] "it is time, perhaps, to forget the much exaggerated things which have <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> sex, sadism and snobbery, and return to the simple, indisputable fact that Mr. Fleming is a most compelling story-teller." [...] Marghanita Laski, writing in The Times Literary Supplement thought that [...] "the new James Bond we've been meeting of late [...] somehow gentler, more sentimental, less dirty." [...] However, she considered that [...] "it really is time to stop treating Ian Fleming as a Significant Portent, and to accept him as a good, if rather vulgar thriller-writer, well suited to his times and to us his readers." ...|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjective}} events {{allow students}} more creativity than the objective events. The speech event {{is divided into}} prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: [...] "It has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> our modern times that, 'Invention {{is the mother of}} necessity.' Please discuss.", [...] "Math has been described as the universal language. Discuss." [...] and [...] "Why is light, light and dark, dark?" [...] In the interview, the students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment. Questions range from: [...] "Who is your role model?" [...] to [...] "How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?" [...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.|$|E

500|$|By {{the second}} half of {{communist}} rule, several new approaches in the critical assessment of Creangă's literature were emerging. His work became a main topic of critical interest and the sole subject of many works, to the point where Nicolae Manolescu assessed that [...] "everything has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Creangă". Within this exegetic phenomenon, an original interpretation of his stories from an esoteric perspective was written by philosopher Vasile Lovinescu as Creangă și Creanga de aur ("Creangă and the Golden Bough"). During the final two decades of communism, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, the recovery of nationalist discourse into official dogma also encouraged the birth of Protochronism. In one of its aspects, theorized by cultural historian Edgar Papu, this approach controversially reevaluated various Romanian writers, Creangă included, presenting them as figures who anticipated most developments on the world stage. Papu's own conclusion about [...] "Harap Alb", outlined in a 1983 volume, depicted Creangă as a direct predecessor of Italian semiotician Umberto Eco and his celebrated volume The Open Work—a conclusion which literary historian Florin Mihăilescu has seen as proof of Papu's [...] "exegetic obsession", lacking in [...] "sense of humor, not just sense of reality." [...] One of Papu's disciples, national communist ideologue Dan Zamfirescu, claimed that Creangă was equal to, or even more important than world classics Homer, William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, while asserting that the eponymous protagonist of [...] "Ivan Turbincă" [...] stands as [...] "the character who dominates world history in our century". Left outside the scope of this critical interest, the [...] "corrosives" [...] were left out of new Creangă readers (such as Iorgu Iordan's 1970 edition), being, according to a 1976 essay by scholar George Munteanu, [...] "still unpublishable" [...] for lack of [...] "a general level of aesthetic education" [...] among Romanians.|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol." [...] The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment.|$|E

These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran, two geniuses of song (as they were then called), sublime, yet imperfect.

2500|$|Emotionally, {{both the}} Packers and Cowboys players were spent. In the Packers' locker room, the players openly wept. Kramer told interviewers, [...] "Many things have <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Coach (Lombardi). [...] And {{he is not}} always {{understood}} by those who quote him. The players understand. [...] This is one beautiful man." [...] Packers Linebacker Ray Nitschke developed frostbite in his feet, causing his toenails to fall off and his toes to turn purple. Bart Starr had frostbite on his fingers and several Packer players were suffering from flu-like symptoms. Cowboys George Andrie, Willie Townes, and Dick Daniels also suffered frostbite from the game.|$|E

Coolidge, famous for his {{opposition}} to the right of police to strike, won a place on the Republican ticket, but the party's nominee, and the eventual winner of the 1920 election, was the U.S. Senator from Ohio, Warren G. Harding. He sounded a very different note in mid-August. An interviewer wrote that [...] "his jaws fairly snapped" [...] when he said that [...] "too much has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Bolshevism in America. It is quite true that there are enemies of Government within our borders. However, I believe their number has been greatly magnified.

Tryon went down with his ship, his last reported words being [...] "It is all my fault". Tryon was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a supremely competent yet radical officer, but with a strong and sometimes overbearing personality. This manner was felt to be a contributory cause to the accident. For instance, an article in Society Journal Talk in July 1893 (following the accident) said, [...] "Much has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> George Tryon's charm of manner, {{and the rest of}} it, but in truth he was, at any rate when officially engaged, a very brusque and dictatorial man.
