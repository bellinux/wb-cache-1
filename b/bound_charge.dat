2500|$|When an {{electric}} field {{is applied to}} a dielectric material its molecules respond by forming microscopic electric dipoles – their atomic nuclei move a tiny distance {{in the direction of}} the field, while their electrons move a tiny distance in the opposite direction.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of the Columbic force on {{piezoelectric}} fracture. <b>Bound</b> <b>charges</b> emerge on the upper and lower surfaces of a permeable crack when a piezoelectric solid with the crack is subjected to far-field mechanical/electric loading. Taking into account the Columbic force between the <b>bound</b> <b>charges,</b> we obtain a non-linear equation governing the normal component of electric displacement () 102 xD on the crack faces. The results show that () 102 xD is, in general, not a constant along the crack faces and depends on the mechanical/electric loading conditions, the crack profile and the material properties outside and inside the crack. Furthermore, we examine the Columbic force under low mechanical/electric loads and then discuss {{the effect of}} the Columbic force on the fracture behaviour of piezoelectric materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{an inner}} product space S we {{consider}} the complete lattice of orthogonally closed subspaces (denoted by F (S)) and the orthomodular poset of splitting subspaces (denoted by E(S)). We recall that E(S) coincides with F (S) if, and only if, S is a Hilbert space [1]. It is shown that only ‘free’ charges can exist on F (S) when S is incomplete [2]. Strongly dense inner product spaces are introduced, and it is shown that for such inner product spaces the state space of F (S) is affinely homeomorphic to the face consisting of the free states on F (S) (i. e. the singular states on B(S), where B(S) is the algebra of bounded operators on S) [4]. The range of <b>bounded</b> <b>charges</b> on F (S) is investigated and it is shown that this is always convex. This result is used to exhibit a counterexample of a regular charge on F (H) (where H is a Hilbert space) which is not completely-additive [3]. Regular <b>bounded</b> <b>charges</b> on E(S) are characterized as follows: “Every regular <b>bounded</b> <b>charge</b> on E(S) is the restriction of a normal functional on B(S) ”. However, it is shown that the set of regular <b>bounded</b> <b>charges</b> need not be sequentially complete when S is not complete [5]. This {{is in contrast to}} the situation when we take S to be a Hilbert space. The Vitali-Hahn-Saks theorem for B(H) is also discussed. It is shown that this theorem cannot be carried over directly to the non-commutative case. In fact, the signed-measure version of the Vitali-Hahn-Saks theorem fails for B(H) when H is infinite dimensional [6]. On the other-hand, if we restrict to positive measures, the Vitali-Hahn-Saks theorem holds for the projection lattice of a Hilbert space, but not for the projection logic of an incomplete inner product space...|$|R
2500|$|Gauss's law {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} a static electric field and the electric charges that cause it: The static electric field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges. In the field line description, electric field lines begin only at positive electric charges and end only at negative electric charges. [...] 'Counting' the number of field lines passing through a closed surface, therefore, yields the total charge (including <b>bound</b> <b>charge</b> due to polarization of material) enclosed by that surface divided by dielectricity of free space (the vacuum permittivity). More technically, it relates the electric flux through any hypothetical closed [...] "Gaussian surface" [...] to the enclosed electric charge.|$|E

His first feud in the WWF was with Heenan's former muscle <b>bound</b> <b>charge</b> [...] "Mr. Wonderful" [...] Paul Orndorff (who Heenan had dropped after Rude joined the Family), before starting {{one of his most}} famous feuds with Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts. Rude had a routine where, before the match, he would make a show of removing his robe while insulting the males in the crowd (usually calling them [...] "fat", [...] "out of shape" [...] or [...] "sweathogs") and, after his victories, he would kiss a woman that Heenan picked from the fans. One of Rude's trademarks was his specially airbrushed tights that he wore during matches. In the Roberts angle, Rude tried to get Roberts' real-life wife, Cheryl, to comply (though not knowing when Heenan chose her that she was in fact the wife of Jake [...] "The Snake"). After Mrs Roberts rejected him and revealed who she was there to see, Rude got angry (after she slapped him) and grabbed her wrist, berating her on the microphone when Roberts ran from the dressing room to make the save. To retaliate a few days later, Rude came to the ring with a likeness of Cheryl stenciled on the front of his tights. A furious Roberts charged the ring and stripped Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave him naked (as indicated by black-spot censoring Rude's genital area), although the live audience saw him actually stripped to a g-string.|$|E
