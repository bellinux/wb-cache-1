2500|$|In August 2017, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fifth generation" [...] or [...] "Gen5". The revisions centered on ergonomics and improving reliability. Many parts of fifth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The two fifth-generation models announced were the Glock 17 and Glock 19, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum. Some conspicuous changes on the fifth-generation models are: ambidextrous slide stop levers, nDLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) surface finish for barrel and slide, a barrel featuring conventional land-and-groove rifling (called the “Glock Marksman Barrel” by Glock) rather than the polygonal rifling used in earlier models, a deeper recessed barrel crown, omission of the finger grooves on the grip, a flared magazine well, and a reintroduction of a (half moon shaped) cutout on the bottom front of the grip. The locking <b>block</b> <b>pin</b> located above the trigger pin that was introduced in the third-generation is omitted. Many internal parts were less conspicuously revised.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this article is to report the {{efficacy}} of the extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> and additional intrafocal pinning technique applied to cases whose mallet fractures were not reduced with extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> alone. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 14 digits with 14 patients who were treated with the extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> and additional intrafocal pinning technique. There were eight men and six women with an average age of 34 years. The average articular surface involvement was 52 %. The average follow-up was 16 months and the mean time from injury to operation was 23 days. Results: All the cases achieved anatomic reduction of fractures. By Crawford’s classification, 9 were excellent and 5 were good. The average active fl exion of the distal interphalangeal joint was 78 degrees and the average extension loss was 1. 8 degrees. Bone union was observed in all cases after a postoperative mean of 38. 4 days. Complications such as skin necrosis, fracture of bony fragments, and nail-plate deformity were not found. Conclusions: Additional intrafocal pinning technique is considered a simple and useful method to obtain anatomic reduction of mallet fractures in cases where extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> alone is insufficient to restore the anatomic configuration of the articular surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{operative}} treatment of mallet fractures {{of more than}} one third of the articular surface is controversial. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the complications and functional outcome of extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> technique. Thirty-six consecutive patients with mallet fractures that involved more than one third of the joint surface were treated by extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> a median of 3 days after injury (range 0 - 35, mean 7). Clinical outcome was graded according to Crawford's criteria. At a median follow-up of 16. 5 months (range 2. 5 - 52, mean 20) 23 patients had an excellent or good result, 11 patients had a fair, and 2 patients a poor, clinical outcome according to Crawford's criteria. None of the patients complained of pain. The median extension loss was 0 degrees (range 0 - 20, mean 4) and the median flexion was 70 degrees (range 30 - 95, mean 68). Eight patients had operative or direct postoperative complications including superficial infection (n = 6), loss of Kirschner wire (K-wire) fixation (n = 1), and K-wire mal position (n = 1). The extension <b>block</b> <b>pinning</b> technique is a minimally invasive method of treating mallet fractures with low morbidity and a good functional outcome...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{several questions}} concerning the distribution of routing tracks across an FPGA. Essentially we are investigating if the intrinsic properties of circuits lead them to map most efficiently to a certain routing architecture. The first question addressed {{is whether or not}} there should there be a directional bias to the routing. If so, what amount of bias is best? Figure 1 (a) illustrates a directionally-biased FPGA in which the horizontal channels contain more tracks than the vertical channels. Commercial FPGAs with both unbiased routing [2, 3] and biased routing [4, 5] exist, so this question has clear commercial relevance. To ensure our results are applicable to the broadest class of FPGAs, we determine the best directional bias for FPGAs with different logic <b>block</b> <b>pin</b> positions and aspect ratios. The second question we address is whether all channels in the same direction in an FPGA should be the same width or whether some channels should be wider than others to facilitate rout- 2 ing in congested regions. We refer to architectures in which the channels in some regions are wider than the channels in others as non-uniform routing architectures, as illustrated in Figure 1 (b...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: The aim of {{our study}} was to compare {{postoperative}} analgesic efficacy, {{and the extent of}} sensory and motor blockade of levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, and bupivacaine administered in a combined psoas compartment-sciatic nerve block (PCSNB) for total hip arthroplasty. Methods: Forty-five patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia combined with PCSNB, were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mL levobupivacaine 3 mg/mL, 50 mL ropivacaine 4. 5 mg/mL or 50 mL bupivacaine 3 mg/mL with epinephrine. Postoperative, the pain intensity at rest, the degree of motor block (Modified Bromage Scale) and the extent of sensory <b>block</b> (<b>pin</b> prick test) were recorded at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours following initial injection in a double blind fashion. Results: The postoperative pain intensity was low and did not differ between groups, except for a significantly lower pain intensity in group ropivacaine compared with group levobupivacaine at 4 hours. Five patients (11 %), equally divided over three groups, needed parenteral rescue opiates postoperatively. The extent of sensory block was not different between the three groups. In each group the majority of patients showed no sensory block in dermatome L 1. Group levobupivacaine initially showed the least motor impairment. Motor impairment was found to be significantly higher in bupivacaine group compared with both ropivacaine and levobupivacaine groups at 12 (P = 0. 012) and 48 hours (P = 0. 003). Conclusions: Levobupivacaine, bupivacaine and ropivacaine are equally effective for PCSNB in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. Residual pain {{may be due to the}} lack of sensory block in dermatome L 1, suggesting that modification of this technique should be considered for this type of surgery. © 2008 World Institute of Pain...|$|E

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the mechanical properties of piano <b>pin</b> <b>blocks.</b> Three <b>pin</b> <b>block</b> types were used, all made from multi-layered beech-plywood. <b>Pin</b> <b>block</b> were divided to eight sections, drilled and fitted by tuning pins. Tightening torque of tuning pins was measured using a torque wrench, depending on the diameter of the hole. Mechanical resistance of the material was measured by microdrill Resistograph. Density distribution in <b>pin</b> <b>blocks</b> and moisture content were determined with gravimetric method. The universal testing machine was used for determination of Janky's and Brinell's hardness, the mechanical properties in compression in plane of the board. Results of tests were evaluated using statistical methods and cross-correlated. A finite-element model in ANSYS software was built, in ordner to clarify the degree and distribution of stress around the hole for tuning pin. Statistically significant differences were found for properties of individual types of <b>pin</b> <b>blocks</b> (especially the density, hardness and compressive strength and tightening torque). Hardness differs significantly when tested perpendicular to the fibers in the plane and along the fibers in the edge. Measurements in individual sections of <b>pin</b> <b>block</b> brought uneven results and did not show statistically significant differences. Significant correlation was found only between the folowing characteristic: type A: the density distribution and the mechanical properties of the plane, density distribution and tightening torque after loosening. Type B: Resistograph resistance and tightening torque after 14 days, the density distribution and mechanical properties of the plane. Type C: density distribution and tightening torque after driving and loosening. Accurate results would be achieved by multiple measurements on multiple pieces of the <b>pin</b> <b>blocks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Regnase- 1 is an RNase that {{directly}} cleaves mRNAs of inflammatory genes such as IL- 6 and IL- 12 p 40, and negatively regulates cellular inflammatory responses. Here, we report {{the structures of}} four domains of Regnase- 1 from Mus musculus - the N-terminal domain (NTD), PilT N-terminus like (PIN) domain, zinc finger (ZF) domain and C-terminal domain (CTD). The PIN domain harbors the RNase catalytic center; however, it is insufficient for enzymatic activity. We found that the NTD associates with the PIN domain and significantly enhances its RNase activity. The PIN domain forms a head-to-tail oligomer and the dimer interface overlaps with the NTD binding site. Interestingly, mutations <b>blocking</b> <b>PIN</b> oligomerization had no RNase activity, indicating that both oligomerization and NTD binding are crucial for RNase activity in vitro.
