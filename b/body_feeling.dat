2500|$|Process Work theory {{includes}} {{a framework of}} experiential 'channels' through which the dreaming process is expressed; these channels include the visual, auditory, movement (kinaesthetic) and <b>body</b> <b>feeling</b> (proprioceptive) channels. [...] Like Gestalt therapy, Process Work tracks a person's experience as it shifts between different channels. [...] Process Work is particularly known for using the channels of body awareness, movement and physical contact to explore psychological issues. The concept of a purposeful 'dreaming process' expressing itself through multiple 'channels' of experience is the theoretical basis for Process Work's 'far-reaching and flexible approach, which uses essentially the same capacious toolbox to work with everything from bodily symptoms to couple relationships to political conflicts'.|$|E

40|$|College-aged {{individuals}} who identify with a sexual minority orientation {{are at high}} risk for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behaviors. Research is lacking on identification of factors contributing to increased risk for this population. This study examined two facets of body investment, body protection and <b>body</b> <b>feelings,</b> as they relate to NSSI, individual and total suicidal behaviors, and sexual orientation. It was hypothesized that NSSI and individual suicidal behaviors would be more frequent in the sexual minority sample compared to the heterosexual sample, body protection and <b>body</b> <b>feelings</b> would be poorer in sexual minorities compared to the heterosexual sample, and low body protection and <b>body</b> <b>feelings</b> would be associated with increased NSSI and total suicidal behaviors. Results indicated no significant difference of prevalence of NSSI and suicidal behaviors between the heterosexual and sexual minority samples. However, sexual minorities reported more suicidal ideation. Increased suicidal behaviors and suicidal ideation, and decreased body protection were significantly correlated with sexual orientation. Decreased body protection {{was a significant predictor of}} NSSI frequency, and poor <b>body</b> <b>feelings</b> and decreased <b>body</b> protection were significant predictors of suicidal behavior for the whole sample. Findings of this study may provide direction for important sexual minority research and treatment...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{physical}} education in Brazil has been coming through a long process for achieving its position in regular schools. Conquering this place is owed to a large set of debates about the most varied pedagogical concepts.   This study aims at analyzing the <b>body</b> <b>feelings</b> of a blind student and phenomenologically describing this student’s perceptions of school spaces when influenced {{by the use of}} tactile maps. The study adopted a qualitative approach from a theoretical-methodological perspective of the case study with phenomenological-existential inspiration.   Based on the dialogues in this study, the authors understood that tactile maps, mediated by the student’s <b>body</b> <b>feelings,</b> represented significant importance to boost memorization of school spaces. This allowed more reliable guidance and safer mobility to that blind student and his own challenges of overcoming physical and attitudinal barriers when he needed to move around daily at school and during {{physical education}} classes...|$|R

40|$|Scientists have {{traditionally}} assumed that {{different kinds of}} mental states (e. g., fear, disgust, love, memory, planning, concentration, etc.) correspond to different psychological faculties that have domain-specific correlates in the brain. Yet, growing evidence points to the constructionist hypothesis that mental states emerge from the combination of domain-general psychological processes that map to large-scale distributed brain networks. In this paper, we report a novel study testing a constructionist model of the mind in which participants generated three kinds of mental states (emotions, <b>body</b> <b>feelings,</b> or thoughts) while we measured activity within large-scale distributed brain networks using fMRI. We examined the similarity and differences {{in the pattern of}} network activity across these three classes of mental states. Consistent with a constructionist hypothesis, a combination of large-scale distributed networks contributed to emotions, thoughts, and <b>body</b> <b>feelings,</b> although these mental states differed in the relative contribution of those networks. Implications for a constructionist functional architecture of diverse mental states are discussed...|$|R

They {{were not able to}} hear harmonies that they wrote in the music theory classes, and they could not create simple melodies and chord sequences. This resulted in a lack of musical sensitivity that caused problems in the performance. His effort was to find ways to help their students to develop skills of feel more, hear, create, imagine, connect, memorize, reading and writing, as well performance and interpretation in music. He worked in order to free the students from the conflicts between mind and <b>body,</b> <b>feeling</b> and expression.|$|E

A scan of <b>body</b> <b>feelings</b> and sensations, similar to forms of Buddhist meditation can enhance awareness practice.

50|$|This {{passage is}} famous {{not just for}} succinctly {{presenting}} the Buddha’s teaching of non-self through the simile but also for {{being one of the}} earliest depictions of a woman adept at comprehending and practising the Buddha’s dhamma. The person Mara seeks to concede as having a metaphysically substantial or permanent essence is only an aggregation of processes, some of which are material (rūpa) and some which are non-material (arūpin). These material and immaterial processes make up the five aggregates (skandhas) which are <b>body,</b> <b>feeling,</b> perception, disposition to actions and consciousness. Just as the term ‘chariot’ is used to refer to an assemblage of parts, such as the wheels, yokes, axles etc., so too is ‘person’ nothing more than a conventional term employed to denote these five aggregates rather than to a permanent essence which the person holds. Each person, like each chariot, is a compound and no compound can be an individual, a being.|$|E
