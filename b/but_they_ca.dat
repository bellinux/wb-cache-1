40|$|The nonprofit sector {{today has}} to meet growing demands for better quality {{services}} and growing competition from business and public organizations, {{and also from}} other nonprofit organizations. Because of these circumstances they have to become more professional in their activities. The paper examines the professionalization and knowledge management in nonprofit organizations. The theoretical issues of knowledge management of nonprofit organizations are supported by examples from (earlier and recent) research of the authors. The aspects of knowledge management presented in this paper, not only give an insight over the contribution of nonprofit organizations {{to the success of}} a larger project, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>ca</b> be an example for other nonprofits dealing with similar problems, facing similar challenges.

40|$|Wild {{birds are}} {{important}} to public health because they carry emerging zoonotic pathogens, either as a reservoir host or by dispersing infected arthropod vectors. In addition, bird migration provides a mechanism {{for the establishment of}} new endemic foci of disease at great distances from where an infection was acquired. Birds are central to the epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV) because they are the main amplifying host of the virus in nature. The initial spread of WNV in the U. S. along the eastern seaboard coincided with a major bird migration corridor. The subsequent rapid movement of the virus inland could have been facilitated by the elliptical migration routes used by many songbirds. A number of bird species can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme dis-ease, but most are not competent to transmit the infection to Ixodes ticks. The major role birds play in the geographic expansion of Lyme disease is as dispersers of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Aquatic waterfowl are asymptomatic carriers of essentially all hemagglu-tinin and neuraminidase combinations of influenza A virus.

40|$|Erythrocytes {{from several}} {{different}} species {{were exposed to}} Ca 2 + and the bivalent-cation ionophore A 23187. The lipid composition, morphology and K+ permeability of the treated cells were investigated. Erythrocytes from human, rat, guinea pig and rabbit (a) showed an increased concentration of 1, 2 -diacyl-sn-glycerol and enhanced labelling of phosphatidate with 32 P, (b) underwent echinocytosis and outward vesiculation, and (c) rapidly released much of their intracellular K+. Pig cells showed only the K+ loss, and ox and sheep (high-K+) cells showed none of these Ca 2 +-evoked effects. All of the cells underwent stomatocytosis and inward vesiculation when treated externally with Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C. These results {{support the idea that}} there is a correlation between the asymmetric insertion of diacylglycerol (or ceramide) into the membrane and the shape-changes leading to microvesiculation, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> indicate that <b>Ca</b> 2 +-triggered K+ efflux and diacylglycerol production are unrelated events. Erythrocytes of chicken and turkey showed no Ca 2 +-stimulated K+ efflux. They showed slight ionophore A 23187 -stimulated vesiculation, but this appeared to be associated with the appearance in the membrane of ceramide rather than of diacylglycerol. Phospholipase C treatment caused very similar changes in morphology and phosphatidate labelling to those seen in mammalian erythrocytes...|$|R

40|$|TRAITS. The adult scarlet macaw, {{measured}} {{from head to}} tail, is 85 cm long and weighs 1200 g. Additionally the lengths of its wing and long pointed tail are 41 cm and 53 cm respectively (Renton, 2000). The males have slightly longer tails and larger bills than the females. As depicted in Fig. 1 its hooked upper mandible is white and lower black. The scarlet macaw’s face is white and lacks feather lines. It has a mostly scarlet plumage, yellow median upper coverts and blue flight feathers on its wings. The outer feathers of the tail are tipped blue (Hilty and Meyer de Schauensee, 2003). Two toes of the scarlet macaw are positioned forwards {{and the other two}} backwards, hence it has zygodactylous feet. ECOLOGY. The very conspicuous scarlet macaws can be found throughout Central and South America inhabiting humid forests, especially along waterways, savannahs and open woodlands (Inigo- Elias, 2010). The canopies of these forests provide nesting cavities, water and diverseUWI The Online Guide to the Animals of Trinidad and Tobago Behaviour crops of wild nuts, fruits and flowers. They have also been observed eating large quantities of clay at river banks and cliffs (Henderson et al. 2010, Attenborough 1998). SOCIAL ORGANIZATION.

30|$|Besides the {{interference}} from the outward flow of cytoplasmic K+ ions, the periplasmic Ca 2 + ions may compete with Na+ ions for the inward permeation through the sodium channels. Therefore, {{the selection of}} Na+ vs. Ca 2 + ions in Nav channels is of particular interest, since Ca 2 + ions frequently act as secondary messengers and their cross-membrane leaking may cause cell disorder. Interestingly, eukaryotic Ca 2 + channels have the EEEE motif at the constriction site (similar to NavAb) <b>but</b> <b>they</b> strongly prefer <b>Ca</b> 2 + over Na+ ions (Sather and McCleskey, 2003). Dudev and Lim investigated this phenomenon using a reduced model system and proposed the protein matrix as the decisive factor for Ca 2 + vs. Na+ selectivity in the SF of calcium channels (Dudev and Lim, 2012). On the other hand, simulations on NavAb suggested that Ca 2 + translocation lacks the knock-on mechanism for efficient permeation although they can favorably bind at sites SCEN and SHFS (Ke et al., 2013). In the SF of NavRh, the site SHFS is composed of four Ser residues and Glu residues are located three residues away on the periplasmic side to constitute a site called IonEX (Fig.  2 C and 2 D). Our simulations on NavRh suggested that the extremely strong binding preference of Ca 2 + ions at IonEX renders a huge free energy barrier (~ 10  kcal/mol) which prevents the Ca 2 + ions from further moving towards the site SCEN (Zhang et al., 2013), an explanation consistent with the experimental observation that periplasmic Ca 2 + ions block the Na+ flux in NavRh (Zhang et al., 2012).|$|R
