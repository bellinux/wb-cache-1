40|$|The author {{explored}} {{the use of}} a novel class of <b>boronated</b> nucleic acids, the boranophosphates, as an alternative, but complementary method to dideoxysequencing. Boranophosphates can be used to directly amplify and sequence single- or double-stranded DNA.

The method, which the author calls <b>Boronated</b> One-Step PCR Sequencing, is unique in that it employs a new class of {alpha}-P-boronated 2 {prime}-deoxynucleoside 5 {prime}-triphosphates first synthesized in the laboratory. These <b>boronated</b> triphosphates exhibit useful properties: (a) they are heat stable, (b) they can be base-specifically incorporated into DNA during the polymerase chain reaction, and (c) once incorporated, the boranophosphate nucleotide (marker) blocks the action of exonuclease. Thus, the positions of the stably-incorporated <b>boronated</b> markers can be revealed by a simple exonuclease digestion, producing a series of fragments [...] each of which is terminated base-specifically at the <b>boronated</b> markers [...] and thereby defining the sequence of the PCR product...|$|R

The orthogonality of disulfide and hydrazone exchange under basic and acidic conditions, respectively, is well established. However, the integration of <b>boronate</b> esters as the third bond has failed so far because they exchanged too easily, especially under hydrazone exchange conditions. In this report, a collection of bioinspired catechols derived from adhesive natural products from cyanobacteria is screened with phenylboronic acids with proximal alcohols (benzoboroxoles), amines and fluorines to identify the least labile <b>boronate</b> esters. Moreover, Kool's 2 -aminophenol catalysts are introduced to selectively accelerate hydrazone exchange without disturbing sufficiently inert <b>boronate</b> esters.

40|$|Iminodiacetic acids are {{versatile}} metal chelating ligands. We herein {{undertook a}} study of dendritic bis- and tetrakis-iminodiacetic acids functionalized at the peripheries of branched core moieties. The dendritic iminodiacetic acids are synthesized by O- and N-alkylations of chosen alcohol and amine reactive sites emanating from a branched core. In order to identify the reactivities of such dendritic iminodiacetic acids, chelation with arylboronates is conducted. An assessment of the hydrolysis under aq. basic condition shows that dendritic <b>boronates</b> hydrolyze to boronic acid significantly slower than monomeric <b>boronates.</b> Slower hydrolysis of dendritic <b>boronates</b> is taken advantage, in order to conduct competitive C-C bond-forming Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Teraryl synthesis is performed using monomeric and dendritic <b>boronates.</b> The iterative, multiple aryl-aryl bond formation is conducted subsequently, so as to prepare tetraaryls, through consecutive reactions of chosen boronic acid, monomeric boronate, dendritic boronate and aryl bromide, in one-pot.

40|$|The {{application}} of MIDA <b>boronates</b> (MIDA = N-methyliminodiacetic acid) in Suzuki- Miyaura reactions has {{increased over the}} last years. This is mainly because in many cases, {{the replacement of the}} boronic acid for the respective MIDA boronate has a positive result in the reaction yield. The key feature that makes MIDA <b>boronates</b> efficient coupling partners is that they can undergo a slow hydrolysis reaction under Suzuki-Miyaura conditions, which generates the boronic acid in situ. The control of the hydrolysis rate is crucial to keep a low concentration of the boronic acid to avoid some of the side reactions frequently observed. The kinetics of the hydrolysis reaction from a range of alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl MIDA <b>boronates</b> have been determined under different reactions conditions. In addition, competition experiments and computational calculations have resulted in the proposal of three distinct mechanisms for the hydrolysis of MIDA boronates: ‘base-promoted’, ‘water-promoted’, and ‘acid-promoted’. The base and acid mediated processes occur at faster rates than the neutral pathway and involves a rate-limiting addition at the MIDA carbonyl carbon by hydroxide or water, respectively. Whilst the 'neutral' hydrolysis requires neither base nor acid and involves ratelimiting B-N bond cleavage by a water cluster. Under certain conditions the neutral mechanism can operate in parallel with the base or with the acid mediated mechanism; relative rates are easily quantified by 18 O incorporation in the MIDA, after this is released from the hydrolysis reaction. This insight is expected to assist informed application and optimisation of MIDA <b>boronates</b> in synthesis as well as the design of new MIDA boronate derivatives...|$|E
