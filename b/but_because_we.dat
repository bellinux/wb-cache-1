500|$|Throughout his writings, Du Bois {{supported}} women's rights,Donaldson, Shawn, [...] "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221. but {{he found}} it difficult to publicly endorse the women's right-to-vote movement because leaders of the suffragism movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A Crisis editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote [...] " [...] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women {{in the eyes of the}} law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her... We must kill [...] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone."Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954, University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.|$|E

In July 2011, Adrianne Palicki was {{confirmed}} for the lead female role of Lady Jaye, and Ray Stevenson was confirmed to portray the villain Firefly. Arnold Vosloo also confirmed that he would reprise his role of Zartan, although in the final film Vosloo appears only in a couple of non-dialogue scenes, with Jonathan Pryce playing Zartan in most scenes. Joseph Mazzello was confirmed to play Mouse. In August 2011, Walton Goggins was added as Warden Nigel James, and it was confirmed that Bruce Willis was cast to star in the film as the original G.I. Joe. The character of Joe Colton was a replacement for fan-favorite Joe character Sgt. Slaughter. Sgt. Slaughter stated that he [...] "was originally supposed to be the part of Bruce Willis' [...] Sgt.

500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement. However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated {{the decision to}} leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyoncé Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist."

2500|$|In Blake's ironic {{treatment}} of empirical doctrines and natural religion, {{a key element}} introduced in Series b is desire; [...] "the rational mind, merely a mechanical manipulation or [...] "ratio" [...] of sense experience, [...] "shall be" [...] transformed as spiritual enlightenment advances and we discover more than [...] "organic perceptions" [...] allow. If {{it were not for}} desires reaching beyond the sensate, Man would be trapped in a self-imposed empiricist prison. For Blake, expanding the prison or accumulating more will not bring any respite, as only the Infinite will satisfy Man. If we could not attain the infinite, we would be in eternal despair, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are not, Blake reasons that we thus must be able to attain the Infinite, and as such, Man becomes Infinite himself; [...] "Locke's principle of a reciprocal and mutually validating relationship among the mind, the sense organs, and their objects has been converted into a similarly structured reciprocity among infinite desire, its infinite object, and its infinite desirer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, it was {{revealed}} that season two regular Meghan Ory (Red Riding Hood/Ruby) would be departing the show to star in CBS's upcoming sci-fi drama Intelligence. However, Ory stated that she would still be open for more episodes on the show as a guest member. Ory later made appearances in episodes twelve and thirteen of the season. The same month, it was announced that Michael Raymond-James (Baelfire/Neal Cassidy) had been promoted from a recurring cast member to a series regular for the season. In July 2013, it was reported that Giancarlo Esposito (The Genie/Magic Mirror/Sidney Glass) would be returning to the series, following his absence from season two. In the same month, it was announced that the role of Robin Hood had been recast from Tom Ellis to Sean Maguire. Adam Horowitz stated, [...] "Although we love Tom Ellis, unfortunately he wasn’t available. We remain huge fans of his, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have an arc planned for the character, we had to move forward." [...] British actor Robbie Kay played the role of the villain {{for the first half of}} the season: Peter Pan. On July 29, it was reported that Rose McIver had been cast as Tinker Bell. Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis teased an unexpected introduction for the well-known character, saying, [...] "It's taking the icon and putting our spin on it. How we introduce her, and who she is, is hopefully going to be surprising because we're going to find she has a surprising connection to someone." [...] For episode five, Bernard Curry played a guest role as Captain Hook's brother Liam, while a member of the Lost Boys called Devin was portrayed by Skyler Gisondo. Joanna Garcia was cast as Ariel from The Little Mermaid. On September 3, 2013, Gil McKinney was cast in the recurring role of Prince Eric.
