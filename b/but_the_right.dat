5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that did exist {{have fallen into}} disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which is not a peerage) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E

25|$|Once this {{agreement}} was settled upon, {{the next step}} was to choose a subject, something which took some time. Several subjects came to Verdi's attention: for example, Byron's The Corsair was considered, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> baritone was not available. In thinking about an opera about the Venetian Foscari family, he found that it was forbidden by the censor in order avoid upsetting any of the descendants of that family who were then living in Venice. However, both of these subjects were to become later Verdi operas, Il corsaro and I due Foscari.|$|E

25|$|Though the North Pacific right whale's {{distribution}} is usually more temperate {{than that of}} the more polar Bowhead whale, there are several records of the two species inhabiting the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk at the same time. E. japonica's summer distribution extends north into the southeastern part of the Bering Sea. In summer, the Bowhead migrates north through the Bering Straits and is in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. In winter, the ice-loving Bowhead moves south into the Bering Sea, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> whales have migrated further south of the Aleutian Islands into the North Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Limited private {{ownership}} rights similar to riparian rights in a surface stream. The amount of groundwater right {{is based on}} the size of the surface area where each landowner gets a corresponding amount of the available water. Once adjudicated, the maximum amount of the water right is set, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> can be decreased if the total amount of available water decreases as is likely during a drought. Landowners may sue others for encroaching upon their groundwater rights, and water pumped for use on the overlying land takes preference over water pumped for use off the land.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} respect the foreigners' self-government, there were limits on the {{abilities}} of Japanese to enter the settlement and of Japan to exercise police power in the area. Due to the extraterritoriality enforced by unequal treaties, legal disputes involving Westerners were subject to judgment by their consulates. The right to self-government was tied {{to the land of}} the settlement, and thus did not apply outside its boundaries, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to consular jurisdiction was tied to the people it applied to, and thus extended even to disputes that occurred outside the settlement. In practice, foreigners claimed the same extraterritoriality outside the settlement that they did inside, which sometimes developed into trouble with the Japanese side.|$|E

It then lifts its right hind leg (while being {{supported by the}} diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), puts down the front right (lateral support), lifts the left front, puts down the rear left, and the pattern repeats.|$|E
25|$|At {{the death}} of King Ferdinand (1383) war broke out between Castile and Portugal. When João I, who had been grand master of the Knights of Aviz, ascended the throne of Portugal, he forbade the knights to submit to Castilian authority, and consequently, when Gonsalvo de Guzman came to Aviz as Visitor, the knights, while {{according}} him hospitality, refused to recognise him as a superior. Guzman protested, and the point remained a subject of contention until the Council of Basle (1431), when Portugal was declared {{to be in the}} wrong. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the Calatravans was never exercised, and the next grand master of the Knights of Aviz, Fernando Rodrigues de Sequeira, continued to assert supreme authority over them.|$|E
25|$|The Judicial Yuan is {{the highest}} {{judicial}} organ. It interprets the constitution and other laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries. The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed by the president, {{with the consent of}} the Legislative Yuan. The highest court, the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice; many cases are presided over by multiple judges.|$|E

25|$|In this context, {{on the eve}} of {{independence}} there did not really exist a political movement strictly based on the demand for the rights of women. Existing institutions sustained political parties, and although these rights were the subject of speeches, they were not then among political priorities. The Union of women and the Union of girls belonging to the Communist party agitated especially in the social and labour domains. As for the Muslim union and the cells destourian women created in 1951-1952, they did not begin to call for the right to vote and eligibility for office until 1955. These two rights became official on March 14, 1957 and Tunisian women voted {{for the first time in}} municipal elections in May 1959 and later in the presidential and legislative elections of November 1959. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to education remained the only one unanimously sought by feminine organizations. From this point of view, the Code was not promulgated under any feminist pressure, that, when it existed, was usually directed to other ideals.|$|E
25|$|When {{a vacancy}} occurred, {{the bishop of}} the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of {{election}} was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In abbeys exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to Rome. It was necessary that an abbot {{should be at least}} 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years, unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience. In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached {{on the rights of the}} monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontré and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8–12 years.|$|E

The kings also exempted some Transylvanian towns and villages from their authority over the centuries.

Voivodes enjoyed income from the royal estates attached to their office, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to [...] "grant lands, collect taxes and tolls, or coin money" [...] was reserved for the monarchs.

He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, [...] " [...] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to die with dignity {{at the end of life}} is not to be confused or equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life." ...|$|E
