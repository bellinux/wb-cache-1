Also the effects of CE on rat <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time were determined. Results indicate that CE {{had no effect on}} urine, haematological and serum biochemical indices at termination of treatment with the exception of serum ALT level which was significantly (p< 0. 05) attenuated in a dose-dependent fashion (21 - 35 %). There were also no differences in <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time between CE-treated and control animals.

Organ weights were not adversely affected by CE treatment. There were significant (p< 0. 05) changes in weight of CE-treated animals with duration of treatment compared to control.

40|$|Objectives: Bee venom (BV) is {{a complex}} mixture of {{proteins}} and contains proteins such as phospholipase and melittin, which {{have an effect on}} <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> The mechanism of action of honey bee venom (HBV, Apis mellifera) on human plasma proteins and its anti-thrombotic effect were studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the anti-coagulation effect of BV and its effects on blood coagulation and purification. Methods: Crude venom obtained from Apis mellifera was selected. The anti-coagulation factor of the crude venom from this species was purified by using gel filtration chromatography (sephadex G- 50), and the molecular weights of the anti-coagulants in this venom estimated by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Blood samples were obtained from 10 rabbits, and the prothrombin time (PT) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) tests were conducted. The approximate lethal dose (LD) values of BV were determined. Results: Crude BV increased the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time.</b> For BV concentrations from 1 to 4 mg/mL, clotting was not observed even at more than 300 seconds, standard deviations (SDs) = ± 0. 71; however, clotting was observed in the control group 13. 8 s, SDs = ± 0. 52. Thus, BV can be considered as containing anti-coagulation factors. Crude BV is composed 4 protein bands with molecular weights of 3, 15, 20 and 41 kilodalton (kDa), respectively. The LD 50 of the crude BV was found to be 177. 8 μg/mouse. Conclusion: BV contains anti-coagulation factors.

40|$|Background. Low {{molecular}} weight heparins (LMWH) like dalteparin are increasingly used for anticoagulation during haemodialysis (HD).

40|$|While {{there are}} many basic and {{clinical}} studies on strychnine, reports on its derivatives are rare, {{except for a few}} reports by Koizumi and Chiyoda of our laboratory. They conducted general pharmacological studies on ethylstrychnine I, II, iodoethylstrychnine and strychnic acid ethylbetaine, new derivatives of strychnine. As a link in the series of such studies the author carried out some inverstigations on the effects of these three derivatives on <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> and briefly presents the main results of the inverstigation. 1. Both ethylstrychnine I and II as well as iodoethylstrychnine, like their mother substance, strychnine, were found to shorten the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> of rabbits, and to enhance the blood coagulating elements. This effect was predominant in ethylstrychnine II followed by iodoethylstrychnine. The order of this potency coincides with that of the minimal lethal dose as found by Koizumi. 2. It was difficult to demonstrate this effect in vitro. Consequently, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that this effect to accelerate the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> is not due to a direct action of the drug on blood itself but is due to the bioreaction. 3. This accelerating effect on the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is almost completely inhibited by luminal, a brain-stem narcotics, but it is not affected by the premedication with yohimbine nor by the resection of bilateral, subdiaphragmatic splanchnic nerves. 4. It seems that this accelerating action is of a central nature and probably it is induced by an increase of coagulating elements such as fibrinogen and thrombin, resulting from the stimulating effect of the drug on the so-called blood coagulation-accelerative center in the diencephalon. In this instance, it appears that the splanchnic nerves are not involved in the transmission of excitation from the above metioned center to the peripheral region, but in this experiment it was impossible to demonstrate any evidence proving that the transmission of such stimuli is conducted via sympathetic accelerative fiber...|$|R
