40|$|A <b>boroscopic</b> {{imaging system}} is {{developed}} to measure sediment velocities within a highly concentrated sheet layer in open channel flows. A detailed literature review {{is presented to}} investigate previous attempts at sheet layer measurements, followed {{by a set of}} experiments to determine clean water flow characteristics in the open channel flume located in the DeFrees Hydraulics Laboratory. Experiments are carried out in the same flume under sediment-laden, sheet flow conditions to determine the steadiness of the flow as well as to verify velocities in the suspended sediment transport region with existing theories. Sediment velocities are captured in the highly concentrated sediment sheet for the same flow conditions using the new <b>boroscopic</b> imaging system. The boroscope is a minimally intrusive lens with a diameter that is only an order of magnitude larger than the natural sand being studied. Minimum Quadratic Difference techniques, along with several filtering techniques, are utilized to determine particle displacements. A rigorous investigation into calibrations is included in order to convert pixel displacements into physical velocities. Three separate metrics are investigated, all involving light intensity values. These metrics are examined from calibrations performed under fixed, moving and in-situ experimental conditions. The limitation of each calibration as well as a discussion of the effectiveness of the calibration techniques is included. Physical velocities within the sheet layer are determined using the in-situ variance of intensity calibration. A complete streamwise velocity profile spanning from the non-moving bed to the free stream is included which combines velocity data collected from both the <b>boroscopic</b> imaging technique as well as an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The joint profile seems fairly continuous but more attention needs to be focused on the velocities located along the interface of the sheet flow and suspended regions as well as possible reasons for differences between these experimental results and results published previously. Finally, future development is discussed including the further investigation into calibration techniques, the possibility of measuring sediment concentrations as well as water velocities and other possible uses for the <b>boroscopic</b> quantitative imaging technique...|$|E

40|$|In a {{three stages}} {{compression}} module at an offshore installation was detected a sudden decrease in managed flow decreasing from 108 to 87 million {{standard cubic feet}} by day MMSCFD. Thermodynamic analysis on performance of three stages of compression axial compressor and power turbine was carried out. Each compression stage were found operating efficiently according to ranges indicated by manufacturer. However a power loss about 1200 hp was detected in turbine so that the problem between the power turbine and the main gearbox MG was focused. <b>Boroscopic</b> and thermographic inspections were carried out detecting hot spots and contaminants deposition. Upon disassembling MG lubrication ducts were detected partially obstructed by silicone...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspection}} of aero engines {{is a complex}} and timeconsuming process, often requiring the disassembling of the engine or <b>boroscopic</b> examinations. The development of a method to locate and characterize defects and damage at an early stage, without disassembling the engine would accelerate the inspection process. For that purpose, the spatial density distribution pattern of the exhaust jet of aircraft engines may be measured with the Background Oriented Schlieren method (BOS). The hypothesis is that defects in the hot gas path have a noticeable impact on the density pattern of the exhaust jet. To establish the connection between defects and measurable patterns, in the present paper numerical simulations of an aero engine are performed including three potential defects. Non-uniformities resulting from a burner malfunction, the increase of the radial gap between blade tip and casing as well as burned trailing edges are propagated with only small degree of dispersion through the turbine and reach the engine exit. The paper shows that each considered defect results in a different exhaust density pattern...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{jet engine}} {{maintenance}} process is complex, expensive and time-consuming. It often requires engine disassembly or <b>boroscopic</b> examinations. In order {{to accelerate the}} process and reduce the down time of an engine we intend to develop a method to locate and characterize defects and damage at an early state, without having to disassemble the engine. The assumption is that various defects in the hot gas path of an engine have a noticeable impact on the spatial density distribution of the exhaust jet of an engine. The resulting differences in the exhaust jet pattern will be measured with the Background Oriented Schlieren method (BOS). We perform numerical simulations (CFD) in order to analyze the effects of various general defect types on the density pattern of the exhaust jet. The defects under investigation include the malfunction of one burner, the increase the turbine blade tip clearance and burned trailing edges of the blades. The changes in the pattern resulting from the defects are compared to the density distribution of the undamaged initial state. It is shown that different exhaust jet patterns {{can be linked to}} the investigated hot gas path defects. Furthermore, a BOS set-up is installed in a test cell of a helicopter engine with a two- stage axial turbine to demonstrate the applicability of the BOS method for the measurement of small density gradients resulting from temperature non-uniformities. A cold streak was inserted into the exhaust diffuser to simulate an artificial defect. The completed measurements show that the BOS method is able to detect these small variations. The present paper summarizes the results of different investigations. It presents a combination of BOS measurements of the exhaust jet and CFD simulations of defects within the hot gas path as a promising approach for evaluating the condition of a jet engine...|$|E
40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). <b>Boroscopic</b> examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged labyrinth support ring of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to tip rubbing with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the labyrinth support ring with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The labyrinth support ring got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the labyrinth support ring from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the support ring was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated labyrinth support ring showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of labyrinth support ring is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of labyrinth support ring was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the labyrinth support ring of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the labyrinth support ring appears to be a remote possibility...|$|E
