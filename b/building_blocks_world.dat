40|$|AbstractIn {{the context}} of reemerging universalistic {{approaches}} to health care, {{the objective of this}} article was to contribute to the discussion by highlighting the potential influence of global trade liberalization on the balance between health demand and the capacity of health systems pursuing universal health coverage (UHC) to supply adequate health care. Being identified as a defining feature of globalization affecting health, trade liberalization is analyzed as a complex and multidimensional influence on the implementation of UHC. The analysis adopts a systems-thinking approach and refers to the six <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of <b>World</b> Health Organization’s current “framework for action,” emphasizing their interconnectedness. While offering new opportunities to increase access to health information and care, in the absence of global governance mechanisms ensuring adequate health protection and promotion, global trade tends to have negative effects on health systems’ capacity to ensure UHC, both by causing higher demand and by interfering with the interconnected functioning of health systems’ <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> The prevention of such an impact and the effective implementation of UHC would highly benefit from a more consistent commitment and stronger leadership by the World Health Organization in protecting health in global policymaking fora in all sectors...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} that categorization {{focuses on}} the issue of access. Prototype models, exemplar models, and connectionist models are all attempts to address this issue. Certainly, the issue of access is important and challenging, and solving it has significant implications for both theoretical and applied research. Models of categorization seem to view categorization as an end in itself. The purpose of categorization is not to know an entity's category. Instead, the purpose of categorization is to identify information in memory that provides useful inferences. Upon accessing a category for an entity, a tremendous amount of knowledge becomes available that is useful in a variety of ways. This knowledge may specify the origins of the entity, its physical structure, its probable behavior, its implications for the perceiver's goals, or actions for interacting with it successfully. Accessing a category is not an end in itself but is instead the gateway to knowledge for understanding an entity and interacting with it appropriately. The chapter {{focuses on the}} roles that categories play in the cognitive system following their access. For example, it has been proposed that goal-derived categories provide sets of instantiations for frame attributes during planning and that common taxonomic categories constitute the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of <b>world</b> models.

40|$|This paper investigates how the myth/metaphor {{layer of}} Inayatullah’s Causal Layered Analysis is formed, using an {{embodied}} cognitive approach. The very way we experience the world, move in it, interact within it and orient our body to our environment generates patterns and concepts that form as metaphors. Language is saturated in metaphor. As we interact together shared metaphors connect together to emerge and take shape as myths. These are the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> of Inayatullah’s <b>world</b> viewlayer. The worldview {{that emerges from}} social interactions {{of a group of}} people form a particular arrangement of interlinking elements from the myth/metaphor layer. The worldview informs the systemic layer, which in turn informs the litany of everyday life. Any particular worldview is therefore only ever one within many possible ways of interlinking the mythic and epistemic elements. It is easy to fall into the trap of assuming our particular worldview is the best, or even the only true worldview. CLA helps us to avoid this problem as it problematises the present and find new metaphors to enable us to envision alternative and preferred futures...|$|R
40|$|Until the 1800 s, {{elements}} such as gold, silver and copper {{were thought to be}} fundamental materials that shared no common <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> The <b>world,</b> at that time, was believed to be composed of various different elements. By 1869, when Dmitri Mendeleev published a paper categorizing these elements into a table, 63 elements had been discovered. Mendeleev, and other chemists during his era, began to recognize patterns in the table. These patterns would eventually predict and lead to the discovery of many more elements, organized into the Periodic Table of Elements that we use today. By the early 1900 s, the proton was discovered, partially explaining why elements fit into the sequence in the Periodic Table of Elements. For the past century, the scientific community has recognized that elements are formed from atoms that differ {{based on the number of}} protons in the atom’s nucleus. Hydrogen has one proton, helium has two protons, and ununoctium, the last element in the table, has 118 protons. There are more than one hundred elements, yet nature’s simplicity forms these unique elements based on the number of protons in the core of the atom. In the 1900 s and into present day 21 st century, the search continues, but now for particles that make up the atom itself. Protons are not fundamental particles, as they can be smashed together in particle accelerators to find smaller parts that construct the proton.
