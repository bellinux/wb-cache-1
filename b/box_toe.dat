50|$|Until recent {{advances}} in technology, shellac (French polish) was the only glue used {{in the making of}} ballet dancers' pointe shoes, to stiffen the <b>box</b> (<b>toe</b> area) to support the dancer en pointe. Many manufacturers of pointe shoes still use the traditional techniques, and many dancers use shellac to revive a softening pair of shoes.|$|E

40|$|Dancing en pointe {{requires}} the ballerina {{to stand on}} her toes, which are protected only by the pointe shoe <b>toe</b> <b>box.</b> This protection diminishes when the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> loses its structural integrity. The objectives {{of this study were}} 1) to quantify the comparative structural static and fatigue properties of the pointe shoe <b>toe</b> <b>box,</b> and 2) to evaluate the preferred shoe characteristics as determined by a survey of local dancers. Five different pointe shoes (Capezio, Freed, Gaynor Minden, Leo’s, and Grishko) were evaluated to quantify the static stiff-ness, static strength, and fatigue properties (cycles to failure) of the shoes. Under axial loading conditions, the Leo’s shoe demonstrated the highest stiffness level, and the Freed shoe exhibited the least strength...|$|R
50|$|Shoe modifications: wearing {{shoes that}} have a wide <b>toe</b> <b>box,</b> and {{avoiding}} those with pointed toes or high heels.|$|R
2500|$|Wide heels do not {{necessarily}} offer more stability, and any raised heel with too much width, such as found in [...] "blade-heeled" [...] or [...] "block-heeled" [...] shoes, induces unhealthy side-to-side torque to the ankles with every step, stressing them unnecessarily, while creating additional impact {{on the balls of}} the feet. Thus, the best design for a high heel is one with a narrower width, where the heel is closer to the front, more solidly under the ankle, where the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> provides room enough for the toes, and where forward movement of the foot in the shoe is kept in check by material snug across the instep, rather than by the toes being rammed forward and jamming together in the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> or crushed into the front of the <b>toe</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The other primary type of wear {{involves}} the exterior fabric. In pointe work the front face and bottom {{edge of the}} <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> are subjected to friction against the performance surface. This friction will eventually wear through the shoe's outer fabric covering, thereby exposing the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> and creating loose, frayed fabric edges. Unlike a weakened shank, damaged outer fabric {{does not affect the}} performance of a shoe. Due to its unprofessional appearance, however, damaged fabric may render the shoe unfit to wear in situations other than informal practice or rehearsal.|$|R
2500|$|The 19th {{century was}} a period of great social change, which was {{reflected}} in ballet by a shift away from the aristocratic sensibilities that had dominated earlier periods through romantic ballet. Ballerinas such as Geneviève Gosselin, Marie Taglioni and Fanny Elssler experimented with new techniques such as pointework that gave the ballerina prominence as the ideal stage figure. Taglioni was known as the [...] "Christian Dancer," [...] as her image was light and pure (associated with her role as the sylph in La Sylphide). She was trained primarily by her father, Filipo Taglioni. In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known as the [...] "Pagan Dancer," [...] because of the fiery qualities of the Cachucha dance that made her famous. [...] Professional librettists began crafting the stories in ballets. Teachers like Carlo Blasis codified ballet technique in the basic form that is still used today. The ballet <b>boxed</b> <b>toe</b> shoe was invented to support pointe work.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the short-term effect of a pointe shoe <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> shape on proprioception in novice ballet dancers. Methods: Thirty-six female subjects completed the study (age = 13. 2 + 2. 2 years, height = 156. 4 + 11. 5 cm, weight = 46. 6 + 9. 4 kg). Subjects were assigned randomly to one of two groups. One group of 18 subjects was assigned to the tapered <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> pointe shoe, and the other group of 18 subjects was assigned to the square <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> pointe shoe. Subjects in each group were given a choice of any variation, brand, or size of shoe, only being restricted on the tapered or square box style. They were expected to train using that shoe, exclusively, over the next six weeks. Each subject’s static proprioception (the Center of Pressure [COP] area [Area 95] and reaction velocity [Vavg]) was measured prior to and following their six weeks of standard training using the AMTI AccuSway Plus forceplate. Results:A mixed-design ANOVA showed no effect on static proprioception for either shoe type. Conclusions: The shape of pointe shoe <b>toe</b> <b>boxes</b> does not have an effect on static proprioception in novice ballet dancers in a six week training program. Future research should evaluate these effects over a longer duration to evaluate long-term effects...|$|R
50|$|Some {{styles are}} {{equipped}} with supports similar to the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> and shank of pointe shoes, though, unlike those of the pointe shoe, the structural design, construction, and integrity provide only limited mobility.|$|R
25|$|A demi-pointe shoe, {{which is}} also {{variously}} called a break-down, pre-pointe, or a soft-block shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe {{and it has a}} <b>toe</b> <b>box,</b> although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the <b>toe</b> <b>box)</b> are typically not as deep as those found on pointe shoes. Demi-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and elastic band in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.|$|R
50|$|Each {{year since}} 2011, Altra Running has doubled their sales revenue and over 1500 {{retailers}} are now selling their zero-drop, foot-shaped <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> shoes. Outdoor recreation gear and sporting goods Retailer REI started selling Altra Running {{shoes in the}} past year.|$|R
5000|$|Minimalist Running Shoes are {{in-between}} traditional {{running shoes}} and barefoot running shoes. They have a reduced heel-to-toe drop of about 4-8 mm, reduced cushioning and reduced or no arch support. The <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> is usually in-between barefoot and traditional running shoes.|$|R
5000|$|Reebok {{became the}} {{official}} provider of licensed CrossFit footwear and apparel in 2011. That year, Reebok released the first Reebok Nano. The shoe {{was designed to}} be used for high impact movements, weightlifting and short-distance running. The shoe's design includes a spacious <b>toe</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pointe {{shoes are}} {{designed}} for ballet dancing. These have a <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> that is stiffened with glue and a hardened sole so the dancer can stand on the tips of their toes. They are secured by elastic straps and ribbons that {{are tied to the}} dancer's ankles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first thing}} to try {{is to use a}} shoe with a wider <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> for a few weeks. A narrow shoe may irritate the {{inflamed}} nerve. If your current shoe is a normal width (D), switch to a 2E. If you are wearing a 2E then try a 4E.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} also {{results from}} a traumatic injury, such as slamming a finger in a door, or from sports activities, such as climbing or hiking rugged terrain. A subungual hematoma that results from the repetitive thrusting of the longest toe into a shoe's <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> is called jogger's toe or runner's toe.|$|R

The Nano 3.0 also introduced the DuraCage construction for additional protection and lightweight support.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional gaucho's [...] "boots" [...] {{are made}} with horse feet rawhide. Gauchos skin the animal and put the freshly skinned hides on their feet like socks, where they are left to dry, taking the user's feet shape. Like moccasins they are soft-soled. Like ancient Roman cothurnus, the {{rudimentary}} boots have no <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> and do not cover the toes completely.|$|R
25|$|En pointe dancers employ pointe {{technique}} to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed {{so that the}} instep is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the floor, with the pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the <b>toe</b> <b>box)</b> square to the floor so that {{a substantial part of}} its surface is contacting the floor.|$|R
50|$|Gaynor Minden’s unique {{manufacturing}} system employs injection molded, thermoplastic elastomeric shanks and <b>toe</b> <b>boxes,</b> in {{a choice}} of stiffness. Impact and noise absorbing cellular urethane cushioning is located throughout the shoe. The exterior is traditional satin and a suede outer sole; the linings are treated with silver ion and combined directly to the satin. An elastic drawstring opens at the side. Unlike turnshoe manufacturing pleats are not used.|$|R
50|$|Several shoe {{modifications}} {{are common}} in freestyle footbag. In order to make toe stalling easier, many players use special lacing patterns that pull apart {{the sides of the}} shoe near the toe area, creating a broad, rimmed platform. Modified lacing is augmented by cutting away the stitching that joins the row of eyelets to the toe. The area that is created by completing these modifications is called a <b>toe</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
25|$|Demi-pointe {{shoes are}} most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to {{acclimate}} dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> allows the dancer to experience {{the feel of a}} pointe shoe, while the insole and outsole work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.|$|R

50|$|Ballet flats or Dolly {{shoes are}} derived from a woman's soft ballet shoe, with a very thin heel or the {{appearance}} of no heel at all. The style sometimes features a ribbon-like binding around the low tops of the slipper and may have a slight gathering at the top-front of the vamp (<b>toe</b> <b>box)</b> and a tiny, decorative string tie. Ballet slippers can be adjusted and tightened to the wearer's foot by means of this string tie.|$|R
