5|$|Although {{hurricane}} warnings {{were issued}} for {{portions of the}} country, many shrimp <b>boat</b> <b>crew</b> members ignored these warnings. As the tropical cyclone passed south of the Baja California Peninsula, it dropped light rainfall of around 1 inch (25 mm) in the area. Moderate rainfall was reported around the landfall location, peaking at 8.98 inches (228 mm) in Pueblo Nuevo, Durango; lighter precipitation of 1ndash&3 inches (25ndash&75 mm) occurred further inland toward the Mexico/United States border.|$|E
5|$|Ben Hildebrand and 12-year-old Eric Kirby go parasailing {{around the}} waters of Isla Sorna. An unknown {{creature}} attacks and kills the <b>boat</b> <b>crew,</b> forcing Ben to detach the line; he and Eric drift towards the island. On the mainland, Dr. Alan Grant has become famous after his involvement at Jurassic Park, while Ellie Sattler is married and has two children. Grant discusses with Sattler how raptors are far more intelligent than they had previously believed. At a dig site, Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan, demonstrates how he can use a 3D printer to replicate a Velociraptor larynx.|$|E
5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his <b>boat</b> <b>crew</b> drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it back to the ship.|$|E

On {{the night of}} 8 August, Commander Stevens sent a <b>boat</b> <b>crew</b> {{under the command of}} Acting Ensign Michael Murphy on a successful mission to cut the telegraph cable between Fort Morgan and the city of Mobile. The fort surrendered on 24 August and the ship remained at Mobile Bay into 1865 supporting Union forces. On 27 March, Union forces advanced on Spanish Fort as the first step in capturing Mobile. The Navy's role was to bombard the defenses and to interdict their communications with Mobile, but the defenders had sown mines in great numbers in the waterways. The Navy successfully swept many of these, but could not completely clear the rivers.|$|E

A <b>boat</b> <b>crew</b> led by Commander John Rodgers went ashore under a flag of truce and found the fort abandoned. Rodgers therefore raised the Union flag.

25|$|Boarding {{operations}} are performed by two , waterjet propelled rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIB), which carry ten people (a fully equipped, eight-strong boarding party, and two <b>boat</b> <b>crew).</b> The RHIBs are {{larger and more}} powerful than the single RHIB aboard a Fremantle, are capable of operating independently of their mothership, and carry their own communications, navigation, and safety equipment. Each RHIB has a dedicated cradle and davit, the boats can be launched and recovered easily, and a centralised 'dressing room' incorporated into the ship's design has streamlined the deployment and return of personnel.|$|E

Surface support might include surface stand-by divers, <b>boat</b> <b>crew,</b> porters, emergency medical personnel, and gas blenders. In-water support may provide supplementary breathing gas, monitor divers during long decompression stops, and provide communications services between the surface team and the expedition divers. In an emergency, the support team would provide rescue and if necessary search and recovery assistance.|$|E

At some point Northumberland was at New Guinea. Rees sent a boat ashore to gather water. Local natives attacked the <b>boat</b> <b>crew,</b> killing or capturing them. Rees lost his chief, third, and fourth officers, and 12 seamen. Eventually Prince Nujku, of Ceram sent proas that rescued the survivors and took them to Bencoolen.|$|E
25|$|Because Alaskan crab {{fishing is}} one of the most {{dangerous}} jobs in the world, the U.S. Coast Guard rescue squads stationed at Integrated Support Command Kodiak (Kodiak, Alaska) and their outpost on St. Paul Island, near the northern end of the crab fishing grounds, are frequently shown rescuing crab <b>boat</b> <b>crew</b> members who fall victim to the harsh conditions on the Bering Sea. The USCG rescue squad was featured prominently during the episodes surrounding the loss of F/V Big Valley in January 2005, the loss of F/V Ocean Challenger in October 2006, and the loss of F/V Katmai in October 2008. Original Productions keeps a camera crew stationed with the Coast Guard during the filming of the show.|$|E
25|$|Nagle's journal {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of the First Fleet {{from the perspective of the}} common sailor.

He was a member of Governor Phillip's <b>boat</b> <b>crew</b> and took part in the explorations which led to the selection of Sydney as the site for settlement. He describes encounters with the Aboriginal people, including the spearing of Governor Phillip and the capture of Bennelong and Coleby.

50|$|Most Navy boats have {{permanently}} assigned crews.

All must be qualified swimmers.The <b>boat</b> <b>crews</b> represent their vessel and should for that reason take pride in their appearance and that of their boat. The efficiency and smartness of a ship's <b>boats</b> and <b>boat</b> <b>crews</b> reflect the standards of the ship. Clean white uniforms can be hard to maintain on some ships, but custom dictates that every day the ship's laundry wash and press a uniform for each member of the duty <b>boat's</b> <b>crew.</b> Ship regulations frequently require crew members to wear sneakers. This is a safety factor, but it also keeps the boats themselves looking good.|$|R
