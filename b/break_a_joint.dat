5000|$|A joint {{co-owner}} may <b>break</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy {{and maintain}} {{an interest in}} the property. Most jurisdictions permit a joint owner to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy by the execution of a document to that effect. In those jurisdictions which retain the old common law requirements, an actual exchange with a straw man is required. This requires another person to [...] "buy" [...] the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price. In either case, the joint tenancy will revert to a tenancy in common as to that owner's interest in the property.|$|E

50|$|Several {{missions}} on the Aquarius {{have been}} canceled due to hurricane activity. During Hurricane Gordon in 1994, {{a crew of}} scientists and divers had to evacuate Aquarius and climb up a rescue line to the surface in 15-foot seas {{after one of the}} habitat's generators caught fire. In 1998, Hurricane Georges nearly destroyed Aquarius, <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> in one of its legs and moving two 8000-pound weights on the wet porch nearly off the structure. Both Hurricane Georges and Hurricane Mitch, later in 1998, also destroyed way stations outside Aquarius used to refill aquanauts' scuba tanks. In 2005, Hurricane Rita broke two of the habitat's seabed anchors and moved one end of Aquarius by twelve feet. As of 2008, no scientists or staff members had been injured at Aquarius due to storms.|$|R

5000|$|The first fraternity, Delta Tau Delta, was {{established}} at Iowa State in 1875, {{six years after}} the first graduating class entered Iowa State. The first sorority, I.C. Sorocis, {{was established}} only two years later, in 1877. I.C. Sorocis later became a chapter of the first national sorority at Iowa State, Pi Beta Phi. Anti-Greek rioting occurred in 1888. As reported in The Des Moines Register, [...] "The anti-secret society men of the college met in a mob last night about 11 o'clock in front of the society rooms in chemical and physical hall, determined to <b>break</b> up <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> meeting of three secret societies." [...] In 1891, President William Beardshear banned students from joining secret college fraternities, resulting in the eventual closing of all formerly established fraternities. President Storms lifted the ban in 1904.|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} great {{interest}} recently in applying nonparametric kernel mixtures in a hierarchical manner to model multiple related data samples jointly. In such settings several data features are commonly present: (i) the related samples often share some, if not all, of the mixture components but with differing weights, (ii) only some, not all, of the mixture components vary across the samples, and (iii) often the shared mixture components across samples are not aligned perfectly {{in terms of their}} location and spread, but rather display small misalignments either due to systematic cross-sample difference or more often due to uncontrolled, extraneous causes. Properly incorporating these features in mixture modeling will enhance the efficiency of inference, whereas ignoring them not only reduces efficiency but can jeopardize the validity of the inference due to issues such as confounding. We introduce two techniques for incorporating these features in modeling related data samples using kernel mixtures. The first technique, called ψ-stick <b>breaking,</b> is <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> generative process for the mixing weights through the <b>breaking</b> of both <b>a</b> stick shared by all the samples for the components that do not vary in size across samples and an idiosyncratic stick for each sample for those components that do vary in size. The second technique is to imbue random perturbation into the kernels, thereby accounting for cross-sample misalignment. These techniques can be used either separately or together in both parametric and nonparametric kernel mixtures. We derive efficient Bayesian inference recipes based on MCMC sampling for models featuring these techniques, and illustrate their work through both simulated data and a real flow cytometry data set in prediction/estimation, cross-sample calibration, and testing multi-sample differences...|$|R

5000|$|A {{ligament}} is a {{small band}} of dense, white, fibrous elastic tissue. [...] Ligaments connect the ends of bones together in order to form <b>a</b> <b>joint.</b> Most ligaments limit dislocation, or prevent certain movements that may cause breaks. Since they are only elastic they increasingly lengthen when under pressure. When this occurs the ligament may be susceptible to <b>break</b> resulting in <b>an</b> unstable <b>joint.</b>|$|R

25|$|This {{left the}} {{original}} requirement unfulfilled; {{as a result}} of this outcome, in 1967, France entered into a series of discussions with West Germany on the topic of a prospective collaboration effort to meet this demand. West Germany was keen to participate in such talks, having long held an interest in conducting joint training operations with France along with a desire for strengthening positive political relations between the two nations. France also valued military cooperation with West Germany, wanting to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> perceived German ideological preference for American aircraft. In 1968, <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> specification was produced out of these talks. One substantial change to the requirements was that the sought trainer was now specified to be subsonic, supersonic trainer aircraft having proven to be superfluous to practical requirements. In July 1969, <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> development and production agreement was signed between West Germany and France; under the terms of this agreement, the two nations committed to purchasing 200 aircraft, these being domestically assembled in each of their own countries.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>joint</b> is <b>a</b> <b>break</b> (fracture) {{of natural}} {{origin in the}} {{continuity}} of either a layer or body of rock that lacks any visible or measurable movement parallel to the surface (plane) of the fracture. Although they can occur singly, they most frequently occur as joint sets and systems. <b>A</b> <b>joint</b> set is <b>a</b> family of parallel, evenly spaced joints that can be identified through mapping {{and analysis of the}} orientations, spacing, and physical properties. <b>A</b> <b>joint</b> system consists of two or more intersecting joint sets. The distinction between joints and faults hinges on the terms visible or measurable which depends on the scale of observation. Faults differ from joints in that they exhibit visible or measurable lateral movement between the opposite surfaces of the fracture. As <b>a</b> result, <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> may have been created by either strict movement of a rock layer or body perpendicular to the fracture or by varying degrees of lateral displacement parallel to the surface (plane) of the fracture that remains “invisible” at the scale of observation.|$|R

40|$|We propose coupled {{generative}} adversarial network (CoGAN) {{for learning}} <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> distribution of multi-domain images. In contrast to the existing approaches, which require tuples of corresponding images in different domains in the training set, CoGAN can learn <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. It can learn <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> distribution with just samples drawn from the marginal distributions. This is achieved by enforcing a weight-sharing constraint that limits the network capacity and favors <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> distribution solution over a product of marginal distributions one. We apply CoGAN to several joint distribution learning tasks, including learning <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> distribution of color and depth images, and learning <b>a</b> <b>joint</b> distribution of face images with different attributes. For each task it successfully learns the joint distribution without any tuple of corresponding images. We also demonstrate its applications to domain adaptation and image transformation.
