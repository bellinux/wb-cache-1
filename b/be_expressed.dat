5|$|Criticism must {{generally}} <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in a temperate and dispassionate manner. This allows rational {{debate about}} the issues raised, and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal {{position}} may <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> {{directly in}} geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for global models or in a map projection planar coordinates for regional models.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} {{is unique in}} comparison {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by non-human animals. Communication systems used by other animals such as bees or apes are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can <b>be</b> <b>expressed.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as a {{sum of the}} angles between the normal vectors at {{consecutive}} pairs of inflection points. It is 2 for convex curves and larger for non-convex curves, serving {{as a measure of}} non-convexity of a curve.|$|E
5|$|Many {{notions of}} graph {{coloring}} {{fit into this}} pattern and can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as graph homomorphisms into different families of graphs.|$|E
5|$|The Worldwide Tanker Normal Freight Scale, often {{referred}} to as Worldscale, is established and governed jointly by the Worldscale Associations of London and New York. Worldscale establishes a baseline price for carrying a metric ton of product between any two ports in the world. In Worldscale negotiations, operators and charterers will determine a price based on a percentage of the Worldscale rate. The baseline rate is expressed as WS 100. If a given charter party settled on 85% of the Worldscale rate, it would <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as WS 85. Similarly, a charter party set at 125% of the Worldscale rate would <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as WS 125.|$|E
5|$|Some 400 {{genes are}} {{shown to be}} brain-specific. In all neurons ELAVL3 <b>is</b> <b>expressed,</b> and in {{pyramidal}} neurons NRGN and REEP2 <b>are</b> also <b>expressed.</b> GAD1 essential for the biosynthesis of GABA <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in interneurons. Proteins expressed in glial cells are astrocyte markers GFAP, and S100B. Myelin basic protein and the transcription factor OLIG2 <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> in oligodendrocytes.|$|R

5|$|Both H.repandum and {{the variety}} album contain the diepoxide {{compound}} repandiol (2R,3R,8R,9R)-4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which {{was shown to}} have potent cytotoxic activity against various tumor cells in laboratory culture. At the molecular level, repandiol is an alkylating agent. It inserts crosslinks between strands of DNA, {{making it difficult for}} the genetic material to <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> or replicated.|$|E
5|$|Elvish {{greetings}} can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> both by {{voice and}} by hand, and often involve {{a combination of}} the two. Elvish greetings are often, but not always, used just prior to a conversation. From the Lord of the Rings it appears that Elves do not have a very elaborate greeting ritual.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{voices are}} often used, {{it is neither}} a concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose feelings and passions are to <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E

5|$|Possession can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> {{either by}} the possessive {{enclitic}} -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} a Lie group and has as such a Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E

The pyruvate content <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> as l mol of pyruvate/g of tissue. Total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) were estimated according to Schneider (1957), using diphenylamine and ordinal reagents, respectively. Nucleic acids content <b>was</b> <b>expressed</b> as l g/mg of tissue.|$|R
5|$|The NZGB {{encourages}} {{the use of}} original Māori names and has given some places official double names. These can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> as alternative names where officially either name could be used (Mount Taranaki or Mount Egmont) or dual names where both names should be used together (Matiu / Somes Island). In 1998, {{as a result of}} the settling of the Ngai Tahu Treaty claim, New Zealand's tallest mountain officially became Aoraki / Mount Cook. There are also a few English dual names, with Wellington harbour also officially known as Port Nicholson.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{units in}} the SI are formed by powers, {{products}} or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number. Derived units are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that {{is derived from the}} base quantities of time and length, so in SI the derived unit is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in terms of the dimensions of the base units.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E
