5|$|The travelogues of {{the later}} 19th century in turn further contributed to the {{elaboration}} and propagation of the Great Wall myth. Examples of this myth's growth are the false but widespread <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Great Wall of China is visible from the Moon or Mars.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was common}} to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour {{normally}} reserved for upper-class humans. The pharaoh's gifts suggest that the corpse was mummified, as was commonly done with humans at the time, in the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ka of the dead would enter into its afterlife through the ceremonial burial.|$|E

40|$|Keith DeRose’s {{solution}} to the skeptical problem is based on his indirect sensitivity account. Sensitivity is not {{a necessary condition for}} any kind of knowledge, as direct sensitivity accounts claim, but the insensitivity of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skeptical hypotheses are false explains why we tend to judge that we do not know them. The orthodox objection line against any kind of sensitivity account of knowledge is to present instances of insensitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> we still judge to constitute knowledge. This objection line offers counter-examples against the claim of direct sensitivity accounts that sensitivity is necessary for any kind of knowledge. These examples raise an easy problem for indirect sensitivity accounts that claim that there is only a tendency to judge <b>that</b> insensitive <b>beliefs</b> do not constitute knowledge, which still applies to our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skeptical hypotheses are false. However, a careful analysis reveals that some of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skeptical hypotheses are false are sensitive; nevertheless, we still judge that we do not know them. Therefore, <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> some of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> skeptical hypotheses are false are insensitive cannot explain why we tend to judge that we do not know them. Hence, indirect sensitivity accounts cannot fulfill their purpose of explaining our intuitions about skepticism. This is the hard problem for indirect sensitivity account...|$|R
25|$|Because people {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quantity of humors {{in the body}} could not be replenished, there were folk-medical <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loss of fluids {{was a form of}} death.|$|R
5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock. The name dew pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) derives from the widely held <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pond was filled by moisture from the air. In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.|$|E
5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the holiness movement in the mid-19th century and Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the growth and spread of Pentecostal and charismatic churches, however, the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience distinct from Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.|$|E
60|$|It is very {{largely through}} desires for <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{primitive}} nature of desire {{has become so}} hidden, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> part played by consciousness has been so confusing and so exaggerated.|$|R
50|$|Dominant logic {{relates to}} the main means a company uses to make a profit. In essence, it is an {{interpretation}} of how a company has succeeded. It describes the cultural norms and <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company espouses.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} holds {{as essential}} are often criticised by some Christians as diverging from Christian orthodoxy. Christian author Robert M.

5|$|Bond infiltrates the circus, {{and finds}} that Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures {{with a nuclear}} warhead, primed to explode at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament, in the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bomb was an American one that was detonated by accident, leaving the West's borders open to Soviet invasion. Bond deactivates the warhead and then he returns to India, joining an assault on Khan's palace.|$|E
5|$|In captivity {{the green}} and golden bell frog is known to feed on crickets, fruit flies, maggots, silkworms, {{domestic}} flies, beetles, mealworms, larvae, slaters, cockroaches, molluscs, plague locusts, spiders, water snails, earthworms, and mice. A case of a small tiger snake being eaten has also been reported. Captive frogs have a habit of not responding to stationary food items, which has helped to form the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> frog will eat most things that move.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik with the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soul of the deceased will pray for them in Heaven. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws {{it on top of}} the grave. Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> springs were used traditionally by Inupiat residents for cooking, for healing and spiritual purposes. Anthropologists {{who studied the}} Inupiat in the area reported local <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> healing influences at the hot springs site was very strong.|$|R
25|$|Many Neopagans worship Gaia. Beliefs {{regarding}} Gaia vary, {{ranging from}} <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Gaia is <b>the</b> Earth to <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> she is <b>the</b> spiritual {{embodiment of the}} earth, or the Goddess of the Earth.|$|R
5|$|Justice Souter joined Breyer's {{opinion in}} all respects but wrote {{separately}} to condition his support on the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> search was appropriate {{only because of the}} immediate danger that the evidence could have been destroyed.

5|$|Mazatec shamans have a {{long and}} {{continuous}} tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions. Most of the plant's local common names allude to the Mazatecs' post-Columbian <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plant is an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, with its ritual use also invoking that relationship.|$|E
5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{arrives at}} the crime scene and meets NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has called her in out of his <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> murders are related to satanism. Reyes merely answers the detective that it was not devil worship, and that the killer {{probably}} was under stress. As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it revert to normal.|$|E
50|$|Dawson was {{originally}} a Baptist pastor in the rapidly expanding industrial town of Birmingham, which {{he moved to}} in 1844 to become minister of the Mount Zion Baptist Chapel where <b>the</b> eloquence and <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young man expressed soon attracted a large following.|$|R
50|$|He made {{vigorous}} {{criticisms of}} the prevailing philosophy in the Islamic seminaries and <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main foundations of philosophy are inconsistent with the Holy Quran and Sunna.

50|$|When {{the site}} of the {{execution}} was finally confirmed by the University of Virginia's Gallows Hill Project in January 2016, no human remains were found, supporting traditional <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> families of the victims returned at night to recover their bodies and reinter them elsewhere.|$|R
5|$|On 29 June 626, {{a coordinated}} {{assault on the}} walls began. Inside the walls, some 12,000 well-trained Byzantine cavalry troops (presumably dismounted) defended the city {{against the forces of}} some 80,000 Avars and Slavs. Despite {{continuous}} bombardment for a month, morale was high inside the walls of Constantinople because of Patriarch Sergius' religious fervor and his processions along the wall with the icon of the Virgin Mary, inspiring the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines were under divine protection.|$|E
5|$|Other wrong {{beliefs are}} killing {{those who are}} in state of {{happiness}} or {{those who are in}} meditation under wrong <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mental state at the time of death will be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation.|$|E
5|$|Since then, most criticisms and denials of {{evolution}} {{have come from}} religious groups, {{rather than from the}} scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of their beliefs with evolution, such as through theistic evolution, other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of creationism, the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> universe and life were created by supernatural forces. The U.S.-centered creation–evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E
5000|$|The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying: [...] "Law enforcement should focus on action, not thought.

50|$|After a brief decline, {{the group}} {{experienced}} a revival {{in the aftermath}} of the October 2005 earthquake.

5|$|Swargadwar is {{the name}} given to the {{cremation}} ground or burning ghat which {{is located on the}} shores of the sea.

5|$|The {{concept of}} the conatus, as used in Baruch Spinoza's psychology, is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates {{principles}} that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.

5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it {{is golden}} in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5000|$|Bernard Cornwell has {{the main}} {{character}} of The Saxon Stories visit Wroxeter in Death of Kings, referring to it as an ancient Roman city that was [...] "as big as London" [...] and using it as an illustration of his pagan <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> World will end in chaos.|$|R
