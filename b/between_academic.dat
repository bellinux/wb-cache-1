25|$|The 1930s {{economic}} {{debate between}} LSE and Cambridge {{is well known}} in academic circles. Rivalry <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861–1935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history).|$|E
25|$|Percussionist Evelyn Glennie has {{collaborated with}} Björk {{and can be}} heard playing the marimba on Post and Telegram, as well as Oxygen. Thompson Twins {{included}} marimba in their many 1980s works. Jack White played marimba on The Nurse, a song on The White Stripes' album Get Behind Me Satan. In 2003, Marina Calzado Linage recorded an album bridging the gap <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> and popular music, Marimba de Buenos Aires, featuring music by Ástor Piazzolla. In 2009, Canadian musician Spencer Krug, working under the moniker Moonface, released a 20-minute continuous piece called Dreamland EP: Marimba And Shit-Drums with Jagjaguwar. The recording consists entirely of marimba, drums and vocals and comprises many movements and recurring themes. Vincent Montana Jr. played the marimba {{on one of the}} great socially conscious soul songs of the early 1970s People Make the World Go Round by The Stylistics. The experimental band Coil (band) used the marimba in its later performances such as Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods and studio albums The Ape of Naples and Black Antlers.|$|E
500|$|In a {{citation}} graph the vertices are documents with {{a single}} publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> papers as {{pointed out in the}} 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers" [...] by Derek J. de Solla Price. [...] In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in citation analysis. Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which are relevant to the current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse these graphs with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies in network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives a new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts. Another technique is main path analysis, which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given citation graph.|$|E

2500|$|Meringolo (2004) compares {{academic}} and public history. Unlike academic history, public history is typically a collaborative effort, {{does not necessarily}} rely on primary research, is more democratic in participation, and does not aspire to absolute [...] "scientific" [...] objectivity. Historical museums, documentary editing, heritage movements and historical preservation are considered public history. Though activities now associated with public history originated in the AHA, these activities separated out in the 1930s {{due to differences in}} methodology, focus, and purpose. The foundations of public history were laid on the middle ground <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> history and the public audience by National Park Service administrators during the 1920s-30s.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that there is no clear link <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> dishonesty and academic success. One study showed that students given an unexpected opportunity to cheat did not improve their grades significantly from the control group. [...] Another study showed that students who were allowed to bring cheat sheets to a test did not improve their grades. [...] While this may conflict with the common perception of cheating (one survey found only 13% of males and 46% of females think that cheating does not help grades,) it is often apparent to professors and members of academic conduct committees when a paper has been plagiarized by its inferior quality.|$|E

The Ministry of Education draws a distinction <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> and funding year levels, the latter being based on when a student first starts school—students first starting school after July, who therefore do not appear on the July roll returns, are classified as being in Funding Year 0 that year, and are recorded as being in Year 1 on the next year's roll returns.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Landau entered on {{a second}} career as a scholar. His {{interest}} in academic economics was spurred by his experiences with Halcon. [...] He wanted to better understand why a technically successful company {{had been unable to}} sustain itself. [...] His work focuses on the chemical industry, but applies its lessons to other industries as well. [...] In books such as The Positive Sum Strategy (1986) and Technology and the Wealth of Nations (1992), Landau examined the ways in which countries, government policies and investments, and companies all interact to influence economic growth and technological advancement. [...] He conceptualized technology as capital and examined the economics of innovation and globalization internationally. [...] He saw himself as providing a bridge <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> economists, industrial and business leaders, and scientists and engineers developing new technology.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his study}} of Eliade, Jung, and Campbell, Ellwood also {{discusses}} the connection <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> theories and controversial political involvements, noting that all three mythologists {{have been accused of}} reactionary political positions. Ellwood notes the obvious parallel between the conservatism of myth, which speaks of a primordial golden age, and the conservatism of far right politics. However, Ellwood argues that the explanation is more complex than that. Wherever their political sympathies may have sometimes been, he claims, the three mythologists were often [...] "apolitical if not antipolitical, scorning any this-worldly salvation". Moreover, the connection between mythology and politics differs for each of the mythologists in question: in Eliade's case, Ellwood believes, a strong sense of nostalgia ("for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise"), influenced not only the scholar's academic interests, but also his political views.|$|E

2500|$|The college {{employs a}} house system whereby {{undergraduates}} living in dormitories {{are assigned to}} a block of students of usually no more than 70 {{which serves as a}} focal point for university events. Most campus dormitories contain multiple houses, though Stony Island has only one, the eponymous Stony Island House. Each building is overseen by a resident master, and should there be more than one house, each a resident head. One or two upper division undergraduates are then selected to serve in addition as resident assistants for each house. All first years are required to live in housing, however, the availability of affordable, off campus apartments makes them a popular option with a sizable segment of the student body. Moreover, students are free to bid or request switches amid houses both <b>between</b> <b>academic</b> years and during them. As such, the house system is rather fluid, and students often have more than one affiliation during their time at the college. The current buildings and attendant houses of the college are: ...|$|E
