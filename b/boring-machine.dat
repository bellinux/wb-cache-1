[...] "Now," [...] he said, [...] "you can protest {{just as much}} as you like, but still, as you'll start to-morrow if we have to tie you on to the pack-horse, it's not going to be very much use. You can nurse your hand for a week, and then go on to Victoria {{and see if you can}} pick up a <b>boring-machine</b> of the kind we want cheap." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was anxious}} {{to know how they}} bored these long barrels, which seemed {{perfectly}} true and are said to shoot admirably; and, on asking the Gusti, received the enigmatical answer: [...] "We use a basket full of stones." [...] Being utterly unable to imagine what he could mean, I asked if I could see how they did it, and one of the dozen little boys around us was sent to fetch the basket. He soon returned with this most extraordinary <b>boring-machine,</b> the mode of using which the Gusti then explained to me. It was simply a strong bamboo basket, through the bottom of which was stuck upright a pole about three feet long, kept in its place by a few sticks tied across the top with rattans.|$|E

Though Nasmyth had lowered the level of the river a little, the smooth-worn stone still rose sheer from the depths of the {{whirling}} pool, and the blasting had obliterated every trace of their previous operations. They were compelled to make new approaches, and they toiled, drenched with the icy spray, on frail, slung stages, cutting sockets for the logs to hold a heavier platform for the little <b>boring-machine</b> Nasmyth had purchased in Victoria. When the platform was built, the working face was narrow, and the rock of a kind that yielded very slowly to the cutting-tool. They had no power but that of well-hardened muscle, and none of the workers had any particular knowledge of engineering.|$|E
