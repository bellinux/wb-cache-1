5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him {{on the outside of}} his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). He wished he were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E
5|$|Boston, {{the capital}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an {{important}} shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s. In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent {{what became known as the}} Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.|$|E

5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010 {{election}} campaign, Gillard {{also said}} that no carbon tax would be introduced under a government she led. In the first hung parliament result in 70 years, the Gillard Government, {{with the support of}} the Australian Greens and some cross bench independents, negotiated the implementation of a carbon tax (the preferred policy of the Australian Greens), <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> fixed-price carbon tax would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plans. The government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February 2011, which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.|$|E

5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> strand of DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of}} a different DNA molecule.

Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 RobertA.Martin {{proposed}} that the large North American wolf C.armbrusteri (Armbruster's wolf) was C.lupus. Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta {{proposed that}} C.dirus was not derived from C.lupus. In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could {{give rise to a}} larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciationa process <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C.dirus in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that C.lupus had given rise to the C.dirus hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E
5|$|OTA began filing {{condemnation}} {{suits for}} homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, the process <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> government exercises its powers of eminent domain, {{was required for}} OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, and drainage work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E

5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves {{an act of}} that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Order is {{dedicated}} to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First Degree exemplification ceremony, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. He {{is said to be a}} First Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating in the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, he rises to that status.

5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> polyubiquitinated {{protein is}} targeted to the proteasome {{is not fully}} understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Translation is {{the process}} <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> mature mRNA {{molecule}} {{is used as a}} template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
