40|$|Abstract]Grain harvest {{represents}} {{a period of}} high risk and is also a bottleneck in a grain production. This study develops a climate-based systems simulation model to investigate the economics of high moisture grain harvesting in Australia. The optimum harvesting and drying strategies were determined. The role of grain aeration cooling was also examined. The model software was developed in MATLAB. This model was run on an hourly basis using 15 years of historical weather data (1991 - 2005) for three main wheat production areas in Australia, represented by Goondiwindi (QLD), Tamworth (NSW) and Scaddan (WA). The Wheat Harvest System Simulation Model (WHSSM) consists of four submodels of weather data, machinery performance, crop loss and economic calculations. Each submodel is represented by mathematical functions and supported by available theoretical and field data. The weather submodel is used to predict dynamic grain moisture contents for a standing crop in the field. Machinery submodel was developed to calculate machinery performance and its operating costs at different grain and weather conditions. The main machinery involved are combine harvester, cooling aerator, and four categories of grain driers. Crop loss submodel is used to quantify grain losses involved during harvest and storage periods, including shedding (yield) losses, header losses, threshing losses, crop quality downgrading losses (due to rainfalls), and storage spoilage losses. The model {{has been used to}} predict and compare the possible return for different harvesting and postharvest management strategies. For the reference case (a 1000 ha farm with a high-capacity harvester and medium-capacity drier in Goondiwindi), it is found that the optimum harvest moisture content for using continuous flow drier and <b>batch</b> <b>drier</b> is 14 and 13...|$|E

A non-linear dynamic model is developed for <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> of foods. Process disturbances and measurement errors are modeled as stochastic processes and a hybrid extended Kalman filter is employed for state estimation. This filter is based on the local linearization of the process model around the suboptimal filter estimates.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish whether commercial sources of dried blood meals available in New Zealand offer useful sources of digestible protein for chinook salmon. Three blood meals were evaluated to assess their suitability as ingredients in salmon feed. In vitro digestibility was determined using the pepsin and pronase digestibility assays. In vivo digestibility was determined by feeding diets to chinook salmon formulated to contain 20 % <b>dried</b> blood meal (<b>batch</b> <b>dried,</b> ring dried or spray dried), and 80 % of a basal diet and by correcting for the digestible protein supplied by the basal diet. Chromic oxide was included in the diets as an indigestible marker. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and amino acids were determined based on samples of faeces collected after 7 days of feeding the respective test diet to chinook salmon. Feces were collected by a manual stripping of the hindgut. Crude protein contents were uniformly high, at 92. 0 %, 93. 1 % and 89. 6 % for the batch, ring and spray dried blood meals respectively. Amino acid contents were also generally high, with the exception of the essential amino acid methionine. All crude protein digestibility determinations ranked the blood meals as: spray dried > ring <b>dried</b> > <b>batch</b> <b>dried.</b> In vitro N digestibility values determined by pronase assay were 60. 5 %, 25. 5 % and 9. 0 % for spray, ring and <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> bloods, respectively. The pronase assay yielded significantly (P< 0. 001) higher digestibility values than did the pepsin assay in the case of ring and spray dried blood meals, corresponding values for crude protein digestibility with the pepsin assay were 27. 8 %, 18. 9 % and 8. 4 % for spray, ring and <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> bloods, respectively. The in vivo apparent faecal digestibility of protein in the dried blood meals determined in the chinook salmon were highest for the spray dried blood meal (68. 4 %), lower in ring dried blood meal (46. 3 %), and very low in the <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal. The amino acid digestibilities were similarly ranked, with the difference between ring and spray dried blood meal being statistically significant for 9 of 17 assayed amino acids (P< 0. 05). A secondary aim of the study was an evaluation of the laboratory rat as a model animal for determining protein digestibility in the chinook salmon. <b>Batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal was fed to rats in an experimental design closely following that set for the chinook salmon, and the apparent digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids were determined based on sampling of ileal digesta. Ileal crude protein digestibility for this <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal in the rat was also very low (3. 9 %), suggesting that the rat may be a suitable model animal for prediction of protein digestibility in chinook salmon. Differences in the protein digestibility of the blood meals appeared to be inversely related to the time spent in processing and drying. It appears that spray and ring dried blood meals may be suitable for inclusion in chinook salmon diets in partial replacement of fishmeal proteins.

40|$|In Sweden, the {{agricultural}} sector uses an estimated 3. 7 TWh per year as electricity or fuel. About 34 % of this total {{is estimated to be}} used in the production of beef, pork, eggs and milk, including the spreading of manure. Some energy is also used for harvesting ley and cereals as feed, which is not included. Most of the energy used is in the form of electricity (approx 63 %). All these estimates are based on a 1981 - 1984 survey by Nilsson & Påhlstorp (1985). Most of the technical equipment is still the same today on farms of comparable size and production methods. However, herds of pigs and cattle are larger now, and therefore new equipment is being used. The average Swedish dairy farm is 39 % larger (49 cows) than the EU- 15 average (35. 5 cows) and herd size is growing rapidly. The climate in winter at the study farms is not as cold as that in central Europe or northern Sweden, although air temperature was below 0 ºC for about 3 months in 2006 (average - 0. 1 ºC, Dec-Feb.) In the period June-August, the average temperature was 17. 8 ºC in 2005 and 19. 1 ºC in 2006. It only exceeded 30 ºC for a period longer than three hours on seven occasions. Because of the climate, it is necessary to have artificial heating in buildings for sows (farrowing section). In all other buildings the animals produce enough heat themselves to keep the house warm. When breeding cattle or dry sows some farmers accept a low inside temperature. Swedish animal welfare legislation requires more space per animal than most other countries. Slatted floors in lying areas are only permissible for fattening steers. Cages for laying hens have to include a sand-bath, nest and perches. Another difference is that sows can only be kept in crates occasionally and can never be tied up. The purpose of this study was to collect data on energy use on modern farms of a size and with a level of technical equipment that could be expected to be in use for the next 10 - 15 years. The data obtained were then added to data from Nilsson & Påhlstorp (1985). The survey was conducted on 16 farms with buildings mainly constructed during the past 10 years and with modern equipment. All these farms except one were in the south of Sweden (Skåne, Halland, Lat. 55 - 56 ºN) and the last one 180 km south-east of Stockholm (Lat. 58 ºN). The study was structured as follows: - Four complete dairy farms were studied in detail and another three were studied because they had interesting technical equipment that was not installed on the first four farms. - Three farms with pigs were studied. One had an FTS-system (Farrowing To Slaughter in the same pen), one a farrowing-growing system (Farrowing to approx. 25 kg/ 11 weeks in the same pen), and one had fattening pigs (approx. 25 - 110 kg). - Two farms with laying hens were studied. One had furnished cages and the other had laying hens on floors. - Two broiler houses were studied. - Four different types of grain dryers were studied: <b>batch</b> <b>drier,</b> circulating <b>batch</b> <b>drier,</b> continuous drier and batch-in-bin drier with multiple stirring augers. To measure electricity use, electricity meters of the type used by power companies were installed. These meters distinguishing between feeding, ventilation, light, manure handling and, for some plants, cleaning/disinfection, heating, milking and packing of eggs. When all these were measured there was still some more electricity that was impossible to measure or to distribute to the right category. This was categorised as Miscellaneous. Meters were also installed for estimating the power (W) used at one piglet farm and at two dairy farms. The data were processed and are included in the appendices in order to allow estimations to be made for other farms and evaluations to reduce the use of energy (power). In milk production, energy use was between 930 and 1540 kWh/cow per year (0. 125 - 0. 203 kWh/L milk). The functions that used most energy were milking and feeding, which together used 65 - 75 % of total energy. On farms that used a wheel loader and tractor for mixing Total Mixed Ration (TMR), energy consumption was higher than on those farms that used electrical engines for mixing. One litre of diesel was set to 9. 8 kWh. Production of piglets (approx. 25 kg) used 689 kWh/sow per year, which means about 28. 7 kWh/ 25 kg pig (assuming 24 piglets/sow & year). During the fattening period (25 - 110 kg), energy use was 20 kWh per pig. The total energy requirement to produce finishing pigs from birth to 110 kg was thus 48. 7 kWh/ 110 kg pig or 1163 kWh/sow per year, assuming a sow produces 24 piglets per year. This can be compared with the FTS-system, which uses 2431 kWh/sow per year. This difference is not completely caused by different breeding systems but is more likely to be due to difference in buildings, and therefore to a greater need for energy for lighting and ventilation, and a higher temperature in the farrowing unit. The farm that used less energy heated the breeding areas with a heat-pump, while another used diesel as fuel. Most energy was used for heating (including the use of heat lamps). If the building for dry sows needs mechanical ventilation and artificial light, then this leads to a greater use of energy. Egg production with laying hens in furnished cages used 3. 1 kWh/year per hen, while a system with free hens used 5. 0 kWh/year per hen. Light and ventilation fans used most energy, but were also the functions that showed the greatest differences between the systems. The difference in energy used for light is most probably due to the higher light intensity and to the two extra hours of light each day in the system with free layers. In broiler production, the largest use of energy was heating (84 %), followed by light (10. 7 %) and ventilation (3. 6 %). The energy needed to produce one broiler (1. 5 kg) was an estimated 0. 91 kWh. This value is an average of five batches due to large variations between batches. The use of electricity differed from 6 % to 20 % between similar houses. All the grain driers except the batch-in-bin drier used between 4. 2 and 9. 1 kWh per 1000 kg of grain during 2005 and 2006. Due to bad weather conditions the use of energy was 30 % higher in 2006. The batch-in-bin dryer used 12. 0 kWh per 1000 kg of grain 2006. Due to different technical standards the values are not directly comparable, but the data are valid for the separate functions...|$|E

40|$|Grass is an {{excellent}} energy crop; it may be classified as a high yielding, low energy input, perennial crop. Over 90 % of Irish agricultural land is under grass; thus farmers are familiar with, and comfortable with, this crop {{as opposed to a}} "new energy crop" such as Miscanthus. Of issue therefore is not the crop, but the methodology of generating energy from the crop. Numerous farmers across Europe (in particular Germany and Austria) use grass silage as a feedstock for biogas production; in a number of cases the produced biogas is scrubbed to biomethane and used as a transport fuel or injected into the natural gas grid. Many Irish farmers are considering converting from conventional farming such as beef production to grass biomethane production.

Starting as a tool to predict drying time, they evolved to become a replacement for a pilot plant study with the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics.

While the present study confirmed the merit of CFD modelling, it also discovered that it is unpractical to model a <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> because of excessive computational time.

As in other anaerobic systems, bacteriological activity is inhibited by lack of moisture and in <b>batch</b> <b>dry</b> digestion liquid is sprinkled over the substrate to encourage biomass degradation and biogas production throughout the process. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out to investigate individual methane generation from the recirculated liquid phase and from the stacked solid material.

Up to 21 % of the total methane generation originated from the recirculated liquid. This suggests that methane generation from the liquid phase {{is not to be}} neglected and needs to be recuperated. The process water tank should be equipped with gas collection facilities. Experimental results further indicate that higher ratios of easily hydrolysable substrates increase the proportion of methane from the liquid phase while slowly hydrolysable material encourages biogas generation in the decomposing biomass bed itself.

Experiments were also carried out {{to determine the effects}} of inlet air humidity on drying rate. The specific humidity ranged from a value typical for air at temperatures near freezing to a value for 30 C air at 90 percent relative humidity. The experimental results show drying rate is strongly affected by inlet air humidity, with the rate decreasing with more humid inlet air. The temperature of the drying process also plays a strong role, with the negative impacts of high inlet moisture being less of a factor in a higher temperature drying process. Concepts for coal drying systems integrated into a power plant were developed. These make use of hot circulating cooling water from the condenser, steam extraction from the turbine cycle and thermal energy extracted from hot flue gas, in various combinations. Analyses are under way to calculate the effects of drying system design and process conditions on unit performance, emissions, and cooling tower makeup water...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Final {{conditioning}} of 25 mm thick dried E. camaldulensis lumber {{was carried}} out in small capacity <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> kiln in laboratory, and the elastic (EL) strain and mechano-sorptive (MS) strain was analyzed by slicing method. Mean moisture content(MC) of boards increases 2. 5 - 3. 0 %, while surface MC increases from 9. 8 % to 14. 2 % and center MC always keeps at 12. 3 % or so. Difference of each slice oven-dried length, through the thickness of the board decreases with the going on of conditioning. Compressive EL strain in the surface decreases significantly during the first 9 h of conditioning, and tensile EL strain in the center doesn&# 8242;t change significantly with the going on of conditioning. Compressive EL strain of sub-surface is greater than that of surface during middle and final period of conditioning, so reverse stress gradient is formed. Casehardened surface is softened by moisture picking-up and then complementary shrinkage makes EL strain and MS strain decrease, but because of the effect of drying history, the change of MS strain lags behind that of M...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} check the {{applicability}} of Artificial Intelligent (AI) techniques to act as reliable inverse models to solve the multi-input/ multi-output heat flux estimation classes of inverse heat transfer problems (IHTPs), in a newly reconstructed experimental setup, a two-input/two-two output (TITO) heat flux estimation problem was defined in which the radiation acts as the main mode of thermal energy. A simple three-layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed, trained, and employed to estimate the input powers (represent emitted heats-heat fluxes from two halogen lamps) to irradiative <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> process. To this end, different input power functions (signals) were input to the furnace/dryer’s halogen lamps, and the resultant temperature histories were measured and recorded for two different points of the dryer/furnace. After determining the required parameters, the recorded data were prepared and arranged {{to be used for}} inverse modelling purposes. Next, an ANN was designed and trained {{to play the role of}} the inverse heat transfer model. The results showed that ANNs are applicable to solve heat flux estimation classes of IHTPs.

40|$|The {{technology}} of „dry fermentation “ can generate energy with communal and agri-cultural organic waste and biomass. Mixed with substrates from human origin such as yellow water (urine), brown water (faeces, night soil) {{and to a}} lesser extent grey water, the aim of a hygienic treatment and additional fertilizer recovery can be real-ized. Up until now biogas technology mainly concentrated on „wet fermentation “ of agricultural and communal biowaste as well as sewage sludge, the dry fermentation process can produce methane from biomass, which is not liquid, and in a mixture night soil collected from dry toilette systems. The one staged Batch Process needs no mixing of biomass during fermentation and no adding of water or liquid com-pounds, as it is necessary in conventional wet fermentation systems. The usual stir-ring and pumping falls away completely in <b>batch</b> <b>dry</b> fermentation systems. It is espe-cially suited for application in semiarid climates as the water consumption in the process is very low compared to conventional anaerobic digestion systems and can be recovered from the ecological sanitation system...|$|R
40|$|A solar-assisted heat-pump dryer {{and water}} heater has been designed, {{fabricated}} and tested. The {{performance of the}} system has been investigated under the meteorological conditions of Singapore. The system consists of a variable-speed reciprocating compressor, collector evaporator, storage tank, air-cooled condenser, auxiliary heater, blower, dryer, dehumidifier, and air collector. The drying system is designed {{in such a way}} that some of the components can be isolated depending on the weather conditions and usage pattern. The drying medium used is air and the drying chamber is configured to carry out <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> of food grains. A simulation program is developed using Fortran language to evaluate the performance of the system and the influence of different variables. The performance indices considered to evaluate the performance of the system are: Solar Fraction (SF) and Coefficient of Performance (COP) with and without a water heater. The values of COP, obtained from the simulation and experiment are 7. 0, and 5. 0, respectively, whereas the solar fraction (SF) values of 0. 65 and 0. 61 are obtained from simulation and experiment, respectively. Heat pump Drying Coefficient of performance Solar fraction...|$|R

40|$|Capacity {{optimisation}} of Norway spruce, 150 x 50 mm 2 {{was carried}} out in a full-scale kiln dryer starting at 50 °C wet bulb temperature. The objective was to reach as high capacity as possible. Maximum allowed moisture content (MC) standard deviation was 10 % of the end moisture content value with 2 % maximum allowed amount of checks. An adaptive control strategy for the process control of a kiln dryer was used to optimise the drying process. The temperature drop across the load (TDL) was used to achieve a constant moisture flux from the <b>drying</b> <b>batch.</b> The <b>drying</b> time was 56 h and the total cycle time was 66. 7 h. The end moisture content was 15. 6 % {{with a standard deviation of}} 1. 4 %-units. It was concluded that adjustments in TDL due to the amount of heartwood need to be done using this control strategy. Optimising start parameters for different wood species and board dimensions considering maximum allowed checking is important to achieve maximum capacity with this control strategy.

40|$|A {{series of}} meat meals was {{prepared}} {{from the one}} type of offal material, sheep stomachs, by <b>batch</b> <b>dry</b> rendering in a model cooker. The meals, designated normal cook (NC), overcooked (OC), rapidly cooked (RC), normal cook with added glucose (GC) and spoilt offal cook (SC), were evaluated as protein supplements by chick growth tests in rations based on wheat and skim milk powder. A control ration (CR) and one incorporating a commercial meat and bone meal (MR), were also included for comparison. No significant differences in weight gain were evident within replicate batches or between treatments NC, GC, OC and RC. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) {{did not differ significantly}} within replicate batches NC, OC and RC. A low weight gain and high FCR was given by SC. Weight gain did not vary significantly with feed intake. A significantly higher weight gain and lower FCR was given by CR whilst the lowest weight gain and highest FCR were given by MR, whose results were comparable only with meal from spoilt offal. Available lysine values (ALV) did not show significant decrease in the OC batches, but were lower in the GC batches. These results show that the nutritional value of meat meal is not adversely affected by varying the time of cooking from 1 to 2 1 / 4 h, by severe overprocessing or by addition of glucose, but that gross spoilage will decrease the nutritive value...|$|R
