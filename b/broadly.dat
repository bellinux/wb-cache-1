5|$|Agaricus bernardii {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} dark brown spore print. The spores are smooth, <b>broadly</b> elliptical, and have dimensions of 6–7.5 by 5–6μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring 14–25 by 4–7μm; the sterigmata are 4–5μm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are <b>broadly</b> club-shaped to cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 17–30 by 4–8μm.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{chaired the}} program {{committee}} for the Symposium on Theory of Computing, {{one of the two}} top research conferences in theoretical computer science, considered <b>broadly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pseudoxenasma: corticioid; wax-like texture; gloeocystidia with spherical apical appendices; basidia {{developing}} laterally on hyphae (pleurobasidia); spores <b>broadly</b> ellipsoid {{to roughly}} spherical, with warty ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Spores are <b>broadly</b> {{ellipsoid}} in shape, amyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7µm or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5µm {{depending on whether}} they originated from four-or two-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are <b>broadly</b> rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have granular contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. Clamp connections in the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{structure}} of Perl derives <b>broadly</b> from C. Perl is procedural in nature, with variables, expressions, assignment statements, brace-delimited blocks, control structures, and subroutines.|$|E
5|$|Trespass in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} <b>broadly</b> divided into three groups: {{trespass}} to the person, trespass to goods and trespass to land.|$|E
5|$|A {{subfield}} of {{the sociology}} of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study of}} death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to <b>broadly</b> as {{the sociology of}} death. This topic is exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs {{as a result}} of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes <b>broadly</b> relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{the colossal}} heads are <b>broadly</b> similar, there are {{distinct}} stylistic {{differences in their}} execution. One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated. Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers; they also incorporated {{the very concept of}} rulership itself.|$|E
5|$|Although fungi are opisthokonts—a {{grouping}} of evolutionarily related organisms <b>broadly</b> {{characterized by a}} single posterior flagellum—all phyla except for the chytrids have lost their posterior flagella. Fungi are unusual among the eukaryotes in having a cell wall that, in addition to glucans (e.g., β-1,3-glucan) and other typical components, also contains the biopolymer chitin.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 census, 16.3% of the {{population}} of Middlewich either did not answer the question about religion, or stated that they had no religion. The breakdown for Congleton showed that 99.3% of those that replied, and did not state that they had no religion, were Christian; the figures for Middlewich will be <b>broadly</b> similar.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broadly</b> {{backed by}} student groups and many faculty members the Committee Against Investment in South Africa held teach-ins and demonstrations {{through the year}} focused on the {{trustees}} ties to the corporations doing business with South Africa. Trustee meetings were picketed and interrupted by demonstrations culminating in May 1978 in the takeover of the Graduate School of Business.|$|E
5|$|<b>Broadly</b> speaking, {{radishes}} can {{be categorized}} into four main types according to the seasons when they are grown {{and a variety of}} shapes lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow radishes, with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a parsnip.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple <b>broadly</b> contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's {{population}} {{has been described as}} <b>broadly</b> working class with pockets of lower middle class communities, particularly in the northeast of the town, near the border with Royton. Parts of the town are relatively affluent compared to the wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used as a weapon on April 22, 1915, at Ypres by the German Army. The effect on the allies was devastating because the {{existing}} gas masks were difficult to deploy and had not been <b>broadly</b> distributed.|$|E
5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral infection. Others use the term more <b>broadly,</b> to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{can also}} be used more <b>broadly</b> to identify species present in a body of water, debris filtered from the air, or sample of dirt. This can establish the range of invasive species and endangered species, and track seasonal populations.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally <b>broadly</b> defined Liliaceae s.l., many {{attempts have been made to}} form suprageneric classifications, e.g. subfamilies and tribes. Classifications published since the use of molecular methods in phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (Liliaceae s.s.). The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APweb) recognizes three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes.|$|E
5|$|First, Universal {{knew that}} it did not have {{trademark}} rights to King Kong, yet it proceeded to <b>broadly</b> assert such rights anyway. This amounted to a wanton and reckless disregard of Nintendo's rights.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{was better}} known as the author of a series of books about his super-spy creation, James Bond; The Diamond Smugglers is one of two non-fiction books he wrote. It was <b>broadly</b> well-received, {{although}} some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.|$|E
5|$|Fossil-fuel {{energy systems}} have {{different}} production, transmission, and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems, and new promotional policies {{are needed to}} ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and <b>broadly</b> as is socially desirable.|$|E
5|$|Genome-scale RNAi {{research}} {{relies on}} high-throughput screening (HTS) technology. RNAi HTS technology allows genome-wide loss-of-function screening and is <b>broadly</b> {{used in the}} identification of genes associated with specific phenotypes. This technology has been hailed as the second genomics wave, following the first genomics wave of gene expression microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism discovery platforms.|$|E
5|$|Gondoliers: A Mafia-themed {{adaptation}} of the opera, <b>broadly</b> rewritten by John Doyle and orchestrated and arranged Sarah Travis, was given at the Watermill Theatre and transferred to the Apollo Theatre in the West End in 2001. The production utilised Doyle's signature conceit of the actors playing their own orchestra instruments.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia in his Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia dentata was placed in section Eubanksia alongside B.marginata and a <b>broadly</b> defined B.integrifolia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to writing on process {{approaches to the}} environment, Palmer has contributed to Christian environmental ethics more <b>broadly,</b> urban environmental ethics, and scholarship on the environment {{in the work of}} English writers. Much of her work in environmental ethics has explored questions concerning animals, including the tension between protecting individuals and protecting species.|$|E
5|$|Infantry units mostly {{fought in}} close order as did their forebears from the Principate. Infantry {{equipment}} was <b>broadly</b> {{similar to that}} of auxiliaries in the 2nd century, with some modifications (see Equipment, below).|$|E
5|$|Mangalorean Catholics {{speak the}} Konkani language, {{which they have}} {{retained}} as their mother tongue despite the migration; the language {{is central to the}} community's identity. They speak a dialect known as Mangalorean Catholic Konkani, which the Ethnologue <b>broadly</b> identifies as the Mangalore dialect.|$|E
5|$|McEwan's is {{well known}} for its {{cavalier}} mascot, <b>broadly</b> based on the Frans Hals painting, the Laughing Cavalier portrait, which has been used since the 1930s. The company was a well known sponsor of numerous football teams throughout the 1980s, and 90s, most notably Blackburn Rovers' Premier League title winning side, and Rangers.|$|E
5|$|More <b>broadly,</b> one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E
5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a <b>broadly</b> defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemurs, and brown lemurs due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the acute}} side effects {{associated}} with brachytherapy {{can be treated}} with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are <b>broadly</b> similar to EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is <b>broadly</b> analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Royton's {{population}} {{has been described as}} <b>broadly</b> working class with pockets of lower middle class communities, particularly in the southwest of the town, near the border with Chadderton, and a growing middle middle class community to the north near Tandle Hill Country Park.|$|E
5|$|Takahashi {{suggests}} that the species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes, as defined by Dutch Mycena specialist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus. Within the section, the North American species M.subfusca appears to be closely related to M.fuscoaurantiaca. M.subfusca may be distinguished by its spindle- to <b>broadly</b> club-shaped cheilocystidia without a narrow neck, club-shaped to irregularly shaped caulocystidia, and lack of pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 census {{reported}} an almost {{equal number of}} males (1016, 49.9%) as females (1020, 50.1%), of which the majority (1988, 97.6%) were white ethnicity, <b>broadly</b> similar to the ethnical diversity of the wider Hampshire region, where 111,635 (96.56%) are registered on the 2011 census as being white ethnicity.|$|E
