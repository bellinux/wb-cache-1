A wrinkle in this arrangement occurred as the project neared completion, however, when Saskatchewan's newly installed NDP government refused to pay its share of $190 million in cost overruns. The other players eventually agreed to pay Saskatchewan's share, but would withhold returns to that province until they had recovered Saskatchewan's arrears.|$|E
2500|$|Thermodynamic {{benefits}} are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated. [...] Major factors limiting the load output of a {{combined cycle power plant}} are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine {{and the heat}} recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.|$|E

Because selenium enrichment may influence the nutrient <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> a study was done to test the effects of selenite-Se (Na 2 SeO 3 ⋅ 5 H 2 O) on selected macronutrients content in maize (Zea mays L. var. saccharata Kcke. cv.

The dry weight of the shoots was then analyzed for phosphorus (P), potas-sium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) content. Phosphorus and calcium content increased, while potassium content decreased with increasing selenium treatments. No si-gnificant differences were found for magnesium level. Plant growth was affected by exces-sive selenium concentration. At low concentration (5 µmol⋅dm- 3), selenium tended to sti-mulate the plant growth and the root elongation but at higher concentrations (50 and 100 µmol⋅dm- 3) the dry mass accumulation and root tolerance index severely decreased. The study revealed that disturbances of growth and reduction <b>of</b> <b>plant’s</b> biomass at the presence of high selenium concentrations in the nutrient solution may have resulted from the disturbance <b>of</b> mineral <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> namely accumulation <b>of</b> large amounts of calcium and phosphorus in shoot tissues...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} light and {{ammonium}} levels on net production, fluorescence parameters and non-structural carbohydrates of the seagrass Zostera noltii under different phosphate conditions were studied. A fully factorial design was used with light (low/high levels), ammonium supply and phosphate preculture conditions <b>of</b> the <b>plants</b> as the experimental variables. Both ammonium supply and low light caused negative and synergistic effects on net production, while ammonium toxicity was more severe at high light levels; in this case, it was independent of the non-structural carbohydrate (sucrose and starch) content. Preculturing <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> with added phosphate alleviated the ammonium toxicity, and also attenuated the negative production <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> grown at low light levels. The results indicated that phosphate preculture ameliorated the plant’s short-term response against the assayed stressors (low light, high ammonium) significantly. An overall consumption of non-structural carbohydrates in response to environmental stressors was recorded throughout the experiment, indicating the importance of carbon and phosphorus reserves to cope with adverse conditions. In addition, phosphate deficiency increased the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> which could have negative ecological consequences for seagrass species thriving under phosphate deficiency conditions, or in developing seagrass transplantation programs. ...|$|R
