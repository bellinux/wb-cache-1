Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens kept two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They kept the place clear from thieves and to add insult to injury, kept people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often kept people from getting money they may have dropped on the ground for people exiting their cars.|$|E

25|$|The Rising Sun badge, {{also known}} as the General Service Badge or the Australian Army Badge, is the {{official}} insignia of the Australian Army and is mostly worn on the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> a slouch hat or, less frequently, on the front of a peaked cap for Army personnel filling certain ceremonial appointments. The badge is readily identified with the spirit of ANZAC, the legend of the Australian soldier (or digger), and the esprit de corps of the Army itself, due to its association with the landings at Gallipoli in 1915. Today, new recruits receive the badge with their initial issue of equipment, which happens within their first three days of enlistment.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match of}} the night {{was one of the}} focal points of the show, the finals of the 16 team Gran Alternativa tournament. Rey Escorpión showed that he had taken the young rudo Boby Zavala under his wing from the moment they entered the arena, Zavala wore a Rey Escorpión T-shirt and was give his own Los Revolucionarios del Terror (Escorpión's team) Sombrero with his name on the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> it. The match focuses mainly on the two Novatos Hombre Bala, Jr. and Zavala as they worked hard to show that they had the wrestling skills to work at a higher level than they were before the tournament. The match went the full three falls. In the closing moments of the match Rey Escorpión {{eliminated}} Hombre Bala, Jr. after he used his signature Aguijón Venenoso ("The Poisoned Stinger") finishing move, also known as a Package piledriver on Bala, Jr. Moments later Boby Zavala landed a splash off the ropes and pinned Atlantis to win the tournament. Following the match the rudo team were presented with trophies as a visual representation of their victory. Afterwards Escorpión touted the values of the Sonora wrestling school that he and Zavala both had trained {{at the beginning of their}} careers.|$|E
25|$|The bowl {{in which}} the drink is {{prepared}} is called a tanoa or laulau. The former word is the more frequently used. The bowls vary in size from twelve to thirty inches and they stand on short rounded legs varying in number from four to twentyfour. It is unusual to find a bowl that has a greater depth than six inches and the majority are perhaps not more than three or four inches deep. A <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> a width varying according {{to the size of}} the bowl runs round the top of the tanoa, and a flange or sometimes a projecting piece of the original wood is left under the bowl. This is pierced by a hole through which a piece of afa (native sennit) is threaded for suspending the bowl from a house post. The tanoa is usually made from the wood of the ifilele tree (Intsia bijuga), a hard-grained timber of a reddish-brown colour. When the bowl was finished it was soaked in fresh water for a considerable time to remove the woody smell. 'Ava often was also allowed to remain indefinitely in the tanoa in order that the inside might acquire an enamelled appearance. This enamel or sheen is called tane. In earlier bowls the legs were tapered towards the bottom and reduced there to about a half an inch in diameter. Chiefs and orators, high and low, use the same type of tanoa. At ceremonies, the bowl used is that belonging to the chief or orator at whose house the ceremony is being held.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid engorgement of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and hypovolemia. However, horses {{may not have a}} high heart rate, presumably due to increased vagal tone. Rectal palpation will demonstrate a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able to}} push beyond the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, laminitis, and DIC.|$|E

2500|$|In Kalamazoo, {{with cold}} weather around 40 degrees and windy, both teams’ {{managers}} agreed {{to play the}} Game 2 in just seven innings.

Grand Rapids gave her a one-run lead in the second inning, and wrapped up the scoring by producing three runs in the sixth, keyed by a two-run double off the bat of Ricketts. Risinger gave up a RBI single to Jean Lovell, and yielded only one extra-base hit, a solo home run by Doris Sams during Kalamazoo's two-run rally in the sixth inning. In the bottom of the seventh, the Lassies tried to rally again. Fern Shollenberger opened with a single, but Risinger retired the next two batters.

2500|$|The Cumans were {{reported}} to be handsome people with blond hair, fair skin and blue eyes, and desirable women. Cuman women had a high reputation for their beauty amongst the Russian aristocracy. Robert de Clari reported that the Cumans often wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest, usually worn in conjunction with bracers. [...] Underneath the vest was worn a short or long sleeved tunic/tabard, extended to the mid calf, splitting {{in the front and}} back between the legs. Men wore trousers and a caftan, each fastened by a belt, which was the traditional costume. The women also wore caftans, as well as pants, dresses, and tunics shorter than those worn by men, sometimes split along the front, back, and sides. Clothes were commonly coloured deep crimson for decoration. Cuman men wore distinguishing conical felt or leather hats, pointed at the top with a broad brim (if made of felt) or a fur trim around the base (if made of leather). The <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> the hat formed a sharp angle at the front and upturned on the rear and at the sides. Women wore a large variety of head dresses and also wore conical hats but with a felt top and a cloth veil extending down the back. This veil only covered the back neck and not the hair or face; another source states that it did cover the hair and that sometimes one or two braids were visible. Women wore a variety of jewellery, such as torques, a type of neck ornament consisting of one or several metal strands attached to a ribbon or necklace and hung around the neck, and head dresses that were made of a series of silver rings on a solid, cylindrically shaped material that was fastened at the temples. The men shaved the top of their head, {{while the rest of the}} hair was plaited into several braids; they also had prominent moustaches. Other Cumans also wore their hair very long, without shaving the top. The women had their hair loose or braided with buns twisting at the side. Both men and women followed a tradition of braiding coloured ribbons into their hair. For footwear, Cuman men and women wore long leather or felt boots with support straps connected to their belt. Both men and women wore cloth or metal arm bands.|$|E
