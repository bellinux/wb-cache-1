25|$|Chevrolet honored California beach resorts {{once again}} by naming the top Chevelle series Laguna with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In {{addition}} to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored urethane front end concealing the new 5mph <b>bumper</b> <b>system.</b> On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific diecast chrome grille with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear bumper, front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.|$|E
25|$|For 1974, a new rear <b>bumper</b> <b>system</b> {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. Underneath sat a box-section aluminum impact bar on two Omark-bolt slider brackets {{similar to the}} system used in the nose which allowed the Corvette to pass federal five-mph impact tests at the rear {{as well as the}} front. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-date than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. For the 1974 model only, casting limitations mandated left and right bumper covers with a vertical center seam. The anti-theft alarm key activator was moved from the rear panel to the front left fender. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions.|$|E

In 1972, he formed with architect Gae Aulenti a study group for the development of new urban transportation systems, a theme which he pursued further for an exhibition at the XVI Triennale in Milan in 1979 and which included the design of a bus for Fiat that enabled passengers to stow their bicycles in a rack. His research culminated with the design of the Zoombike (no longer in production), a lightweight bicycle designed with aircraft technology to achieve the required strength and speed acceleration, which can fold as quickly and simply as an umbrella and easily fit into a car trunk.|$|R
40|$|Bumper bars {{have been}} used on {{vehicles}} almost from their early beginnings and in today’s vehicles they are performing a number of functions. They are required to not only fit within the vehicles overall design aesthetics but are also being required to ideally absorb larger amounts of energy, offer protection to a vehicle’s high value components and be low cost to repair. Due to climate change there is an ever increasing need for less fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The effects of “peak oil” are also set to demand and in perhaps in a much shorter time frame, the need to dramatically reduce fuel consumption {{even more than the}} fore mentioned factors. However, vehicle weights have been steadily increasing due to luxury and performance based feature inclusions. These factors mean there is a more pressing need to reduce vehicle weights. The consumer is also becoming more conscious of vehicle safety features and safety is figuring more prominently in the minds of consumers and government regulators. Thus the light weighting needs and the need for improved safety affect the choice of material and the design of <b>bumper</b> <b>systems</b> and other vehicle components. Aluminium and magnesium alloys have the potential to offer lightweight solutions for a <b>bumper</b> bar <b>system,</b> which is a significant structural component within a vehicle and can play a significant roll in energy absorption...|$|R
