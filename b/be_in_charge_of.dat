5|$|Scott {{had decided}} on a mixed {{transport}} strategy, relying on contributions from dogs, motor sledges and ponies. He appointed Cecil Meares {{to take charge of}} the dog teams, and recruited Shackleton's former motor specialist, Bernard Day, to run the motor sledges. Oates would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the ponies, but as he could not join the expedition until May 1910, Scott instructed Meares, who knew nothing of horses, to buy them—with unfortunate consequences for their quality and performance.|$|E
5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the reform of the royal government.

5|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put}} in charge of Raw, after Eric Bischoff took the night off, {{following}} his match the night before. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series. Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series. The winning team would be granted absolute control of running the show for a month, and the winning members would all get a week to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the program.

5|$|Ministers may be {{designated}} by the Prime Minister to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio. The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge. Some Ministers are appointed as Second Ministers for portfolios {{other than their own}} to assist the primary Minister in his or her duties.

5|$|When {{termites}} {{construct their}} nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single termite would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, {{but at a}} group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.|$|E
5|$|By 1310 the {{relationship}} between Edward II and his earls had deteriorated {{to the point where}} a committee of earls took control of government from the king. The earls disobeyed a royal order not to carry arms to parliament, and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform. At the heart of the deteriorating situation was the peers' opinion of Edward II's relationship with Piers Gaveston, and his reputedly outrageous behavior. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, who were to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the reform of the royal household. John of Brittany was one of eight earls appointed to this committee of21, referred to as the Lords Ordainers. He was among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II and was also by this time one of the older remaining earls.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter was not {{the first}} person asked to oversee the comic; Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-off comic, was {{originally}} intended to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the bimonthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the TV series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take them on. Although the comic-book series was intended to expand on the TV series, there was an occasional continuity overlap because of differences in production schedule between the comic and the series. In one instance, the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM and the season-three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs. The comic-book series tied into the TV series, the Chloe Chronicles webisodes and Smallville-related webpages, with cast and crew interviews and information on the episodes' production. The comic-book series ended in January 2005, with no comics published until the Season Eleven series debut.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a new {{contract}} was signed between the Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) with a Lebanese company Inkript, a member of Resource Group Holding (RGH), to make the move for biometric passports. Inkript held {{a joint venture with}} French firm Gemalto, based in the Netherlands to participate in the tender.

The contract’s term is three years, and Inkript will produce four million Lebanese biometric passports. The contract, valued at around 140 million US dollars, was funded by a Saudi grant.

5|$|On 12November 1945, at {{the first}} general meeting of army leadership, General Sudirman– {{the leader of the}} Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years {{military}} experience and was 23 years younger than Oerip– was elected leader of the army following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional commanders from Sumatra, who had voted unanimously, swayed the vote in Sudirman's favour; Oerip had lost votes because some of the division leaders distrusted his history with the KNIL and the oath he had taken to the Dutch motherland upon graduation. Although Sudirman was surprised at his selection and offered to surrender the leadership position to Oerip, the meeting did not allow it; Oerip himself was glad to no longer <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the army. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to serve as chief of staff under him. While Sudirman remained unconfirmed, Oerip remained de jure leader; however, the Indonesian journalist Salim Said writes that Oerip's orders were at times unintelligible owing to the leader's poor command of Indonesian and often ignored unless approved by Sudirman.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 400 hastily {{assembled}} US Army recruits {{arrived in}} Okinawa aboard the USS Walker. The inexperienced soldiers {{were assigned to}} the 29th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, a command that was preparing other battalions to move into Korea and to relieve the other units of the 24th Infantry Division. The new formations, now consisting mostly of soldiers who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions, were immediately sent into Pusan. The headquarters of the regiment remained behind to form a new regiment. This regiment would originally <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the defense of Okinawa but would later be rushed into Korea. The two battalions landed in Pusan on July 21 and {{were assigned to the}} 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, but they retained their designations as the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 29th Infantry Regiment. Instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter the front lines, the battalions were immediately sent to the regiment's sector at Chinju. By July 22 the units were on the front lines with new equipment. The equipment, fresh from production lines, was not prepared for combat, despite promises from several commanders that the unit would be given time to do so.|$|E

5|$|Rear Admiral Lionel Tufnell, {{the head}} of a British naval mission to Greece, {{advocated}} purchasing another armored cruiser like Gerogios Averof, along with several smaller vessels and allocating funds to modernizing the Greek naval base at Salamis; this proposal was supported by Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who sought to control naval spending in the tight Greek budget projected for 1912. The plan came to nothing, as the Greek government waited for the arrival of British advisers for the Salamis project. In early 1912, the Greek Navy convened a committee that would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> acquiring a new capital ship to counter Reşadiye, initially conceived as a battlecruiser. The new ship would be limited to a displacement of , since that was the largest vessel the floating dry dock in Piraeus could accommodate.

5|$|The Cabinet {{generally}} directs {{and controls}} the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament. It also has significant influence over lawmaking. Ministers may be {{designated by the}} Prime Minister to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Singapore's ministers {{are among the best}} paid in the world. Prior to a salary review in 2011, the Prime Minister's annual salary was S$3.07 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers ranged between S$1.58 million and S$2.37 million. On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to review the salaries of the Prime Minister as well as the President, political appointment holders, and Members of Parliament. Following the recommended wage reductions by the committee which were then debated and subsequently accepted in Parliament, the Prime Minister's salary was reduced by 36% (includes the removal of his pension) to S$2.2 million (then about US$1.7 million). Nonetheless, the Prime Minister remains the highest-paid political leader in the world.|$|E
5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E
