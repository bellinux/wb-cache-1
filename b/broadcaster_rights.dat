50|$|Broadcasting rights {{vary from}} country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the {{distribution}} of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a VPN or proxy server. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a <b>broadcaster</b> <b>rights</b> to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as HBO for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.|$|E

Copyright is based on the quasidual concept, which simply means that we distinguish the moral rights from the property rights. In this work, I explain the content of all of these individual rights. I also address the licensing contract, by which the author authorizes another person to administer the rights to use his piece. I am focusing on cases of the so-called non-contractual use of production, which means that the user may use the work without the consent of the author and free of charge. Furthermore, I define the idea and the content of performer's rights to his artistic output, the manufacturer of the sound and image recording rights to his sound recordings and radio and television <b>broadcaster's</b> <b>rights</b> to his broadcast.
