5|$|According to the 2010 census, the City and County of Denver {{contains}} 600,158 {{people and}} 285,797 households. The population density is 3,698 inhabitants {{per square mile}} (1,428/km²) including the airport. There are 285,797 housing units at an average density of 1,751 per square mile (676/km²). However, the average density throughout most Denver neighborhoods tends to <b>be</b> <b>higher.</b> Without the 80249 zip code (47.3 sqmi, 8,407 residents) near the airport, the average density increases to around 5,470 per square mile.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of emus on mainland Australia is thought to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> {{now than it was}} before European settlement, some local populations are at risk of extinction. The threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of the eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also <b>be</b> <b>higher,</b> causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the adipose (fat) tissue.

5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> risk.|$|E

5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E

Baker asserts that the true figure could <b>be</b> <b>higher,</b> owing to the inability of post-war researchers to identify an exact figure, due to the loss or destruction of British records in the retreat from Greece or during the subsequent occupation.|$|E

Hampden regularly has crowds of below 1,000 for Queen's Park matches in the lower divisions of the Scottish football league system. Queen's Park have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1958.|$|E
5|$|Some {{guidelines}} {{recommend a}} bolus (initial large dose) of insulin of 0.1unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight. This can be administered {{immediately after the}} potassium level is known to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> than 3.3mmol/l; if the level is any lower, administering insulin {{could lead to a}} dangerously low potassium level (see below). Other guidelines recommend delaying the initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered. It is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections under the skin for mild or moderate cases.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis.

Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E

5|$|Some {{water from}} the Shamokin Creek {{watershed}} enters the Mahanoy Creek watershed via various mine tunnels, mainly the Doutyville, Helfenstein, the Locust Gap, and the Centralia Mine discharges. Water from Mahanoy Creek also flows through mine tunnels into Shamokin Creek. The discharge of the creek at various locations ranges from 0 to 320 cubic feet per second. The discharge of acid mine drainage in the creek ranges from 0 to 17.2 cubic feet per second. In 2001, the discharge was typically found to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in March than in August.|$|E
5|$|The {{average number}} of lice per host tends to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> in large-bodied bird species than in small ones. Lice have an {{aggregated}} distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice. This pattern is more pronounced in territorial than in colonial—more social—bird species.|$|E

5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Rivens development, {{publisher}} Brøderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of a delay in the publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game {{in time for the}} 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to <b>be</b> <b>higher</b> than any other game that holiday season, Brøderbund launched a $10million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.|$|E
