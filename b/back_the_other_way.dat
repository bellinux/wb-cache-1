2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|E

50|$|CHOTHE SYSTEM OF MARRIAGE:A {{man from}} a Chothe clan cannot just marry another Chothe woman, as he wanted. In ancient days, our ways of {{marriage}} {{would have been}} zealously adhered to. At one time, a Parpa man was allowed to marry a Thao woman. Yet, since centuries <b>back,</b> it was <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> around. Now, men from Thao clans marry the women of Parpa clan. There are bride-givers, and bride-takers,breaking the law and manipulating or otherwise, was a taboo. In the olden days, a person breaking this sacred tradition was exiled from the village. He or She was even sometimes speared to death.|$|R

40|$|This report {{sets out}} the {{established}} theory of driving a mode in a beam loaded, multi-cell cavity via a waveguide coupling and derives associated envelope equations from which time domain solutions are developed. Time domain solution allows accurate simulation with realistic microphonic spectra, beamloading, drive amplifier characteristics, controller and measurement errors to be encompassed. A computer code {{that uses the}} model is used to compute limits on phase and amplitude stability of a dipole mode {{as a function of}} disturbance and control system latency for a superconducting cavity being developed for use as a crab cavity for the ILC. A crab cavity is a deflection cavity operated with a 90 o phase shift with respect to the beam so that the front of a bunch gets kicked one way whilst <b>the</b> <b>back</b> gets kicked <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way...</b>|$|R

50|$|Although many regard {{trails and}} street as being {{completely}} opposite, the attraction is similar — trails riders {{build their own}} jumps so their riding is limited only by their creativity and resourcefulness. Trails riders usually run a rear brake only as they have no use for a front brake, and usually a rotor (gyro) {{to make it easier}} to do barspins, so they do not have to spin the bars <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to untangle them, which is hard to do on trails. In general, trail/dirt jumping bikes have longer wheelbases (chainstays) than other BMXs to aid with stability, the added stability is important in trails riding.|$|E
5000|$|A DTP dam {{is a long}} {{barrier of}} 30 km or more which is built {{perpendicular}} to the coast, running straight out into the sea, without enclosing an area. Along many coasts of the world, the main tidal movement runs parallel to the coastline: the entire mass of the ocean water accelerates in one direction, {{and later in the}} day <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> A DTP dam is long enough to exert an influence on the horizontal tidal movement, which generates a water level differential (head) over both sides of the dam. The head can be converted into power, using a long series of conventional low-head turbines installed in the dam.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a steel mill can convert 1 load of iron plus 1 load of coal into 2 loads of steel. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to {{each step of the}} industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, [...] "create" [...] manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

50|$|A pole lathe is a wood-turning lathe {{that uses}} a long pole as a return spring for a treadle. Pressing the treadle with your foot pulls on a cord that is wrapped around the piece of wood or billet being turned. The {{other end of the}} cord reaches up {{to the end of a}} long springy pole. As the action is reciprocating, the work rotates in one {{direction}} and then <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Cutting is only carried out on the down stroke of the treadle, the spring of the pole only being sufficient to return the treadle to the raised position ready for the next down stroke. Modern pole lathes often replace the springy pole with an elastic bungee cord.|$|E
5000|$|An {{efficient}} {{system of}} dispersing feed and water {{along the road}} was put in use. Teams outbound from Mojave, pulling empty wagons, hauled their own feed and supplies, which were dropped off at successive camps as the outfit traveled. The supplies would be on hand to use when a loaded wagon came <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> and no payload space was wasted. There was one stretch of road where a 500-gallon wagon was added to take water to a dry camp for the team that would be coming from the opposite direction. The arriving team would use the water and take the empty tank back to the spring on their haul the next day, ready for re-filling and staging by the next outbound outfit.|$|E

Jerry sets his weapon up in the ground, draws it back and fires his rock into Tom's stomach as he is turning around. Tom is pushed into a tree, but fires his rock. It latches onto Jerry's slingshot and pushes him back into another tree. Tom's rock then returns and latches onto his own slingshot. Tom ducks his head, but peers back at it and watches it hits his face. [...] "BLAP!" [...] Tom is then fired into Jerry's slingshot and hits Jerry in the face. [...] "BLAP!"

5000|$|Windshield Wiper/360 Windshield Wiper: The rider spins a tailwhip and, {{while still}} in the air, spins another tailwhip <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Matt Sparks was the first rider {{to do it on}} a BMX bike in 2006, calling it a Windshield Wiper. A 360 {{windshield}} wiper is when the rider spins a 360 degree rotation while doing a windshield wiper at the same time. James foster did it in 2008 at the Jomopro contest in Joplin, MO. Foster also landed it in the fifth Cameron White Annual Dirt Jam. The trick has also been pulled by Kyle Baldock, Alessandro Barbero, among others. Baldock landed a 360 windshield wiper to late tailwhip at the 2011 Salt Lake City Dew Tour. At the Dew Tour in Orlando, FL in 2009, T.J. Ellis pulled the world's first Windshield Wiper Backflip.|$|E
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} used to help remove air from a pneumothorax. The valve is usually designed as a rubber sleeve within a plastic case where the rubber sleeve is arranged so that when air passes through the valve one way the sleeve opens and lets the air through. However, when air is sucked <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> the sleeve closes off and no air is allowed backwards. This construction enables it {{to act as a}} one-way valve allowing air (or fluid) to flow only one way along the drainage tube. The end of the drainage tube is placed inside the patient's chest cavity, within the air or fluid to be drained. The flutter valve is placed in the appropriate orientation (most packages are designed so the valve can only be connected in the appropriate orientation) and the pneumothorax is thus evacuated from the patient's chest.|$|E
