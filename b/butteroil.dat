5000|$|An Arrangement {{concerning}} certain Dairy Products (Geneva, 12 January 1970), {{a treaty}} entered into {{by a number}} of nations, was established initially to set a minimum price of skimmed milk powder to $20 per 100 kilograms. The intention was to expand the arrangement to other dairy products. It also established a management committee within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade framework to oversee the arrangement. Three years later, a Protocol relating to Milk Fat (Geneva, 2 April 1973) was agreed to, extending the skimmed milk powder controls to other internationally transportable milk products, such as Ghee, anhydrous milk fat, anhydrous <b>butteroil</b> and anhydrous butterfat, <b>butteroil</b> and butterfat.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} interplay of {{naturally}} occurring pro- and antioxidants during deep-fat frying. The study has significance to the food industry because knowledge of these interactions are important for maintaining the sensory and nutritional quality of fried food. ^ Antioxidant protection was observed in an oil blend of sunflower, olive and <b>butteroil</b> when used for potato frying, reflecting the presence of <b>butteroil.</b> Fractionation of <b>butteroil</b> and incorporation of these fractions into heating studies showed enhanced stability in the liquid fraction. Carotenoids and tocopherols {{may be responsible for}} this protection since these natural antioxidants are present in <b>butteroil</b> and are known to migrate to the liquid phase during fractionation. When <b>butteroil</b> was blended with sunflower oil and stored at 37 ∘C no antioxidant activity was observed, suggesting that the high temperatures of frying may also be necessary in the observed protection, i. e. through the production of malliard reaction products. ^ When the oil blend was used to fry cod and analyzed for oxidation by polymer formation, the oil showed less polymers than expected, in comparison to the extensive oxidation reported by change in dielectric constant and fatty acid analysis. Subsequent studies suggest that polymers produced during the frying of cod may preferentially bind to the fish protein. When the cod was freeze-dried prior to frying, the fish was shown to protect the oil against oxidation. Lipid and non-lipid solid fractions of the fish exhibited antioxidant protection under similar conditions. This suggests that phospholipids and protein, the primary components of the lipid and solid fractions, respectively, may be responsible for this protection. Enhanced stability of sunflower oil was also observed when commercial amino acids and phospholipids were incorporated and heated at 185 ∘C. ^ The oxidative process of oils during deep-fat frying can be very complex. A wide variety of factors must be considered when determining the oxidative stability of a frying system. The competitive role of pro- and antioxidants potentially present in both the oils used for frying and the food substrates being fried can greatly influence the frying system and ultimately affect the quality of the food product. ...|$|E

40|$|A lipase from Aspergillus niger, immobilized by {{physical}} adsorption on hydrophobic hollow fibers made of microporous polypropylene, {{was used to}} effect the hydrolysis of the glycerides of melted butterfat at 40, 50, 55, and 60 °C (pH 7. 0), and at pH 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0, 7. 0, 8. 0, and 9. 0 (40 °C). McIlvane buffer and melted butterfat were pumped cocurrently through the hollow fiber reactor. The concentrations of ten different free fatty acids in the effluent oil stream were measured by HPLC. Multiresponse nonlinear regression methods were employed to fit the data to multisubstrate rate expressions derived from a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism in which the rate controlling step is deacylation of the enzyme. Thermal deactivation of the immobilized lipase was {{also included in the}} mathematical model of reactor performance. A postulated normal distribution of vmax with respect to the number of carbon atoms of the fatty acid residue (with an additive correction for the number of double bonds) was found to provide the best statistical fit of the data. The models developed can be used to independently predict the effects of either the pH or the temperature, as well as the reactor space time and the time elapsed after immobilization, on the free fatty acid profile of the lipolyzed <b>butteroil</b> product...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effect of lipid concentration on the properties of k-casein stabilized emulsions, <b>butteroil</b> was added to solutions that contained 0. 3 % k-casein to achieve milk fat concentrations of 3, 10, and 20 %. These mixtures were adjusted to pH 6. 5 and heated to 65 ?C. They were then homogenized at 20 and 100 MPa and particle size was measured; viscosity and yield stress were measured before and 30 minutes after the addition of chymosin. These experiments were repeated twice. Homogenization of the emulsions at 100 MPa produced smaller particles than homogenization at 20 MPa. Emulsions with 20 % milk fat showed the largest particle size. Before treated with chymosin, these emulsions had the greatest viscosity and yield stress, however the differences with the other lipid concentrations were greater after chymosin treatment. A gel with yield stress less than 10 Pa occurred in emulsions with 3 or 10 % milk fat. The emulsion with 20 % milk fat after chymosin treatment provided the best possibility for the formation of a gel because it had the highest viscosity and yield stress. The effect of protein concentration on the properties of the emulsions was determined in emulsions that contained 20 % milk fat and 0. 5, 0. 7, and 1. 0 %. These emulsions were prepared as previously described. Emulsions homogenized at 100 MPa had smaller particles than emulsions homogenized at 20 MPa. An increase in protein concentration caused the particle size to decrease. Emulsions homogenized at 100 MPa were more stable than emulsions homogenized at 20 MPa and the emulsion with 1. 0 % k-casein was the most stable emulsion. The protein load of k-casein stabilized emulsions ranged from 3 to 6 mg/m 2. The viscosity and yield stress prior to chymosin treatment showed no properties of gelation. After treated with chymosin, these emulsions produced a weak gel with yield stress values that ranged from 14 to 16 Pa...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 67 - 73). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Emulsions with 10 % protein and 20 % butter oil were prepared by dispersing sweet whey protein concentrate (SWPC), acid whey protein concentrate (AWPC), or AWPC + glycomacropeptide (GMP) in distilled water with <b>butteroil.</b> The mixture was heated to 65 ?C and homogenized at 20 and 90 MPa. Whey protein emulsions were heated to 90 ?C for 30 min in a closed water bath to form gels. The d[vs] of particles in the emulsions made from sweet whey was lower (p 0. 05) from d[vs] of particles in emulsions prepared from AWPC + GMP. The distribution of particles sizes in WPC emulsions homogenized at 90 MPa was bimodal distribution compared to emulsions homogenized at 20 MPa. The surface area of particles in SWPC emulsions increased 2. 5 x when the homogenization pressure was increased from 20 to 90 MPa. However, the surface area of emulsions prepared from AWPC and AWPC + GMP homogenized at 20 MPa decreased 5 x when homogenized at 90 MPa. Gels made using AWPC and AWPC + GMP emulsions had a higher shear stress at fracture than gels made using SWPC. The shear stress at fracture of gels made using AWPC and AWPC + GMP and homogenized at 20 MPa were 13. 48 kPa and 15. 06 kPa but increased to 23. 81 kPa and 22. 07 kPa, respectively, when the emulsions were homogenized at 90 MPa. The shear strain at fracture of gels made using the AWPC and AWPC + GMP emulsion homogenized at 20 MPa were 1. 1 and 1. 12 and decreased to 0. 75 and 0. 71, respectively when the emulsions were homogenized at 90 MPa. The shear stress and strain at fracture for gels containing AWPC + GMP was similar to the shear stress and strain value at fracture for gels made from AWPC. Gels made using SWPC emulsions exhibited the most true shear strain (p< 0. 05) and had a more rubbery texture than gels made from AWPC and AWPC + GMP emulsions which had a lower true shear strain value and a brittle texture...|$|E
