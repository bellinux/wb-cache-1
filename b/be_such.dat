5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of a pond, for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must <b>be</b> <b>such</b> that all forces balance.|$|E
5|$|The third {{industrial}} revolution is spreading from {{the developed world}} to some, but not all, parts of the developing world. To participate in this new global economy, developing countries {{must be seen as}} attractive offshore production bases for multinational corporations.

5|$|True orbital {{resonances}} between asteroids {{are considered}} unlikely; {{due to their}} small masses relative to their large separations, such relationships should be very rare. Nevertheless, Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1:1 resonant orbital relationships (for periods up to 2 million years or more); about forty such objects have been identified. Decameter-sized objects detected {{in the vicinity of}} Vesta by Dawn may <b>be</b> <b>such</b> quasi-satellites rather than proper satellites.|$|E
5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and their need to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would <b>be</b> <b>such</b> that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the {{albatrosses}} in the Northern Hemisphere is more complete {{than that of the}} southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of short-tailed albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda, and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa, Japan, actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds. For more data on fossil species of the living albatross genera, see the genus articles.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is {{equivalent}} to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture {{is referred to as}} icy even though it is a hot, dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice. At a depth of 7,000km, the conditions may <b>be</b> <b>such</b> that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the base of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.|$|E
5|$|Tory leaders {{scheduled}} a leadership convention for December. In early November, the Suez crisis erupted. Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded {{that it was better}} to <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E
