5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> {{from other}} {{actinides}} and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, {{with the standard}} process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

In 1864, the western island district (population: 2,438) <b>was</b> <b>separated</b> to become the new municipality of Herøy.

5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|Callie {{wants to}} take Sofia and move to New York with Penny but Arizona {{does not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from her {{daughter}} so she hires a lawyer and they go to court for a custody battle. After a long case, Arizona wins sole custody of Sofia. but in the end she ends up sharing Sofia with Callie because she thinks that; 'both of Sofia's moms deserve to be happy'.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E

5000|$|An unin{{corporate}}d entity has {{not been}} granted formal corporate status by incorporation. An unincorporated entity will generally <b>be</b> a <b>separate</b> entity for accounting purposes, but {{may or may not}} <b>be</b> a <b>separate</b> legal entity.

5|$|Mendelevium {{can finally}} <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> {{from the other}} {{trivalent}} actinides using selective elution from a cation-exchange resin column, the eluant being ammonia α-HIB. Using the gas-jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary. The above procedure is {{the most commonly used}} one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> {{from similar}} species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be {{confused}} with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it relatively easy to distinguish between the two.|$|E
5|$|Spectra of excited {{states can}} be used to analyze the atomic {{composition}} of distant stars. Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a gas-discharge lamp containing the same element. Helium was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23years before it was found on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture {{with water and}} are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of hafnium and zirconium is so similar {{that the two}} cannot <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> {{on the basis of}} differing chemical reactions. The melting points and boiling points of the compounds and the solubility in solvents are the major differences in the {{chemistry of}} these twin elements.|$|E
5|$|The prefixes on {{the other}} hand, are regular for each verb, {{although}} the complete paradigm of verb prefixes is highly complex. They encode three variables: person, number and tense, and are not segmentable; one prefix cannot <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> into the three parts. Ngani- for example, encodes second-person singular agent ('you'), first-person singular patient/undergoer ('me') as well as past tense.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from the plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{attended}} {{a series of}} crisis meetings in Chicago with Connant, Groves, Arthur Compton, Kenneth Nichols and Enrico Fermi. It was agreed that the isotopes could not <b>be</b> <b>separated,</b> so high-purity plutonium would not be required. Thomas therefore decided to disband his plutonium purification team. The Los Alamos laboratory {{then turned to the}} technologically much more difficult task of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
