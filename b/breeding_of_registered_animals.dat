By following the principle that individual breeders register sufficient young females to be certain of having enough replacements for their current breeding stock, the ratios were calculated {{of the number of}} adult females in a breed to the number of female registrations, in a given year. Number of breeds considered were 8 cattle, 16 sheep, 8 pigs, 1 goat and 2 equines, all in the United Kingdom or Ireland.

There was considerable variation between breeds in values of the multiplier, apparently for reasons of breed history and function. This was particularly evident for equines where the two breeds yielded multipliers of 3. 8 and 13. 9.

40|$|Myostatin (MSTN) is a {{negative}} modulator of muscle mass. Previously, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in horse MSTN gene that could be associated with morphological traits. In particular, two SNPs of the promoter of MSTN gene were statistically more frequent in heavy than in light horse breeds. In addition, other studies indicated that a SNP in the first intron of the MSTN is associated with athletic abilities in Thoroughbred horses. Here, we evaluated the effect of SNPs in the MSTN gene on several morphological traits measured in Italian Heavy Draft Horse (IHDH) breed. This horse breed is currently selected mainly for meat production. The linear type evaluation data <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>animals</b> in the studbook were used to calculate estimated breeding values (EBVs) for 11 traits related to general aspects, trunk and leg traits.

Through this process, hundreds of dog breeds have been developed. Initially, {{the ownership of}} working and, later, purebred dogs, was a privilege of the wealthy. Nowadays, many people can afford to buy a dog. Some breeders chose to breed purebred dogs, while some prefer {{the birth of a}} litter of puppies to a dog registry, such as kennel club to record it in stud books such as those kept by the AKC (American Kennel Club). Such registries maintain records of dogs’ lineage and are usually affiliated with kennel clubs. Maintaining correct data is important for purebred dog breeding. Access to records allows a breeder to analyze the pedigrees and anticipate traits and behaviors. Requirements for the <b>breeding</b> <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> purebreds vary between breeds, countries, kennel clubs and registries. It has been concluded that [...] "findings imply that when selective breeding was done by humans, it squashed the snouts of certain dog breeds, it also morphed their brains" [...] (Scientific American, 2010).Breeders have to abide by the rules of the specific organization to participate in its breed maintenance and development programs.

There are some naturalised genetic groups in this region such as the Pantaneira in the Pantanal region of the center-west or Barriga Negra (Black Belly) in the north. These are not yet recognized as breeds by the Ministry of Agriculture although are naturalized and well adapted to their environments.

The variation in weight for females was related to bovinemetric measurements associated to meat production (thoracic perimeter, body length and rump height), with easy calving (hip width, pin bone width and rump length).
