40|$|A {{series of}} six oxime N-methylcarbamates, C 6 H 5 C(R) =NOCONHCH 3 [R = SCH 3, CH 2 SCH 3,(2) -an d (E) -CH(CH),) SCH,, C(CH 3) 2 SCH 3 C, (CH 3),], analogues of {{commercial}} compounds such as aldicarb, <b>butocarboxim,</b> methomyl, and thiofanox, was synthesized for potential anticholinesterasic activity. NMR, IR, and UV {{were used to}} assign the configurations. The kinetic study of the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase from bovine erythrocyte and {{the determination of the}} dissociation constant Kd and of the carbamylation rate constant k 2 allowed discussion {{of the importance of the}} number of methyl groups on the carbon a to the iminic group. The insertion of the phenyl group generally did not improve the activity but yielded compounds, one isomer of which had a potential activity close to that of the commercial compounds...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{specific}} and rapid procedure for determining six largely used carbamate insecticides in bovine whole milk is here presented. This method {{is based on}} the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique with heated water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography (LC) â€“mass spectrometry (MS) equipped with a single quadrupole and an electrospray ion source. Target compounds were extracted from milk by water heated at 90 ?C. After acidification and filtration, 0. 2 mL of the aqueous extract was injected in the LC column. MS data acquisition was performed in the selected on-monitoring mode, selecting three ions for each target compound. Heated water appeared to be an excellent extractant, since absolute recovery data ranged between 76 and 104 % with R. S. D. not larger than 8 %. Using <b>butocarboxim</b> (an obsolete carbamate insecticide) as surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the analysis at three spike levels varied between 85 and 105 % with R. S. D. not larger than 9 %. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, limits of quantification were estimated to range between 3 ppb (propoxur) and 8 ppb (pirimicarb). The effects of temperature, volume and flow rate of the extractant on the analyte recovery were studied...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest {{and demand for}} real multi-residue methods able to simultaneously determine pesticides with {{a broad spectrum of}} chemical characteristics in environmental and biological matrices. A method based on solid-phase extraction with a Carbograph 4 cartridge and liquid chromatography with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ES-MS) enabling simultaneous determination of non-acidic and acidic pesticides in real water samples is described. On repeatedly (n= 5) extracting 4 l of drinking water (spike level 50 ng/l), 2 l of ground water (spike level 100 ng/l) and 1 l of river water (spike level 100 ng/l), recovery of 26 base/neutral pesticides and 13 acidic pesticides were equal to or better than 80 %, except for carbendazim (67 %), <b>butocarboxim</b> (73 %), aldicarb (75 %) and molinate (77 %), Relative standard deviations ranged between 4 and 15 %. Final extracts containing acidic and cion-acidic pesticides were analyzed in a single chromatographic run while the ES-MS system was operated in both positive and negative ion modes. With the aim of finding the best operating conditions, in terms of sensitivity, the pH of the LC eluent was varied in the 2. 9 - 8. 4 range. Altogether, the best results were obtained by using an LC eluent containing 1 mmol/l formic acid. Over the entire pH range considered, well shaped peaks for both basic and acidic analytes were achieved by the use of a new generation LC column. By extracting selected ion current profiles from the total ion current mass chromatogram relative to analysis of 4 1 of drinking water spiked with 50 ng/l of each of the 39 analytes, estimated limits of detection ranged between 0. 05 and 1. 5 ng/l, except for propyzamide (8 ng/l) and 2, 4 -DB (3 ng/l) ...|$|E
