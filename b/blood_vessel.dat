40|$|The spatial {{patterns}} of diffuse, primitive and classic beta/A 4 deposits was studied {{in relation to}} <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 24 cortical tissues from five elderly cases of Alzheimer's disease with pronounced congophilic angiopathy (CA). Beta/A 4 deposit subtypes and beta/A 4 stained <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were clustered in the tissue. In many instances, the clusters of beta/A 4 deposits and <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were regularly spaced along the cortical strip. Total beta/A 4 deposits were positively correlated with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in five tissues only. Similarly, clusters of diffuse and primitive beta/A 4 subtypes were each positively correlated with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in two brain regions. By contrast, clusters of classic beta/A 4 deposits were positively correlated with <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 62 % of the cortical tissues examined. These results suggest that in patients with significant CA, initial deposition of beta/A 4 protein was unrelated to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> However, clusters of classic beta/A 4 deposits {{appeared to be in}} phase with clusters of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> along the cortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{clustering}} {{pattern of}} diffuse, primitive and classic β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits was {{studied in the}} upper laminae of the frontal cortex of 9 patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ stained tissue was counterstained with collagen type IV antiserum {{to determine whether the}} clusters of Aβ deposits were related to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> In all patients, Aβ deposits and <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were clustered, with in many patients, a regular periodicity of clusters along the cortex parallel to the pia. The classic Aβ deposit clusters coincided with those of the larger <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in all patients and with clusters of smaller <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 4 patients. Diffuse deposit clusters were related to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in 3 patients. Primitive deposit clusters were either unrelated to or negatively correlated with the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in six patients. Hence, Aβ deposit subtypes differ in their relationship to <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The data suggest a direct and specific role for the larger <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the formation of amyloid cores in AD. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|The {{fusiform}} {{face area}} (FFA) {{is known to}} play {{a pivotal role in}} face processing. The FFA is located in the ventral region, {{at the base of the}} brain, through which large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> run. The location of the FFA via functional MRI (fMRI) may be influenced by these large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> Responses of large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> may not exactly correspond to neuronal activity in a target area, because they may be diluted and influenced by inflow effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the FFA, that is, whether the FFA includes large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> and/or whether inflow signals contribute to fMRI signals of the FFA. For this purpose, we used susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences to visualize large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> and dual-echo gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) to measure inflow effects. These results showed that the location and response signals of the FFA were not influenced by large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> or inflow effects, although large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were located near the FFA. Therefore, the data from the FFA obtained by individual analysis were robust to large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> but leaving a warning that the data obtained by group analysis may be prone to large <b>blood</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R
5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around a <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> (thus a combination of the two). A variety of immunohistochemical stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E

40|$|Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) tubes (5 mm in diameter) were {{fabricated}} {{using an}} electro spinning method {{and used as}} a scaffold for artificial <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> through the hybridization of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) differentiated from canine bone marrow under previously reported conditions. The potential clinical applications of these artificial <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> were investigated using a canine model.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E

40|$|The thesis aims to {{investigate}} the performance and potential of wavelets {{in the context of}} feature detection in retinal imaging, and to use those results to develop a robust algorithm that can reliably detect the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> within retinal photographs. Detection of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in retinal images is an important step in the predictions and diagnosis of cardio-vascular diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, that are known to affect the appearance of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the retina. We analysed current image processing techniques for segmenting <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> from other features in retinal photographs. We considered an alternative approach that uses a model of the cross-sectional profile of the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> along with a series of noise filters, in an attempt to mimic how the human visual system would extract the vasculature from other features in retinal photographs. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the technique is able to detect <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> that are otherwise missed by conventional techniques, while rejecting fine details that are not <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> Further work is needed to improve the results by refining the model...|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} angiography, {{images are}} acquired by exposing {{an area of}} interest with time-controlled x-rays while injecting contrast medium into the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> The image obtained would also include all overlying structure besides the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in this area.

5|$|The {{three factors}} of Virchow's triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, {{and changes in}} the endothelial <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> lining (such as {{physical}} damage or endothelial activation)—contribute to DVT and are used to explain its formation. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk factors contribute to DVT, though many at high risk never develop it.|$|E

5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a <b>blood</b> <b>vessel)</b> because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{associated}} with disease processes in the retina, which involve the retina becoming starved of oxygen (ischaemic). The ischemic retina releases a variety of factors, {{the most important of}} which is VEGF. These factors stimulate the formation of new <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> (angiogenesis). Unfortunately, these new vessels {{do not have the same}} characteristics as the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> originally formed in the eye. In addition, new <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> can form in areas that do not have them. Specifically, new <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> can be observed on the iris. In addition to the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> in the iris, they can grow into the angle of the eye. These <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> eventually go through a process called fibrosis which closes the normal physiologic anatomy of the angle. The closing of the angle prevents fluid from leaving the eye resulting in an increase in intraocular pressure. This is called neovascular glaucoma.|$|R

50|$|Substances called vasoconstrictors {{can reduce}} the size of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> thereby {{increasing}} <b>blood</b> pressure. Vasodilators (such as nitroglycerin) increase the size of <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> thereby decreasing arterial pressure.|$|R
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> {{and the rate of}} delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E
25|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, severe nonproliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy enters an advanced or proliferative (PDR) stage, where <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> proliferate/grow. The {{lack of oxygen}} in the retina causes fragile, new, <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills {{the inside of the}} eye. Without timely treatment, these new <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment. The new <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> can also grow into the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>vessels</b> {{are made}} of {{a thin layer of}} ECs.

Consequently, ECs have unique functions such as fluid filtration, homeostasis and hormone trafficking. ECs are the most differentiated form of an ESC. Formation of new <b>blood</b> <b>vessels</b> occurs by two different processes: vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. [...] The former requires differentiation of endothelial cells from hemangioblasts and then the further organization into a primary capillary network. The latter occurs when new vessels are built from preexisting <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
