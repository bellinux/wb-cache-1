30|$|The grouted splice {{connections}} are not practical for resisting shear load as the usable capacity was too low, {{which was about}} 1 / 3 of the ultimate capacity. Although the connection was able to withstand a high shear strength of about 300 kN, the <b>bar</b> <b>dower</b> action caused the connection to lose elasticity at about 100 kN. Unless it is integrated with another mechanism that is more effective in resisting shear load, such as shear keys at the dry pack joint (Rizkalla et al. 1989), the connection can only be designed at 1 / 3 of its ultimate capacity.|$|R
50|$|The manor, now in Royal possession, was {{presented}} by King Henry I in <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> his second wife, eighteen-year-old Adelicia, upon their marriage in 1121.|$|R

50|$|Usually, {{the wife}} was free from kin {{limitations}} to use (and bequeath) her <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> whatever and whomever she pleased. It {{may have become}} the property of her next marriage, been given to an ecclesiastical institution, or been inherited by her children from other relationships than that from which she received it.|$|R
5000|$|In an April 2013 report, the BBC's Panorama {{asked whether}} the Islamic Sharia Council was [...] "failing {{vulnerable}} women and mothers" [...] by requiring women seeking divorce to give back their marriage dowry (or mahr). The question of khula divorce often turns on the dower: if the woman is seeking the divorce, she has <b>to</b> return the <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> the man, if not, no divorce. Since in traditional Islamic society, men are traditionally the bank account holders and women are traditionally homemakers, the woman has no purchase, and cannot obtain a loan in order <b>to</b> repay the <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> receive an Islamically recognized divorce. The Islamic Sharia Council must recognise a British divorce, {{by virtue of the}} law of the land, if the petitioner shows them a decree absolute. However, the Islamic Sharia Council is displeased if the dower remains unpaid.|$|R
60|$|In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for <b>dowers</b> <b>to</b> their daughters, and portion {{off their}} nieces {{with a few}} {{porpoises}} a-piece. You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.|$|R

50|$|The {{husband was}} legally {{prevented}} {{from using the}} wife's dower — as contrasted with her dowry, which {{was brought to the}} marriage by the bride and used by both spouses. This often meant that the woman's legal representative, usually a male relative, became guardian or executor of the <b>dower,</b> <b>to</b> ensure that it was not squandered.|$|R
5000|$|The man’s name is Andrea Filosanto. He {{had been}} taking his mother’s <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> her and was robbed. He dies, and the dog grieves for him. Reginald takes the dog, Charon, into his family. A few months later, the dog finds the assailant, who is apprehended, confesses to {{being one of the}} robbers, is tried, convicted, and executed.|$|R
50|$|A {{second chance}} of a title came in 1955 {{in the shape of}} the British {{flyweight}} crown. Terry Allen, a previous Dower victim, had vacated the title allowing Dai <b>Dower</b> <b>to</b> contest the crown against Eric Marsden on 8 March at the Harringay Arena. Also at stake was Dower's Empire crown. Dower beat Marsden by points over the 15 round contest.|$|R

50|$|At the 1950 general election, Robertson moved {{constituencies}} from Streatham {{to fight}} Caithness and Sutherland, the northernmost part of mainland Scotland. The constituency {{had a long}} Liberal tradition but the Conservatives had won the seat from Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair in 1945 on a pledge by the candidate Eric Gandar <b>Dower</b> <b>to</b> seek re-election after the capitulation of Japan; {{as a result of}} breaking that promise (among other things), Gandar Dower had fallen out with his Unionist Association.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' said Alice, in the luxury, not of castle-building but of convent- building; 'it may be {{that when}} that knight over there sees me so small and ill-favoured he will none of me, and then I'll thank him so, and pray my father to let him have all my lands and houses except just enough <b>to</b> <b>dower</b> me <b>to</b> follow thee with, dear Lady Prioress.' ...|$|R

The jewels also shall be valued, but I give them back to you as my wedding <b>dower.</b> <b>To</b> these nuns further I grant permission to bide here in Jerusalem to nurse the Christian sick, unharmed and unmolested, if so they will, and this because they sheltered you. Ho! minstrels and heralds lead this new-wed pair to the place that has been prepared for them." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the death}} of her husband, the now Queen Dowager retreated to Gudhem Abbey. Because Scandinavian {{customary}} law dictated that no clan property could be held by a member of a religious order, she transferred some lands, including her queenly <b>dower,</b> <b>to</b> certain relatives and gave others as donations to ecclesiastical institutions. For example, her sister Benedikta received as a gift from her the town of Söderköping, one of the Queen's dower possessions. The Queen Dowager soon became the Abbess of Gudhem Abbey, and served in that position until her death there in 1252.|$|R

50|$|Claxby Manor House (also {{known as}} Claxby Hall) was built around 1760, reputedly for Samuel Dashwood as the <b>Dower</b> House <b>to</b> Well Hall. It {{later became the}} vicarage, and is a Grade II listed building.|$|R

50|$|To {{seal the}} new {{alliance}} between Besalú and Barcelona, William agreed to marry Raymond Berengar's sister-in-law, Llúcia, daughter of Count Bernard I of La Marche. On 11 December 1054, William signed a scriptura dotis, a charter granting a <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> Llúcia. In {{accordance with the}} Liber iudiciorum, the Visigothic law still in effect in Catalonia, he granted Llúcia one tenth of all his possessions. That same day he also made {{what he called a}} scriptura donationis causa sponsalitii, a donation on the occasion of his betrothal, granting Llúcia the counties of Berga and Ripoll and all that pertained to them. This marriage never came to fruition.|$|R
50|$|The {{present day}} manor house was erected around 1765 and later rebuilt to plans by Mervyn Noad as a <b>dower</b> house <b>to</b> Ballochmyle in 1957. An {{elephant}} {{was the family}} crest and this appears over the door.|$|R
5000|$|Dower ex assensu patris, was the <b>dower</b> given <b>to</b> {{the bride}} {{by the father}} of the bridegroom. This became {{obsolete}} long before it was formally abolished (in the United Kingdom, for example, by the Dower Act 1834).|$|R
50|$|The cottage's origins date to a building, {{possibly}} a farmhouse, from the 18th century. It was enlarged in the 1790s and then extended, again, in the mid-1800s. It was the <b>dower</b> house <b>to</b> the original Kingscote Park.|$|R

6000|$|In {{the early}} pages {{of this very}} book, Mr. Gladstone says, that the union {{of church and state}} is to the church of {{secondary}} though great importance; her foundations are on the holy hills and her condition would be no pitiable one, should she once more occupy the position that she held before the reign of Constantine.[109] Faint echo of the unforgotten lines in which Dante cries out to Constantine what woes his fatal <b>dower</b> <b>to</b> the papacy had brought down on religion and mankind.[110] In these sentences lay a germ that events were speedily to draw towards maturity, a foreshadowing of the supreme principle that neither Oxford nor any other place had yet taught him, 'the value of liberty as an essential condition of excellence in human things.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Henley Park {{house is}} {{in a small}} park north of the Fair Mile that leads {{north-north-west}} from Henley. It was the <b>dower</b> house <b>to</b> Fawley Court.

5|$|During the reigns of HenryIV (1399–1413) and his {{successor}} HenryV (1413–1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard.

She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the custodianship of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15thcentury and almost nothing is known about Rochester Castle between then and {{the second half of the}} 16thcentury. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 at the latest. Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort.|$|R
