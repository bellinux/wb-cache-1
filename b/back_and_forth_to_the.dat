5|$|While II Canadian Corps pushed {{south from}} Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August, Bradley and Montgomery {{realised}} {{that there was}} an opportunity for the bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching Alençon on 11August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward. The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Führer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused, because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops but {{more than a third of}} the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. The issue has been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of OB West on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model. Kluge committed suicide on 19 August after Hitler became aware of his involvement in the 20 July plot. An invasion in southern France (Operation Dragoon) was launched on 15 August.|$|E
25|$|In particular, this norm gets smaller when {{a number}} is multiplied by p, in sharp {{contrast}} to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers. These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic {{shipping}} terminal was in Colon, Panama. The Pacific terminal was in Panama City. The 48-mile {{double track}} railway {{was the first}} transcontinental railway and an engineering marvel of the era. Until {{the opening of the}} Panama Canal in 1914, the Panama Railway Company carried the heaviest volume of freight per unit length of any railroad in the world. H. W. Corbett and others from Portland would then use it to get <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> connecting ships to and from the East, rather than crossing on mule back. When the transcontinental Union Pacific Railroad to San Francisco was completed on May 10, 1869, this more direct route was then used for shipping and travel connecting to Portland by boat.|$|E

25|$|Significant {{conclusions}} of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better {{stem the tide of}} U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where terrorists are able to slip out of counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries were it is increasingly not difficult for terrorists to travel <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Western world.|$|E
25|$|Duterte {{was born}} on March 28, 1945, in Maasin. His {{maternal}} grandfather was a Chinese immigrant from Xiamen, Fujian. His father was Vicente G. Duterte (1911–1968), a Cebuano lawyer, and his mother, Soledad Duterte (née Roa; 1916–2012), was a school teacher from Cabadbaran, Agusan and a civic leader of Maranao descent. Duterte's father was mayor of Danao, Cebu, and subsequently the provincial governor of (the then-undivided) Davao province. Rodrigo's cousin Ronald was mayor of Cebu City from 1983 to 1986. Ronald's father, Ramon Duterte, also held the position from 1957 to 1959. The Dutertes consider the Cebu-based political families of the Durano and the Almendras clan as relatives. Duterte also has relatives from the Roa clan in Leyte through his mother's side. Duterte's family lived in Maasin, and in his father's hometown in Danao, until he was four years old. The Dutertes initially moved to Mindanao in 1948 but still went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Visayas until 1949. They finally settled in the Davao Region in 1950. Vicente worked as a lawyer engaged in private practice. Soledad worked as a teacher until 1952 when Vicente entered politics.|$|E
25|$|When a {{young worker}} leaves the nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E

In 1908, after the explorer's own early vessel The Duchess of Bedford was itself trapped in the Arctic ice and smashed, Capt. Leavitt provided passage for Leffingwell and his party back to San Francisco. As a token of thanks, Leffingwell named the island Narwhal after the name of Leavitt's steam-driven whaler. Leffingwell named another island [...] off Alaska's North Slope [...] Leavitt Island, after his friend the captain.|$|E

60|$|The purpose {{with which}} the two girls had come out was soon made to appear; for after running along before the party of {{travellers}} for {{about a quarter of}} a mile, they came to a place where two shallow but rather broad brooks flowed across the pathway. When Rollo and Mr. George came up to the place they found that the girls had placed boards over these streams of water for bridges. One of the boards was the one which the girl had brought along with her, under her arm. The other girl, it seems, kept her board under the bushes near the place, because it was too heavy to carry <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. It was their custom to watch for travellers coming along the path, and then to run on before them and lay these bridges over the brooks,--expecting, of course, to be paid for it. Rollo gave them each a small piece of money, and then he and Mr. George went on.|$|E
