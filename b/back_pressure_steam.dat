Much of the literature proposes using power from the existing coal plant and thermal integration of its supercritical steam cycle with the stripper reboiler to supply the energy needed for solvent regeneration and CO 2 compression. This study finds that using an auxiliary natural gas turbine plant to meet the energetic demands of carbon capture and compression may make retrofits more attractive compared to using thermal integration in some circumstances. Natural gas auxiliary plants increase the power output of the base plant and reduce technological risk associated with CCS, but require favorable natural gas prices and regional electricity demand for excess electricity to make using an auxiliary plant more desirable. Three different auxiliary plant technologies were compared to integration for 90 % capture from an existing, 500 MW supercritical coal plant. CO 2 capture and compression is simulated using Aspen Plus and a monoethylamine (MEA) absorption process. Thermoflow software is used to simulate three gas plant technologies. The three technologies assessed are the gas turbine (GT) with {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG), gas turbine with HRSG and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine, and natural gas boiler with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine. The capital cost of the MEA unit is estimated using the Aspen Icarus Process Evaluator, and the capital cost of the external GT plants are estimated using the Thermoflow Plant Engineering and Cost Estimator. The gas turbine options are found to lead to electricity costs similar to integration, but their performance is highly sensitive to the price of natural gas and the economic impact of integration. Using a GT with a HRSG only has a lower capital cost but generates less excess electricity than the GT with HRSG and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine. In order to generate enough steam for the reboiler, a significant amount of excess power was produced using both gas turbine configurations. This excess power could be attractive for coal plants located in regions with increasing electricity demand. An alternate capture plant scenario where a greater demand for power exists relative to steam is also considered. The economics of using auxiliary plant power improve slightly under this alternate energy profile scenario, but the most important factors affecting desirability of the auxiliary plant retrofit remain the cost of natural gas, the full cost of integration, and the potential for sale of excess electricity. by Sarah Bashadi.

40|$|Energy saving in {{coal power}} plants {{is a popular}} topic in present days with the global energy crisis. Internal {{electricity}} demand or auxiliary power consumption is an energy portion related with equipment supportive to the main equipment, which is unavoidable but with a proper investigation, some amount of this energy can be saved either by introducing thermally efficient auxiliary equipment or improving efficiencies of available equipment. Out of the various auxiliary equipment, the driving motor of boiler feed pump is the largest power consumer of internal electricity demand in 3 x 300 MW sub-critical Lakvijaya Power Station in Sri Lanka. So {{it is obvious that}} prime movers of feed pumps could be contributed for {{a large percentage of the}} losses. So it was decided to find out how to minimize the losses related to Boiler Feed Pump (BFP) system using small steam turbine to drive the BFP. The widely used alternatives for the BFP drivers are condensing type and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> type <b>steam</b> turbines. Eleven (11) different configurations of Condensing type, <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> type and also extraction <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> type turbines were considered and software programs for each configuration were implemented using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. The considered configurations are different to each other by inlet steam thermodynamic parameters, steam flow rate, exhaust thermodynamic steam parameters and intermediate extraction parameters etc. Thermodynamic analysis ended up with interesting solutions while all the configurations are giving improved efficiencies than existing electrical motor driven mode. But some of them had not improved their net output and hence there were no gain in net generator power output although the efficiencies are higher. Out of other configurations with improved net output and efficiency, the case with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine arranged parallel to the HP turbine had the highest net output gain with better improvement in efficiency without changing the input power to the boiler. Considering the CO 2, SOx and NOx emissions, it was cleared that power plant with suggested BFP modes will give more clean energy than existing power plant. Considering the partial loads behavior it was observed that power plant with <b>Back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine, <b>steam</b> extracted from HP turbines inlet for prime movers of boiler feed pumps is more thermodynamically economical than existing power plant.

This topic mainly {{research}} the high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply technology of {{steam turbine generator}} unit and the correlation analysis of turbine under high <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> operating condition. High <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> heat supply is an energy saving technology developed {{in order to meet}} the requirements of energy saving and environmental protection. This technology can not only reduce the cold end losses to improve the thermal efficiency of power plant, but also decrease the energy loss and pollution emissions because it take the place of traditional heating boiler.

40|$|Steam {{is highly}} used {{in most of}} the industries. There are many {{occasions}} where low pressure steam is used. Most of the times, relatively higher pressure is generated, transported and finally the pressure is reduced before use. Throttling devices are used for reducing pressure. Throttling valves or pressure reducing valves have been used for this work {{in most of the}} instances. There is a huge potential of utilizing this energy by introducing <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbines. If the turbine exhaust pressure can be further dropped, power generation through the steam turbine can be increased. This research project was created to cover these areas. There is no literature which can be used to calculate the power output of a turbine with known flow rates and input and output conditions. This project is aimed to give the information how much power is generated under the given conditions. This can be used for selecting a suitable back pressure turbine for the particular requirement. Giving the capital investment for such project also was an objective. It can be decided whether the selected project on retrofitting pressure reducing valves with the steam turbines is viable. There is no sufficient information on performance of thermo-compressors which can be used for increasing steam pressure. There is an objective of finding out the motive flow required for the known suction flow at known input and output conditions. As the title of the research shows, ultimate objective {{of this study was to}} see whether combining thermo-compressors to reduce back pressures is feasible or not. This research project was done for five input steam conditions and six output steam conditions of the turbines. For a selected turbine, performance at known pressures was calculated. This information was graphically represented to give a clear picture. Similarly performance of thermo-compressors was calculated for known input and conditions. This information also was graphically represented. Finally the performance of the back pressure turbines were calculated when the back pressure dropped further by introducing thermo-compressors. Calculated values were graphically represented to check whether this was a viable option. As per the outcome of this project, guide lines were made for <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbines with different input and output conditions. As the input, superheated steam varying from 10 barg at 350 deg. C up to 50 barg at 450 deg. C have been considered. Turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara also have been considered. Guide lines were extended to show the cost of investment to retrofit pressure reducing valves with back pressure turbines. Guide lines were made on the amount of motive pressure consumed to increase the pressure of steam at different input and output conditions. These guidelines also were extended to show the capital investment of the installing thermo-compressors. Process steam pressures varying from 2 bara to 6 bara have been discussed against turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara under the study of the behavior of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbines combined with thermo-compressors. Further study was done to ensure whether there is any effect of the isentropic efficiency and the generator efficiency on this behavior. Finally, it was proved that there was no benefit of operating the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbines at lower exhaust pressure by introducing thermocompressors and increasing the pressure before giving to the process for the pressure and temperature ranges covered in this study. Retrofitting of PRV with steam turbines seems to be an attractive option. This study discussed only the application of superheated steam. Further studies can be extended to saturated steam to use single stage steam turbines. Introducing of thermo-compressors for specific industries also can be done as a further study. However, further study of introducing thermo-compressors to enhance performance of back pressure turbine will not be done as it seems not viable...|$|E

40|$|Cogeneration systems fired with coal {{or other}} solid fuels and {{containing}} conventional extracting-condensing or <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbines {{can be found}} throughout the world. A potentially more economical plant of higher output per unit thermal energy is presented that employs a pressurized fluidized bed (PFB) and coal carbonizer. The carbonizer produces a char that is fed to the PFB and a low heating value fuel gas that is utilized in a topping combustion system. The topping combustor provides the means for achieving state-of-the-art turbine inlet temperatures and is the main contributor to enhancing the plant performance. An alternative to this fully coal-fired system is the partially coal, partially natural gas-fired air heater topping com-bustion cycle. In this cycle compressed air is preheated in an atmospheric pressure coal-fired boiler and its temperature raised further by burning natural gas in a topping gas turbine combustor.

Considering the demand of power and water, a detailed mathematical model of the cogeneration system targeting the minimum total annual cost (TAC), which includes the power plant, multistage flash (MSF) and reverse osmosis (RO), is proposed and described as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem.

The results show that the operation pattern of the cogeneration system could be varied in terms of the water demand. When the water demand is lower than 8000 m 3 /h, the combination of power plant associated with MSF is adopted and the condensing-extraction steam turbine is selected. When the water demand of water is higher than 8000 m 3 /h, the tri-combination of power plant, MSF and RO is the optimal choice, in which <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine is selected...|$|E

40|$|Energy use at a Kraft {{pulp mill}} in the United States is {{analyzed}} in detail. Annual average process steam and electricity demands {{in the existing}} mill are 19. 3 MMBtu per ADST and 687 kWh per ADST, respectively. This is relatively high by industry standards. The mill meets nearly all its electricity needs with a back-pressure steam turbine. Higher electricity to heat ratios is an industry wide trend and anticipated at the mill. The potential for self-sufficiency in energy using only black liquor and bark available on-site is assessed based on {{the analysis of the}} present energy situation and potential process changes. The analysis here suggests that steam and electricity demand could be reduced by 89 % by operating consistently at high production rates.

In order to reduce total operating costs and improve energy efficiency appropriate operating strategy should be chosen. This study is aimed at optimising the supply water temperature and mass flow rate in a DH system, depending on the heating load variations. The minimisation of operating costs of DH system with different heat sources was conducted. Two different design cases of a DH pipe network based upon of a real project redevelopment in Wales, UK, were considered. First, the DH pipe network was designed based on a low pressure loss (100 Pa/m). It means that pipes with large diameters and small size pump were chosen. Second, the DH pipe network was re-designed using a larger pressure drop (1200 Pa/m). In this case smaller diameter pipes and larger size pump were selected. An optimisation model was developed using FICOTM Xpress optimisation tool. Hydraulic and thermal calculations were validated using commercial software PSS SINCAL. Three cases with different heat sources connected to the DH network were investigated. In the first case {{it was assumed that}} the fuel cost was negligible. In the second case, water boiler was used. In the third case combined heat and power (CHP) connected to the DH network was considered. The optimisation of annual supply water temperature and mass flow rate was achieved by minimising annual operating costs. Heat loss and pump energy consumption were calculated. Results show that optimum flow and supply temperature profile over the year are different when different types of heat sources and different designs of the DH pipe network are used. The difference is particularly substantial when a CHP connected to the DH network, is used.

40|$|Dupont's Marshall Laboratory is an {{automotive}} paint {{research and}} development facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The campus is comprised of several buildings that are served by Trigen-Philadelphia Energy Corporation's district steam loop. In 1996 Dupont management {{announced that it was}} considering moving the facility out of Philadelphia primarily due to the high operating cost compared to where they were considering relocating. The city officials responded by bringing the local electric and gas utilities to the table to negotiate better rates for Dupont. Trigen also requested the opportunity to propose energy savings opportunities, and dedicated a team of engineers to review Dupont's steam system to determine if energy savings could be realized within the steam system infrastructure. As part of a proposal to help Dupont reduce energy costs while continuing to use Trigen's steam, Trigen recommended modifications to increase energy efficiency, reduce steam system maintenance costs and implement small scale cogeneration. These recommendations included reducing the medium pressure steam distribution to low pressure, eliminating the medium pressure to low pressure reducing stations, installing a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine generator, and preheating the domestic hot water with the condensate. Dupont engineers evaluated these recommended modifications and chose to implement most of them. An analysis of Dupont's past steam consumption revealed that the steam distribution system sizing was acceptable if the steam pressure was reduced from medium to low. After a test of the system and a few modifications, Dupont reduced the steam distribution system to low pressure. Energy efficiency is improved since the heat transfer losses at the low pressure are less than at the medium pressure distribution. Additionally, steam system maintenance will be significantly reduced since 12 pressure reducing stations are eliminated. With the steam pressure reduction now occurring at one location, the opportunity existed to install a backpressure turbine generator adjacent to the primary pressure reducing station. The analysis of Dupont's steam and electric load profiles demonstrated that cost savings could be realized with the installation of 150 kW of self-generation. There were a few obstacles, including meeting the utility's parallel operation requirements, that made this installation challenging. Over two years have passed since the modifications were implemented, and although cost savings are difficult to quantify since process steam use has increased, the comparison of steam consumption to heating degree days shows a reducing trend. Dupont's willingness to tackle energy conservation projects without adversely affecting their process conditions can be an example to other industrial steam users...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 69 - 80 The thrust herein is to {{encourage}} more people to take transient data during startups and rundowns. The common complaint is that it takes too much {{time and effort to}} prepare for this information. That argument is "weak" within today's instrumentation capabilities. Further, the more forms of information on the same transient data gives the person saddled with the responsibility of eliminating the problem a better confidence level in the final conclusion. The rotor system, whatever its configuration, forces all the system's responses during the run up and rundown. The ability to look at plots of time waveforms, orbits, polars, Bode plots, cascades, eccentricities, spectra, raw vs synchronous vs compensated information can be valuable. The ability to define accurately the "resonances" in the system and the corresponding ability to direct logical in-situ balancing. The ability to identify rubs when they occur. The initiation of "instabilities" is near breathtaking. The ability to correlate running speed vibration values vs subrotative (whirl or whip) values can be very meaningful and normally with unexpected results, i. e., qualifying the "damping" or "lack of' in a system. In all this, the FM tape recorder should never be overlooked; however, the digital storage capability with computer attached is extremely powerful and simple to manipulate. Speed tracking offers the ability of saving memory during operational delays, as the next speed threshold has not been reached. Three case histories are used to illustrate the advantages of transient measure. The three descend in "actual data" presented to simplify the process. The more complicated/involved issue is addressed first, and it is a 22 MW compressor turbine gas generator, power turbine, generator system. This equipment suffered from overfiring the combustors, over acceleration, and over heating the gas turbine system, rubs on compressor blades and heavy destructive rubs on hot turbine shroud bands. The unit whirls and whips. For about 18 hr after repairs, it suffered other problems of "surge/stall" due to IGV control problems (not covered in this text). The second case discusses a simple low horsepower, medium speed, five stage <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine with problems which existed for over one and one-half years. The basic trending, which showed varying amplitudes and phase, just simply did not define the problem. One set of transient startup/shutdown data on the soloed turbine brought to bear, "quickly," the main problem. Several options were open for correction; the simplest was performed, and the problem totally eliminated. Further, stress corrosion cracking failures were better understood under high stress. The third is a very complicated hot gas turbine single shaft, expander compressor steam turbine, unit. It goes through three (two rigid and one bending) criticals (=resonances) to reach an operating speed of - 18, 000 rpm. The failure of the first wreck is better investigated via transient data.

The utility plant consists of a gas turbine with post combustion capabilities for production of high <b>pressure</b> <b>steam.</b> The high <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> is expanded to low <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> with help of turbines before it condensates or is used by the process. The problem is to control the post combustion based on the flow to the condenser, which implies large time constants and significant time delay. A model of the utility plant was developed wit...|$|R
40|$|Throughout many {{manufacturing}} facilities, colleges, commercial {{sites or}} industrial complexes, pressure reducing valves (PRV's) provide a cheap, reliable method to produce low <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> {{from a high}} pressure source {{in order to meet}} a process requirement or heating load. This simple method of expanding steam in a PRV creates no work and supplies the same heat content available in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> at a more manageable low pressure. What if you could produce the same low <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> while saving {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} on your electric bill and taking only a minimal hit in the available heat content? Why let steam down and get no benefit from it, when putting it through a low <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> turbine coupled to a generator would produce the heat you need for process with the byproduct of onsite electrical generation. This paper analyzes the costs, concerns and benefits of replacing a pressure reducing valve with a Steam Turbine Generator set including illustrations of what the marginal fuel increase would be in order to take advantage of the added benefits of clean, cheap and reliable onsite power production...|$|R
30|$|Heating {{wood with}} high temperature, {{especially}} {{up to the}} boiling point, {{is believed to be}} a rapid method for drying. High temperature causes <b>steam</b> <b>pressure,</b> which leads to accelerate a water movement along the grain direction due to capillary force [21]. <b>Pressure</b> <b>steam</b> and microwave irradiation can be a drying method that rise inside temperature quickly to achieve rapid drying. An advantage of <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> drying is resulting rapid drying without over-drying the surface compared to high temperature drying at atmospheric pressure [22 – 24]. Moreover, steaming contributes on removal of some extractives which allows better access of water molecules to cell walls resulting more rapid tangential and radial diffusion [5]. Steam injection drying is a kind of <b>pressure</b> <b>steam</b> drying with slightly modification. The modification was that the superheated steam is injected through a perforated plate, whose temperature is higher than that of the <b>steam.</b> <b>Pressure</b> of the chamber is controlled above atmospheric one. The advantage of this method is that the steam heats lumber to evaporate water {{and at the same time}} brings water in the lumber out.|$|R
