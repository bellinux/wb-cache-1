50|$|BPMV is the viral {{pathogen}} {{that causes the}} disease Bean Pod Mottle in soybeans and other legumes such as snap peas. BPMV is a species in the plant pathogenic virus family Comoviridae, and genus Comovirus characterized by icosahedral symmetry, non-enveloped, having two single stranded positive-sense RNAs (RNA-1 and RNA-2) separately encapsulated in isomeric particles, and are between 28 and 30 nm in diameter. (Bradshaw, 2007). The virus can overwinter in leaf-feeding beetle vectors (such as the <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle),</b> survive in perennial host species, and in virus-infected seed. In the North Central Region, the <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cerotoma trifurcate) is the most influential vector, by feeding on infected legumes and transferring virus particles to the next plant it lands on to feed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> are the {{principal}} vectors of bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). Last week we discussed the affects of seed-applied insecticides on <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> and whether such insecticides can substitute for an early-season foliar application within a BPMV disease management program. Although {{there is a positive}} relationship between <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> and BPMV, the effect of chemical control on the disease is different than that for the insect vector. As we discussed last week, a management program that included seed-applied insecticides resulted in improved yield but lower seed quality. Why does this happen and how is BPMV affected...|$|R
40|$|The {{overwintering}} <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are gone}} {{and we are}} looking forward to the appearance of the first-generation adults. The second generation, not the first, will have the greatest impact on yield by feeding on the soybean pods and beans.

40|$|As {{stated in}} an earlier article in the ICM Newsletter (May 15, 2006), <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> are back with a vengeance this year.

This also has resulted in an apparent high incidence of bean pod mottle virus disease in Iowa fields. Infected plants can be characterized by the leaves, which show a yellow to green blotchy appearance called leaf mottle. Sometimes leaves have a raised or blistered appearance...|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} {{symptoms}} {{are difficult to}} differentiate from other viruses or pathogens, so seeing these symptoms does not necessarily guarantee the plant has BPMV, lab testing can confirm. There {{can also be a}} combination of pathogens infecting the plant which can affect the severity of symptoms. Insect activity, especially of the <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> or other known vectors, can increase the chance of BPMV presence.|$|E
50|$|BPMV can be {{transferred}} via insect vector such as the <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> or from infected seed which is a low occurrence (Michigan State University Field Crop Pathology), although {{it is still not}} fully understood how the virus gets from one host from another host, if not bean leaf beetles. Being a non-persistent virus, when the bean beetle feeds on infected tissue, the virus is carried around the mouthparts of the insect to the next host the beetle feeds on. The feeding creates an easy opening for the virus to get in, after which the virus begins its attack on the host.|$|E

40|$|To date, our {{recommendation}} for the chemical control of <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> and <b>bean</b> pod mottle virus {{has been for}} an early and a mid-season application of a pyrethroid insecticide (e. g., Asana®, Mustang®, or Warrior®).

40|$|Cross-resistance, and {{longevity}} of resistance, {{induced by the}} <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerotoma trifurcata, was studied IN the soybean PI 227687 that exhibited induced response in earlier studies. <b>Bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> adults and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens, larvae were used to induce resistance and to determine beetle feeding preference. Beetles were collected from soybean fields 2 to 5 days prior to the feeding preference test. The level of cross-resistance induced by soybean looper herbivory to subsequent <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding was higher when compared to cross-resistance induced by <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> herbivory against subsequent feeding by soybean looper.

40|$|Greenhouse {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate and demonstrate the phenomenon of induced resistance to <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> in soybean. Different elicitors such as, mechanical injury, chemical inducer (BTH) and herbivory by the <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster), and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker), were studied. A pairwise comparison of leaflets from treated plants with untreated (control) plants revealed that soybean looper herbivory was a better inducer than the other treatments. However, herbivory by <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> and BTH applied following artificial defoliation also induced resistance against <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding. Studies conducted with two cultivars (Colfax and Williams 82) and a soybean germplasm line (HC 95 - 24 MB) using the same treatments demonstrated that soybean looper herbivory was again a better inducer than other treatments in the soybean entries tested. Herbivory by <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> BTH, and BTH followed by artificial defoliation, were also found to induce resistance against <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle.</b> ^ Cross resistance studies demonstrated that soybean looper herbivory offered better cross resistance after induction to subsequent feeding by <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle.</b> However, herbivory by <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> also induced resistance against the soybean looper. Studies conducted to demonstrate the longevity of the induced response revealed that induced response was highest on 14 th day after treatment (DAT) and response was lowest on 25 th DAT.

40|$|Summary of Project Goal: The goal of {{this project}} is to find {{effective}} management treatments for the <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cerotoma trifurcata) and soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) for use in certified-organic soybeans. The <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is one of the}} major vectors of bean pod mottle virus, which causes seed staining and can cause a downgrading of the soybeans at market from food grade to feed grade. Feeding from the soybean aphid causes stunted plants, reduced pods and seeds, and can transmit viruses that cause mottling and distortion of the leaves and a reduced seed set. Discolored seeds may also result from this infection. The use of organic pest management treatments may help organic farmers manage bean leaf beetles and the transmission of virus or fungal agents responsible for seed coat staining and maintain the premium received for organic food-grade soybeans. Outcome and Significance: Findings of the experiment show that there were no consistent significant differences between treatments regarding <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> populations and seed staining or aphid populations and soybean yields. Although the project did not result in any treatments providing significant control over <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> populations or soybean aphid populations, the experiment is still meaningful in that it has shown the inefficacy of four products on <b>bean</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> and soybean aphid populations so future experiments can concentrate on other products, biological control agents, and/or physical trapping methods...|$|E
