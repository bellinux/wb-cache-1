To overcome the inherent shortcomings of conventional pumping units, the researchers designed the phased pumping units and the dual-horsehead pumping units with a more reasonable TF curve that can greatly improve the balance effect and the system efficiency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Biphenol monoacrylate (BMA) {{was applied}} to be {{combined}} with the traditional hindered phenolic-based binary antioxidant system to form the ternary antioxidant system {{for the purpose of}} further improving the thermal oxidative stability of polyoxymethylene (POM). The thermal stabilization effect of BMA on POM was studied by the measurements of isothermal and nonisothermal degradation, formaldehyde emission amount, and <b>balance</b> <b>torque.</b> The thermal stability of the stabilized POM under multiple processing and long-term aging was further studied in comparison with the commonly used antioxidant Irganox 245. The results showed that the antioxidant BMA can improve the thermal stability of POM effectively through a unique bifunctional stabilizing mechanism, and much low content of BMA-based ternary antioxidant system can reach the same level of thermal stabilization effect on POM as with Irganox 245, which can replace Irganox 245 to be applied in the production of POM due to its low dosage and low production cost.

40|$|Backgroud: Despite of {{many people}} {{engaging}} in aerobic dance activities, little knowledge was reported regarding the effects of low-impact dance on the <b>balance,</b> <b>torque</b> and range of motion (ROM) of joints of the lower extremities. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine whether any differences existed in terms of the aforementioned variables between older females who regularly engaged in low-impact dance and those who were physically inactive. Method: In total, 38 older females comprised the subjects of this study, which consisted of a dance group (DG) and a control group (CG). The extension torque of the knees, dynamic and static balance, and ROMs of the hip and ankles of all participants were measured. Results: Dynamic balance in the DG was significantly higher than that in the CG (13. 0 ± 4. 7 vs. 5. 5 ± 7. 8 times, p < 0. 05). Although the knee extension torque for both legs was higher in the DG than in the CG, a significant difference was only found in the non-dominant leg. A few ROMs of lower-extremities joints in the dominant leg, ankle inversion, plantiflexion and dorsiflexion were significantly higher in the DG than the CG (p < 0. 05). In addition, ankle inversion of the non-dominant leg in the DG was also significantly higher than that in the CG.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{reformulation}} of the posture generation problem that encompasses non-Euclidean manifolds. Such a formulation allows a more elegant mathematical {{description of the}} constraints, which we exemplify through some scenarios in the simulation results section. In our previous work, the posture generation problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization program with constraints expressed only through Euclidean manifolds; we solve the latter problem using on-the-shelf solvers. Instead, we decided to implement a new SQP solver that is most suited to non-Euclidean manifolds structural objects. By doing so, {{we have a better}} mastering in the way to tune and specialize our SQP solver for robotic problems. I. INTRODUCTION Computing robot configurations to meet the requirements of a given set of tasks, within a viable state, is a recurrent problem whose complexity grows with that of the robot. In this paper, we are interested in the following generalized inverse kinematics problem: we search a configuration for which the robot fulfills tasks under constraints of joint limits, auto-collision and non-desired collision avoidance, <b>balance,</b> <b>torque</b> limits, etc. We coined it posture generation. Such a problem is encountered in both planning and control. In both cases, computation time and robustness are critical issues. We have already proposed various implementations of the humanoid posture generation problem. All of our implementations formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization program to address multi-contact planning. In [1], the multi-contact planner explores the contact space using thousands of HRP- 2 humanoid posture generator (PG) queries; we used the FSQP solver [2]. In [3], the PG is extended to handle various humanoid robots and multiple agents, the solver used is IPOPT [4]. In [5] the PG is extended to various contact models and used to generate multiple related postures at once. The latter work and the DRC participation revealed that re-planning on the fly is necessary and having a robust PG is crucial in many situations. Other works also make use of PG, e. g. in [6][7]. Posture generation has been formulated as a problem over a Euclidean space. Robots variable may however be more naturally expressed over non-Euclidean manifolds. The archetypes for this are the rotation part of the root body for a humanoid robot, and ball joints, whose variables live in SO(3). Some typical tasks are also naturally formulated o...|$|E

40|$|Input <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> is a {{well known}} way to reduce drive speed {{fluctuations}} in high speed machinery and combustion engines. This paper introduces a cam-based centrifugal pendulum (CBCP) and a design procedure for it which results in quasi perfect <b>balancing</b> of inertial <b>torques</b> for any drive speed. The CBCP combines the centrifugal pendulum vibration absorber, well-known in mechanical vibration literature, with a <b>torque</b> <b>balancing</b> principle well-known in mechanism literature, that is, the use of cams to generate arbitrary torques. For given design parameters (such as the link lengths and link inertial parameters), the cam design is governed by a nonlinear, second-order, explicit differential equation.

The design parameters themselves are determined {{by means of an}} optimization problem, the goal of which is to minimize the (constant) equivalent inertia of the combined system, consisting of the original mechanism to be balanced and the CBCP.
