His face frightened me, as it did everyone; but not <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> brutal, not <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> evil. On the contrary, <b>it</b> frightened me <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so beautiful, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so good." ...|$|R

5|$|Telecommunication over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> between one transmitter and one receiver.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{primarily}} influential {{not because}} of any great technical leaps, but rather <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so successful for Schlumberger's oil divisions and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the few success stories of the AI bubble to receive wide publicity before the AI winter.|$|R

5|$|When {{regarded}} as a star icosahedron, the complete stellation is a noble polyhedron, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> both isohedral (face-transitive) and isogonal (vertex-transitive).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more difficult to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|A {{surface is}} more {{wettable}} when γLV and θ is low. Zisman termed the intercept of these lines when cos θ = 1, as the critical surface tension (γc) of that surface. This critical surface tension {{is an important}} parameter <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a characteristic of only the solid.|$|E

40|$|After <b>it</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} in 1939, medullary sponge kidney (MSK) received relatively little attention.

500|$|By his own admission, De Esque {{chose to}} place hell on this star, over placing hell on Earth, the Moon or the Sun <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a {{celestial}} pariah, an outcast, {{the largest of}} all known comets or outlawed suns in the universe." [...] The latter three were rejected by De Esque: the Sun <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> uninhabitable for animal or vegetable life, and the Moon <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> once part of the Earth.

5|$|An {{example of}} {{obedience}} and punishment driven morality {{would be a}} child refusing to do something <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{resistant}} to corrosion, nickel was occasionally {{used as a}} substitute for decorative silver. Nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after 1859 as a cheap coinage metal (see above), but in the later years of the 20th century was replaced by cheaper stainless steel (i.e., iron) alloys, except in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> denser than air, {{it tends to}} accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
5|$|Federation of Australia 1901 {{alternative}} date, 19 January - {{proposed as}} an alternative to traditional Australia Day <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> only one week earlier and can represent Federation 1901 with 19.01.

50|$|Torishima {{described}} the Dr. Slump anime as unsuccessful {{in his opinion}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> did not loyally follow the manga. He said this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the first time the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump team had to manage an anime based on one of their manga and its creative process, explaining that, if something went wrong, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late to change <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already animated.|$|R

5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{protective}} gas in growing silicon and germanium crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas chromatography, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> inert. Because of its inertness, thermally and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels and impulse facilities.|$|E
50|$|The cowboy bedroll was a {{significant}} item in Old West culture, not simply <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the precursors of the modern sleeping bag (combining, as it did, padding, coverings, and a weatherproof shell), but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the cowboy’s trunk, safety box, and portable seat {{as well as his}} bed.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{readers of}} The Atlantic were {{offended}} by Hawthorne's essay, and the magazine received [...] "cruel and terrible notes". The concern <b>was</b> partially <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> somewhat pro-southern, but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> antiwar. Others found it too ambiguous. George William Curtis condemned it as [...] "without emotion, without sympathy, without principle".|$|R
