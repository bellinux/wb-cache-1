5|$|Initial {{copies of}} the album were shipped out in <b>black</b> <b>body</b> bags, a promotional device that drew minor criticism. The album debuted at No. 32 on Billboards Top 50 albums, peaking at No. 26 on the Billboard 200. By January 29, 1993, the album sold 480,000 copies, {{according}} to Variety. However, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, Body Count was certified gold for sale shipments in excess of 500,000 copies, with a certification date back to August 4, 1992.|$|E
2500|$|But more importantly, it {{relied on}} a new {{theoretical}} postulate of [...] "perfectly black bodies", which {{is the reason why}} one speaks of Kirchhoff's law. Such <b>black</b> <b>bodies</b> showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart's reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly <b>black</b> <b>bodies</b> later considered by Planck. Planck's <b>black</b> <b>bodies</b> radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.|$|R
25|$|This section {{describes}} some concepts {{developed in}} connection with <b>black</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Planck {{also noted}} that the perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies</b> of Kirchhoff do not occur in {{physical}} reality. They are theoretical fictions. Kirchhoff's perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies</b> absorb all the radiation that falls on them, right in an infinitely thin surface layer, with no reflection and no scattering. They emit radiation in perfect accord with Lambert's cosine law.|$|R
5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal <b>black</b> <b>body,</b> as it reflects no light.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal {{in the microwave}} band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a <b>black</b> <b>body.</b> A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, dressed in a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone {{in a room with}} two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
25|$|Two of the {{greatest}} successes of the Big Bang theory are its prediction of the almost perfect <b>black</b> <b>body</b> spectrum and its detailed prediction of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. The CMB spectrum {{has become the most}} precisely measured <b>black</b> <b>body</b> spectrum in nature.|$|E
25|$|Whether a {{radiator}} is isotropic {{is independent}} of whether it obeys Lambert's law. As radiators, a spherical <b>black</b> <b>body</b> is both, a flat <b>black</b> <b>body</b> is Lambertian but not isotropic, a flat chrome sheet is neither, and by symmetry the Sun is isotropic, but not Lambertian on account of limb darkening.|$|E
40|$|Viral Bodies: Uncontrollable Blackness in Popular Culture and Everyday Life maps rapidly {{circulated}} {{performances of}} Blackness across visual media that collapse <b>Black</b> <b>bodies</b> into ubiquitous “things. ” Throughout my dissertation, I use viral performance {{to describe the}} uncontrollable discursive circulation of bodies, their behaviors, and the ideas around them. In particular, viral performance is employed to describe the complicated ways that (mis) understandings of <b>Black</b> <b>bodies</b> spread and are often transformed into common-sense beliefs. As viral performances, <b>Black</b> <b>bodies</b> are often made more visible, while simultaneously becoming more opaque. This dissertation examines the recurrence of viral performances of Blackness in viral videos online, film, and photography/images. I argue that viral performances make products that reinscribe stereotypical notions of Blackness while also generating paths of alterity—which contradict the normalized clichés and provide desirable possibilities for <b>Black</b> performance. Viral <b>Bodies</b> forges a new dialogue between visual and aural technologies, performance, and larger historic discourses that script <b>Black</b> <b>bodies</b> as visually (and sonically) deviant subjects. I am interested in how technologies complicate the re-presentation of images, ideas, and ideologies—producing a necessity for new decipherings of performances of Blackness in popular culture and everyday life...|$|R
50|$|Although {{planets and}} stars are neither in thermal {{equilibrium}} with their surroundings nor perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies,</b> black-body radiation {{is used as}} a first approximation for the energy they emit.Black holes are near-perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{in the sense that they}} absorb all the radiation that falls on them. It has been proposed that they emit black-body radiation (called Hawking radiation), with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole.|$|R

25|$|A massive {{ideal gas}} {{with only one}} type of {{particle}} is uniquely described by three state functions such as the temperature, volume, {{and the number of}} particles. However, for a <b>black</b> <b>body,</b> the energy distribution is established by the interaction of the photons with matter, usually the walls of the container. In this interaction, the number of photons is not conserved. As a result, the chemical potential of the <b>black</b> <b>body</b> photon gas is zero. The number of state variables needed to describe a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> state is thus reduced from three to two (e.g. temperature and volume).|$|E

25|$|Color {{temperature}} can be {{indicated in}} kelvins or mireds (1 million {{divided by the}} color temperature in kelvins). The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional temperature, the correlated color temperature, the temperature of a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> which emits light of a hue which to human color perception most closely matches {{the light from the}} lamp, is assigned.|$|E
25|$|The most revolutionary {{aspect of}} Planck's {{treatment}} of the <b>black</b> <b>body</b> is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, {{as often as they}} are excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the <b>black</b> <b>body,</b> but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the <b>black</b> <b>body</b> never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.|$|E
