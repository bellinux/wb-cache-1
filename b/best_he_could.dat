5|$|Darwin {{had shown}} great {{ability as a}} {{collector}} and had done the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> with the reference books he had on ship. It was now the province of recognised expert specialists to establish which specimens were unknown, and make their considered taxonomic decisions on defining and naming new species.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the war, the strategy of total warfare—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has {{been the subject of}} controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> in order to fulfill his part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.|$|E
5|$|In late 1970, Vicki Cole {{indicated}} {{in an interview}} Nixon was doing the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E

5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley Docker, should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island. McNish had prepared the boats as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> for a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides to give them a higher clearance from the water.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into the}} countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean to do the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees {{into the parking lot}} LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her {{from the other side}} and the flûtes took up stations fore and aft, repeatedly raking the British ship. Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron was so close to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck, killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|E
5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with Oliver Smith's designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, {{for the most}} part, either shabby looking or too stylized. Prince refused {{to spend money on}} new construction, and Smith was obliged to improve what he had as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> with very little money to do it.|$|E

25|$|Six {{days later}} HMS Princess Charlotte was off Tobago when she sighted {{them in the}} distance. The two French vessels were too far away for Princess Charlotte to chase them.

He was successful and an engagement ensued.|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, López remained active by coaching and instructing youth players in Caracas. Everyman's ballplayer, he worked {{to overcome the}} challenges he faced in life and baseball. Although he had no opportunity to play at Major League Baseball, he simply took the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find and took advantage of it. He permanently adjusted and readjusted his hitting style and pitching mechanics, came back from many injuries, but the Big Boy of Barlovento (el Muchachote de Barlovento in Spanish) persevered and won recognition as pitcher and slugger in all leagues where he played.|$|E

25|$|Starting in May 1925, the Copiaus {{performed}} {{plays by}} Molière {{as well as}} those written expressly for them by Copeau, using masks of their own invention. Their presentations were preceded by a parade of the entire troupe, accompanied by drums, horns and colorful banners. They performed on a bare platform in village squares or whatever indoor space they could find. Copeau continued his work with this troupe as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> despite his heavy schedule of readings and lectures. But given their inventiveness and creativity, his control over the troupe lessened.|$|E
25|$|Simons {{had grown}} tired of small town life in Kansas in any event and {{was ready for a}} new challenge. Newspaper {{publisher}} Victor Berger, now America's first socialist Congressman, had previously promised Simons a job on his English-language daily, the Milwaukee Leader, if he had ever needed a position. In June 1913, Simons decided to take Berger up on the offer, accepting the position without great enthusiasm but feeling as though it was for the time being the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. Algie and May Simons would be coming home to Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee {{left for}} lunch, Colonel Munford saw the Union attack {{shaping up as}} he {{prepared}} to have his cavalry division defend the left flank against the attack. Munford sent several couriers to look for Pickett or Fitzhugh Lee to tell them of the impending attack but they could not be found. Captain Henry Lee of Fitzhugh Lee's staff also could not find them. Munford had his division dismount, and deployed it on the left of Ransom's refused line. Each Confederate unit commander prepared for the attack as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> not always in co-operation with each other.|$|E
