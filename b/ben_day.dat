500|$|When Lichtenstein {{made his}} {{transition}} to comic-based work, {{he began to}} mimic the style while adapting the subject matter. He applied simplified color schemes and commercial printing-like techniques. The style he adopted was [...] "simple, well-framed images [...] solid fields of bold color often bounded by thick, stark border lines." [...] The borrowed technique was [...] "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of <b>Ben</b> <b>Day</b> dots used in newspaper printing". PBS asserts {{that this is an}} adaptation of the ligne claire style associated with Hergé. Lichtenstein once said of his technique: [...] "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental." ...|$|E

[...] Considered McCay's masterpiece, its child protagonist had fabulous dreams, {{interrupted}} each week with his awakening in the final panel. [...] Nemo's appearance was based on McCay's son Robert. [...] McCay experimented with formal aspects of the comics page: he made inventive use of timing and pacing, {{the size and shape}} of panels, perspective, and architectural and other details. [...] The Herald was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time; its printing staff used the <b>Ben</b> <b>Day</b> process for color, and McCay annotated the Nemo pages with precise color schemes for the printers.|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's {{borrowings}} from comics mimicked {{their style}} while adapting their subject matter. He explained that [...] "Signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter. There {{are certain things}} that are usable, forceful and vital about commercial art." [...] Rebecca Bengal at PBS wrote that Whaam!s graphic clarity exemplifies the ligne claire style associated with Hergé, a cartoonist whose influence Lichtenstein acknowledged. Lichtenstein was attracted to using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention. He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was [...] "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of <b>Ben</b> <b>Day</b> dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines similar to those used to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint."

2500|$|Masterpiece is {{regarded}} as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered [...] "witty and yet eerily prescient" [...] because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, [...] the blonde female's speech bubble, [...] "Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!" [...] conveys her remark as she gazes at the painting, of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of The Guardian says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and [...] "the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in Mr. Bellamy. According to Roberta Smith of The New York Times, Masterpiece was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced [...] "faint and uneven" [...] <b>Ben</b> <b>Day</b> dots.|$|E
