5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, {{with higher levels of}} anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E
500|$|David Gates of Newsweek contrasted Eugenides' debut novel The Virgin Suicides with Middlesex, {{writing that}} the first novel was [...] "ingenious", [...] "entertaining", and [...] "oddly moving", but that Middlesex is [...] "ingenious", [...] "entertaining", and [...] "ultimately not-so-moving". Despite this criticism, Gates {{considered}} Middlesex to be the novel where Eugenides [...] "finally plays his metafictional ace". Commenting that Middlesex is [...] "more discursive and funnier" [...] than The Virgin Suicides, Laura Miller of Salon wrote that the two novels deal with disunity. Max Watman of The New Criterion concurred, noting that Middlesex is [...] "funny, big, embracing, and wonderful", unlike Eugenides' first novel. Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised Middlesex for having the same unique qualities as The Virgin Suicides, commenting that Middlesex had [...] "an ability to describe the horrible in a comic voice, an unusual form of narration and an eye for bizarre detail." [...] Lawson noted that whereas Middlesex deals with the [...] "links" [...] among gender, life, and genes, The Virgin Suicides deals with the [...] "connections" [...] <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> death.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft's epigrammatic {{allusion to}} Rousseau's Julie (1761) signifies her {{debt to the}} novel of sensibility, {{one of the most}} popular genres during the last half of the 18th century. Along with other female writers, such as Mary Hays, Helen Maria Williams, Charlotte Turner Smith, Mary Robinson, Maria Edgeworth, and Hannah More, Wollstonecraft felt {{compelled}} to respond to the Rousseauvean ideological aesthetic that had come to dominate British fiction. Romantic heroines, Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, [...] "represent woman constructed for man: the heroic feminine victim of the courtly rake and gallant, the virtuous feminine companion of the ideal professionalized gentleman, and the intellectually and erotically subservient companion of the ideal bourgeois man". Wollstonecraft would also attack Rousseau in her best-known work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, because of his sexism in the second part of Emile. She announces in the [...] "Advertisement" [...] (a section similar to a preface) of Mary that she is offering her heroine, who is a [...] "genius", as a contrast to characters such as Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Rousseau's [...] In addition the text is peppered with allusions to popular sentimental novels such as The History of Eliza Warwick (1778) and The Platonic Marriage (1787), which critique their presentation of the heroine of feminine sensibility. Mary is more akin to the charitable and industrious heroines of Bluestocking Sarah Scott's Millenium Hall (1762) than to the passive, weepy heroines found in most sentimental novels. Debate concerning the relationship <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sensibility continued into the early 19th century; Jane Austen, for example, made it the explicit focus of her novel Sense and Sensibility (1811).|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{with the}} Analytical Reviews third issue, Mary Wollstonecraft became the key editor for dramas, romances, and novels. Scholars {{have speculated that}} her reviews are signed by the letters [...] "M", [...] "W", or [...] "T", {{corresponding}} roughly to her initials, {{in large part because}} they have identified her writing style in these pieces. Her reviews, which number over 200, are generally characterized by their concern for women's issues. Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers concludes that Wollstonecraft [...] "is not only a pioneer feminist, but also a pioneer feminist critic, whose analysis of the mesh <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> genre inaugurates the feminist critical project". Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews, criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising, for example, the [...] "wise and resilient" [...] Mrs Stafford of Charlotte Smith's autobiographical novel Emmeline (1788). In highlighting this character, she [...] "singles out... the knowledgeable mother figure who has felt and thought deeply", one who resembles the women she described in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) as having [...] "power... over themselves". She derides the [...] "derivative, prescriptive, imitative, and affected" [...] and celebrates the [...] "natural, innovative, [...] imaginative". Evincing a particular regard for the works of Thomas Holcroft, such as Anna St. Ives (1792), Wollstonecraft celebrated their championing of innate nobility and virtue over aristocratic titles. Romanticist Anne Chandler argues that Wollstonecraft's reviews demonstrate [...] "an earlier Augustan politics of knowledge, variously outlined by Dryden, Pope, and, to a lesser extent, Swift" [...] which [...] "may be seen in her insistence on a continuum between aesthetic integrity and civic virtue; her belief in a metaphysical dialogue between human wit and divine Nature; and her perception of belletristic criticism as the proper tribunal for a new onslaught of scholarly and scientific research". While writing her last novel, [...] (1798), Wollstonecraft took advantage of her position with Johnson and reviewed almost nothing but novels, exposing herself to the wide variety of novelistic forms.|$|E

Also in the month, Netflix released viewing patterns for the Marvel Netflix series. The data, which came from Netflix's [...] "1,300 'taste communities' around the world, where subscribers are grouped based on what they watch", showed that viewers would not watch the series in chronological order by release, rather starting with Jessica Jones, then Daredevil, Luke Cage and finally Iron Fist. Todd Yellin, Netflix’s vice president of product innovation, noted that audiences watch the series [...] "in order of how they're interested in them and how they learn about them." [...] Netflix's data also showed that a viewer watching Luke Cage would most often then move on to Iron Fist, with Yellin figuring that Jessica Jones and Luke Cage would have paired up more, given that Cage was introduced on Jessica Jones. The data also revealed that fans of Stranger Things and other series that explore [...] "the dark side of society" [...] such as Black Mirror, The Walking Dead and the documentary Amanda Knox led viewers to starting Luke Cage.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Wilton {{came out as}} a lesbian, which gave her {{a strong sense of}} {{identity}} and politics as well as informing her intellectual work, although she never felt completely accepted by lesbians who had come out earlier in life because of her personal history of heterosexuality. She wrote in 1993, [...] "the positionality of [...] "lesbian" [...] offers a potent site from which to investigate the social, cultural and political interlocution of gender and sexuality". She saw herself as having a distinctly lesbian perspective on the issues she researched in a way that challenged the assumptions of colleagues and gay men, particularly in relation to gendered behaviour. In the lesbian edition of Sexualities (3, May 2000), Wilton noted the marginalisation of lesbian issues within sexuality studies and the journal. This conflictual approach was contra-punctuated by a warms in her personal relationships, which embodied a strong sense of solidarity with co-workers on sexuality, especially with gay men. She was keen to rework the debates on the relationship <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sexuality, and sought to integrate them as a focus for interdisciplinary study that included health policy, film theory, sociology of sexuality, as well as feminist and queer theory. Wilton's writing was aimed at both academic and lay audiences. Her published material reflected theoretical work on sexuality aimed at academics, a book designed for practitioner training, an introductory text for policy makers, discussion about the self-fashioning required by women who transition from heterosexuality to lesbianism, books for lay members of the communities involved in her research, and an edited volume on lesbians and film.|$|E

40|$|Research {{on gender}} {{development}} draws on two principal hypotheses: gender is a multi-dimensional construct <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> develops within social contexts. The present study examines the associations <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> identity, peer acceptance and self-worth across two contexts, single-sex (all-girls) and mixed-sex schools. The investigation examined whether peer relations mediate the association <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> identity <b>and</b> self-worth and whether type of school moderates the association <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> identity <b>and</b> peer relations. Early adolescents (N = 676, mean age = 10. 13 years) rated their gender typicality, felt pressure to conform, social competence and self-worth and indicated which {{of their peers}} was a friend. We present competing theories, one favouring a stronger association <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> identity <b>and</b> peer acceptance for {{the girls in the}} all-girls schools, the other for the girls in the mixed-sex schools. We hypothesized that the associations <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> identity <b>and</b> peer acceptance would be higher for the boys as compared to girls in the mixed-sex schools. We expected our mediational model to be applicable to all groups. Multi-group structural equation modeling was used. Mediation was found {{in the case of the}} girls in the all-girls schools. Higher typicality was related to higher social competence in the all-girls schools while the inverse was true for the girls in the mixed-sex schools. This study provides further evidence for the conceptualization of gender within a social context.

5000|$|Human sexuality, unlike gender, {{has kept}} a {{relatively}} stable definition by which it refers to all sexual attitudes and behaviours in an erotic, or lack of erotic, nature. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sexuality is not static, it is fluid and changing. In light of this, gendered sexuality does not necessarily follow predictable patterns. Typically, however, gendered sexuality has often followed a heteronormative path, whereby heterosexuality is seen as what Vanwesenbeeck calls a [...] "key-site" [...] for the intersection <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> sexuality. Historically, however, these interpretations of sexuality have been riddled with gendered stereotypes, such as men holding more permissive attitudes towards frequent sex and multiple sexual partners, whereas women are more conservative.|$|E
