25|$|Reducing defects on extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) masks is currently {{one of the}} most critical issues to be addressed for commercialization of EUV lithography. Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm FWHM can still be printable by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at Photomask Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E
25|$|In Tamil Nadu, Sheikh Abdul Ghaffoor, 39, {{was arrested}} with an alleged plan of {{carrying}} out bombings on Independence Day, 15 August 2008. The plot included bombing the state capital Chennai along with three other cities in Tamil Nadu and at least six trains. Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai is believed to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the list for such terror attack. The man was detained with a large cache of explosives and two timer devices. Apparently, {{it is believed that}} the plot was revealed by an arrested leader, P Ali Abdullah, of a banned organisation, who has been serving sentences in an Indian jail since 2003. Chennai city police later on 1 August 2008 announced that the arrests were not linked with either the Ahmedabad or Bangalore blasts.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{learning}} of the album's first-week sales, Jordon Terrell, also known to fans of the band as [...] "Charlie Scene."

[...] The album also debuted at number one on the US Hard Rock charts, number two on the US Rock, Digital, and Alternative charts, and number 11 on the Tastemaker Albums charts. Outside of the US, American Tragedy charted number five in Canadian albums charts and number 43 in the UK albums charts.|$|E

500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing.

500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a building so that the episode would begin and end the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams {{thought it would be}} better to start it underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge.|$|E
500|$|Recording of Satisfied {{began in}} September 2007 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. [...] As with DecembeRadio's {{previous}} album, Scotty Wilbanks {{was hired as}} the producer. [...] Said Reedy of Wilbanks, [...] "We just have a kindredship as musicians and as players.... There's {{a lot of excitement}} and passion that comes from his end.... big thing for us is having a really good time. [...] If we're not having a good time making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music that you really can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E

2500|$|Evans {{became known}} as an {{innovator}} during {{more than two decades}} with the American League. One obituary observed that he [...] "introduced something new to officiating by running down to a base where a play was made so that he would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> it". This approach became a standard practice among major league officials. He was also aware of the increasing demands placed on umpires and strongly advocated formal training for baseball officials. Furthermore, in a game that retained much of the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of earlier decades, Evans [...] "substituted diplomacy for belligerency and proved an arbiter could control a game without threats of physical violence".|$|E

In August 2012, the pilots voted to organize and joined the Teamsters. Allegiant's chairman and CEO, Maurice J. Gallagher Jr., has {{been critical of the}} unionization of airline employees and has stated that [...] "Unionization {{is one of those things}} that clogs the arteries and makes you less quick and not as nimble as you need to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> your game...

Recordings were made for a planned live album, but the idea was dropped after Halliwell's later departure. Later that year, the Spice Girls were invited to sing on the official England World Cup song [...] "How Does It Feel (To <b>Be</b> <b>on</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> the World)", the last song recorded with Halliwell until 2007.

In the French grip, {{the palm of}} the hand should be close to perpendicular with drum head and the thumb should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the stick. In both of these styles, as with most percussion grips, the fulcrum consists of the contact between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger is used as a guide and to help lift the stick off of the drum. The American grip is a hybrid of these two grips. Another known grip is known as the Amsterdam Grip, made famous by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which is similar to the Hinger grip, except the stick is cradled on the lower knuckle of the index finger.|$|E
2500|$|There {{will also}} be a [...] public square, with 28,000 plants and 225 trees, on the platform. In the middle of the square would be a 16-story {{structure}} of connected staircases between the buildings; the structure, titled Vessel, is designed by Thomas Heatherwick and will cost US$150 million. The public square will be a ventilation area for the West Side Yards, as well as a storm water runoff site. Storm water that runs off into the square will be reused. Since it is going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> an active rail yard, the public square would be located over a [...] deep plenum above a huge cooling slab with 15 fans blowing [...] air and a [...] rainwater storage tank.

Tim corrects him and says he is a DJ-man. The Doctor then recognizes this [...] "alien that plays hip-hop music on the radio". Tim calls it old and a [...] "TURDIS" [...] and then says to the Doctor {{that he is going to}} [...] "pimp his TARDIS". There are then several shots of mechanics attaching things to the TARDIS that are typical to Pimp My Ride (e.g. a customized number plate: T4RD15 and a disco ball where the normal light would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the TARDIS). The Doctor doesn't mind as these are only cosmetic changes, but Tim has messed up the suspension and the Doctor dematerializes from the garage with the TARDIS jumping to different places in the garage.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Eminem {{appears in a}} {{recording}} studio, rapping his verse in [...] "No Love." [...] American hip hop producers Just Blaze, The Alchemist and Denaun Porter make cameo appearances in the studio. When the boy arrives home from school, his parents see his injuries and begin arguing. The boy leaves to go skateboarding. After listening to Eminem and Lil Wayne, he is motivated and soon has the urge {{to stand up to}} the bullies. He arrives wearing a hoodie. At first the boy gets knocked down, but gets back up. At this moment, Eminem finishes his verse and starts singing the chorus. The scenario appears to play out in several ways where in one scene the boy appears to strike one of the bullies and then runs, only to be caught by them. In the next scene, he appears to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> one of the bullies and strikes him yet near the end it only appears he postures against the bullies and then walks away. Eminem also finishes his session and leaves to end the video.|$|E
2500|$|The clothes worn on Miami Vice had a {{significant}} influence on men's fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the [...] "T-shirt under Armani jacket"–style, and popularized Italian men's fashion in the United States. Don Johnson's typical attire of Italian sport coat, T-shirt, white linen pants, and slip-on sockless loafers became a hit. Even fine timepiece manufacturers got in on the action. Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date [...] "President" [...] model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show's other [...] "approved" [...] colors. Designers such as Vittorio Ricci, Gianni Versace, and Hugo Boss were consulted in keeping the male leads looking trendy. Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, [...] "The concept of the show is to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> all the latest fashion trends in Europe." [...] Jodi Tillen, the costume designer for the first season, along with Michael Mann, set the style. The abundance of pastel colors on the show reflected Miami's Art-deco architecture.|$|E

2500|$|The album went triple-Platinum, {{spawning}} {{the number-one}} hits [...] "Hot Stuff" [...] and [...] "Bad Girls", that went Platinum, and the number-two [...] "Dim All the Lights" [...] which went Gold. The week of June 16, 1979, Summer would again have the number-one single on the Hot 100 chart, and the number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart; when [...] "Hot Stuff" [...] regained {{the top spot}} on the Hot 100 chart.

The following week, Summer was the first solo artist to have two songs in the Hot 100 top three at the same time. In July 1979, Summer topped the Hot 100 singles chart, and the Billboard 200 albums chart, and the Soul singles chart simultaneously. In the week of November 10, 1979, [...] "Dim All the Lights" [...] peaked at [...] 2 for two weeks; the following week [...] "No More Tears (Enough is Enough)" [...] would get to No. 3; and once again Summer would have two songs in the top 3, on the Hot 100.

In the span of eight months, Summer had topped both the singles and albums charts simultaneously, three times. She became the first Female Artist to have three number-one singles in a calendar year. With [...] "Mac Arthur Park", [...] "Hot Stuff", [...] "Bad Girls", and the Barbra Streisand-duet [...] "No More Tears (Enough is Enough)", Summer achieved four number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart within a 12-month period. Including [...] "Heaven Knows" [...] and [...] "Dim All the Lights" [...] she had achieved six top 4 singles on the Hot 100 chart in the same 12-month period. Those songs, along with [...] "Last Dance", [...] "On the Radio", and [...] "The Wanderer", would give her nine Top 5 singles on the Hot 100 chart in just over a two-year period. The single, [...] "No More Tears (Enough is Enough)" [...] would sell over 2 million copies becoming a Platinum success. [...] "Hot Stuff" [...] won her a Grammy Award in the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, {{the first time the}} category was included. She was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and both Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Female R Vocal Performance, as well as Best Disco Recording.
