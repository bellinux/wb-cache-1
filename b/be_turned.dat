5|$|Although {{he gave up}} his {{original}} intentions for the Lifehouse project, Townshend continued to develop the concepts, revisiting them in later albums, including a 6-CD set, The Lifehouse Chronicles in 1999. In 2007 he opened a website called The Lifehouse Method to accept personal input from applicants that would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into musical portraits.|$|E

50|$|The second Iowa 94 existed from 1966 {{until it}} <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> back on July 1, 2003. The {{portions}} of the route within Cedar Rapids <b>were</b> <b>turned</b> over to the city, and were identified by their city street names. The rural portion of the route <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> over to Linn County, who today maintain the route as County Road W36.|$|R

5|$|The {{upper limit}} of {{navigation}} was initially Donington High Bridge, where the Swaton Eau joins the South Forty-Foot Drain {{and provides a}} wider section where boats can <b>be</b> <b>turned.</b> Beyond the bridge, the drain was officially only suitable for canoes and kayaks.|$|E

5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided that the road <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> over to the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its {{first two years of}} existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Night Interception Committee on 2 May it was decided that the bomber threat was greater than submarines, and the {{decision}} was made to move 80 of the 140 ASV Mk. I transmitters to AI, adding to 70 being constructed by EKCO (E.K. Cole). These would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into 60 IIIA's and 40 IIIB's. At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were not suitable for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, {{there was a very}} good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
50|$|The {{detector}} <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> on in May 1999, and <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> off on 28 November 2006. The SNO collaboration {{was active}} {{for several years}} after that analyzing the data taken.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Sixty Six Bingo" [...] {{each player}} gets six cards {{and there are}} six common cards.

If no player claims the pot by being knocked out, then the pot is split between high hand and low hand. If a player's {{remaining}} cards include an ace, then it is possible to be both high hand and low hand.|$|R

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|Disheartened, David {{falls from}} a ledge, but is rescued by Joe using their amphibicopter. David tells Joe {{he saw the}} Blue Fairy {{underwater}} and wants {{to go down to}} meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities using an electromagnet. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to go to the Fairy, which {{turns out to be a}} statue at Coney Island. The two become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. David asks repeatedly to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into a real boy until the ocean freezes and is deactivated once his power source is drained.|$|E
5|$|Flinn {{conceived}} the penal colony Rura Penthe as on an arid, undeveloped world with odorous aliens; Meyer {{suggested that it}} <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> into an ice world instead. The exterior shots of Martia, Kirk, and McCoy traveling across the frozen wastes were filmed {{on top of a}} glacier in Alaska, forty minutes east of Anchorage. Because of budget and time constraints, the second unit was tasked with getting the footage. The location was accessible only by helicopter, and was scouted months before filming began.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} time in U.S. history, SCATANA was invoked, thus {{stranding}} tens of thousands of passengers across the world. The FAA closed American airspace to all international flights, causing about five hundred flights to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> back or redirected to other countries. Canada received 226 of the diverted flights and launched Operation Yellow Ribbon to deal with the large numbers of grounded planes and stranded passengers.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the Air Ministry {{approached}} Morris Motors Limited to ask {{how quickly}} their Cowley plant could <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> to aircraft production. In 1936 this informal request for major manufacturing facilities {{was turned into a}} formal scheme to boost British aircraft production capacity under the leadership of Herbert Austin, known as the shadow factory plan. Austin was given the task of building nine new factories, and to supplement the existing British car manufacturing industry by either adding to overall capacity or increasing the potential for reorganisation to produce aircraft and their engines.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Hartmann's mother {{wrote to}} the new West German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, to whom she appealed to secure his freedom. A trade {{agreement}} between West Germany and the Soviet Union was reached, and Hartmann was released along with 16,000 German military personnel {{as one of the}} last Heimkehrer. After spending 10 {{and a half years in}} Soviet POW camps, he was among the last batch of prisoners to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> over. Returning to West Germany, he was reunited with his wife Ursula, to whom he had written every day of the war.|$|E
50|$|A {{controversial}} {{feature of}} the bridge was added in 1998, when lights were added to illuminate the bridge at night. Many thought this was unnecessary and a waste of both electricity and money. During a power crisis in 2000, the lights <b>were</b> <b>turned</b> off, but they <b>were</b> <b>turned</b> on for one night to honor Hendler's passing. Now the lights <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> on at night, and turned off at 2 am.|$|R
50|$|Cannon pinion - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> by the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> by the minute wheel, which <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the cannon pinion directly.|$|R
