40|$|Serum {{levels of}} {{prolactin}} (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), progesterone and estradiol- 17 t 1 were compared in female turkeys during various phases of their reproductive life cycle. Prolactin levels of broody turkeys were higher (2164 ± 127 ng/ml) {{than those of}} laying turkeys (468 ± 74 ng/ml), which were in turn {{higher than those of}} hens that had stopped laying (119 ± 18 ng/ml). Serum LH, progesterone, and estradiol- 17 levels of laying hens were significantly higher than those of the other two groups. The levels of these hormones did not differ between <b>broody</b> <b>hens</b> and hens that had stopped laying, but were not <b>broody</b> (photorefractory <b>hens).</b> Serum prolactin levels of <b>broody</b> <b>hens</b> dropped markedly within a day of nest-deprivation and confinement to cages. Levels remained low while hens were in cages. When nests were again made available to <b>broody</b> <b>hens</b> that had been deprived of nests for 48 h, they resumed nesting within 5 mm, and serum prolactin levels then increased. In other experiments, it was found that a significant decline in serum prolactin occurred after 8, but not 4 h of nest-deprivation. After a 48 h period of cage confinement of hens, prolactin levels were seen to increase within 30 mm after hens were returned to their home pens. Levels continued to rise and had nearly reached pre-cage confinement levels by 12 h after resumption of nesting...|$|R

Hens in T 2 and T 3 received 50 g feed/hen/day. The interval between end of incubation and first lay was shorter in T 2 (36. 3 days) and T 3 (41. 7) than in T 1 (55. 2). Clutch length was shortest in T 1 (12. 7 days), medium in T 3 (15. 0) and longest in T 2 (17. 0). There were more eggs/clutch in T 2 (14. 7) and T 3 (14. 3) than in T 1 (11. 5).

5000|$|Under natural conditions, most birds lay {{only until}} a clutch is complete, {{and they will}} then {{incubate}} all the eggs.

She will [...] "sit" [...] or [...] "set" [...] on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe.

50|$|Ducks are {{generally}} monogamous, although these bonds usually last {{only a single}} year. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing {{to do so in}} favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their ducklings to water. Mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease. Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to water.Most domestic ducks neglect their eggs and ducklings, and their eggs must be hatched under a <b>broody</b> <b>hen</b> or artificially.|$|E

And it is noteworthy that if reg 57(3) is validly made, an inspector could require any person not necessarily connected with the poultry industry to answer any inquiries relative to the source of production, ownership and intended destination of a single fowl.
