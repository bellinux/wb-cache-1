40|$|The {{integrity}} of steel-aluminium dissimilar alloy joints {{is dependent on}} the thermal cycle applied during the joining process. The thermal field has a direct influence on the growth of the intermetallic compounds (IMC), which result from the reaction between iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al), but it also determines the size of the <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> of the joint. A finite element (FE) thermal model was developed to predict the transient thermal cycle at the Fe-Al interface for different levels of applied energy by changing the power density and interaction time. The time-temperature profiles were correlated to the weld geometry, IMC layer thickness and mechanical strength. The experimental results showed that having a small <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> is equally detrimental to the mechanical strength of the joint as having a thick IMC layer. The FE model suggested that comparing to time, the temperature is more important in laser welding of steel to aluminium as this is the factor which most contributes to the growth of the IMC layer and the formation of the <b>bonding</b> <b>area.</b> However, {{it was not possible to}} identify a thermal field able to produce simultaneously a large <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> and a thin IMC layer to optimize the joint strength...|$|E

Anodic bonded substrates with four different <b>bonding</b> <b>areas</b> are simulated {{for the analysis}} of stresses, occurring during the CMP process.

30|$|Depending on the substrate, the {{adhesive}} procedure can be extremally challenging. The difficulty to stablish {{a proper}} and durable <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> in NCCLs {{is related to}} the modified histology of the affected dental structure, that presents hyper-mineralized dentin and denatured collagen, not ideal for the bond stability [22]. There are many studies on adhesive procedures in the cases of NCCLs and the best results are usually obtained with RMGIC and two-step self-etch adhesive systems [20, 21], with some variations among commercial brands. In general, the durable <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> created by the two-step self-etch adhesives is attributed to a simple operatory technique, as the primer is applied on dry dentin, becoming less dependent on the operator. Additionally, the chemical adhesion to the dental structure, provided by the specific monomers, such as 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogenphosphate (10 -MDP), is considered crucial [20 – 23].|$|E

40|$|The role of bonding in the tensile creep {{behavior}} of paper was analyzed. This {{was accomplished by}} producing handsheets at a range of different bonding levels through manipulation of relative <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> and specific <b>bond</b> strength. This was done by varying the level of wet pressing (to change relative <b>bonded</b> <b>area)</b> and using debonding and bonding agents (to change specific bond strength). Once manufactured, sheets underwent an extensive battery of physical testing and creep testing. Creep testing was conducted under constant humidity and cyclic humidity (accelerated creep) conditions. Microscopic analysis techniques were also employed to visually study <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> loss from creep strain. Two mathematical models (one empirical and one rheological) were created to isolate, account for, and incorporate bonding into predicting tensile creep behavior in paper. Overall, {{the results from this}} thesis show that the role of bonding in tensile creep behavior (and accelerated creep behavior) is no different than its role in stress-strain behavior, which is a new finding. This means the bonding influence on tensile creep behavior is related to sheet efficiency and how effectively stress is distributed within the structure, <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> loss is a strain-induced phenomenon and bonding is not the cause of accelerated creep behavior.

30|$|Thus, this {{discussion}} {{makes clear that}} the scarf joint should perform best for the same <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> of adhesive, followed by the stepped-lap joint. The DLJ only outperforms the SLJ, which clearly gives the worst performance, {{but it should be}} considered that, for the same LO, the DLJ has twice the <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> than all other joints. As a result, these differences should result in a distinct joint behaviour, although the joints’ performance also depends on the adhesive type, in the sense that, typically, more brittle adhesives are more sensitive to peak stresses. Moreover, at high transmitted loads, which typically take place for higher LO, another issue has importance: plasticization of the adherends. All these issues will be discussed further in the strength analysis that will follow.|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of electronic packages under exceptionally harsh environments presents a significant {{challenge for the}} microelectronics industry, for example, in down-hole, well-logging and turbo-machinery applications. High temperature Au based solders are one potential candidate for die attachment for harsh environments and is already used in limited cases. For Au-Si die bonding, some of the Si is provided by diffusion from the Si die itself. Therefore, the interfacial reaction between the Si and Au-Si thin foil solder preform is {{a key factor in}} the control of the die bonding process. Unfortunately, during the die bonding process, defects such as voids, delaminations, and impurities are not unusual. These defects are caused by the assembly process, chemical impurities, soldering reactions, and thermal stresses. Understanding these defects is critical for the reliable performance of the devices after bonding.

40|$|The {{hardness}} and Young's modulus of {{the successive}} layers across a resin-dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> {{were determined by}} nano-indentation for four commercially-available dentin adhesive systems, of which two were also applied with a different conditioning agent. With a computer-controlled nano-indentation technique, minute triangular indentations were made within a small area of a few micrometers' diameter at a load of a few milli-Newtons. The load and displacement of the indenter were continuously monitored during the loading-unloading sequence, so hardness and Young's modulus could be computed {{as a function of}} the indenter geometry and the applied load. The hardness of the resin-dentin interdiffusion zone was significantly lower than that of unaltered dentin. A gradient of moduli of elasticity was observed from the rather stiff dentin over a more elastic resin-dentin interdiffusion zone and adhesive resin layer to the restorative composite. That gradient was more substantial in those systems that produced relatively thick adhesive resin layers or supplementally provided a filled low-viscosity resin as an intermediate layer between the adhesive resin and the bulk restorative composite.

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of the cross-sectional area shape (cylindrical vs. rectangular) and the bonding surface area on the microtensile bond strengths and stress distribution of four dentin adhesive systems (Scotchbond MP Plus, OptiBond FL, OptiBond Solo, One-Step). In addition, finite element analysis (FEA) models were developed to investigate stress distributions. Methods. Extracted human molars were cut vertically and the occlusal enamel removed; one-half of the tooth was used for rectangular specimens, the other half for cylindrical specimens. The occlusal dentin was bonded according to the manufacturers' directions and covered with a block of resin composite. For the cylindrical specimens, the bonded dentin was shaped with a diamond bur on a lathe to produce specimens of area 1. 1, 1. 5 or 3. 1 mm 2 at the bonded interface. The rectangular specimens were sectioned to obtain bar-shaped specimens, which were shaped to produce hour-glass shaped specimens with the same area as the round specimens. Bonds were stressed in tension at a speed of 1 mm min- 1. The mean bond strengths were compared using two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, LSD and Student's t tests. The fractured surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the frequencies of the fracture modes were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. FEA models were created simulating the cross-sectional areas for bonding to determine the stress distribution. Results. The 3. 1 mm 2 <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> groups showed significantly lower bond strengths than the 1. 1 mm 2 <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> groups (p < 0. 05), except for the rectangular specimens using Scotchbond MP Plus and One-Step. Most cylindrical specimens of <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> 1. 1 or 1. 5 mm 2 exhibited adhesive failure at the interface between the dentin and the adhesive resin. No differences were determined between cylindrical and rectangular specimens. The fracture mode matched the stress distribution patterns calculated from the FEA modeling. Significance. The results indicate that the test methods using small surface areas produce higher bond strengths than those using larger surface areas, and that cross-sectional shape has little effect. This is probably a result of fewer defects occurring in the small-area specimens. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the Academy of Dental Materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This arrangement enables arrays A and B to achieve special resolution of 400  µm when evaluating the adhesive in the x-direction using the pulse echo method. The arrays A and B can inspect an area of 6.5  mm each, whereby the resolution for one test position consists of 14 individual measurements.

This test area is sufficient for the complete testing of seam <b>bond</b> <b>area</b> b, whereas seam <b>bond</b> <b>area</b> a is usually larger.
