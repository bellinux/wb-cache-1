40|$|Highly {{transparent}} YVO 4 :Eu {{thin films}} were deposited via dip coating of liquid nanoparticle dispersions on glass substrates. Annealing of the nanoparticle layers resulted in {{restructuring of the}} material into oriented crystalline films. The crystallinity was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction. Film thickness was adjusted to 467 nm by multiple deposition. The resulting coatings show &# 62; 99 % absorbance for wavelength below 300 nm and &# 62; 90 % transmission in the visible spectral range. Under UV-light excitation a bright red photoluminescence with a quantum efficiency of 20 % is observed.

40|$|International audienceThis work proposes the {{development}} of a power supply for Dielectric <b>Barrier</b> Discharge (DBD) <b>lamps,</b> intended for the evaluation of a water treatment system based on UV radiation. The DBD excimer lamp is an attractive source of UV because of its cost and radiation power. The proposed converter is conceived to control the UV radiation by programming different lamp current intensities, duty cycles and frequencies. For the converter synthesis, a capacitive electric equivalent model of the DBD is used. A simulation of the converter and its control analysis is presented...|$|R

A pulsed power supply with controllable parameters based on a push-pull converter is developed for lamp excitation at different voltage levels and repetition rate. The experimentations were conducted for 28 different operating points with the frequency range of 2 kHz to 15 Khz at output voltage levels of between 7. 4 kV up to 13 kV. The obtained results show the feasibility of finding an optimum operation point due to nonlinear behaviour of the DBD lamp...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study between ten different photocatalytic active coatings was done. The effectiveness and photocatalytic {{activity of the}} coatings were studied by degradation experiments of methylene blue (MB) dye under UV light illumination. The reactor design consisting of sintered glass packed in a borosilicate tube placed between two planar dielectric <b>barrier</b> discharge <b>lamps</b> (Osram Planon) is reported for the first time. The coatings consisted of either titania, silica, or zinc on sintered borosilicate glass. The advantage of sol-gel in catalyst preparation was exploited to combine catalyst to act as cocatalyst. TiO 2 -P 25 widely applied in suspension systems was effectively immobilized on sintered glass support {{with the aid of}} tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) solution which acted as support material. Results indicated that TiO 2 -P 25 +SiO 2, TiO 2 -P 25 +SiO 2 +Pt, and TiOSO 4 _ 30, 6 wt% films showed highest degradation rates close to 100 % after 90 [*]min illumination with degradation rates exceeding 50 % after 30 [*]minutes.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{detailed}} experimental and modeling study of efficiency for dielectric <b>barrier</b> discharge excited <b>lamp</b> containing mixtures of xenon and iodine. A survey of performance as functions of pressure, iodine partial pressure and excitation parameters {{indicates that the}} maximum efficiency of conversion from electrical output to UV (253 nm) is in the range 1 - 2 % in contrast to previous reports of efficiency > 20 % [eg. Zhang and Boyd, J. Appl. Phys 84, 1174 (1998) ]. The results are in good agreement with a 1 -D rate-equation model of the discharge kinetics, which suggests that direct quenching of the upper states of the Xel* (B-X) transition (253 nm) by I₂ limits the output efficiency. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We observe marked {{increases}} in the time-averaged intensity, peak intensity, efficiency and spectral purity of the VUV output from an Xe excimer <b>barrier</b> discharge <b>lamp</b> when using short-pulse (~ 150 ns FWHM (full width half maximum)) excitation. Intensity increases with Xe pressure up to 600 Torr with a maximum output 2. 6 times higher and an efficiency 3. 2 {{times higher than the}} same lamp excited by conventional ac excitation (i. e. sinusoidal voltage waveform). The output occurs in regular short pulses (< 300 ns FWHM) with a peak intensity more than six times the peak intensity typically obtained using ac. The spectral characteristics are similar to that observed using ac excitation except that the ratio of VUV to visible Xe* emission increases by a factor of three. The pulsed discharge appears diffuse (i. e. glow-like), even at the higher pressures at which the ac discharge is filamentary. It is concluded that the enhanced performance results largely from the ability for pulsed excitation to generate a discharge at near atmospheric pressures with a much lower electron density than that possible using ac. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDielectric <b>barrier</b> {{discharge}} (DBD) <b>lamps,</b> being capacitive loads, must {{be associated}} with bidirectional current sources for an appropriate control of the transferred power. Pulsed current source supplies, which are known to offer very interesting performances, require speciﬁc power switches {{that are able to}} manage bidirectional voltage and unidirectional current at much higher frequencies (several hundreds of kilohertz) than commercial thyristors. This paper proposes the detailed design of such a high-speed synthesized thyristor, using discrete components: a MOSFET in series with a high-voltage (HV) diode and a logic circuit that controls its gate. This switch is associated with an optimized self-powered driver, which is a very efﬁcient solution to handle the perturbations associated with the HV and high-frequency operation. Experimental application of this device for DBD excimer lamp supply is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} a series-resonant inverter for the supply of a dielectric <b>barrier</b> discharge excimer <b>lamp.</b> Causal analysis, based on the fundamental properties of the load, is used to detail the reasoning {{which has led to}} this topology. In order to effectively control the lamp power, the operating mode of this converter combines discontinuous current mode and soft commutation (zero-current switching), obtaining low electromagnetic emissions and reduced switching losses as well. The model of the lamp is brieﬂy presented, and it allows a simple state plane analysis to calculate all the electric variables involved in the converter and, consequently, to select the components of the supply. The mathematical relationships obtained from this process, for injected power control by means of the available degrees of freedom, are validated with simulations and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Light sources play an {{indispensable}} {{role in the}} daily life of any human being. Quality of life, health and urban security related to traffic and crime prevention depend on light and on its quality. In fact, every day approximately 30 billion electric light sources operate worldwide. These electric light sources consume almost 19 % of worldwide electricity production. Finding new ways to light lamps is a challenge where the stakes are scientific, technological, economic and environmental. The production of more efficient light sources is a sustainable solution for humanity. There are many opportunities for not only enhancing the efficiency and reliability of lighting systems but also for {{improving the quality of}} light as seen by the end user. This is possible through intelligent use of new technologies, deep scientific understanding of the operating principles of light sources and knowledge of the varied human requirements for different types of lighting in different settings. A revolution in the domain of light source technology is on the way: high brightness light emitting diodes arriving in the general lighting market, together with organic LEDs (OLEDs), are producing spectacular advances. However, unlike incandescence, electrical discharge lamps are far from disappearing from the market. In addition, new generations of discharge lamps based on molecular radiators are becoming a reality. There are still many scientific and technological challenges to be raised in this direction. Diagnostics are important for understanding the fundamental mechanisms taking place in the discharge plasma. This understanding is an absolute necessity for system optimization leading to more efficient and high quality light sources. The studied medium is rather complex, but new diagnostic techniques coupled to innovative ideas and powerful tools have been developed in recent years. This cluster issue of seven papers illustrates these efforts. The selected papers cover all domains, from high to low pressure and dielectric <b>barrier</b> <b>lamps,</b> from breakdown to acoustic resonance. Especially in the domain of high pressure lamps, J J Curry shows how coherent and incoherent x-ray scattering can be used as an imaging technique adapted to lamps. J Hirsch et al treat the acoustic resonance phenomenon that seriously limits the frequency domain for high pressure lamp operation. M Jinno et al illustrate a method that allows for measuring Xe buffer gas pressure in Hg-free metal halide lamps for automotive applications. In the domain of low pressure lamps, M Gendre et al investigate the breakdown phase by means of optical and electrical diagnostic tools. The similarity rules used a long time ago for simulating plasma behaviour based on invariants are now serving as diagnostic tools, as shown in the paper by D Michael et al. N Dagang et al show how impurities can be detected in Hg-free electrodeless lamps and more particularly in dielectric barrier discharges emitting excimer radiation. The quality of light is illustrated by a final example by R Kozakov et al on how to qualify the light output from the lamp with respect to biological effects on human...|$|R
40|$|The use of plate glass-water thermal {{barriers}} in controlled environment facilities effectively reduces the thermal load within the plant growth chamber. This allows high PPFs {{to be provided}} for plant growth and development studies, adequate simulation of daily light integrals, and simulation of peak PPF's. Further, substantial amounts of incandescent lamp supplementation can be used to achieve simulation of daylight R:FR ratios which are needed to ensure adequate stem development in some species. While the focus in this paper is on the use of entire thermal barriers which separate the lighting enclosure from the plant growth chamber, the same principles apply to the use of water jackets for cooling individual lamps (such as can occur with xenon-arc lamps). In this instance, the <b>barrier</b> separating the <b>lamps</b> from the plant chamber can be much simpler (e. g., plexiglass) as the main function of the barrier is to separate the air ventilation of the lamp enclosure from the air system within the plant growth chamber. The main advantage of water as a thermal barrier is the negligible absorption of radiation in the photosynthetically-active and near infrared wavebands. Consequently, plate glass-water barriers typically allow transmission of approximately 90 % of radiation in these regions. While ventilated double and triple glazing systems appear to be attractive alternative to water barriers from an operating standpoint, their significant absorption in the biologically-important wavebands (7 - 12 %) with each glass layer and longer-wave cut-offs (typically 2500 - 4000 nm) makes them a much less attractive alternative. The data presented here demonstrate clearly that measurement of PPF alone is not an adequate representation of the radiation environment being used in a controlled environment study. The amounts and proportions of long-wave and short-wave radiation in a plant growth chamber are dependent on lamp type, lamp combination, presence of a thermal barrier, the type of thermal <b>barrier</b> between the <b>lamps</b> and the plant growing area and the overall construction and design of the chamber. It is important, therefore, in reporting results of controlled environment studies, to adequately describe both the details of the lighting system used and the characteristics of the radiation produced by that system, so results of different studies can be adequately evaluated and compared...|$|R
5000|$|The five {{star rating}} system for each race, {{the use of}} primary and {{secondary}} objectives introduced in Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and also used in Asphalt 7 have all been retained in Asphalt 8. Three stars are awarded for finishing in first place, two for second, and one for third. Achieving secondary objectives, such as performing a given number of stunts or knocking down opponents, awards the player with two additional stars. Obtaining stars in an event is cumulative - players who finished first in an event without completing the secondary objectives may replay the race and obtain a five-star rating even if the primary objectives aren't met. The core gameplay is slightly different, however. As the subtitle implies, the focus of Airborne is on jumping, with tracks featuring a lot more ramps than in previous games. In addition to performing standard jumps, the player can also perform flat spins (by drifting onto a ramp) and barrel rolls (by hitting curved ramps). All jumps earn nitro boost; the longer the airtime, the more boost earned. Destroying obstacles such as <b>barriers</b> and <b>lamp</b> posts or hitting traffic cars also earns nitros. Another new feature, which substitutes the [...] "Adrenaline mode" [...] in Asphalt 6 and 7, {{is the ability to}} perform a [...] "Perfect Nitro". When the player hits boost, a small red zone appears in the boost bar. If the player hits boost again when the boost meter is in the red zone, the car will accelerate even faster, with the boost lasting until the player runs out of boost, brakes, crashes or hits a ramp.|$|R
