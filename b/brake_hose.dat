2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started. While they closely resemble miniature Janney couplers, they are somewhat different mechanically, with the knuckle pivoting {{from the center}} of the coupler head, rather than from the side. A steel pin, designed to resemble an air <b>brake</b> <b>hose,</b> allows the couplers to be released magnetically; the design of the coupler head prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a straight pin extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised above rail height when uncoupling was desired.|$|E

50|$|The ER5 has a {{twin piston}} front disk brake and a rear drum brake. Unlike many modern motorcycles, with fixed caliper and {{floating}} disk, the ER5 has a fixed disk and floating caliper. 'A' models have a trailing piston which {{is smaller than}} the leading piston but the later 'C' models have identical leading and trailing pistons, dramatically improving front braking. 'A' model owners often fit caliper units from 'C' models. As for most motorcycles, another common braking upgrade is to reduce sponginess by replacing the OEM <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> with a braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|E

50|$|These {{systems are}} {{different}} to dragging equipment detectors, which {{are looking for}} anything dragging from the train connecting with the sleepers.Low Hose detectors are looking specifically between two wagons, to measure the droop of the <b>brake</b> <b>hoses.</b> The <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> need a bit of droop, but too much and they can hit or dislodge.Typically, these systems employ a vertical bar installed {{on one side of}} the track, with infrared sensors pointed across the track at a mate bar with receivers installed pointed back at the infrared beams. When a train goes past, the infrared sensors are looking in the coupling area specifically, and will alert if anything is detected in the area that is lower than acceptable.|$|R

25|$|Because of its extreme non-reactivity {{and high}} {{temperature}} rating, PTFE {{is often used}} as the liner in hose assemblies, expansion joints, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as <b>brake</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|E

Only 300 of these were released.The facelift versions of 250 units were released for 2008 model year and powered by the 2.5-liter turbo engine. The modified EJ255 engine was rated [...] at 6000 rpm and 350 Nm at 2800 rpm. It included Bilstein shocks, a rear suspension kit with partial ball-bearing-jointed bushings, 5 mm lower springs, Brembo brakes (4-piston front, 2-piston rear) with stainless steel mesh-type <b>brake</b> <b>hose,</b> 18-inch ENKEI wheels (2.5 kg lighter over stock), front and rear STI spoilers, leather and alcantara front seats, and an 8-way power driver seat with memory settings.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} tubes {{were cut}} from a roll of rubber industrial tubing by his assistant, hence the natural curve of the tube. A curved metal adaptor was designed (Magill oral and nasal connectors) and a 4" [...] black rubber connecting hose to fit to the anesthetic circuit was adapted from an MG car <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> and named the 'catheter mount' by Magill's theatre technician at Westminster Hospital. Originally, there was no inflatable cuff. The tube was packed {{either side of the}} sub-glottis by two green anaesthetic swabs, with ribbon gauze sewn on by hand to aid extraction at extubation of the endotracheal tube. Anaesthetic gel or ointment was used to lubricate the tube and provide some relief for the patient's sore throat post-procedure.|$|E
50|$|Braided {{stainless}} steel brake lines (also known as braided {{stainless steel}} <b>brake</b> <b>hoses)</b> are flexible hoses fitted to a hydraulic brake system.

Thomas also carries an electric light on the right-hand side of his front buffer beam and a red tail light mounted on the centre of his bunker, whereas the originals had removable kerosene lamps mounted on lamp irons, which Thomas incidentally has, although they are not used but instead included for continuity with the other engines.|$|R

50|$|Bankers or helpers were {{historically}} positioned at {{the rear}} of the train, in which case they also protected against wagons or coaches breaking away from the train and running back downhill. Also, in a pusher role, it was possible for the helper/banker to easily separate once the train had crested the grade. Once separated, the banker would return to a siding or stub so as to clear the mainline and get ready for the next train. A common practice with knuckle couplers was to remove the knuckle from the front coupler. The locomotive would be brought up behind the last car of the train while the train was moving slowly. The air <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> would not be coupled. When the train no longer required assistance, the helper/pusher would slow, then reverse and coast back down the grade to its siding at the bottom of the grade. This practice was outlawed in North America after the end of the steam era.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel brake lines. It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel brake lines are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series. Braided stainless steel brake lines are a common aftermarket upgrade, purchased and installed after a vehicle is initially purchased.|$|E
50|$|The yard has eleven arrival tracks, two hump {{tracks and}} 40 {{classification}} tracks up to 920 m long. The freight wagons or sets of wagons are run {{over the hump}} and then retarded {{by a series of}} automatic retarders and finally pushed together for coupling. The wagons are then coupled together with their <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> and the <b>brakes</b> are tested by a remote-controlled brake test system. The entire marshalling operation is automatically controlled by a central electronic interlocking. Intervention by the signallers is only required if there is a fault.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} center buffer coupler of AAR tight {{lock type}} at the coach end has a support frame which provides an anti-climbing protection. The coupler can be opened {{from the side}} by a lever. The design allows the use of screw coupler instead of center buffer coupler. Therefore a fixing plate for buffers is also provided. The inter-vehicle coupler for the supply of the 750 V from the generator car is located below the under-frame. Due to the moving situation 4 <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> are to be used at the coach end which are brought to two hoses behind the coupler.|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} was soon {{superseded}} by air operated or vacuum operated brakes. These <b>brakes</b> used <b>hoses</b> connecting all the wagons of a train, so the driver could apply or release the brakes {{with a single}} valve in the locomotive.|$|R
