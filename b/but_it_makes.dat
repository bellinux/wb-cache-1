Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E

25|$|Transumbilical: a trans-umbilical breast {{augmentation}} (TUBA) is a {{less common}} implant-device insertion technique wherein the incision is at the navel, and the dissection tunnels superiorly. This surgical approach enables emplacing the breast implants without producing visible scars upon the breast; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntlywithout the endoscope's visual assistanceand is not appropriate for emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the elastomer silicone shell of the breast-implant device during its manual insertion through the shorttwo-centimetre (~2.0cm.)incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone-gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.|$|E

Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Drake has a {{distinct}} personality, as the creators did {{not want him to}} appear as a caricature or [...] "cardboard cutout". Hennig constantly elaborated Drake's personality through in-game dialogue and interactions with other characters, rather than exclusively through cutaway scenes. Drake reacts to events in a human-like way, often commenting and complaining on the absurdity or difficulty of his situation. While traveling through chapters, Drake frequently makes sarcastic quips and taunts. Self-educated in history and various languages, Drake is also highly intelligent. Matt Casamassina of IGN commented on the character's interactions during gameplay that reveal Drake's nature: [...] "it's lighthearted and amusing, but it also demonstrates that Nate is aware of how absurd his predicaments sometimes are. It's a small, unimportant communication, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense that the two would behave exactly as they do." ...|$|E

500|$|The main {{usage of}} zinc oxide (zinc white) was in paints {{and as an}} {{additive}} to ointments. Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 {{but it did not}} mix well with oil. This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO. In 1845, LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale, and by 1850, zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe. The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead: zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight, it is not blackened by sulfur-bearing air, it is non-toxic and more economical. Because zinc white is so [...] "clean" [...] it is valuable for making tints with other colors, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors. For example, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings. All those paintings developed cracks over the years.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} often called a Super Mario 64 clone for its {{similarity}} in gameplay. Gerstmann compared it favourably to Mario, saying that [...] "it doesn't stray {{too far from}} the formula, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make." [...] Game Informer observed that, while both games are very similar, Banjo-Kazooie has less emphasis on the platforming and more on exploration. Schneider noted that the worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are [...] "bigger, more detailed and are filled with interactive characters at every corner." [...] Colin Williamson of AllGame stated similar pros, crediting the level design as [...] "simply delightful, loaded with creativity, secrets, and memorable characters." [...] Nintendo Power remarked that the game's puzzles were fresh and that the characters [...] "have more of a loud-mouthed attitude than Mario and crew. One habitually-criticized aspect of the game was its flawed camera system. Game Revolution remarked that it can occasionally be in a bad angle to gauge a jump properly, while Edge said that its fixed position in underwater sections can be frustrating while retrieving collectables.|$|E

[...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy.
