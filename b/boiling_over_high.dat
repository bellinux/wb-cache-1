5000|$|Lobster stew: until {{not long}} ago this type of sauce or bread soup was a poor fisher's dish, since Minorcan's {{lobsters}} were easy to find. Add bits of lobster on top of onions, tomato, garlic, and  parsley and <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> heat.  Kaldereta is the best known internationally Minorcan dish, {{and of all the}} Minorcan pots the most emblematic is lobster. Other pots that are prepared a lot are made of fish, usually roca fish, like the grouper pot.|$|R
5000|$|To {{make the}} dish, the broth is {{prepared}} first by boiling a cleaned chopped chicken, whole garlic, onions, ginger and {{a type of}} fresh green chili pepper called [...] "Cheongyang gochu" [...] (청양고추) altogether in a pot. The pepper {{is famous for its}} extreme spiciness and {{plays an important role in}} tasting the dish. Cellophane noodles are soaked in water. The cooked chicken is simmered with a sauce made from ganjang, mullyeot (물엿, syrup-like condiment), sugar, and pepper in the broth. Slices of shiitake, and diced carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables are added in the pot and <b>boiled</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> heat for ten minutes. Whilst the carrots and potatoes are almost getting cooked, a little amount of wheat flour and spinach, sliced cucumber, scallions and the noodles are added to the pot as well. After cooking, the dish is put on a plate and sesame seeds are spread over it.|$|R

50|$|A milk watcher, milk saver, pot watcher, pot minder, milk guard, or <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> {{preventer}} is {{a cooking}} utensil {{placed at the}} bottom of a pot to prevent <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> of liquids, and especially the burning (scorching) of milk.|$|R
5000|$|Normally, {{boiling water}} does not <b>boil</b> <b>over.</b> When fats, starches, {{and some other}} {{substances}} are present in boiling water, for example by adding milk or pasta, <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> can occur. A film forms {{on the surface of}} the boiling liquid; for example, cream can <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> as milk fat separates from the milk. [...] The increased viscosity of the liquid causes the steam bubbles to form foam trapped under the film, pushing the film up and over the lip of the pot, <b>boiling</b> <b>over.</b> A milk watcher disrupts this process by collecting small bubbles of steam into one large bubble and releasing it in a manner which may puncture the surface film. The device also rattles when boiling occurs, alerting the cook who may then lower the heat setting of the stove.|$|R
