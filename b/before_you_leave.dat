25|$|Tim Cain, the producer, lead {{programmer}} {{and one of}} {{the main}} designers of the 1997 computer game Fallout, said: This book was how individual will handle thinking that he is the last survivor on Earth. This is why in Fallout <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> the Vault we really wanted that sense of isolationism. That sense: You are the only personality here on the Wasteland who is called a normal person and what do you feel like special in that way.|$|E
500|$|... "Moments" [...] is a mid-tempo pop ballad. Written {{in the key}} of D major, {{the beat}} is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 150 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of D4 to A5. [...] "Moments" [...] utilises a gently strummed guitar and intermediate piano lines. Inspired by the breakdown of a relationship between Sheeran and an unnamed woman, the song's lyrics revolve around an unrequited love. The chorus of the song is essentially built on the hook, [...] "You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be/ My love, my heart is breathing for this moment in time/I'll find the words to say/ <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> me today." ...|$|E
500|$|Broderick and Hughes {{stayed in}} touch for a while after production. [...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{take account}} of anything--I'm myself a man who always takes too much. It isn't a matter about which I press you for an {{immediate}} answer. You can give me no answer probably without {{a good deal of}} thought. I'VE thought a good deal--otherwise I wouldn't speak. I only want to put something <b>before</b> <b>you</b> and <b>leave</b> it there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{ways of the}} transgressors are hard," [...] he replied, {{pointing}} still {{towards the}} gate. [...] "If you'd come here in shame and humiliation, if you'd come here as one as had learnt the truth, you'd have found me all that you sought. But you come here a very ignorant woman, Marcia, and <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> me a little harder than ever <b>before,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> the curses that choke my throat a little hotter, a little more murderous." ...|$|R
2500|$|Because {{the flight}} from Portland to Boston had been delayed, his bags {{did not make it}} onto Flight 11. Atta's bags were later {{recovered}} in Logan International Airport, and they contained airline uniforms, flight manuals, and other items. The luggage included a copy of Atta's will, written in Arabic, as well as a list of instructions, also in Arabic, such as [...] "make an oath to die and renew your intentions", [...] "you should feel complete tranquility, because the time between you and your marriage in heaven is very short", and [...] "check your weapon <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> and long <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave.</b> You must make your knife sharp and you must not discomfort your animal during the slaughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Police also {{discovered}} several documents on Talcott's body. [...] The documents included {{the letter from}} Mrs. Talcott's sister urging Talcott to act, a grand jury subpoena from the investigation of Moore, and quantities of advertising literature for Hydrox Ice Cream. [...] However, the item that drew the most attention in the press was a cryptic handwritten note that appeared to contain a threat against Talcott. [...] The note read, [...] "Friday, P.M. -- I will give you until tomorrow morning <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> the house to withdraw from this case or I will introduce [...] damaging evidence of six years ago." [...] Talcott's brother-in-law, George E. Repp, told police that he believed the note was Talcott's effort to record a threat made by Mrs. Talcott. [...] Repp described an angry encounter at the Talcott residence:"Talcott, in writing the threat, was but quoting the words of his own wife. [...] I was {{with them in the}} Talcott home the day before Talcott testified against Dr. Moore. Mrs. Talcott then threatened to reveal happenings of six years ago if he didn't drop out of Monroe's prosecution." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{not scared}} of dogs," [...] he explained, [...] "but {{that one of}} yours won't let me get about my own house. Besides, I guess he'd eat some of those Chinamen <b>before</b> morning if <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> him loose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} to wait, sir," [...] she replied. [...] "I have {{something}} important to say, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> add another line to your will. A little while since, I told you {{there was a second}} necessity connected with your present situation, which had not been provided for yet, but which must be provided for, when the time came. The time has come now. You have a serious difficulty to meet and conquer <b>before</b> <b>you</b> can <b>leave</b> your fortune to your cousin George." ...|$|R

5000|$|Charlie Brand of the Phoenix, Arizona band Miniature Tigers {{attended}} the school, {{and noted that}} his parents mistakenly initially {{thought it was a}} youth camp for troubled teens when they sent him there: [...] "It was bizarre because my family's not Scientologists. My parents thought it was for troubled teens. camp forced Scientology on you, and you had to go through the steps <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could <b>leave.</b> <b>You</b> had to use an E-Meter and study guides about all their beliefs." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, and {{the lamplight}} showed a darker hue than the bronze of frost and sun in his face. [...] "Miss Schuyler, I {{have never felt}} quite so mean <b>before,</b> and <b>you</b> will <b>leave</b> the rest to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{care not}} for reward," [...] said Louise; [...] "the deed will reward itself. But methinks to stay is more {{dangerous}} than to go. Let me stay, then, and nourish the unhappy Prince, and do you depart to bring help. If they kill me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> return, I <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> my poor lute, and pray you to be kind to my poor Charlot." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As you remark, {{the ideas}} and customs of our {{countries}} differ," [...] the Sicilian rejoined. [...] "Here a nobleman of my descent would consider it an everlasting shame to stand quietly on one side, and see the woman whom he worshiped become the bride of another man, and that man an alien. He would be esteemed, and justly, a coward. Let us waste no more words, Signor.
