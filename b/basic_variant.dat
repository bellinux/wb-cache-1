5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>variant</b> of the {{national}} flag is a plain white-and-red horizontal bicolor. A variant defaced with the coat of arms is restricted to official use abroad and at sea. Legal restrictions notwithstanding, the two variants are often treated as interchangeable in practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>variant.</b> 102–119 {{passengers}} {{dependent on}} seat pitch. To have used 16 RB.202 lift fans.|$|E
25|$|All early {{variants}} seated {{pilot in}} front and two passengers behind him, in common cabin. The first production variant was Mi-1, quickly replaced by improved Mi-1T, that carried extra operational equipment including full radio and blind-flying instruments, and had more reliable engine AI-26V. The next <b>basic</b> <b>variant</b> was the Mi-1A of 1957, with further increased reliability and provisions for one 160 l external fuel tank.|$|E
30|$|The {{trend of}} <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> was not {{consistent}} in two culture process (Fig.  2 b). In control cultures, <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> gradually decreased from day 8 {{and dropped to}} 22.6 % day 14. However, <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> contents in uridine added cultures was 28.7 % at day 14, which almost remained unchanged from day 8. The different trend made <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> in uridine added cultures increased significantly (p[*]<[*] 0.01).|$|R
30|$|Figure  5 b {{showed that}} other <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> {{maintained}} {{at a high}} level in uridine added culture, which reached 25.2 % at day 14. However, in control culture, other <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> contents gradually decreased since day 6, and dropped to 11.8 % at day 14, which was significantly lower than those in uridine added culture (p[*]<[*] 0.01). The contents of other <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> are of great importance in monoclonal production practice in which lysine residues can be removed in purification steps. From this perspective, uridine’s negative impacts on <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> were more considerable for fed-batch culture process development. Other <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> may caused by proline amidation, which is a further modification followed by lysine cleavage. As C-terminus of the heavy chain usually ends with the –P–G–K (proline–glycine–lysine) sequence, the exposed glycine would be further removed and proline would be amidated after the cleavage of lysine, resulting in the generation of <b>basic</b> <b>variants.</b> Therefore, other <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> increased as lysine variants decreased may due to proline amidation, and the further characterization work by peptide map is ongoing.|$|R

25|$|Ko fights {{proceed in}} a similar manner to those of Go, with the {{difference}} that captures and moves answered by captures aren't valid ko threats. Although snapbacks are not possible in the <b>basic</b> <b>variant</b> (as it is necessary to make a ko threat before any consecutive capture occurs), they can be explicitly allowed with an extra rule while retaining the property that all known forced cycles are impossible.|$|E
25|$|A new major variant, Mi-1M in 1957 {{introduced}} an enlarged cabin {{and the more}} powerful AI-26VF engine, which allowed the accommodation of three passengers on a bench behind the pilot. Cabin height increased from 1.22 to 1.26 m and width from 1.01 to 1.2 m. A noticeable difference was horizontal bottom windows line instead of slanted, with bigger rear side windows, and a less pointed fuselage nose. It could also be fitted with two external side capsules for the injured or mail. There were trials of an armed anti-tank variant Mi-1MU carried in 1961, being the first Soviet attack helicopter, {{but it did not}} enter production due to having a small payload and the cessation of production of the <b>basic</b> <b>variant.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It {{featured}} two fuel tanks, one of [...] {{under the}} floor, one of [...] beneath the passenger's seat. All civilian models {{also had to}} meet Army requirements, in case of wartime requisitioning. (This is also why a hardtop version was not available until 1993) The <b>basic</b> <b>variant</b> GAZ-69 has a pair of doors and usually has standard canvas top and upper sides; there are two seats in front and two folding benches for three passengers each on sides. The further variant GAZ-69A (UAZ-69A) has four doors, folding canvas top and two rows of seats.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> of the roadster.|$|R
30|$|Charge {{heterogeneity}} of mAb {{was caused by}} various PTMs and degradation happened in cell culture process. We have known that uridine made acidic <b>variants</b> decreased and <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> increased. In this part, we did further investigations on mAb’s glycosylation, aggregation and glycation levels to discuss the reason why uridine made acidic variants decreased, and in next part we discussed uridine’s effects on <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> {{from the perspective of}} lysine variants.|$|R
30|$|Main {{species is}} the major peak shown on CEX chromatogram, which is {{generally}} determined by the contents of acidic <b>variants</b> and <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> of the mAb. As uridine’s inhibitory effect on acidic variants and promotion effect on <b>basic</b> <b>variants,</b> main species content had a slight increase (2.7 %) by uridine feeding. Figure  2 d showed the CEX chromatograph of mAbs produced by two fed-batch cultures on day 14.|$|R

In this paper we consider the geometric version of the problem, where all points in a Euclidean space are candidates for network nodes. We present the first general approach for geometric versions of <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> of the buy-at-bulk network design problem. It enables us to obtain quasi-polynomial-time approximation schemes for <b>basic</b> <b>variants</b> of the buy-at-bulk geometric network design problem with polynomial total demand. Then, for instances with few sinks and low capacity links, we design very fast polynomial-time low-constant approximations algorithms...|$|R
