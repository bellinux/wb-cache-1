5|$|At a {{time when}} non-Brahmins in other parties were {{gradually}} coming over to the Justice Party, <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> up with the Brahmin's methods and {{ways of dealing with}} political questions, it was nothing short of folly to think of admitting him into the ranks of the Justice Party.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} 75 million years, plants evolved {{a range of}} more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving, and it <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> upon. Hole feeding and skeletonization are {{recorded}} in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding evolving {{by the end of}} that period.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E

5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although {{the rest of the}} radar used Vacuum tubes. The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, was used to test the ability of the system.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine. The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been very fond of eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness.|$|E

5|$|The egg is {{generally}} oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In {{the case of}} solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> regularly while it grows. The nest varies from {{a hole in the}} ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E
5|$|The flight {{instruments}} in the B.1 were traditional and included G4B compasses; Mk.4 artificial horizons; and zero reader flight display instruments. The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot. In the B.2, these features were incorporated into the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ARI 5959 Terrain-following radar (TFR), built by General Dynamics, its commands <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> into the director-horizons.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a young lawyer <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more {{satisfying}} career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which {{is the subject of}} the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch.|$|E

40|$|Antennas of {{broadband}} and multi-band operation are presented. A broadband planar antenna {{includes two}} inverted-L antennas (ILAs) {{facing each other}} across a gap. One of the ILAs is input fed, {{and the other is}} electromagnetically coupled. The positioning of the gap affects the bandwidth. A dual-band planar antenna includes two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs <b>being</b> input <b>fed,</b> and the other being coupled. This dual-band planar antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed between the two ILAs. A triple-band planar antenna includes two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs <b>being</b> input <b>fed</b> and the other IPA being coupled. This triple-band antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed between the two ILAs, and a conductor extending horizontally from the monopole antenna towards, but not reaching the coupled ILA. Another dual-band antenna includes an inner cut loop antenna encompassed by an outer cut loop antenna. Each of the cut loop antennas includes two ILAs with one of the ILAs <b>being</b> input <b>fed</b> and the other being coupled. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|Feral {{cats are}} {{domestic}} cats that {{were born in}} or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas. The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60million. Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food. Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats {{at some of these}} sites <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> and given medical attention by volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Finn {{wakes up}} to {{discover}} that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife {{and he is now}} the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint that reality is not what it seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{planned to}} have the K-25 plant in full {{production}} by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic, and felt that, barring a miracle, it {{would be unlikely to}} reach that point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> into the electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945.|$|E

50|$|The lake, <b>being</b> glacially <b>fed,</b> {{does not}} reach its crest until {{mid to late}} June. When it is full, it {{reflects}} a distinctive shade of blue. The color {{is due to the}} refraction of light off the rock flour deposited in the lake on a continual basis.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum or {{copper strip}} casting: Commercial twin-belt {{continuous}} strip casting machines {{are capable of}} producing as-cast dimensions from 10-35 mm thick, and up to 2035 mm wide. After <b>being</b> directly <b>fed</b> into a hot rolling mill, the as-cast strip is typically rolled down to 1-3 mm thickness strip.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific swift {{is found}} {{in a wide range}} of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in {{sheltered}} locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> by metabolising body fat.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} {{the risk of}} contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), <b>being</b> <b>fed</b> an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Palmer {{was arrested}} on the charge of murder and forgery (a {{creditor}} had told the police his suspicions that Palmer had been forging his mother's signature) and detained at Stafford Gaol; he threatened to go on hunger strike, but backed down when the governor informed him that this would lead to his <b>being</b> force <b>fed.</b>|$|R
