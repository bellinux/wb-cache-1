However, in the 1990 season when he came back he found that he had become more powerful than before his injury, and in December 1990, he celebrated his first European cup victory in sprint in Hochfilzen. One week later he participated in his first world cup relay. He was soon rewarded <b>B-status</b> and because of success in the German Championship in 1992 he qualified for the world cup in Pokljuka in December 1992.|$|E
30|$|Results: In all patients, primary MTC was histologically {{verified}} post-surgery. 29 out of 33 patients showed increased DOPA-Decarboxylase {{activity in}} the primary tumor (Sens.: 88  %; mean SUVmax: 10, 3). Undetected tumors were exclusively staged pT 1 a. Lymph node staging showed a sens./spec./acc./ppv/npv of 65  %/ 100  %/ 79  %/ 100  %/ 65  % (P[*]<[*] 0, 001). Pre-surgical cN 1 <b>b-status</b> in [18 F]Fluoro-DOPA-PET/CT was predictive for postsurgical persistently elevated calcitonin levels (sens. 85  %, spec. 90  %, ppv 85  %; P[*]<[*] 0.001), as well as pre-surgical basal calcitonin levels with an AUC of 0.84 (P[*]=[*] 0.009). SUV-parameters did not show any significance in that matter.|$|E
