40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} aerodynamic mistuning {{in the context of}} a structurally coupled blade system. The aerodynamic mistuning assumes a difference in blade loading (between adjacent blades) but no change in eigenfrequency or modeshape. Thus, emphasis is placed on the profile shape impact of transonic rotor blades on aeroelasic damping. An example aeroelasic calculation of the proposed mistuning strategy is present for a coupled <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The impact of mistuning compared to the tuned datum profile is discussed. It is shown that there exist significant differences for the two configurations but that the net impact of mistuning is small for the coupled system investigated compared to a freestanding blade design...|$|E

40|$|Flow {{non-uniformity}} at {{the discharge}} of high power density impellers can result in significant unsteady interactions between impeller blades and downstream diffuser vanes. These interactions result in degradation of both performance and pump reliability. The MSFC Pump Technology Team has {{recognized the importance of}} resolving this problem and has thus initiated the development and testing of a high head coefficient impeller. One of the primary goals of this program is to improve impeller performance and discharge flow uniformity. The objective of the present work is complimentary. Flow uniformity and performance gains were sought through the application of a tandem <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The approach adopted was to numerically establish flow characteristics at the impeller discharge for the baseline MSFC impeller and then parametrically evaluate tandem blade configurations. A tandem design was sought that improves both impeller performance and discharge uniformity. The Navier-Stokes solver AEROVISC was used to conduct the study. Grid embedding is used to resolve local gradients while attempting to minimize model size. Initial results indicate that significant gains in flow uniformity can be achieved through the tandem blade concept and that blade clocking rather than slot location is the primary driver for flow uniformity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} predicting the reference minimum-loss incidence and deviation angles of a <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement</b> with splitter vanes, which is probably a solution for future ultra-highly loaded axial compressor designs. The motivation of the modeling is to guide the blading design in splittered compressor design processes where the additional splitter vanes must be specially considered. The development of the model {{is based on a}} blade performance database from systematic numerical simulations. Basic correlations of the model are firstly proposed, which consider dominant blade geometry parameters related to blade loading, including camber angle and solidity. Secondly, geometric and aerodynamic corrections about orientation parameter, blade maximum thickness, inlet Mach number, and three-dimensional (3 D) effects are empirically incorporated into the basic correlations. Eventually, a subsonic 3 D splittered rotor is designed using the correlations coupled with the corrections obtained from the validation of the model. The results indicate that the model is able to achieve a good agreement within an error band of ± 1. 0 ° for the predictions of both reference minimum-loss incidence and deviation angles, and the rotor designed using the model accomplishes the desired work input and flow deflection...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} presented for a two-dimensional simulation {{of the gas}} flow field and of the dynamic behavior of lignite particles inside Beater Wheel mills with classifier, installed in large coal-fired plants. A large number of representative particles are tracked using Lagrangian equations of motion, in combination with a stochastic model for particle turbulent dispersion. All the important mechanisms associated with the particle motion through the mill (particle-surface collisions and rebounding phenomena, fuel moisture evaporation and erosion wear of internal surfaces) are modeled. A special model is constructed to simulate the fragmentation of impacting particles and to calculate the size distribution of the final mill product. The models are regulated {{on the basis of}} available data from grinding mills of the Greek lignite power stations. The numerical code is capable of predicting the locations of significant erosion and to estimate the amount of particle mass that circulates through the mill via the classifying chamber. Mean impact velocity and impingement angle distributions along all the internal surfaces are also provided. The results indicate remarkable differences in the extent of the erosion caused at different locations of the mill. Also, the significant role of the leading <b>blades</b> <b>arrangement</b> inside the classifier on its classification performance and efficiency is elucidated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the blades of multi-bladed water-pumping windmills {{when they have}} variable mass and centre of mass. The paper explores <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement</b> strategies that will minimize the eccentricity of the rotor centre of mass and hence any rotor-induced vibration. The number of blades in the rotor is assumed to equal the number made in each production batch, {{in contrast to the}} case where a batch of up to 22 blades was optimally matched to produce two- and three-bladed rotors, Hitz & Wood [1]. Using the measured mass and centre of mass of 24 blades for the rotor of a 26 ft Kijito windmill described by Harries [3], three strategies are considered. Random matching of the blades is shown to become increasingly effective as blade number increases. Pairing the blades by ordering in the product of mass and centre of mass, d, followed by random selection of pairs also produces rotors with low eccentricities. The numerical experiments show that the best strategy involving random selection is to pair by ordering, swapping the blades of every second pair, and then randomly arrange the resulting pairs. Finally, a heuristic based on blade pairing is shown to give eccentricities which are high compared to the minimum value determined exactly for 12 blades or less, but apparently low enough to be useful...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the procedure, approach and Rocketdyne CFD {{results for the}} optimization of the NASA consortium impeller design. Two different approaches have been investigated. The first one {{is to use a}} tandem <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the main impeller blade is split into two separate rows with the second blade row offset circumferentially with respect to the first row. The second approach is to control the high losses related to secondary flows within the impeller passage. Many key parameters have been identified and each consortium team member involved will optimize a specific parameter using 3 -D CFD analysis. Rocketdyne has provided a series of CFD grids for the consortium team members. SECA will complete the tandem blade study, SRA will study the effect of the splitter blade solidity change, NASA LeRC will evaluate the effect of circumferential position of the splitter blade, VPI will work on the hub to shroud blade loading distribution, NASA Ames will examine the impeller discharge leakage flow impacts and Rocketdyne will continue to work on the meridional contour and the blade leading to trailing edge work distribution.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a model of}} the fouling mechanism and the evaluation of compressor washing on line. The results of this research were obtained from experimental and computational models. The experimental model analyzed the localization of the particle deposition on the blade surface and the change of the surface roughness condition. The design of the test rig was based on the cascade <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement</b> and blade aerodynamics. The results of the experiment demonstrated that fouling occurred on both surfaces of the blade. This mechanism mainly affected the leading edge region of the blade. The increment of the surface roughness on this region was 1. 0 μm. This result was used to create the CFD model (FLUENT). According to the results of the CFD, fouling reduced the thickness of the boundary layer region and increased the drag force of the blade. The model of fouling was created based on the experiment and CFD results and was used to calculate the engine performance in the simulation code (TURBOMATCH). The engine performance results demonstrated that in five days fouling can affect the overall efficiency by 3. 5 %. The evaluation of the compressor washing on line was based on the experimental tests and simulation of the engine performance. This system demonstrated that it could recover 99 % of the original blade surface. In addition, this system was evaluated in a study case of a Power Plant, where it proved itself to be a techno-economic way to recover the power of the engine due to fouling. The model of the fouling mechanism presented in this work was validated by experimental tests, CFD models and information from real engines. However, for further applications of the model, it would be necessary to consider the specific conditions of fouling in each new environment.

40|$|Use of self {{actuated}} {{leading edge}} spoilers is virtually unknown on wind turbine <b>blades.</b> A simple <b>arrangement</b> has been devised and implemented on a 7. 5 metre diameter medium solidity rotor. The leading edge {{portion of the}} blade in outer one-third span is mounted offset like an auxiliary airfoil {{with respect to the}} trailing edge portion. The latter is a fixed piece where as the lending edge portion is supported on springs to enable its flap-like movement. This movement is adequately dampened with the help of dashpots. In low and moderate wind speeds the auxiliary airfoil remains undeflected and thereby generates a higher overall lift for the blade. In higher wind speeds the airfoil deflects in a manner of getting progressively stalled and thus providing control on rotor overspeeding. This movement is self actuated and appears quite stable. Further analytical and wind tunnel studies are recommended to exploit full potential of such an arrangement which is inexpensive and appears appropriate atleast respect of small wind turbines...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} order to better understand the augmentation of forced convective heat transfer when a single row of counter-rotating vortex blades is attached to a flat surface. The major emphasis of the work is to study the way in which vortex generators augment the heat transfer coefficient of an initially-laminar boundary layer over a flat, constant-heat-flux surface exposed to favorable free-stream pressure gradients. Particular emphasis is placed on the relationship between the geometry of vortex generators and the augmentation of local and overall heat transfer coefficients. The behavior of the boundary layer downstream of vortex generators is partially explored;This dissertation includes results of an experimental investigation that indicates the amount of heat transfer enhancement depends on the vortex <b>blade</b> height and <b>arrangement</b> on the plate surface. The local enhancement of heat transfer coefficient was increased up to 300 % over that for a plain flat plate mainly because of high turbulence produced over the region adjacent to the plate surface, resulting in increased mixing of the slower fluid near the plate surface with the free stream. A set of guidelines for the design of more efficient surface with vortex generators was proposed...|$|R
40|$|Pioneering {{studies of}} lead (Pb) {{concentrations}} in polar ice by Clair C. Patterson and co-workers (e. g. Murozumi et al., 1969; Boutron and Patterson, 1983, 1986) revealed important information on climatic changes dating {{many thousands of}} years in the past and the effect that humans have had on these pristine environments. Rosman and co-workers (e. g. Rosman et al., 1993, 1994 a) extended this research utilising the isotopic composition of Pb preserved in the ice to identify the source regions of both natural and anthropogenic Pb transported to the polar regions, thereby adding significantly to the understanding of atmospheric transport mechanisms and the impact of continental anthropogenic activity on the pristine polar environments. This thesis extends this area of research by investigating seasonal and short-term variability in Pb, Ba and In concentrations and Pb isotopes through the accurate sectioning of decontaminated glacial ice cores at high spatial resolution. This improves our understanding of the processes impacting on the deep ice core records, which, in turn, expands the interpretation and application of these records. A new sample preparation technique, incorporating a mechanised circular saw <b>blade</b> <b>arrangement</b> into the lathe design, first described by Candelone et al. (1994), has been developed to sample glacial ice cores at high spatial resolution with minimal contamination. This technique was extensively tested using artificially made ice cores, prepared from ultra-pure water, to quantify and minimise the Pb, Ba and In contamination associated with the process. The residual contamination in each inner core slice from the procedure amounted to 0. 2 ± 0. 2 pg Pb with [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb, [superscript] 208 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb and [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 204 Pb ratios of 1. 16 ± 0. 12, 2. 35 ± 0. 16 and 15. 3 ± 6. 7 respectively, 1. 5 ± 0. 4 pg Ba and 0. 6 ± 2. 0 fg In. This technique was then utilised to obtain high resolution analyses of Pb, Ba and In concentrations, and Pb isotopes in ice core sections recovered from Law Dome, East Antarctica and from the East Rongbuk Glacier on the northern slope of Mount Everest in the Himalaya. Law Dome, East Antarctic Holocene ice cores provide strong evidence for the transport of anthropogenic Pb from Australia to the Law Dome environment during the late 19 th century, with [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb and [superscript] 208 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios as low as 1. 061 ± 0. 001 and 2. 339 ± 0. 002 respectively, in close agreement with the Pb isotopic characteristics of Australian Broken Hill Pb ores. The onset of anthropogenic pollution of the Law Dome environment occurred in spring 1889 AD, associated with the onset of Pb ore smelting activities in Port Pirie, South Australia. Seasonal variability is most clearly seen in anthropogenic Pb and Ba (as a proxy for mineral dust) concentrations where peaks in concentrations generally occur in the autumn and spring periods, with consistently low concentrations during winter. Lead isotopic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios are inversely correlated with residual (anthropogenic + crustal) Pb concentrations with the lowest ratios occurring during periods of high Pb concentrations. The observed seasonal variability is associated with the annual cycle in position and strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Trough, a region of low pressure situated off the coast of Antarctica, which moves closest to the Antarctic coast and increases in strength during the autumn and spring seasons. Concurrently, a strengthening of the Southern Ocean westerlies entrains and transports more atmospheric impurities from continental regions such as Australia. The low Pb concentrations and relatively more radiogenic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios that appear in the winter layers are indicators of aerosol inputs into the Law Dome environment from a well mixed Southern Hemisphere atmospheric background. Law Dome deep ice core sections, sampled at short-term resolution, show variability in all measured species over time indicating a general instability in temperature (as indicated by δ 18 O compositions) and environmental conditions (as indicated by elemental concentrations) prevailing during the periods of time integrated by the ice. Based on Pb isotopic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios, which reach values of 1. 225 ± 0. 004 and 1. 230 ± 0. 003 in glacial, and last glacial – Holocene transition ice respectively, noticeable volcanic Pb contributions are found to occur in both time periods, reaching as high as ~ 39 % and ~ 46 % respectively. These increases are associated with a decrease in mineral dust concentrations due to relatively warmer climatic conditions prevailing within the times integrated by the ice core sections. A link between temperature and environmental conditions in glacial ice is observed when changes in δ 18 O compositions (as a proxy for temperature) exceed 0. 24 ‰. In contrast, there is no link between temperature and environmental conditions during the last glacial – Holocene transition period, demonstrating a complicated climatic and environmental state existing at Law Dome at this time that incorporates aspects of both cold and warm climates. The high spatial resolution sectioning of continental glacial ice cores recovered from the East Rongbuk Glacier on the northern slopes of Mount Everest, and dated to the 18 th and 20 th centuries, has similarly shown variability in all measured species over time. Elemental Pb, Ba and In concentrations are very well correlated in all ice core sections confirming the environment of the East Rongbuk Glacier, within the investigated time periods, to be strongly controlled by the input of mineral dust. Isotopic [superscript] 206 Pb/[superscript] 207 Pb ratios in 18 th century ice range from 1. 18 – 1. 21 which are attributed to a natural mineral dust background devoid of any influences of anthropogenic [or volcanic] activity. During 18 th century monsoon periods (when mineral dust concentrations are generally low), local Himalayan material plays an important role on crustal inputs into the sampling region, with some inputs of Indian derived material possibly sourced to the Indian Peninsula, and Trans-Himalayan belt/Lhasa block material sourced to locations slightly north of Mount Everest. During non-monsoon periods (when mineral dust concentrations are generally high), it is likely that mineral dust from regions in northern Africa and central Asia are impacting on the high altitude Himalaya, with some possible contributions from the arid regions in north-western India and local Himalayan material. Based on elemental (Pb/Ba) and Pb isotopic ratios, there is no indication ofanthropogenic [or volcanic] Pb contributions in the 20 th century East RongbukGlacier ice core samples indicating that, prior to 1952 AD, the high altitude samplingsite was isolated from the effects of anthropogenic Pb pollution. Consequently, inthe 20 th century, Pb transported to the East Rongbuk Glacier site is sourced tomineral dust. An increase in elemental concentrations is observed in 20 th century ice,indicating increased mineral dust deposition relative to the 18 th century. Concurrently, a marked change in the isotopic characteristics of 20 th century ice coredata, relative to 18 th century ice core data, is observed, with a clear segregation ofmonsoon and non-monsoon data and the transition of 20 th century data to lessradiogenic values. This adjustment likely reflects environmental changes that haveoccurred from the 18 th to the 20 th centuries...|$|E
