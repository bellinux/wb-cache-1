5000|$|In contrast, many bicycle tyres {{made for}} street use are slick. Aquaplaning does not present {{a problem for}} {{bicycles}} due to their narrower width, higher pressure, lower speed, and circular cross section (due {{to the need to}} lean the bicycle in turns); the <b>bicycle</b> <b>tyre</b> can penetrate the water layer to contact the road much more easily. In practice, grooved bicycle tyres do not outperform slick tyres on wet roads. However, many low and medium performance bicycle tyres have substantial tread depth, because the bicycles are designed with off-road excursions in mind: in dirt, gravel or sand, the tread pattern provides significantly improved traction. In addition, high-performance bicycle tyres, although designed for road use only, often have a very fine tread pattern, which appears to provide no difference in performance versus a slick tyre and is only there for marketing purposes and as a tyre-wear indicator. This is clear not only from direct testing of tyres, but also {{from the fact that the}} texture of the road is itself coarser than the minimal tread pattern on these tyres. Some grooveless designs have small [...] "holes" [...] or dimples embedded in the tread as a tyre-wear indicator. This is similar to automobile tyre-wear indicator bars, which contact the road when the tyre is worn to a low tread amount, making the tyre noisy on the road.|$|E
5000|$|In 1886, 33-year-old Andre Michelin {{abandoned}} {{his career as}} a successful Parisian engineer to take over his grandfather's failing agricultural goods and farm equipment business. Established in 1832,"Michelin et Cie" [...] suffered from neglect and {{was on the verge of}} insolvency following the founder's death. Michelin's grandfather had started the company that sold farm equipment and an odd assortment of vulcanized rubber products, such as belts, valves and pipes. As soon as Andre took the helm of the company, he recruited his younger brother Edouard to join him at the company. Edouard was named the company's managing director. While duly committed to the success of the business, neither brother had any prior experience selling goods or had the slightest idea where to even begin.In 1889, a cyclist familiar with the Michelin Company approached Edouard with his flat tyre seeking assistance. Getting a flat tyre frequently meant cyclists were left stranded for hours. In the late 1880s, cycling was becoming a popular form of transportation and hobby due in large part to John Dunlop's 1888 patent for the inflatable <b>bicycle</b> <b>tyre.</b> Before Dunlop's invention, bicycle tyres were made out of solid rubber. The solid rubber tyres tended to provide little traction and made for a difficult and uncomfortable ride. After the hapless cyclist approached the Michelin Company for assistance, Edouard took great interests in the new pneumatic tyres. The Michelins recognized that there would be a great demand for pneumatic tyres if only there was a way to more quickly make repairs. They reasoned that first the wheel must become detachable. Edouard conducted a series of experiments and developed a number of prototypes. In 1891, he was granted a patent for a detachable tire.|$|E
