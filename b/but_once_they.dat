5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full <b>but,</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E

25|$|Turner's {{college career}} {{was a rather}} {{turbulent}} one. He first played with Orange County Community College but his brash, flash style didn't enamour him to his coach. On one road trip, Turner and a teammate got into a scuffle after that player knocked Turner's tray in a fast-food joint. The coach told Turner to cool it <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> got back on campus, Turner exacted retribution. The next day when the coach saw that teammate sporting a black eye, he summoned Turner to his office and kicked him off the team.|$|E
25|$|The nest {{is always}} {{part of a}} colony but there is never more than one nest in a tree. Sometimes the colony can cover quite {{extensive}} areas with a single nest in each tree (usually juniper, live oak or pine). There are usually 3–4 eggs laid, quite early in the season. Incubation is usually 16 days. The male bird normally brings food near to the nest, and the female flies to him to receive it and take back to the nest to feed the chicks that fledge around 3 weeks later. Young are normally fed only by their parents, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> reach near-fledging size they can sometimes receive a meal from any passing member of the colony, which can continue for some time after leaving the nest.|$|E

25|$|On 25 April 1813, Foy left Bilbao {{with his}} own, Sarrut's and Palombini's divisions, {{altogether}} over 11,000 troops, and reached Castro Urdiales that evening. The port was defended by 1,000 Spanish soldiers under Pedro Alvarez {{and supported by}} three British sloops, Lyra (10), Royalist (18) and Sparrow (16). The French took several days to bring up heavy cannons, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> opened fire, the town walls were quickly breached. On the night of 11 May, the French stormed the town. While many of the attackers indulged themselves in rape and looting, the British ships successfully evacuated most of the garrison. Both sides lost about 180 casualties. On 30 May, Foy cornered a battalion of Spanish irregulars, killing 200 and capturing 360. Two other guerilla forces were caught but they managed to slip away with minor losses.|$|E
25|$|Piecing {{involved}} repairing sporadic yarn breakages. At the rollers, {{the broken}} yarn would be {{caught on the}} underclearer (or fluker rod on Bolton mules), while at the spindle it would knot itself into a whorl on the spindle tip. If the break happened on the winding stroke the spindle {{might have to be}} stopped while the thread was found. The number of yarn breakages was dependent {{on the quality of the}} roving, and quality cotton led to fewer breakages. Typical 1,200 spindle mules of the 1920s would experience 5 to 6 breakages a minute. The two piecers would thus need to repair the thread within 15 to 20 seconds while the mule was in motion <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> had the thread it took under three seconds. The repair actually involved a slight rolling of the forefinger against the thumb.|$|E
25|$|In May 1945, {{they were}} {{transferred}} to II Australian Corps and transported to Torokina {{to take part in}} the Bougainville Campaign. Their deployment had been delayed by lack of shipping, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> had arrived the regiment was assigned to the 3rd Division, and was allocated to support the 15th Brigade's advance towards the main Japanese base around Buin in the south. The regiment was heavily engaged between mid-May and early July when the Australian offensive came to an end amidst heavy rain and during this time the three batteries together fired over 18,000 rounds. Fire missions undertaken in this time included the provision of counter-battery and preparatory fires, and support to patrol operations with each of the regiment's batteries being individually assigned to one of the 15th Brigade's three infantry battalions. To ensure accurate support was provided forward observation officers were assigned to infantry patrols during this time; fires were also directed by spotter planes.|$|E

25|$|The {{species is}} known to undergo a dietary shift as it grows to adulthood. Young {{individuals}} less than 10cm in length consume considerable volumes of copepods and minor amounts of polychaetes, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> reach around 10cm, the diet shifts to a polychaete-dominated one. Further growth sees {{an increase in the}} volume of amphipods, small fish and oligochaetes taken. These changes appear to be unrelated to mouth morphology, instead the fish becomes more mobile and possesses a larger mouth {{to be able to take}} these prey. The yellowfin whitings' diet also varies spatially and temporally, which appears to be a function of prey availability at different sites and periods of the year. There is little resource partitioning between the small individuals of sillaginids which inhabit shallow inshore habitats, with Sillago vittata, S. burrus and Sillaginodes punctatus also taking copepods as their primary prey in southwest Western Australia. This changes as each species grows, with S. vittata and S burrus moving to deeper waters to avoid interspecific competition, whilst the remaining S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctatus partition the resources, with S. punctatus consuming more decapods and shrimps.|$|E
25|$|Campbell Island is a sub Antarctic island 700km {{south of}} New Zealand that became infested with rats in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, {{including}} the Campbell teal and Campbell snipe, only survived on small rocky islets {{just off the}} island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for ex-situ conservation, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island {{was one of the}} most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113km2, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of bird strike for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. Snipe have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.|$|E
25|$|Like other macaques, rhesus troops {{comprise}} {{a mixture of}} 20–200 males and females. Females may outnumber the males by a ratio of 4:1. Males and females both have separate hierarchies. Female philopatry, common among social mammals, has been extensively studied in rhesus macaques. Females tend not to leave the social group, and have highly stable matrilineal hierarchies in which a female’s rank {{is dependent on the}} rank of her mother. In addition, a single group may have multiple matrilineal lines existing in a hierarchy, and a female outranks any unrelated females that rank lower than her mother. Rhesus macaques are unusual in that the youngest females tend to outrank their older sisters. This is likely because young females are more fit and fertile. Mothers seem to prevent the older daughters from forming coalitions against her. The youngest daughter is the most dependent on the mother, and would have nothing to gain from helping her siblings in overthrowing their mother. Since each daughter had a high rank in her early years, rebelling against her mother is discouraged. Juvenile male macaques also exist in matrilineal lines, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> reach four to five years of age, they are driven out of their natal groups by the dominant male. Thus, adult males gain dominance by age and experience.|$|E

25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Mega Man Legends 2 is {{very similar}} to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions. Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.|$|E

500|$|Prior to 2009, most games {{released}} on Steam had traditional anti-piracy measures, including the assignment {{and distribution of}} product keys and support for digital rights management software tools such as SecuROM or non-malicious rootkits. With an update to the Steamworks SDK in March 2009, Valve added its [...] "Custom Executable Generation" [...] (CEG) approach into the Steamworks SDK that removed the need for these other measures. The CEG technology creates a unique, encrypted copy of the game's executable files for the given user which allows them to install it multiple times and on multiple devices, and make backup copies of their software. Once the software is downloaded and installed, the user must then authenticate through Steam to de-encrypt the executable files to play the game. Normally this is done while connected to the Internet following the user's credential validation, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>they</b> have logged into Steam once, a user can instruct Steam to launch in a special offline mode {{to be able to}} play their games without a network connection. Developers are not limited to Steam's CEG and may include other forms of DRM and other authentication services than Steam; for example, some titles from publisher Ubisoft require the use of their UPlay gaming service, and prior to its shutdown in 2014, some other titles required Games for Windows– Live, though many of these titles have since transitioned to using the Steamworks CEG approach.|$|E
