40|$|Summary–main findings. Legal {{framework}} A new framework {{consisting of}} regulations and guidelines for opioid substitution treatment of heroin addicts, as {{laid down in}} the Act relating to specialist health services, entered into force on 1 February 2010. The new framework is intended to contribute to equal provision of opioid substi- tution treatment throughout the country, and to help to integrate such treatment {{with the rest of}} the health service. The age limit no longer ap- plies, but before someone is offered opioid sub- stitution treatment, an assessment must always be carried out of whether the patient will benefit from treatment without such medication. The Health Personnel Act and the Act relating to specialist health services were amended with effect from 2010. The amendments, which concern the follow-up of children as family members, have strengthened children’s legal status and ensured that minor children of parents with mental illness, drug/alcohol dependency, serious somatic illnesses or injuries receive better follow-up when their parents receive medical help. In 2010, the Norwegian Medicines Agency has added eleven new drugs to the list of narcotic substances, cf. the Regulations relating to narcotics. These are: GBL, 1, 4 –butandiol, fenazepam, <b>Bentazepam,</b> Bk-MBDB, Bromo-Dragonfly, 4 -fluoride amphetamine, mCPP, MBDB, mephedrone and PMMA. With the exception of mCPP, all the drugs were previously covered by the derivative rule in the same regulation...|$|E
