5|$|The {{temperature}} of a beer has {{an influence on}} a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength pale ale to be served cool, while a strong <b>barley</b> <b>wine</b> or imperial stout to be served at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv <b>barley</b> <b>wine</b> made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Rose would {{occasionally}} sexually abuse the girl herself, and would later take extreme gratification in degrading {{the child with}} acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. From the age of 13, both Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Nonetheless, Rose was always present {{in the room when}} these acts occurred, to ensure the girl did not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged either 13 or 14, Rose took the girl to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of <b>barley</b> <b>wine.</b> Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once the trio had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked the girl the question: [...] "Do you think you could be my friend?"

5000|$|Through {{the latter}} part of the 20th century, most British brewers used a {{standard}} design of bottle, known as the London Brewers' Standard. This was in brown glass, with a conical medium neck in the pint and with a rounded shoulder in the half-pint and nip sizes. Pints, defined as 568 ml, and half-pints, or 284 ml were the most common, but some brewers also bottled in nip (1/3-pint) and quart (2-pint) sizes. It was for example mostly <b>barley</b> <b>wines</b> that were bottled in nips, and Midlands breweries such as Shipstone of Nottingham that bottled in quarts. This standardisation simplified the automation of bottling and made it easier for customers to recycle bottles as they were interchangeable. They carried a deposit charge, which in the 1980s rose to seven pence for a pint and five pence for a half-pint. Some brewers however used individual bottle designs: among these were Samuel Smith, which used an [...] clear bottle, and Scottish and Newcastle, which used a clear bottle for their Newcastle Brown Ale (both designs survive in the 500 ml size today). Other brewers such as Timothy Taylor had used their own embossed bottles and rare examples continued to be reused into the 1980s. During the 1980s the industry turned away from refillable bottles and UK beer bottles are now all one-trip, and most are 500 ml (16.9 U.S. fl oz; 17.6 imp fl oz) or 330 ml in volume. The compulsory high recycled-content of these bottles makes them very dark and the lack of temper makes them chip easily when being opened.|$|R

50|$|The {{contents}} of the tomb, which were largely banquet furnishings, must {{have been used for}} the ceremony. Analysis of the food and drink residues produced the menu of the funerary banquet. The feast included a spicy stew, made with barbecued sheep or goat, honey, wine, olive oil, and most likely lentils, seasoned with anise or fennel. The small bronze cauldrons that sat in the tops of the serving stands had contained a mixed fermented beverage of grape <b>wine,</b> <b>barley</b> beer, and honey mead. The beverage served at the king’s funeral has been reconstructed by Dogfish Head Brewery as the award-winning “Midas Touch,” which is now widely available. This collaborative research allowed the funeral ceremony before the burial to be reconstructed in a painting by Greg Harlin.|$|R
2500|$|The majordomo {{referred}} to in the surviving fuero may have been [...] "a local estate manager rather than the count's household official". This person was also in charge of organising the annual boon work of the settlers and was responsible for supplying them with food and drink during that period. This boon work consisted in three operationes, as they are called in the surviving charter: two for sowing and one for either threshing or ploughing in Ponce's fields. The tenants also owed Ponce tribute or rent in the form of one cahiz each of wheat and barley per field and portions of the produce of their vineyards and orchards. They also owed yantar (hospitality). The fuero of Azaña contains one of the best surviving descriptions of this practice from the twelfth century, and it also indicates Ponce's expectation of continued itinerancy between his various properties and tenancies. The settlers were required each year to prepare a feast for him or his wife and their retinues, although their sons, daughters, or grandchildren could be sent in their place. The amount of produce to be used for these feasts is specified: three rams, one pig, twelve hens, 160 loaves of bread, and large quantities of <b>barley</b> and <b>wine.</b> If none of Ponce's kin attended in a given year, the settlers were exempted from the tribute, which is what the meal was taken to be. Ponce has been described as an [...] "absentee landlord with a vengeance", although no different from his fellow twelfth-century European aristocrats.|$|R

500|$|By {{the last}} quarter of the 11th century, the Byzantine navy was a shadow of its former self, having {{declined}} through neglect, the incompetence of its officers, and lack of funds. Kekaumenos, writing in c. 1078, laments that [...] "on the pretext of reasonable patrols, [...] are doing nothing else but ferrying wheat, <b>barley,</b> pulse, cheese, <b>wine,</b> meat, olive oil, a great deal of money, and anything else" [...] from the islands and coasts of the Aegean, while they [...] "flee [...] before they have even caught sight of them, and thus become an embarrassment to the Romans". By the time Kekaumenos wrote, new and powerful adversaries had risen. In the West, the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, which had expelled the Byzantines from Southern Italy and had conquered Sicily, was now casting its eye on the Byzantine Adriatic coasts and beyond. In the East, the disastrous Battle of Manzikert in 1071 had resulted in the loss of Asia Minor, the Empire's military and economic heartland, to the Seljuk Turks, who by 1081 had established their capital at Nicaea, barely a hundred miles south of Constantinople. Soon after, Turkish as well as Christian pirates appeared in the Aegean. The Byzantine thematic fleets, which once policed the seas, were by then so depleted by neglect and the successive civil wars that they were incapable of responding effectively.|$|R
40|$|Documentary {{evidence}} and artistic representations have traditionally {{served as the}} primary sources of information about Byzantine diet. According to these sources, Byzantine diet was based on grain (primarily wheat and <b>barley),</b> oil, and <b>wine,</b> supplemented with legumes, dairy products, meat, and marine resources. Here, we synthesize and compare the results of stable isotope ratio analyses of eight Greek Byzantine populations (6 th- 15 th centuries AD) from throughout Greece. The delta(13) C and delta(15) N values are tightly clustered, suggesting {{that all of these}} populations likely consumed a broadly similar diet. Both inland and coastal Byzantine populations consumed an essentially land-based C(3) diet, significant amounts of animal protein, and possibly some C(4) plants, while no evidence of a general dependence on low-delta(15) N legumes was observed. One interesting result observed in the isotopic data is the evidence for the consumption of marine protein at both coastal sites (a reasonable expectation given their location) and for some individuals from inland sites. This pattern contrasts with previous isotopic studies mainly on prehistoric Greek populations, which have suggested that marine species contributed little, or not at all, to the diet. The possibility that fasting practices contributed to marine protein consumption in the period is discussed, as are possible parallels with published isotope data from western European medieval sites.
