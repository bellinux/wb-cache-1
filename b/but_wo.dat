30|$|For this study, we adopted two {{pressure}} values during {{the growth of}} WS 2 film in experiments: low pressure (<[*] 100  mTorr) and one atmospheric pressure (1  atm). Figure  2 c shows a SEM image of the sample prepared under a low-pressure environment. As we found, only leaf-like flakes were randomly distributed over the substrate, which were not WS 2 <b>but</b> <b>WO</b> 3, as was further confirmed by Raman characterization. Figure  2 d shows a SEM image of the sample grown under one atmospheric pressure. In contrast with Fig.  2 c, there were many triangular domains with size above 100  μm appearing on the substrate, which were WS 2 as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy. Such contrast experiments have been repeated many times, and every time, we got almost the same results. Compared with low-pressure mode, atmospheric pressure mode was more helpful to get a high yield of WS 2 flakes with large size and clear edges. As we know, CVD process generally includes two stages: (1) gas transportation and gas phase reaction and (2) surface adsorption and surface reaction. In both these two stages, collision process {{is a very important}} and robust factor. At one atmospheric pressure, the mean free path of gas molecules becomes shorter and the collision frequency gets higher (see Additional file  1). The higher collision frequency combined with high temperature and high flow rate usually lead to a higher reaction rate and a higher nucleation rate by promoting the chemical reaction between precursors or between precursor clusters and substrate. On the other hand, from the theory of thermodynamics, the chemical free-energy change ΔG (<[*] 0) is the driving force for nucleation. The critical free-energy change ΔG* could be regarded as an energy barrier of nucleation, which is inversely correlated with the gas pressure [20]. Therefore, the higher pressure in APCVD always leads to a smaller nucleation energy barrier, a higher nucleation rate, and a larger nucleation density than those in the case of low pressure CVD (LPCVD). So, the atmospheric pressure mode in our experiments is more favored in growing 2 D TMDC films.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that there is a {{striking}} difference in word order between Modern Japanese and Early Old Japanese. Early Old Japanese lacks the canonical transitive pattern [Subject-ga Object-o V]. The basic word order in Early Old Japanese is [Subject-ga/no Object-Ø V], in which the subject is marked by the genitive ga or no and a morphologically unmarked object must appear immediately adjacent to the verb. When the object is marked by wo, it is obligatorily moved over a subject, resulting in [Object-wo Subject-ga/no V]. Following Miyagawa (1989) and Miyagawa and Ekida (2003), I argue that a bare object is assigned abstract case under the strict adjacency requirement, <b>but</b> that <b>wo</b> in Early Old Japanese does not function as an accusative case. The particle wo differs crucially from the case particle o in Modern Japanese in that it marks not only the direct object of a transitive verb, but all kinds of internal arguments of both transitive and intransitive verbs. Furthermore, wo conveys a definite interpretation. An element marked by wo moves to a particular structural position, namely Spec(vP) or Spec(CP), where it is assigned definite/topic interpretations...|$|R
