5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known <b>bullet</b> exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent <b>bullet</b> can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the <b>bullet</b> before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the <b>bullet</b> and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable <b>bullet</b> time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue. When in use, the <b>bullet</b> time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables <b>bullet</b> time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the <b>bullet</b> time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although <b>Bullet</b> Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the <b>bullet</b> time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the <b>bullet</b> can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered <b>bullet.</b> By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of <b>bullet.</b> The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the <b>bullet,</b> and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the <b>bullet.</b> The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the <b>bullet</b> came from that particular weapon.|$|E

50|$|Frangible <b>bullets</b> {{striking}} animal targets create wounds {{similar to}} conventional <b>bullets.</b> Some penetrate soft tissue similar to {{full metal jacket}} <b>bullets.</b> Some may disintegrate upon striking bone. Hunting <b>bullets</b> include a frangible core designed to disintegrate when a protective jacket is opened by softer tissue or fluid. Frangible <b>bullets</b> disintegrating in flesh cause very serious wounds with persistent effects. Frangible <b>bullets</b> may damage or defeat personal armor intended to resist traditional lead <b>bullets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, the mono-metal <b>bullets</b> {{fall short}} of this {{velocity}} threshold due {{to the need to}} seat the <b>bullets</b> deeper owing to the length of the <b>bullets</b> and the need to stay within the maximum overall length specification of the cartridge. This is because the lower mono-metal <b>bullets</b> have a higher length to weight ratio than conventional <b>bullets.</b> Manufacturers such as A-Square have chosen to load slightly lighter <b>bullets</b> [...] instead of the [...] <b>bullets.</b>|$|R
5|$|The SS196SR was {{introduced}} in 2005 {{and it is now}} discontinued in favor of the SS197SR cartridge. It featured a lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max <b>bullet</b> which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 500m/s (1,650ft/s) when fired from the Five-seven. The polycarbonate tip used in the V-Max <b>bullet</b> acted as a wedge, enhancing expansion of the <b>bullet.</b> The SS196 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level II vest when fired from the Five-seven. The SS196 could be identified by its red polymer tip.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestle Kingdom 9 undercard {{featured}} several matches {{involving the}} <b>Bullet</b> Club, which {{was led by}} A.J. Styles. The group dominated NJPW for most of 2014, holding all four of its heavyweight championships during the summer. After the NJPW–GFW partnership was forged, GFW head Jeff Jarrett joined the <b>Bullet</b> Club on August10. On December 7, during a <b>Bullet</b> Club post-match assault on Tomoaki Honma, NJPW veteran tag team Tencozy (Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima) stormed into the ring {{to the aid of}} Honma, driving the <b>Bullet</b> Club away. They then joined Honma to challenge the stable to a six-man tag team match at Wrestle Kingdom 9. Bad Luck Fale, Yujiro Takahashi and Jeff Jarrett—making his NJPW ring debut—were scheduled to represent the <b>Bullet</b> Club at the event.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the <b>bullet</b> when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the <b>bullet,</b> which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's <b>bullet</b> would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front <b>bullet</b> hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the <b>bullet</b> had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the <b>bullet</b> had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} <b>bullets</b> {{there are}} several hard cast [...] diameter <b>bullets</b> that are compatible with the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum. Such <b>bullets,</b> unlike jacketed <b>bullets,</b> {{are designed to be}} driven at reduced velocities.

50|$|During the 1972-73 NBA season, the <b>Bullets</b> {{acquired}} Elvin Hayes {{from the}} Houston Rockets. In the draft, the <b>Bullets</b> acquired Kevin Porter.

In the playoffs, the <b>Bullets</b> faced their playoff rivals the New York Knicks. The <b>Bullets</b> fell in 5 games by a 1-4 margin. Following the season, the <b>Bullets</b> would move to Landover, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and became the Capital <b>Bullets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Monolithic <b>bullets</b> are lighter {{in weight}} than lead <b>bullets.</b> As a result, {{monolithic}} <b>bullets</b> {{are able to}} achieve or exceed the velocities of lead- or jacketed <b>bullets</b> at the correct powder loads [...]|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the <b>bullet</b> had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest.

5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a <b>bullet</b> cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver <b>bullet</b> developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver <b>Bullet.</b> Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.|$|E
50|$|Soft-point <b>bullets</b> {{are similar}} to {{jacketed}} hollow-point <b>bullets,</b> because both have a jacket open on the forward tip. The soft core is exposed forward of the jacket on soft-point <b>bullets,</b> while the jacket may extend forward of the core on hollow-point <b>bullets</b> emphasizing aerodynamic improvement rather than expansion. <b>Bullets</b> with {{a large amount of}} core exposed forward of the jacket might have a hollow point within that core; and some hollow-point <b>bullets</b> have no jackets.|$|R
50|$|The German protests were effective, however, {{resulting}} in the ban {{of the use of}} expanding <b>bullets</b> in warfare. The British replaced the hollow-point <b>bullets</b> with new full metal jacket <b>bullets,</b> and used the remaining stocks of expanding <b>bullets</b> for practice.|$|R

5|$|In the Jamia Hafsa complex, {{damage was}} extensive, with {{thousands}} of <b>bullet</b> holes in the courtyard. The basement was blackened from rockets. The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had <b>bullet</b> marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls and stacks of books were piled against walls.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ryusuke Taguchi defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kenny Omega of the <b>Bullet</b> Club. Distractions by the <b>Bullet</b> Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi {{in the eyes}} with an aerosol can and broke Taguchi's ankle lock on Omega later in the match. Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Later in the month, <b>Bullet</b> Club {{took part}} in NJPW's North American tour, {{produced}} in collaboration with ROH. The Young Bucks, who entered the tour as both the IWGP Junior Heavyweight and ROH World Tag Team Champions, lost the latter title to reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) on May 17, ending their two-month reign in their first defense. Meanwhile, their seven-month reign as the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions ended on June 21 at Dominion 6.21, where they were defeated by the Time Splitters in their sixth defense. Later that same event, Bad Luck Fale defeated Shinsuke Nakamura to become the new IWGP Intercontinental Champion. On June 29, Yujiro Takahashi brought another title over to the <b>Bullet</b> Club, when he defeated Tomohiro Ishii with help from his stablemates for the NEVER Openweight Championship. With the win, <b>Bullet</b> Club had won every title in NJPW, now simultaneously holding all four of its heavyweight titles.|$|E
5000|$|Monolithic <b>bullets</b> {{retain their}} weight and shape {{far better than}} lead <b>bullets.</b> Lead <b>bullets</b> often break apart once they hit their {{intended}} target (if traveling at high velocities) which implies greater meat damage to the hunted animal.

In the first, The Young Bucks defeated reDRagon, Roppongi Vice and the team of Matt Sydal and Ricochet to regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. In the following match, Fale, Takahashi and Tonga were defeated by Toru Yano and the ROH tag team The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) in a match to determine the inaugural NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions. This was followed by two title matches, where <b>Bullet</b> Club lost two of their championships with Omega losing the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship back to Kushida and Anderson and Gallows losing the IWGP Tag Team Championship to Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma. In <b>Bullet</b> Club's final title match of the event, Styles unsuccessfully challenged Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Hours after the event {{it was reported that}} Anderson, Gallows and Styles had all given their notice to NJPW and would be leaving the promotion for WWE. The following day, the rest of <b>Bullet</b> Club turned on Styles and kicked him out of the group with Omega taking over the leadership. Omega also announced his graduation from the junior heavyweight division, stating {{that he did not want}} a rematch with Kushida, but instead a match with Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Accuracy {{achieved}} {{when using}} monolithic <b>bullets</b> {{is much higher}} than accuracy obtained by using lead <b>bullets</b> [...] This is due to the precision manufacturing process of monolithic <b>bullets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{monolithic}} <b>bullets</b> {{have also}} gained {{popularity in the}} world of professional competitive shooting. Due to the precision manufactured process by which the <b>bullets</b> are produced, the high accuracies achieved make for ideal target shooting <b>bullets.</b> When purchasing high quality, well designed monolithic <b>bullets</b> with low trajectories and limited drag through the air, these <b>bullets</b> provide a massive advantage to the competitive shooter, especially over medium to longer ranges.|$|R
5000|$|While most {{commercial}} cartridges {{operating at}} high pressure use jacketed <b>bullets,</b> gas checked <b>bullets</b> are popular with [...] "handloaders" [...] who can recycle lead to make cast <b>bullets,</b> and then must only {{pay for the}} gas check.
