5|$|Ono {{is often}} {{associated}} with the Fluxus group, whose founder George Maciunas was her friend during the 1960s. Maciunas admired and promoted her work enthusiastically and gave Ono her U.S. show at his AG Gallery in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> remain independent. She did, however, collaborate with him, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.|$|E
5|$|Greenwald {{was born}} in 1977 to Rick and Bonnie Greenwald. She has two brothers. Growing up, Greenwald {{had no plans to}} be a wrestler, but she was {{interested}} in appearing on American Gladiators. She trained to be a powerlifter from age 14 to age 18, and at age 14, she broke the Minnesota state powerlifting record (75pounds) for her age group by lifting 100pounds. She also trained as a gymnast. Later, she began wrestling for fun, not <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be on TV.|$|E
5|$|Kurt and {{his father}} Burt are called in to see Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), where it is {{revealed}} that although Kurt apparently won his election by 190 votes, more votes have been cast than there are students. Kurt admits that he contemplated cheating, but decided against doing so. Nevertheless, Kurt is disqualified and Brittany wins the election. Kurt tells Finn and Rachel that he is still under suspicion, and after he leaves, Rachel admits to Finn {{that she was the}} one who stuffed the ballot box <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help Kurt.|$|E

5|$|While in England, Godwin took {{a course}} in {{creative}} writing at the City Literature Institute, where she met her second husband, psychiatrist Ian Marshall. They were married two months later. The marriage was brief and they were divorced in 1966. After their breakup, Godwin returned to the United States. At age 29, she {{took a job as}} fact-checker in New York City for The Saturday Evening Post. She said the job was embarrassing, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.|$|E
5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.|$|E
5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources {{disagree}} on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E

5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{distinction}} in ethics and action theory, largely made popular by Bernard Williams (1979, reprinted in 1981), concerning internal and external reasons for action. An internal reason is, roughly, something that one has in light of one's own [...] "subjective motivational set"---one's own commitments, desires (or wants), goals, etc. On the other hand, an external reason is something that one has independent of one's subjective motivational set. For example, suppose that Sally is going to drink a glass of poison, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide and believes that she can do so by drinking the poison. Sally has an internal reason to drink the poison, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide. However, {{one might say that}} she has an external reason not to drink the poison <b>because,</b> even though <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> die, one ought not kill oneself no matter what—regardless of whether one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> die.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E

Cristina claims that the two would never have worked out <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> emulate him, not be by his side. Preston then reveals his ulterior motive for bringing Cristina to Switzerland: to ask her to take over his hospital, which she accepts.

25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to do was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E

25|$|Patel's first {{opportunity}} for acting {{came in the}} form of an offer from her father's schoolmate, Rakesh Roshan, to star opposite his son, Hrithik Roshan, in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000). The offer came immediately after she graduated from high school, but she refused the project <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> continue her education in the US. Afterwards, Kareena Kapoor replaced her, but luckily, Kapoor dropped out a few days into the principal photography and Patel was given the opportunity once again during a family lunch. She readily agreed to do the project this time. The role of an exuberant college girl in love, undergoing a tortuous time at losing her lover and rediscovering a more mature relationship gave Patel scope to perform. The film was a smashing success and established Patel as a rising star, earning her awards for Best Debut at a number of award ceremonies. In her second film, the Telugu language drama Badri, she starred opposite Pawan Kalyan. The film was a major success, grossing more than Rs 120 million in India.|$|E
25|$|The Song of Dermot and the Earl and Expugnatio Hibernica {{follow the}} same pattern, portraying Derbforgaill’s {{abduction}} in 1152 and Mac Murchada’s banishment in 1166 as occurring at the same time. The Song claims that Derbforgaill {{had fallen in love}} with Diarmait, who in turn only made a pretense of loving her, in an effort to entice her away from Ua Ruairc, as a means of avenging previous wrongs inflicted by Leth Cuinn (the northern half of Ireland) upon Leth Moga (the southern half of Ireland). She subsequently arranged for a rendezvous from which he could carry her back to Laigin unchallenged. Ua Ruairc is then said to have complained to the (unnamed) king of Connacht, who convinced Mac Murchada’s allies to abandon him and force him into exile. In the events as narrated by the Song (and to a degree the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Annals of the Four Masters) Derbforgaill is clearly a dupe, but in Gerald of Wales’s Expugnatio Hibernica she becomes more blameworthy:On an occasion when Ua Ruairc king of Meath had gone off on an expedition to far distant parts, his wife, Ua Máelechlainn's daughter, whom he had left on an island in Meath, was abducted by the aforesaid Diramait, who had long been burning with love for her and took advantage of her husband's absence. No doubt she was abducted <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be and, since 'woman is always a fickle and inconstant creature', she herself arranged that she should become the kidnapper's prize.Almost all the world's most notable catastrophes have been caused by women, witness Mark Antony and Troy. King Ua Ruairc was stirred to extreme anger on two counts, of which however the disgrace, rather than the loss of his wife, grieved him more deeply, and he vented all the venom of his fury with a view to revenge. And so he called together and mustered his own forces and those of neighbouring peoples, and roused to the same purpose Ruaidrí, prince of Connacht and at that time supreme ruler of all Ireland. The men of Leinster, seeing that their prince was now in a difficult position and surrounded on all sides by his enemies' forces, sought to pay him back, and recalled to mind injustices which they had long concealed and stored deep in their hearts.. They made common cause with his enemies, and the men of rank among this people deserted Mac Murchada along with his good fortune... he finally trusted his life to the sea in flight, and so to speak had recourse to this last hope of saving himself.In addition to the classical references to Mark Antony and Troy, the quotation used by Gerald is from Mercury's pushing Aeneis to leave Dido and fulfill his fate by sailing to Italy, in the Aeneid.|$|E
