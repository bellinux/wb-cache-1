40|$|Reference Laboratories of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) are {{required}} to function as centres of expertise and standardisation, to prepare, store and distribute biological reference materials, to develop new procedures for disease diagnosis and control, to gather, analyse and disseminate epidemiological data, and to provide expert consultancy for the OIE. A number of other activities are also desirable, such as, training, diagnostic testing for other countries, organisation of scientific meetings, and publication of scientific data. OIE Collaborating Centres are focused on cross-cutting topics rather than specific diseases, {{and they are not}} necessarily laboratory-based (although many are). Their mandate relates to operating as a centre for research, expertise, standardisation and dissemination of techniques, the harmonisation of international regulations for animal disease surveillance and control, and the provision of consultant expertise. Again a number of other activities are also desirable, such as training, scientific meetings and publications. Apart from aquatic animal diseases (which are dealt with by the Aquatic Animal Diseases Commission), the <b>Biological</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Commission</b> (BSC) assesses applications for Reference Laboratory and Collaborating Centre status, and advises the OIE on their suitability.

40|$|The Commission {{was welcomed}} by Dr Bernard Vallat, Director General of the OIE. He thanked {{the members of}} the Commission for their {{dedicated}} and continuing good work. He informed the Commission that meetings of the Aquatic Animals Commission, Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission and the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases this year have been organised to allow coordination and harmonisation of their work and this arrangement will continue. He suggested that for next year, the Aquatic Animals Commission consider, if possible, also meeting with the <b>Biological</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Commission.</b> He drew attention to the recent meeting of the Administrative Commission, which drafted a new OIE strategic plan for 2005 - 2010, taking into account comments from Member Countries, with an increased emphasis on the OIE’s work on aquatic animals. The Commission examined draft revised texts related to the Aquatic Animals Health Code (hereafter referred to as the Aquatic Code) circulated for Member Countries ’ comment by the Bureau of the Commission after its October 2004 meeting, and comments received on those texts. The outcome of the Commission’s work is presented as appendices to this report. Amendments made to existing chapters and previously circulated drafts are shown as double underlined text, with deleted text in strikeout. A yellow background is used to distinguish amendments and deletions made at this meeting from those made at the meeting of the Bureau in October 2004...|$|E
40|$|During its 20 th {{annual meeting}} in Paris in May 1999, the OIE (World {{organisation}} for animal health) Ad Hoc Group on Non-Tsetse Transmitted Animal Trypanosomoses expressed the following concerns about dourine: the discrepancies {{in some of the}} results of the complement fixation test (CFT), which is the only international diagnostic test officially recognised by the International Organisation for the Transportation of Equidae; the persistence of suspected cases of dourine in some Asian, European and African countries; the impossibility of differentiating Trypanosoma equiperdum from Trypanosoma evansi and of isolating new strains of T. equiperdum from clinical cases that have appeared in various parts of the world since 1982. In the light of these concerns, it was decided, in agreement with the Directorate of the Federal Veterinary Services of Russia in Moscow, to perform comparative trials on the value of CFT/dourine at the OIE Reference Laboratory for dourine in Moscow (The All-Russian Research Institute of Experimental Veterinary Medicine) using reagents (antigens and sera) from seven countries with extensive experience in the field of dourine diagnosis, namely, South Africa, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. It is thanks to the successful co-operation of these countries that the trials were made possible. Results showed an overall concordance and were submitted for consideration to the OIE <b>Biological</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>Commission,</b> the commission which is in charge of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. These trials serve as a starting point for further study, particularly in the following areas: the isolation of new strains of T. equiperdum from clinical dourine cases; the identification of specific markers for T. equiperdum which would make it possible to differentiate it from among the other species within the subgenus Trypanozoon; the experimental infection of horses with newly isolated T. equiperdum strains to compare their pathogenicity with those currently used in national diagnostic laboratories and with that of T. evansi; phylogenetic studies; the proposal and validation of new, internationally recognised diagnostic test(s) for dourine. status: publishe...|$|E
