The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a <b>ballcock.</b> Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock.

50|$|A <b>ballcock</b> (also balltap or float valve) is a {{mechanism}} or machine for filling water tanks, {{such as those}} found in flush toilets, while avoiding overflow and (in the event of low water pressure) backflow. The modern <b>ballcock</b> was invented by José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, a Mexican priest and scientist, who described the device in 1790 in the Gaceta de Literatura Méxicana. It consists of a valve connected to a hollow sealed float {{by means of a}} lever, mounted {{near the top of the}} tank. The float is often ball-shaped, hence the name <b>ballcock.</b> The valve is connected to the incoming water supply, and is opened and closed by the lever which has the float mounted on the end. When the water level rises, the float rises with it; once it rises to a pre-set level, the mechanism forces the lever to close the valve and shut off the water flow. This is an example of negative feedback and of proportional control.|$|E
50|$|The main item in {{the room}} is the {{sanitation}} fixture itself, the toilet. This may be the flushing sort, which is plumbed into a cistern (tank) operated by a <b>ballcock</b> (float valve). Or it may be a dry model, which does not need water.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, Hydrant signage varies, {{with several}} types {{displayed}} across the country. Most Australian hydrants are underground, being of a <b>ballcock</b> system (spring hydrant type), {{and a separate}} standpipe with a central plunger is used to open the valve. Consequently, hydrant signage is essential, because of their concealed nature.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>ballcock</b> or {{float valve}} {{is often used}} to {{regulate}} the filling of a tank or cistern. When the fluid level drops, the float descends, levering the valve opening and allowing more fluid to enter. Once the float reached the 'full' position, the arm presses the valve shut again.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} the use of {{negative}} feedback control is the <b>ballcock</b> control of water level (see diagram). In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in fuel injection systems and carburettors. Similar control mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving air conditioners, refrigerators, or freezers.|$|E
50|$|A trick tank is a {{watering}} device for livestock or wildlife. It collects precipitation, holds {{the water in}} a covered tank to minimize evaporation and maintain adequate water quality, and dispenses water on demand into a basin from which animals can drink. Dispensing may be regulated by a mechanical float device similar to a <b>ballcock</b> in the tank of a flush toilet.|$|E
50|$|A {{float chamber}} works by {{allowing}} liquid within the chamber {{to lift a}} float which is linked to a valve which regulates the liquid intake. When the level is low, the float drops and opens the valve, allowing in liquid until the float rises sufficiently to close off the valve again. This is identical in principle to the <b>ballcock</b> valve.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{discharge}} process, the <b>ballcock</b> responds to the drop in water level and refills the tank. Should the float or valve fail and allow the water level to exceed the fill line, the water will pour into the overflow tube and out to the bowl (in the flapper valve type) or to an outside drain (in the siphon type). Although this does not stop the wastage of water, it avoids the flooding that would otherwise occur after a single-point valve failure.|$|E

Crapper's nephew, George, did improve the siphon mechanism by which the water flow is started. A patent for this development was awarded in 1897.|$|E
5000|$|Taps are {{normally}} {{connected to the}} water supply {{by means of a}} [...] "swivel tap connector", which is attached {{to the end of the}} water pipe using a soldered or compression fitting, and has a large nut to screw onto the threaded [...] "tail" [...] of the tap, which hangs down underneath the bath, basin or sink.

50|$|The Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra (or PHLO) were an {{eccentric}} band of British musicians, who joined together in early 1968 {{to play a}} fusion of comedy, jazz, and folk music, in a unique style which has been compared with the Temperance Seven and the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Many of the songs performed dated from the 1920s or 1930s. Other influences included music-hall, blues and jug band music. Their eccentricity was not due to their characters and choice of music alone, but to {{an eclectic mix of}} instruments, some of them home-made, such as the 'egg-cupaphone' and the 'ballcockaphone', which was a wind instrument in which the supply of air to the reed was controlled by toilet cistern chain connected to a <b>ballcock.</b>|$|E

3000|$|Both {{cauliflower}} {{and cabbage}} are euphemisms for genitalia. The flaccid penis is a tail (the term penis is Latin for “tail”), a tassel, bauble, putz (this word {{is much less}} dysphemistic in English than in Yiddish; it derives from the verb putsn “adorn”) It is a dangle, worm, schlong, tummy / hairy banana (cf. Bahasa Malaysia pisang “banana”, {{said to be the}} prevalent euphemism used among women), noodle, dill, gherkin, wally, wire, wiener and other terms for sausages (little boys sport saveloys). One delightful metaphor is the one eyed trouser snake. Cock—which, in this sense, has multiple sources—comes in part from the “tap, faucet” sense of cock (still present in stopcock and <b>ballcock)</b> (see Allan and Burridge 1991 : 105 ff); doodle derives from cock via fore and end-clipped cockadoodledoo but also perhaps from doodle as adornment. The bird metaphor sanctions pecker. It is found in Catullus (85 – 54 bce) Passer, deliciae meae puellae “sparrow, my girl’s darling” (Carmina II, Catullus 1969) and throughout the centuries since. Used literally, cock is the generic term for a “male bird”; however, its salient literal meaning is “the male of gallus domesticus”; and this cock, by repute, rules the roost—whence rooster. This used to be what a man was expected to do (a view which probably had some effect on the use of Cock as a euphemistic remodelling of God in fifteenth–seventeenth century English). Taking this perspective, for a man to be cock of the walk demonstrates the very essence of manhood. From a different point of view, the manifestation of maleness is having a penis. From the Middle Ages until at least the seventeenth century, the flesh and blood of a cock was believed to be a strong therapeutic and restorative agent and was recommended in medical texts and recipes. Thirdly, there is the folk myth that men often find themselves sexually aroused at cock-crow (hence the wake-up call Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey), whereas their womenfolk are more readily sexually aroused in the evening. Because the penis rises with the cock (rooster), an association is established between the two. Fourthly, the rooster is a randy creature which struts around with a neck that moves not unlike an erect penis on a walking man, whence one source for the idiom keep your pecker up. Pecker is a frequent euphemism for penis. A pecker was also a narrow hoe used for digging holes when seeding; perhaps it got the name from the birdlike action involved in its use, and the association with seed. Certainly, peckers, seed, and birds form a natural set which intersects with another natural set whose members are peckers, penises, seed, and holes. Beak {{is one of the many}} synonyms for “penis” (Farmer and Henley 1890 – 1904). The similarity of the profiled penis-with-testicles to the outline of a bird gives rise to an image found in many languages, cf. the Bahasa Malaysia and Bahasa Indonesia euphemism burung “bird” (used particularly by women); Italian uccello “bird” and passerotto “sparrow”, Latin passer “sparrow’; and the German verb vögeln “fuck” is apparently based on Vogel “bird” (Barolsky 1978; de Jongh 1968 / 1969). The guy who said he was in prison ‘not for robbing a wagon but for wagging his robin’ was immediately understood (Mike Harding ‘Strangeways Hotel’ (Rubber Records, 1975). One of the appearance-based terms for the female pudendum is bird’s nest. The penis is the bird to enter this nest.
