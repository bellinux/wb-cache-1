5|$|The jury heard how {{the murder}} weapons {{had been found}} in a shed at Nazir's house along with two bags of bloodied clothes. DNA and {{fingerprints}} belonging to Nazir was found on the hunting knife and Parker's <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> found on both the hammer and knife. His <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> also found on the clothes of two of the accused, along with Nazir and Mahrad's DNA and a pathologist told how marks on Parker's body matched the hammer found in Nazir's shed. Three balaclavas were also recovered from the property, again containing traces of Parker's blood, Nazir's younger brother Wyed told the court he had seen his brother cleaning the murder weapon {{on the night of the}} killing and witnessed all four defendants with blood on their clothing. Further witnesses reported Nazir admitting to beating someone up, Mahrad admitting to kicking Parker and Awan recalling stabbing him. A witness also saw all four defendants kicking Parker.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> {{viewed as}} a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, {{and the most important}} Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
40|$|A {{question}} {{that most of}} jurists are faced with <b>is,</b> whether human <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> basically a property or not and is human the owner of his <b>blood?</b> Moreover, what <b>is</b> the difference between blood and other organs of the body {{from the viewpoint of}} ownership? If <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> a property, why human is not the owner? Unlike <b>blood,</b> there have <b>been</b> legal discussions on organ sale, where <b>blood</b> can <b>be</b> retrieved by the body while segregated organs are not retrievable by the body. Investigating various views about ownership of organs of the body, one can conclude that <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> a property owned by humans. ...|$|R
50|$|Autologous <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> not {{routinely}} {{tested for}} infectious diseases markers such as HIV antibodies. In the United States, autologous <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> tested {{only if it}} is collected in one place and shipped to another.|$|R
50|$|For example, if {{antibodies}} {{that bind}} the A <b>blood</b> group <b>are</b> added and agglutination occurs, the <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> either type A or type AB. To determine between type A or type AB, antibodies that bind the B group are added and if agglutination {{does not occur}}, the <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> type A. If agglutination does not occur with either antibodies that bind to type A or type B antigens, then neither antigen is present on the blood cells, which means the <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> type O.|$|R
5|$|In the 18th {{century and}} 19th century, more Arab <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> added by stallions who were {{turned out in}} the Welsh hills. Other breeds have also been added, {{including}} the Thoroughbred, Hackney, Norfolk Roadster, and the Yorkshire Coach Horse. Before the car was developed, the quickest mode of transport in Wales was the Welsh Cob. Tradesmen, doctors, and other businessmen often selected ponies by trotting them the 35 uphill miles from Cardiff to Dowlais. The best ponies could complete this feat in under three hours, never breaking gait. Formal breeding stock licensing was introduced in 1918, but before this, breeding stock was selected by such trotting tests.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, A Rush of <b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> Coldplay's first {{venture into}} the top 5 with 144,000copies sold initially, {{stronger}} than its predecessor, Parachutes, which debuted at number 189 in December 2000. It has since been certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and it has sold sales 4,925,000 copies as of July 2014. It has been certified 7x platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, having accumulated shipments of over 490,000units, and 4x times platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 400,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{added to the}} Irish draught breed {{in an attempt to}} improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse. In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E
50|$|Venous <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> deoxygenated <b>blood</b> which travels {{from the}} {{peripheral}} vessels, through the venous system {{into the right}} atrium of the heart. Deoxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> then pumped by the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary artery which is divided in two branches, left and right {{to the left and}} right lungs respectively. <b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> oxygenated in the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.|$|R
50|$|At low right atrial {{pressures}} this graph {{serves as}} a graphic demonstration of the Frank-Starling mechanism, that <b>is</b> as more <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> returned to the heart, more <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> pumped from it without extrinsic signals.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> {{used as an}} {{ingredient}} without any additional preparation.

One example is the drinking of seal <b>blood</b> which <b>is</b> traditionally believed by the Inuit to bring health benefits.|$|R
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. <b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E
5|$|No <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> shed {{during the}} event, {{and when the}} Gabonese people did not respond violently the {{military}} interpreted this {{as a sign of}} approval. Aubame was offered the presidency of the newly formed provisional government. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Gondjout. During the coup, he served as Minister of State. The coup's leaders were content at restoring security for the civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> {{drawn into}} a test tube {{containing}} liquid sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample.

50|$|The {{average density}} of human <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> 1060 kg/m3. The {{specific}} volume that correlates to that density is 0.00094 m3/kg. Notice {{that the average}} specific volume of <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> almost identical to that of water: 0.00100 m3/kg.|$|R
50|$|In {{arterial}} blood-gas sampling, a {{small amount}} of <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> taken from an artery, usually in the wrist. The <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> then checked for oxygen and carbon-dioxide levels. This test shows how well the lungs are taking in oxygen.|$|R
