40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of mean heart rate (HR) and HR variability on image quality in low-dose computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective electrocardiographic (ECG) triggering. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-six consecutive patients were scheduled for low-dose CTCA using prospective ECG triggering. The image quality of all coronary segments was rated on a 5 -point scale by two independent readers (scores of 1 - 3 were considered diagnostic, and scores of 4 and 5 were considered nondiagnostic). Intravenous beta blockers were administered targeting HR 65 beats/min despite using <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> (<b>n</b> = 3), 129 patients underwent computed tomographic scanning. The estimated mean effective radiation dose was 2. 2 +/- 0. 7 mSv (range, 1. 1 - 3. 5). The mean HR during scanning was 58. 4 +/- 6. 6 beats/min (range, 44. 2 - 80. 1), with a variability of 1. 6 +/- 1. 0 beats/min (range, 0. 2 - 5. 3). Mean HR (r = 0. 49, P <. 001) but not mean HR variability (r = 0. 14) was related to image quality. Nondiagnostic image quality on CTCA was found in 5 % of the coronary segments in 21 of 129 patients. However, on receiver-operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff HR of 62 beats/min was determined, below which nondiagnostic segments were significantly less frequent (2 % vs 14 %, P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Prospective triggering allows low-dose CTCA but requires a low HR. Because a low HR offers a prolonged diastole, widening the optimal phase for scanning, HR variability seems to have a negligible impact on image quality...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the 90 -day risk of hospitalization with pneumonia among patients treated with different anti-hypertensive drug classes. Design: Population based cohort study using five linked databases. Participants: Individuals {{over the age}} of 65 who filled a new outpatient prescription for one of four anti-hypertensive medications: ACE inhibitors (n = 86 775), ARBs (n = 33 953), calcium channel <b>blockers</b> (CCB, <b>n</b> = 34 240), <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> (BB, <b>n</b> = 35 331) and thiazide diuretics (n = 64 186). Primary Outcome: Hospitalization with pneumonia within 90 days of a qualifying prescription. We adjusted for ten a priori selected covariates, including age, sex, diabetes and number of visits to a family doctor. Results: Baseline characteristics of the groups were relatively well matched, except for age, sex, diabetes and frequency of family doctor visits. 128 of the 86 775 patients (0. 15 %) initiated on an ACE inhibitor and 43 of the 33953 patients (0. 13 %) of patients initiated on an ARB were hospitalized with pneumonia in the subsequent 90 days. 135 of 64 186 patients (0. 21 %) initiated on a thiazide, 112 of 35 331 patients (. 32 %) initiated on a BB, and 89 of 34 240 (0. 26 %) patients initiated on a CCB achieved the primary outcome. Compared to calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors (adjusted OR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 46 to 0. 81) and ARBs (adjusted OR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 36 to 0. 76) were associated with a lower risk of pneumonia.

40|$|Background: <b>Beta</b> <b>blockers</b> are {{recommended}} by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for high and intermediate-risk cardiac patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. <b>Beta</b> <b>blockers</b> are a class of drugs that moderate the effects of increased catecholamine levels on the heart by selectively blocking beta receptors in the heart and blood vessels, resulting in a lower heart rate and blood pressure. <b>Beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use perioperatively {{has been shown to}} reduce the risk of ischemia and infarction. Purpose: The purpose of this project is to address <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use in a group of anesthesia providers who routinely attend to high-risk and intermediate-risk cardiac patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in a medium-sized private hospital in suburban South Florida. There are barriers to the implementation of the published guidelines for <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> administration, including lack of awareness of the best current practice and a lack of a formal <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> protocol at the institutional level. Methods: A simple and inexpensive <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> protocol was implemented and evaluated by various means. <b>Beta</b> <b>blocker</b> administration practices were examined and documented prior to and after protocol implementation. <b>Beta</b> <b>blocker</b> usage was examined prior to and after protocol implementation Findings/Implications: It was hypothesized that increased anesthesia provider awareness would lead to increased administration of perioperative <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> to high-risk and intermediate-risk cardiac patients undergoing non-cardiac procedures. Although there was a knowledge increase related to the new <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> protocol, no change in practice was observed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>blockers</b> {{should not}} be used as a {{first-line}} treatment in the acute setting for cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (CIACS). No recent studies have been identified that show the benefit of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in reducing coronary vasospasm, or coronary vascular resistance, in patients with CIACS. In the multiple case studies identified, the use of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in CIACS resulted in detrimental outcomes, and the discontinuation of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> used in the acute setting led to improvement in clinical course. The guidelines by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association also support this idea, and recommend against the use of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in cocaine-induced ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) because of the risk of coronary vasospasm. Though, in general, <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> improve mortality in patients who have suffered MI, it is unclear whether patients with CIACS will benefit from this mortality reduction because no studies assess the use of <b>beta</b> <b>blockers</b> in the long term, and because cocaine users may be prone to continue to abuse the substance, thus complicating the effect of drug therapy.Contrast media are not contraindicated in patients receiving <b>beta</b> <b>blockers.</b>|$|R

We examined {{the association between}} <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy and depressive symptoms in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients {{and the extent to}} which there is a dose–response relationship between <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> dose and depressive symptoms. Methods Patients treated with PCI (N = 685) completed the depression scale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 1 and 12 months post PCI. Information about type and dose of <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use was extracted from medical records. Results Of all patients, 68 % (466 / 685) were on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy at baseline. In adjusted analysis, <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use at 1 month post PCI (OR: 0. 82; 95 % CI: 0. 53 – 1. 26) was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms. At 12 months post PCI, there was a significant relationship between <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> use and depressive symptoms (OR: 0. 51; 95 % CI: 0. 31 – 0. 84), with <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy associated with a 49 % risk reduction in depressive symptoms. There was a dose–response relationship between <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> dose and depressive symptoms 12 months post PCI, with the risk reduction in depressive symptoms in relation to a low dose being 36 % (OR: 0. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 37 – 1. 10) and 58 % (OR: 0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 24 – 0. 76) in relation to a high dose.

MethodsA case-control study of patients admitted to a level I trauma center was conducted. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, medications, injury information, and hemodynamic profiles. Logistic regression identified correlations between preinjury beta blockade and hemodynamics during initial trauma resuscitation and in-hospital mortality.

Mean pre-resuscitation heart rate was 83 in patients on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> and 89 in patients not on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> (p =  0. 007). Mean post-resuscitation heart rate was 80 in patients on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> and 85 in patients not on <b>beta</b> <b>blocker</b> (p =  0. 02).
