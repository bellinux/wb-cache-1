25|$|The {{second major}} {{problem was the}} method of struggle. Ahmadzadeh {{believed}} that {{the only means of}} battle is a military one and had a strategic role in their fight. Jazani believed in the current situation one should not limit their means to one method <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> prepare the people in a political sense from all sides. With this effort one can fight against injustice and dictatorship for a better life for all people. This will first fix the problem with communication between people and second the social injustices develop a populous sense against the Shah in Iran and the world, and a dictator regime would fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E
25|$|After the {{introduction}} come {{the words of}} Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake {{of life in the}} present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.|$|E

25|$|Catherine Hills {{suggests}} {{it is not}} necessary to see all the early settlers as federate troops, and that this interpretation has been used rather too readily by some archaeologists. A variety of relationships could have existed between Romano-British and incoming Anglo-Saxons. The broader archaeological picture suggests that no one model will explain all the Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain and that there was considerable regional variation. Settlement density varied within southern and eastern England. Norfolk has more large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries than the neighbouring East Anglian county of Suffolk; eastern Yorkshire (the nucleus of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira) far more than the rest of Northumbria. The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not assume that all of these were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later Viking settlers, may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.|$|E

[...] The Daily Telegraph, for instance, although like most of its contemporaries describing Brett's death as [...] "a vulgar, dastardly murder", nevertheless supported reform in Ireland; [...] "we may hang convicted Fenians with good conscience, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also thoroughly redress those evils distinctly due to English policy and still supported by English power." ...|$|E

500|$|Overall, Walker concludes, [...] "Posterity {{may have}} {{overestimated}} {{the importance of}} extra-musical thought in Liszt's symphonic poems. We {{would not want to}} be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made about the origins of his music; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not follow them slavishly, {{for the simple reason that}} the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either." [...] Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt [...] "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" [...] as being evocative rather than representational. [...] "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," [...] MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism.|$|E
500|$|Positions on genetic {{determinism}} often {{correlate with}} social politics, and {{few of us}} are neutral or even changeable on the issues. Wade recognizes that his ideas may not be acceptable to everyone but warns that [...] "to falter in scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness". He seems to be warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political correctness. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never become casual about how comparable [...] "slopular" [...] science and very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning by leading scientists fed a venomous kind of darkness not too many decades ago. Wade's post-hoc tales often put him in step with a long march of social darwinists who, with comfortable detachment from the (currently) dominant culture, insist that we look starkly at life in the raw and not blink at what we see.|$|E

The contribution they make does contribute to the success of combat operations, particularly when they remove the enemy from the field of battle, even if those actions are physically removed from the fight." [...] Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen, added, [...] "Extraordinary achievement directly impacting combat operations at this level deserves to be recognized with a distinctive medal, not a device on an existing medal. The DWM is visionary in that it fills a need for a non-valorous combat impact medal." ...|$|E
500|$|Born Villain was {{released}} worldwide from April 30, {{with a cover}} of Carly Simon's [...] "You're So Vain" [...] included on all editions as a bonus track. This cover was recorded after the album had been completed, and features Johnny Depp performing guitar. The pair were introduced when Manson appeared as an extra on 21 Jump Street when he was 19, although [...] "You're So Vain" [...] is their first musical collaboration. The cover originated from a jam session, with Manson explaining that they [...] "started playing old blues songs and I said, 'My record's done, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> really do a song {{to add to the}} end of it, {{as if it were a}} movie.'" [...] He described the cover's placement on the album as: [...] "It's like the movie's over, and this is playing at the end title credits." [...] It was later included on the soundtrack to the documentary West of Memphis. Dean Karr, who served as the photographer on Manson's cover shoot for the March 2012 issue of Revolver, was commissioned to create the album's cover art. He had previously worked on the artwork accompanying Antichrist Superstar. However, the cover image would later be revealed to be the work of photographer Lindsay Usich, with Karr's photography being used for the album's first single, [...] "No Reflection".|$|E

I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that.
