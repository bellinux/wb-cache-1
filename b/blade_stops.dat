50|$|The {{automatic}} {{wire stripper}} was first patented in 1915 by Stuart G. Wood of Brooklyn, NY. The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism {{taking on the}} general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, replaceable blades, and <b>blade</b> <b>stops</b> in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its rest position. A second actuation released the mechanism {{to return to the}} rest position. The action was further refined by Wood and finally by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the rest position while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{assesses the}} need for additional tank isolation systems and tooling at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Locations for future operations at ORNL include the South and North Tank Farms and various Federal Facilities Agreement tanks. The goal of this report is to identify future needs for development of remote tools and systems to isolate inactive waste storage tanks. Remote tools have been developed to support waste-retrieval and tank-isolation operations at the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAATs) at ORNL. The tools developed for in-tank remote operations include a pipe-cutting tool (a modified band saw), a pipe-cleaning tool (a modified drill with a wire brush), and a pipe plug. A review of the planned future operations revealed several desirable modifications to improve the efficiency, operability, and flexibility of the existing tank-isolation tools. For example, the pipe-cutting tool needs improvements to provide better alignment, a blade-cutting-release device, improved tire replacement, sensors to prevent operation of the saw when the <b>blade</b> <b>stops,</b> blade speed controls, and force feedback sensors. In addition, the need to test the existing pipe plug for use on corroded piping was identified. The pipe plug has been used on only relatively clean in-tank stainless steel (SS) piping to date. However, there may be a need later to use the plug on corroded SS and other types of pipes. Improvements to the pipe plug for use on flush wall pipes and small-diameter openings in tanks are also desirable. Besides tank isolation, those performing tank closures may need to use cutting and capping equipment on buried pipes. The current cutting and capping equipment may have to be modified for deployment systems other than the Modified Light Duty Utility Arm, for which they were initially designed. Improved cutting and other remote systems may also be needed to dispose of contaminated equipment and tank shells. These requirements will be defined jointly by the U. S. Department of Energy, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the state of Tennessee as part of the overall remedial decision for the ORNL Bethel Valley area...|$|E

5000|$|Static Rollover is {{a rolling}} action when the {{helicopter}} blades {{are not in}} rotation. When the rotor <b>blades</b> <b>stop,</b> the helicopter has the same principles of any other object and will roll if the static rollover critical angle is exceeded. Each helicopter has its own critical angle; this is a byproduct of its center-of-gravity.|$|R
50|$|Blade {{pitch control}} is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal-axis wind turbines. While {{operating}}, a wind turbine's control system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes. Feathering the <b>blades</b> <b>stops</b> the rotor during emergency shutdowns, or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed. During construction and maintenance of wind turbines, the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted rotational torque {{in the event of}} wind gusts.|$|R

The Bengals were offered an opportunity to join the former Midwest Football League in 1938 (as a natural rival for the Cincinnati Models/Blades, and when the <b>Blades</b> <b>stopped</b> playing, the AFL asked the Bengals if they could take over the Blades' remaining games in the 1938 Blades' AFL schedule.

5000|$|His [...] "Sawing a {{woman in}} half" [...] {{involved}} an electric circular saw some three to four feet in diameter mounted in an open frame. Blackstone's version differed from others in that the lady lay on a table that was pulled by a motor through the saw blade. Blackstone demonstrated {{the efficacy of the}} device by sawing noisily through a piece of lumber. Then a female assistant was placed on the saw table in full view, as wide metal restraints were clamped upon her midsection. The blade whirred and appeared to pass through her body, as ripping sounds were heard, the woman shrieked, and particles were scattered by the whirring blade. When the <b>blade</b> <b>stopped</b> she, of course, rose unharmed.|$|R

It took Gass two weeks to complete the design, and a third week to build a prototype based on a [...] "$200 secondhand table saw." [...] After numerous tests using a hot dog as a digital analog, in spring 2000, Gass conducted the first test with a real human finger: he applied Novocain to his left ring finger, and after two false starts, he placed his finger into the teeth of a whirring saw <b>blade.</b> The <b>blade</b> <b>stopped</b> as designed, and although it [...] "hurt like the dickens and bled a lot," [...] his finger remained intact.|$|R

He {{was sentenced to death}} with his co-defendants on the third day of deliberations. Their execution by guillotine took place on 24 March 1794. Hébert fainted several times {{on the way to the}} guillotine, and screamed hysterically when he was placed under the blade. Hébert's executioners amused the crowd by adjusting the guillotine so that its <b>blade</b> <b>stopped</b> inches above his neck. Only on the fourth attempt was the execution carried out. His corpse was disposed of in the Madeleine Cemetery. His widow was executed twenty days later on 13 April 1794. Her corpse was disposed of in the Errancis Cemetery.|$|R

50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) <b>blades.</b> <b>Stop</b> valves and governor valves are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing.|$|R
50|$|Furling {{works by}} {{decreasing}} {{the angle of}} attack, which reduces the induced drag from the lift of the rotor, {{as well as the}} cross-section. One major problem in designing wind turbines is getting the blades to stall or furl quickly enough should a gust of wind cause sudden acceleration. A fully furled turbine <b>blade,</b> when <b>stopped,</b> has the edge of the blade facing into the wind.|$|R
50|$|Stalling {{works by}} {{increasing}} the angle at which the relative wind strikes the blades (angle of attack), and it reduces the induced drag (drag associated with lift). Stalling is simple {{because it can be}} made to happen passively (it increases automatically when the winds speed up), but it increases the cross-section of the blade face-on to the wind, and thus the ordinary drag. A fully stalled turbine <b>blade,</b> when <b>stopped,</b> has the flat side of the blade facing directly into the wind.|$|R
25|$|In a rotor with blades moving say towards right. Let some blades {{receives}} flow {{at higher}} incidence, this <b>blade</b> will <b>stop</b> positively. It creates obstruction {{in the passage}} between the blade to its left and itself. Thus the left blade will receive the flow at higher incidence and the blade to its right with decreased incidence. The left blade will experience more stall while the blade to its right will experience lesser stall. Towards the right stalling will decrease whereas it will increase towards its left. Movement of the rotating stall can be observed depending upon the chosen reference frame.|$|R

50|$|In {{both cases}} {{the basis of the}} trick is that the <b>blade</b> is {{mechanically}} <b>stopped</b> just short of the magician's neck.

50|$|Iris {{diaphragms}} with moving blades {{are used}} in most modern camera lenses to restrict the light received by the film or sensor. While manufacturers attempt to make the aperture circular for a pleasing bokeh, its shape tends towards a polygon with {{the same number of}} sides as <b>blades</b> when <b>stopped</b> down to high f-numbers (small apertures). Diffraction spreads out light waves passing through the aperture perpendicular to the roughly-straight edge, each edge yielding two spikes 180° apart. As the blades are uniformly distributed around the circle, on a diaphragm with an even number of blades, the diffraction spikes from blades on opposite sides overlap. Consequently, a diaphragm with n&thinsp; blades yields n&thinsp; spikes if n&thinsp; is even, and 2n&thinsp; spikes if n&thinsp; is odd.|$|R

40|$|Wind {{power is}} a {{sustainable}} source of energy. However, there are certain challenges to be overcome. One of the operational challenges is the phenomenon of ice shedding. Icing happens on wind turbine blades in cold regions. When ice grows to a certain size, it separates from the wind turbine blades resulting in the phenomenon of ice shedding. This phenomenon is of significantly dangerous for equipment and personnel in the region. Ice shedding may happen either because of vibrations or bending in blades. However, it was noticed by operators at Nygårdsfjell wind park, Narvik, Norway that ice shedding is more probable to happen when <b>blades</b> are <b>stopped</b> and turned back on. This observation reveals the fact that bending of blades (from loaded to unloaded positions) allows the ice to separate and hence result in ice shedding. This {{can be linked to}} the phenomenon of icing, mechanical and adhesive properties of ice. This paper reviews above in detail...|$|R
50|$|Easy-Spin Starting - This {{compression}} release, implemented as {{an extra}} hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft, was introduced in 1961 to reduce the effort required to start an engine. In 1982, a new U.S. federal safety regulation required lawnmower <b>blades</b> to <b>stop</b> spinning within three seconds of the operator {{letting go of the}} handle. The least costly, most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine, to stop the engine (and therefore the blade) immediately when the handle was released. Briggs & Stratton engineers found engines with the Easy-Spin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop. The Easy-Spin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve, but this reduced engine performance. The intake-side Easy-Spin remained in use on Briggs & Stratton's engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement, but was discontinued in 1997 due to tightening emission regulations.|$|R

If she presses the button, the <b>blade</b> will <b>stop</b> but Butch will be electrocuted to death; and if she lets her hand get cut, they will be left to go. Tabitha is doubtful about it as she is not in love with Butch. Butch reassures her that these weeks were the best days of his life and is happy to be with her. He then decides to taunt Nygma over killing Isabella but his statements do not match the car crash. Tabitha decides not to press the button and her hand is cut off. Nygma leaves just as Barbara has already found the place.|$|R
50|$|The small {{restraining}} pin at 3 is {{the only}} thing holding the blade open and is prone to failure if abused. The whole slide assembly moves only a short distance, exactly as far as the thumb stud moves. The force that causes the blade to extend or retract is equal to the force applied by the user on the thumb stud to stretch the main spring before it releases. For this reason the tip of the blade is unlikely to even break skin and is entirely incapable of causing significant injury when released though the edge of the blade may still cut as it moves as with any knife. Any object {{in the path of the}} extending blade may cause the <b>blade</b> to <b>stop</b> before it can lock in position. This is easily remedied by either pulling the blade out so that it locks or pushing it in till it locks and then redeploying.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decision}} was made by Pond to attend Reno with the same engines used for flight testing. In fact, a vibrator was still attached to the left vertical stabilizer to initiate flutter {{as part of the}} planned flight test program. There was no expectation of victory the first year. It was viewed as a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] more than anything else. After takeoff for the final event on Sunday, the left engine threw a rod out the side of the block and created a tunnel of fire 4 ft in diameter and about 15 ft long. An onboard halon extinguishing system put the oil fire out and an uneventful single-engine landing was made. The engine installations were very compact and [...] "close cowled", meaning the bodywork covering the engines had little clearance. The carbon fiber engine cowling was a structural component of the aircraft and as such had to be protected from heat-soak after shutdown. This was accomplished via two 2-stroke weed blowers immediately after the <b>blades</b> <b>stopped</b> turning, quickly followed by two air conditioner blowers attached to the air inlet [...] "scuppers". The engine cowlings were lined with corrugated inconel of [...]007 thickness. Airflow was vital to structural integrity. Conversely, the powerplant units had to be preheated to nearly operating temperature before fireup. This was due to the tight tolerances of the engine main bearings. Because methanol burns much cooler than gasoline, cooling was never an issue. Actually the cold nature of the methanol gave the team a problem with oil viscosity. The thick, graphite laden oil would [...] "puke" [...] overboard {{for the majority of the}} time while airborne. Eventually it was determined that the oil drain holes were undersized in the rocker area of the heads as they were not intended to run at a constant high RPM in an automobile application. Fully half of the radiator inlet ducting was blocked off after the first test flight on March 22, 1991. Dick Rutan was the initial test pilot. Mike Melvill also flew the plane as did Steve Hinton as part of the test program.|$|R

Equivalent safety to the current fleet is desired by the regulators, which means that loss of a single fan blade will not cause hazard to the aircraft. NASA Glenn and Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) China Lake collaborated with the FAA Aircraft Catastrophic Failure Prevention Program to design and test a shield that would protect the aircraft passengers and critical systems from a released blade that could impact the fuselage. This report documents the live-fire test from a full-scale rig at NAWC China Lake. NASA provided manpower and photogrammetry expertise to document the impact and damage to the shields.

50|$|Gebauer {{concluded}} that the then-common practice of converting infantry machine guns for aircraft use was outdated. The most common problem with such converted weapons was that {{the position of the}} aircraft's propeller controlled the time of firing only, {{with the rest of the}} gun's operation depending on the force of propellant gases; a late-firing cartridge could cause damage to the propeller <b>blades,</b> while misfires <b>stopped</b> operation altogether. Gebauer had the idea to directly power a machine gun from the aircraft's engine, independently of the gas produced by the gun's cartridges. This meant that misfired cartridges would be automatically ejected and the next loaded. He called it the direct-driven motor machine gun.|$|R
50|$|One new feature, commercially {{available}} in saws since 2005, is an automatic braking system. The feature's inventor, {{after trying to}} license it to manufacturers without success, started SawStop, based in Tualatin, Oregon. SawStop's saws apply {{a small amount of}} electric current to the blade of the saw. This current is continuously monitored. If the saw detects a change in this current (as would occur if a hand or other body part came into contact with the blade) an automatic braking system is activated, forcing an aluminum brake block into the <b>blade.</b> The saw <b>stops</b> within five milliseconds, and angular momentum retracts the blade into the table. The operator suffers a small nick instead of an amputation or other more serious injury.|$|R
