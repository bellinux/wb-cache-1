25|$|The {{source code}} for Sun's {{implementations}} of Java (i.e. {{the de facto}} reference implementation) has been available for some time, but until recently, the license terms severely restricted what could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> without signing (and generally paying for) a contract with Sun. As such these terms did not satisfy the requirements of either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation to be considered open source or free software, and Sun Java was therefore a proprietary platform.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for this album was more {{communal}} {{compared to that}} for Hello Master; Heppner had written much of the band's debut album himself and his bandmates helped him in arranging the material, but the sophomore album featured more contributions from each band member. Nudo once again wrote and sang a song for the record, and although Watchorn did not write the lyrics to an entire song by himself for this album, he and Heppner collaborated on several of them, including [...] "Lady Killer". Watchorn explained that the songs changed drastically between {{the time they were}} first written and when they got recorded, and that the songs [...] "weren't complete until they actually made the record." [...] He also said that the album's protracted production history enabled the group to experiment with the songs and repeatedly alter them to taste, thus ironically yielding a record that was considered better than if they had been able to simply record it and <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> sooner.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{struggling}} to find financial backing for Donnie Darko in Hollywood, director Richard Kelly spent {{a year and a}} half pitching the project to executives. After reading the script, Drew Barrymore agreed to finance the film through her production company Flower Films. Following Barrymore's involvement, Kelly was able to hire several well-known actors—such as Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell and Katharine Ross—and to produce the film for a budget of $4.5million. On January 19, 2001, Donnie Darko made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Despite the film receiving considerable acclaim from critics, distributors felt daunted and were unsure of what could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> With its genre-bending themes and complex plot, it was described as [...] "inaccessible" [...] and [...] "not marketable". After several months it was close to going directly to home video, but was eventually picked up by Newmarket Films and received a wide release on October 26, 2001.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective {{reception}} of the Sega CD is mixed, praising certain titles in its game library but criticizing its low value for money and limitations on the benefits it provides to the Genesis. GamePro listed the Sega CD as the 7th-worst selling video game console of all time, with reviewer Blake Snow noting that [...] "The problem was threefold: the device was expensive at $299, it arrived late in the 16-bit life cycle, and it didn't do much (if anything) to enhance the gameplay experience." [...] Snow went on to note, however, that the Sega CD did have in its library [...] "the greatest Sonic game of all time" [...] in Sonic CD. IGN's Levi Buchanan criticized Sega's implementation of CD technology for the Genesis, noting, [...] "What good is the extra storage space if there is nothing inventive to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it?</b> No new gameplay concepts emerged from the SEGA CD—it just offered more of the same. In fact, with few exceptions like Sonic CD, it often offered some of the 16-bit generation's worst games, like Demolition Man." [...] Jeremy Parish of USgamer pointed out that [...] "Sega was hardly the only company to muddy its waters with a CD add-on in the early '90s" [...] and highlighted some [...] "gems" [...] for the system, but cautioned [...] "the benefits offered by the Sega CD had to be balanced against {{the fact that the}} add-on more than doubled the price (and complexity) of the [...]" [...] Writing for Retro Gamer, Damien McFerran cited various reasons for the Sega CD's limited sales, including the add-on's high price, lack of significant enhancement to the Genesis console, and lack of ability to function without a console attached. Retro Gamer writer Aaron Birch, however, defended the Sega CD and wrote that [...] "the single biggest cause of the Mega-CD's failure was the console itself. When the system came out, CD-ROM technology was still in its infancy and companies had yet to get to grips with the possibilities it offered... quite simply, the Mega-CD was a console ahead of its time." ...|$|E
