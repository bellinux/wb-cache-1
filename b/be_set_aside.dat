5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held that the trial judge made an error in accepting GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was built under a self-imposed comprehensive minority contracting {{and affirmative action}} package that met the city's 1985 30% hiring rule for public sector projects. Chicago mayor Harold Washington's administration had passed an edict that 30% of the work for public sector projects <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for minority and women-owned businesses. In a show of support for this rule, Stein & Co. and AT adopted the rule for their private development.|$|E
5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside.</b> Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E

5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks {{to play with the}} cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E

5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> to be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|In March 1609, Duke John William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg died childless. Both Duke Wolfgang William of Palatinate-Neuberg and Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg {{claimed the}} territories. In the {{subsequent}} succession chaos, the Order fell into disuse. By the late 17th century, the Duchy of Jülich {{passed into the}} jurisdiction of the Prince-Elector Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Neuberg, who descended from a cadet branch of the Palatine line of the House of Wittelsbach. In May 1708, he restored the Order of Saint Hubert and assumed the position of grand master for himself. To reward loyalty and service, he conferred the cross of the Order on several of his courtiers. He also gave the recipients generous pensions on the condition that a tenth <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for the poor, and a significant sum be distributed on the day of their reception into the order.|$|E

5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} Bristol's main {{shopping}} area should be {{moved away from}} the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. They suggested that the pre-war shopping area should <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and that the central shopping area should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal of the shopping area was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{settled the}} lawsuit on July 25, 2011, and a {{majority}} of players signed union authorization cards. The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. Under the agreement, which runs through 2021, revenue sharing, the most contentious issue during the lockout, was re-designed so that the players must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on the amount of money given to rookies. Fifty million dollars was set aside annually for medical research and approximately $1 billion would <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> for retired player benefits {{over the life of the}} agreement.|$|E

5|$|The chronicler Symeon of Durham {{asserted}} that when St-Calais was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Thomas of York, {{he managed to}} avoid professing obedience to the archbishop, which, if true, would have freed St-Calais from interference in his diocese. After his appointment, St-Calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of secular clergy with monks, and consulted the king and Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, before going to Rome to receive permission from Pope Gregory VII. These consultations, and the conditions within his diocese, may have kept St-Calais from visiting Durham until some time after his elevation. In 1083 he expelled the married clergy from the cathedral, and moved a small community of monks from Bede's old monastery at Jarrow to Durham, to form the new chapter. This community had been founded at Jarrow by Reinfrid, a Norman ex-knight and monk of Evesham Abbey, and Eadwine, an English monk from Winchcombe Abbey. After the community had settled in Durham, St-Calais named Eadwine as prior, and arranged for lands to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>aside</b> to support the monks. The expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house, but only one actually joined.|$|E
