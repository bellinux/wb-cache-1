6000|$|... 'Only if I had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> long. I {{said we had}} <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> a good bit, and {{had been}} hauling goods to the camps where we had been. I did not give any time, {{but it was a}} long list of camps, and they must have {{reckoned}} we had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> some months. One of them said something about a reference, so as to be sure that I should bring the goods here when I got them, but I said--Reference be blowed. We had been hauling out here long enough, and as we had got a waggon and team it weren't likely we were going to risk them and being shot {{for the sake of a}} few pounds' worth of goods: so they did not say anything more about it. I said my mate was going to work here and was going to buy a claim, and that satisfied them a bit. I suppose you are going to have your grub here at one o'clock?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three eggs," [...] said he. [...] "I think Dorothy has not <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to-day. That is the {{beginning}} of your profits. You can take two of them; we have to leave one for the nest-egg." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Say, what do {{you know}} about this?" [...] he exclaimed, turning to his companions. [...] "Those four young Rovers <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> right by the window!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{is it you}} <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> still? This <b>is</b> Thursday, isn't it? We {{meant to}} have been half way home, to be {{in time for the}} matches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't seem {{to place}} it somehow," [...] said Prescott in alarm, seeing {{that if he were}} called upon to share any more reminiscences it might lead him into difficulties. [...] "You know I've <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> some time," [...] James replied. [...] "My name is Walsham. I believe I was gazetted to your {{regiment}} {{some months}} ago, but I only {{heard the news}} on my arrival at New York last week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --GIT up, you old cow! {{stumbling}} {{like that}} when we've just been praising you! out on a scout and can't {{live up to the}} honor any better than that? Antonio, how long have you <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> in the Plains and the Rockies?" ...|$|E
50|$|Executions <b>are</b> carried <b>out</b> <b>here.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She met you, at the Fergusons', {{just for}} a moment, when she <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> last autumn. What really nice and simple people the Fergusons are, with all their money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are awfully good," [...] said Cicely, [...] "but {{you must}} {{agree with me}} more prudently now that we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and I will not tell mother until Miriam knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be very}} hard, at any rate, for any of them to beat you," [...] {{said the}} tutor. [...] "Since I have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> I have seen no one adopt their ways with half as much grace as you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the air does it," [...] {{explained}} Biggs, when Darry {{spoke about}} the speed. [...] "After you've <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> a while you'll eat like a horse and feel like walking ten miles every morning before breakfast. I tell you, the air is wonderful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Phillips is killed," [...] Mr. Blount said, as he {{examined}} the body. [...] "The spear has gone right through his throat. Fortunately he was a single man. He has only <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> a few months, and was staying down at Dick Caister's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{struck the}} nail on the head, lad. And why not, seeing as how we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> in {{fighting}} waters, and with no ship of our own to go aboard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{made up my}} {{mind that}} 'most {{everybody}} knew I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> on your case," [...] the amateur detective said, as if speaking to himself, and Plums asked, in surprise: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kells, I'm much obliged," [...] replied Cleve, with {{a semblance}} of earnestness. [...] "I'm no good or I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here...</b> But I can't stand for these--these deals with girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{nothing but}} a damned official. But you're not a bad fellow; when you've <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{a year or two}} you'll be all right. What's wrong about you is that you won't drink. You wouldn't be a bad sort if you got soused once a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wondered. Mr. Parr was there; I'm told--and he's {{never been}} known to desert St. John's except on the rarest occasions. But oh, Mr. Hodder, I must congratulate you on your {{influence}} with Alison. When she has <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> before she never used to come to church at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but I think {{a letter}} {{sent to a}} certain address in Paris will be {{forwarded}} to him. To tell the truth, I have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> so long I have partly lost track of him. He will be amazed to hear from you, I am sure, and Laura will be surprised, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew them}} all once," [...] Edgar said. [...] "We were at school together. I {{did not know}} that any of them <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> I would not have them {{recognize}} me for anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we {{had better}} come to an understanding," [...] said Dan Baxter, as he warmed his hands. [...] "We all know what we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for, {{so there is no}} use in mincing matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; of course, {{the lines}} can be run again by any one; {{but there must}} be a scheme in it, for Mr. Wright wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> unless {{something}} could be gained by it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are dreaming, man. You have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> eight years; {{she was a}} {{child of}} ten when you left England! You {{certainly}} have not seen her, and as I know pretty well every woman who has been in this station for the last five or six years, I can answer for it that you have not seen anyone in the slightest degree resembling her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so, sir," [...] Tom said; [...] "we {{have had}} {{very little to do}} during the six months we have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> except to learn the {{language}} of the country, and I think now we could pass very well as Spanish boys. Besides, who would suspect boys? We are quite ready to chance detection if we can be allowed to go." ...|$|E
60|$|AN {{awful thing}} has happened! My friend, Private Mulvaney, who went {{home in the}} Serapis, time-expired, not very long ago, has come back to India as a civilian! It was all Dinah Shadd's fault. She could not stand the poky little lodgings, and she missed her servant Abdullah more than words could tell. The fact was that the Mulvaneys had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> too long, and had lost touch of England.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} {{feel as though}} it were," [...] he answered. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> this morning, when the wind was at play," [...] and he pointed with his whip at a fantastic snowdrift, [...] "before I saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said (his {{invariably}} preliminary jocosity {{at every}} call I made), [...] "I suppose you <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> making kodak {{pictures of the}} mountains. It's the wrong {{time of the year}} to buy any hardware, of course." ...|$|R
50|$|Prospecting <b>was</b> carried <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for copper, {{silver and}} stone coal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so, too, Mike. I {{have only}} <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for two years, and yet I am {{beginning}} to feel that I should like a quieter life. No doubt {{the loss of my}} hand {{has something to do with}} that, but I would give up, willingly, all chance of ever becoming a colonel, if I could but settle down in the old country, though I fear there is very little chance of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would never}} have made a good servant of the Company, for he so hated his work that, when he had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> about a year, he tried to blow out his brains. He snapped the pistol twice at his head, but it didn't go off, though it was loaded all right. Strange, wasn't it? So {{he came to the}} {{conclusion}} that he wasn't meant to kill himself, and went on living till something should turn up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Let Harry {{wait till}} tomorrow. I shall be seeing the king this evening. He is always {{interested}} in adventure, and I will tell him the whole story, {{and ask him to}} write a few lines, saying that Harry and Carstairs are young officers who have borne themselves bravely, and to his satisfaction. It may help with the duke, and will show, at any rate, that you have both <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and not intriguing at Saint Germains.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{how can you}} be a captive," [...] eagerly {{interrupted}} the girl--"when you <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> on the lake, in father's best canoe, and the Indians are in the woods with no canoe at all? That can't be true, Deerslayer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it any use my {{stopping}} {{here any}} longer?" [...] Jim Allen cried from the bow; [...] "because if not I will come aft to you. It {{is a good}} deal warmer sitting together than it <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have come}} for Maxon," [...] growled the creature. [...] "We have been penned up long enough. We want to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> We {{have come to}} kill Maxon and you and all who have made us what we are." ...|$|R
