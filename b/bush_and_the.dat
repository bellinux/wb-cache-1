They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not {{speak to each other}} again for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909, the Woman’s Club {{purchased}} {{an option}} to buy the property on {{the southwest corner of}} Winter and State streets for $5500, which was located across State from Willson Park (a city park at that time). This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000, and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women’s Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel <b>Bush)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Woman’s Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Power {{transformer}} {{is the key}} {{equipment in}} power system. In view of {{the issues of the}} current bushing monitoring method, a new detection method of bushing insulation defects is proposed in this paper. According to the internal structure of bushing, the internal insulation defects are divided into three categories, including partial moisture, pollution, local insulation defects, the outer insulation of the bushing is equivalent to a resistance chain model. The entire bushing insulation is considered as a parallel between inner insulation and external insulation (inner Insulation is the main). This detection makes uses of the transient voltage measured from transformer <b>bushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> transient current measured from the end shield down-lead as the signal source. The reference data dynamically generated is used to diagnosis and distinguish Insulation defects of Transformer bushing, according to the monitoring data of <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> maximum of the reference data, the type of <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> insulation defect <b>and</b> <b>the</b> severity can be sentenced. A large number of simulation results initially confirmed <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>and</b> feasibility of <b>the</b> proposed method...|$|R
