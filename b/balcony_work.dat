40|$|This {{project is}} aiming to {{reduction}} of energy demands, and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} consequently, by achieving less heating demand and higher thermal comfort for residential buildings. The choice of refurbishment as the best solution for that is investigated. For {{the needs of the}} project, a case study was used, carefully chosen to be representative and of common detailing, so the solutions proposed can be implemented to more buildings. The criteria for the refurbishment measures that were investigated were mainly: not extreme costs, comfort for the residents during the construction and the possibility to generalize the solution for more buildings. CAPSOL models were created for the calculation of the heating demand in the exiting situation and the refurbishment solutions. The result of this modeling was that the building has to be fully refurbished in order for it to achieve both high thermal comfort and low heating demand. Passive measures, like second skin façade and closed-off <b>balcony,</b> <b>work</b> better than external insulation, especially if they are south oriented. The greenhouse gas emissions were calculated both form the heating demands and by calculating the embedded energy of the materials used in each refurbishment solution. Again, the passive measures were more efficient because glass and steel are much less environmentally-costly materials than aluminium frames and external insulation. Also, geothermy {{played an important role in}} reducing the emissions greatly. Structural and Building EngineeringStructural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
50|$|Among his masterworks is {{a series}} of wall frescoes of figures in quadratura <b>balconies,</b> <b>works</b> that were part genre, part courtly conceit. He later {{completed}} a fresco cycle for the Villa Soderini-Berti, in Nervesa near Treviso. He was strongly influenced by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his works. He was a founding academic of the Accademia of Venice.|$|R

5000|$|Today Colombo is {{probably}} best remembered for La Casa de los Pavos Reales at 3216-36 Rivadavia and Casa Calise at 2562-78 H.Yrigoyen [...] Those of his Art Nouveau style buildings that still remain are easily recognized by their abundance of lion heads, <b>balconies,</b> iron <b>work,</b> cherubs, female heads and caryatids, turkeys, falcons and dragons.|$|R
50|$|The marble {{used for}} the {{counters}} and floors was variegated Escolette imported from France while woodwork was made of polished black walnut. Large clocks, with dials of escolette were centered in <b>balcony</b> grill <b>work</b> {{at each end of}} the main lobby. Offices were located on each balcony. The basement housed the vaults and recreation rooms for employees while the fourth floor contained offices and a large club room for employees.|$|R
50|$|The movie's script, {{loosely based}} on the Jean Genet play The <b>Balcony,</b> was the <b>work</b> of consummate {{television}} writer B. W. Sandefur, who also wrote for such shows as Barnaby Jones, Little House on The Prairie and Charlie's Angels.|$|R
25|$|The citadel's {{architecture}} is Indo-sarcenic with intricately carved arches and <b>balconies.</b> Fine lattice <b>work</b> adorns windows and murals. There are some Islamic inscriptions on the arches of the fort. The palace contains royal suites, the imperial court, halls and a prison.|$|R
50|$|Other Broadway {{credits include}} Saravà, Lend Me a Tenor, and Golda's <b>Balcony,</b> William Gibson's <b>work</b> about the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. Golda's Balcony {{set a record}} as the longest-running one-woman play in Broadway history on January 2, 2005.|$|R
50|$|Norwood Gardens’ {{homes were}} {{designed}} to provide circulating fresh air and sunlight. The interior floor plans maximized use of space, making the homes attractive to families.The exterior design is a lively combination of white stucco and red tapestry brick. The mortar {{is a mix of}} bright white lime with a quartz aggregate that sparkles and accentuates the brick. Additional architectural elements include iron <b>balconies,</b> lattice <b>work,</b> green blinds, cement flower pots on the roof, red Italianate tiles, planter supports in the shape of lambs heads and a variety of architectural medallions embedded in the brick.|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} was {{exhibited in the}} 1869 Paris Salon along with Manet's The <b>Balcony,</b> another <b>work</b> that lacked a simple genre affiliation, and in which {{at least one of}} the figures seems to confront the viewer as if challenging the [...] "fourth wall". Both pieces were found wanting by art critics of the day; by this time a common criticism of Manet was that his goal was to [...] "attract attention at any price". The reviewer Jules-Antoine Castagnary criticized the two paintings in a quote that well reflects the conventional expectations of a painting in this period, just before the further turbulence that Impressionism brought upon art: ...|$|R
5000|$|Apart from carved columns, {{the palace}} is {{distinguished}} by two finely <b>worked</b> <b>balconies</b> in dark wood. These balconies (or miradors) adapt the European architecture to vernacular Peruvian tradition. The interiors feature Sevillian tiles, plasterwork, wooden columns, lobed Moorish arches and soaring coffered ceilings. It {{is considered to}} have a true [...] "Limeño" [...] architectural originality, harmoniously combining Andalusian, Moorish, Criollo and Asian features.|$|R
5000|$|Several Goodwin {{prints are}} in the {{collection}} of the National Portrait Gallery in London, as is a picture of him, with Muhammad Ali and John Conteh. The 1999 Icons of Pop exhibit included his photographs of Sandie Shaw and Tom Jones. In 2003, after John Lennon had been voted No. 10 (by national vote) from [...] "one hundred Britons", a Goodwin portrait of Lennon was selected for inclusion in the NPG/BBC publication Great Britons: The great debate. The 2006 exhibit Beatles on the <b>Balcony</b> featured Goodwin's <b>work.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interiors}} of Anhalt apartments feature amenities and design details that were uncommon in apartments of the time. Many Anhalt apartments featured built-in refrigerators, electric dish washers, wood-burning fireplaces, high ceilings, hand-carved woodwork, and double floors for soundproofing. Although individual apartments were not exceptionally large, many featured individualized floor plans and amenities more {{commonly found in}} single-family homes: upper and lower levels connected by curved interior staircases, private <b>balconies,</b> glazed tile <b>work,</b> and stained-glass window panes. The 25-unit Ten-O-Five apartment building, completed in 1930, was the first apartment building in Seattle to feature an underground parking garage.|$|R
50|$|Hornig’s art {{considers}} {{the built environment}} and incorporates everyday architectural elements like doors, walls, and windows, as well as industrial materials such as concrete. These appear in both sculpture and site-specific installations. One 2002 sculptural <b>work,</b> <b>Balcony,</b> installed a full stucco balcony - complete with a drying towel - floating above {{the floor in a}} gallery. In a 2005 Lisbon exhibition, Hornig created a “stone” wall out of newspaper and glue, extending along and reflecting in a glass gallery wall of windows. One major site-specific work is the Glass Façade Project, or Das Glasfassaden-Projekt, which in 2005 provided a large installation for an elementary school building at Pfeuferstraße 1, in Munich’s Sendling district. The project features silkscreen printed with transparent colors on safety glass. Brightly colored balloons, bookshelves, and seemingly billowing white sheets appear on the façade of the urban school. The silkscreened images are visible from inside the glass façade and outside of it. In certain works that incorporate architectural elements, she simplifies and omits details like door handles and adjusts an item’s scale in order to transform a recognizable object into a sculpture.|$|R
