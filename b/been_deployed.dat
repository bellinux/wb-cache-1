5|$|The {{continuing}} high operational {{tempo of}} the Army after East Timor further emphasised {{the need to}} develop the capability of the Army Reserve. Since then increasing numbers of Reservists have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> overseas in varying capacities as well as undertaking periods of full-time service in Australia to maintain capabilities within Regular units heavily committed to deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. In lower intensity areas, such as East Timor and the Solomon Islands, formed units of Reservists raised from personnel drawn from many units, have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> on peacekeeping duties to relieve the pressure being placed upon the Regular Army and allowing them to focus on the higher intensity combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to this Australian Army Reserve units have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> on border security duties with the Royal Australian Navy as part of Operation Relex, as well as participating regularly in multinational exercises such as Rifle Company Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it.

5|$|Shed Light’s Second phase {{eventually}} {{turned out}} {{to be based on the}} B-57. B-57 aircraft had already <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> to southeast Asia and had been the subject of initial sensor evaluations under Tropic Moon II.

40|$|United Nations (UN) peacekeepers tend to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> to ‘hard-to-resolve’ civil wars. Much less {{is known}} about where peacekeepers <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> within a country. However, to assess peacekeepers’ {{contribution}} to peace, it matters whether they <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> to conflict or relatively safe areas. This article examines subnational UN peacekeeping deployment, contrasting an ‘instrumental’ logic of deployment versus a logic of ‘convenience’. These logics are evaluated using geographically and temporally disaggregated data on UN peacekeepers’ deployment in eight African countries between 1989 and 2006. The analysis demonstrates that peacekeepers <b>are</b> <b>deployed</b> on the frontline: they go where conflict occurs, {{but there is a}} notable delay in their deployment. Furthermore, peacekeepers tend to <b>be</b> <b>deployed</b> near major urban areas...|$|R
50|$|Railway {{artillery}} {{became a}} permanent {{part of the}} CA, but <b>was</b> not widely <b>deployed.</b> All 47 8-inch railway guns <b>were</b> <b>deployed,</b> but only 16 of the 91 12-inch railway mortars <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> at any one time.|$|R
5|$|A {{detachment}} of four Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft provided air defence for the US military {{base on the}} island of Diego Garcia during the campaign against the Taliban, which was called Operation Slipper. The initial detachment was provided by No. 77 Squadron RAAF between December 2001 and 10 February 2002. This detachment was replaced by a detachment from No. 3 Squadron RAAF which was deployed between 10 February 2002 and 20 May 2002. No further Australian units have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> to Diego Garcia. The United States Air Force commented favourably on the RAAF contingent's professionalism during this deployment.|$|E
5|$|As part of Commodore Richard Dale's Mediterranean Squadron, Enterprise had <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> {{with the}} American force blockading the Vilayet of Tripoli. Enterprise, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Andrew Sterett, had been sent by Commodore Dale to gather {{supplies}} at Malta. While cruising towards Malta, Enterprise engaged Tripoli, commanded by Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous. Tripoli put up a stubborn fight, and the engagement lasted for three hours before the polacca was finally captured by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, SS-Nordland and SS-Westland {{had become}} {{the basis for the}} {{formation}} of the fourth division, SS-Division Wiking. Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve in the Allgemeine SS at Berger's instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger's unit had <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> to the area of occupied Poland, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.|$|E

5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Months later, on 20 January 1818, Marques de Sousa was enlisted {{into the}} army as a cadet in the 1st Regiment of Light Cavalry in the Division of Royal Volunteers.

5|$|Next {{came the}} bomb-laden strike {{aircraft}} protected by escort fighters (Combat Air Patrol or MIGCAP) and electronic jamming aircraft to degrade enemy radar. New ECM devices had hurriedly <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> to protect aircraft from missile attacks, but they remained subject to frequent breakdowns because of climate conditions in Southeast Asia. Also {{included in the}} missions were KC-135 aerial tankers and Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters, which were, in turn, protected by propeller-driven A-1 escorts.|$|E

5|$|On 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces invaded East Timor. Operasi Seroja (Operation Lotus) was {{the largest}} {{military}} operation ever carried out by that nation. Troops from Fretilin's military organisation Falintil engaged ABRI forces {{in the streets of}} Dili, and reported 400 Indonesian paratroopers were killed as they descended into the city. Angkasa Magazine reports 35 dead Indonesian troops, and 122 from the Fretilin side. By the end of the year, 10,000 troops occupied Dili and another 20,000 had <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> throughout East Timor. Massively outnumbered, Falintil troops fled to the mountains and continued guerrilla combat operations.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, and would have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> near {{the anniversary of the}} killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E
5|$|The Gneiss-2 {{airborne}} radar was evaluated in the Pe-3 beginning in July 1942 {{and it was}} sent to both Moscow and Stalingrad for combat trials in late 1942. Another round of trials was conducted by aircraft of the 2nd Guards Fighter Corps of the PVO in Leningrad between February and May 1943 and it was approved for service the next month. Very few appear to have <b>been</b> <b>deployed</b> as only fifteen were fitted on Pe-3s.|$|E

50|$|During initial testing {{before the}} {{missiles}} <b>were</b> <b>deployed,</b> 26 of 32 missiles (81%) were successfully launched. While the systems <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> from 1961 to 1975, 225 of 311 launches (72%) were successful.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to budget}} restrictions, only one squadron, the 106th, <b>was</b> <b>deployed</b> to France. On 27 October twenty RF-84F's <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> to Dreux, {{arriving}} on 3 November. In addition, two T-33As and one C-47 <b>were</b> <b>deployed</b> as support aircraft.
