5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas <b>Becket,</b> over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and <b>Becket</b> contended over the question, with the bishops supporting <b>Becket</b> against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to <b>Becket</b> from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to <b>Becket</b> in after the Council of Westminster to urge <b>Becket</b> not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped {{he would be able to}} influence <b>Becket.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} as a master of arts in Paris for over forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas <b>Becket.</b> <b>Becket</b> had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that <b>Becket</b> urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There {{is some evidence that}} Pope Alexander III had a hand in Robert's election, as <b>Becket</b> in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E
5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the <b>Becket</b> dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to <b>Becket,</b> to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but <b>Becket</b> was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of <b>Becket,</b> and to keep <b>Becket</b> from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E

500|$|After <b>Becket's</b> death his {{sentences}} of excommunication were confirmed, {{as well as}} the suspensions from ecclesiastical office. The pope in his confirmation referred to Roger of York, Foliot, and Josceline of Salisbury, as the [...] "Gilbertine trinity". The excommunication was absolved for Foliot on 1August 1171, but he remained suspended from office. He secured his restoration to office on 1May 1172, after clearing himself of any involvement in <b>Becket's</b> murder. The king performed a public act of penance on 12July 1174 at Canterbury, when he publicly confessed his sins, and then allowed each bishop present, including Foliot, to give him five blows from a rod, then each of the 80monks of Canterbury Cathedral gave the king three blows. The king then offered gifts to <b>Becket's</b> shrine and spent a vigil at <b>Becket's</b> tomb.|$|R
5|$|Baldwin {{attracted}} the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the <b>Becket</b> controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas <b>Becket</b> the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against <b>Becket.</b> Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of <b>Becket.</b> John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from <b>Becket</b> to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the <b>Becket</b> dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>Becket</b> {{returned}} to England, on 1 December 1170, he excommunicated Roger, {{as well as}} Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of Lincoln and Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury. After <b>Becket</b> landed in England the three excommunicates went to <b>Becket</b> and asked for absolution, but while <b>Becket</b> was willing to absolve Gilbert and Josceline, he insisted that only the pope could absolve an archbishop. Roger persuaded the others that they should stick together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E
5|$|During {{the great}} dispute between <b>Becket</b> and the king, Foliot was reviled by <b>Becket</b> and his supporters. He acted as an envoy {{for the king}} {{on a number of}} {{diplomatic}} missions related to this dispute and wrote a number of letters against <b>Becket</b> which were circulated widely in Europe. <b>Becket</b> excommunicated Foliot on two occasions, the second of which precipitated the archbishop's martyrdom. For a short period following Becket's death the papacy kept Foliot excommunicate, but he was quickly absolved and allowed to resume his episcopal functions. In addition to his role in the <b>Becket</b> controversy, Foliot often served as a royal judge, and was an active administrator and bishop in his different dioceses. He was a prolific letter writer, and some of his correspondence was collected after his death. He also wrote sermons and biblical commentaries, two of which are extant.|$|E

5|$|Late in December 1164 de Broc {{was one of}} {{the royal}} {{officials}} who took possession of the archiepiscopal residence at Lambeth for the king as well as arresting the relatives, clerks, and members of the household of <b>Becket</b> who had aided Becket's flight into exile. In June 1166 <b>Becket</b> excommunicated de Broc for his part in administering the archiepiscopal estates for the king while <b>Becket</b> was in exile. <b>Becket</b> again excommunicated de Broc in April 1169, along with Robert de Broc {{and a number of other}} royal officials.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1170, de Broc was {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} keep <b>Becket</b> from returning to England. Working with de Broc were Roger de Pont L'Évêque– the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot– the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon– the Bishop of Salisbury, Gervase de Cornhill– the Sheriff of Kent, and Reginald de Warenne. De Broc was part of the party that met <b>Becket</b> at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The group, led by Gervase of Cornhill, complained that <b>Becket</b> was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury, but <b>Becket</b> managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the three excommunicated ecclesiastics, but nothing was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from <b>Becket</b> to consider other options.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{wrote his}} Life and Miracles of St Thomas of Canterbury around 1173 to 1174. Though lost, {{it is one}} of the main sources for an Icelandic saga on <b>Becket</b> {{entitled}} Thómas saga Erkibyskups, which survives in a copy dating from the first half of the 14th century. This saga preserves a number of otherwise unknown details about Becket's life and remains one of the main sources for <b>Becket</b> studies. Robert's life also was a source for the work of Benet of St Albans, another biographer of <b>Becket.</b> A modern historian partially reconstructed Robert's biography from these sources. A major source for Robert's work on <b>Becket</b> was the writings of John of Salisbury. A modern biographer of <b>Becket,</b> Frank Barlow, speculates that Robert's biography was lost because it favoured the king's side of the story, rather than Becket's.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>Becket's</b> death his {{sentences}} of excommunication were confirmed, {{as well as}} the suspensions from ecclesiastical office. The pope in his confirmation referred to Roger of York, Foliot, and Josceline of Salisbury, as the [...] "Gilbertine trinity". The excommunication was absolved for Foliot on 1 August 1171, but he remained suspended from office.

The king then offered gifts to <b>Becket's</b> shrine and spent a vigil at <b>Becket's</b> tomb.|$|R
5000|$|In 1220, <b>Becket's</b> {{remains were}} {{translated}} {{from his first}} tomb to the finished chapel. As {{a result of this}} event, the chapel became a major pilgrimage site, inspiring Geoffrey Chaucer to write The Canterbury Tales in 1387 and with routes (e.g. from Southwark (Chaucer's route) and the Pilgrim's Way to/from Winchester) converging on the cathedral. <b>Becket's</b> shrine stood until it was destroyed in 1540. This was done on orders from King Henry VIII as vengeance for his ancestor, Henry II. The king also destroyed <b>Becket's</b> bones and ordered that all mention of his name be obliterated. The pavement where the shrine stood in the chapel is today marked by a lighted candle. Modern day archbishops of Canterbury celebrate the Eucharist at this place to commemorate <b>Becket's</b> martyrdom and the translation of his body from his first burial place to this chapel.|$|R

5|$|After {{the bishops}} refused to pass judgment, the barons {{attempted}} to do so, but <b>Becket</b> refused to hear the court and left the council without the king's permission. Soon afterward, Foliot, along with Hilary of Chichester, went to <b>Becket</b> and suggested a compromise, which <b>Becket</b> refused. <b>Becket</b> went into exile after this last attempt at a settlement, and arrived in Flanders on 2November 1164. Foliot was sent, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hilary of Chichester, Bartholomew Iscanus, the Bishop of Exeter, Roger of Worcester, the Bishop of Worcester, William d'Aubigny, the Earl of Arundel, {{and a group of}} royal clerks, to Thierry the Count of Flanders, Louis VII the King of France, and Pope Alexander III. Their mission was to prevent the archbishop from being given refuge, but despite their efforts Louis of France agreed to grant <b>Becket</b> refuge. Foliot's delegation met with more success at the papal court; although they did not succeed in securing a decision in the king's favour, neither did the pope side with the archbishop.|$|E
5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent Barre on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with <b>Becket.</b> The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom <b>Becket</b> had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than <b>Becket.</b> When <b>Becket</b> protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1162 Chesney {{was summoned}} to Normandy by the king, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, and Hilary of Chichester, in order to lend their support to the {{election}} of Thomas <b>Becket</b> to the see of Canterbury. In July 1163, Chesney {{was present at the}} royal court held at Woodstock Palace, which included the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, the prince of Northern Wales Owain Gwynedd, and King Malcolm IV of Scotland. The two Welsh princes and the Scots' king did homage to Henry II while at this court. In 1163 Chesney was excused from attending a papal council at Tours because of his health, but he attended the royal councils of Clarendon and Northampton in 1164, which dealt with the growing dispute, now known as the <b>Becket</b> controversy, between the king and <b>Becket.</b> At those councils Chesney attempted to persuade <b>Becket</b> to compromise, but was unsuccessful. The king subsequently sent Chesney to northern England as an itinerant justice in 1166.|$|E

50|$|During Thomas <b>Becket's</b> archiepiscopate, {{the dispute}} flared up again, {{with the added}} {{complication}} of an attempt by Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, to have his see raised to an archbishopric, basing his case on the old Gregorian plan for London to be {{the seat of the}} southern province. Foliot was an opponent of <b>Becket's,</b> and this fed into the dispute, as well as <b>Becket's</b> legateships, which specifically excluded York. When Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York, crowned Henry the Young King in 1170, this was a furthering of the dispute, as it was Canterbury's privilege to crown the kings of England.|$|R
5|$|Early in Becket's exile, Robert {{received}} a papal censure {{for not doing}} more to support <b>Becket.</b> In summer 1165, Robert accompanied Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, on a papal mission to King Henry, to convey to the king Pope Alexander's complaints about the king's behaviour. The king had been preventing his subjects from visiting or appealing to the papacy, and Alexander wished to protest against that, as well as against the king's treatment of <b>Becket.</b> In 1166, <b>Becket</b> tried to convince Robert to switch sides, writing to Robert in conciliatory tones. John of Salisbury, a supporter of Becket's, prevailed upon two French academics to write to Robert, criticising him for hypocrisy.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{appears as}} a {{character}} in several modern plays and films. He is a central character in James Goldman's 1966 play The Lion in Winter, set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king although, as Goldman acknowledges, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional. The Lion in Winter {{has proved to be}} an enduring representation of Henry, being turned into an Academy-Award-winning film and remade in 2003 for television. Henry also appears in the play <b>Becket</b> by Jean Anouilh, filmed in 1964; once again, however, the character of the King is deliberately fictitious, driven by the need for drama between Henry and <b>Becket</b> in the play. The <b>Becket</b> controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and <b>Becket</b> form the basis both {{for a discussion of the}} more superficial events of Becket's death, and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Henry and <b>Becket</b> quickly {{disagreed}} over {{a number}} of issues, including Becket's attempts to regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while <b>Becket</b> maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, <b>Becket</b> temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E

5|$|In 1170, Gervase was {{involved}} with attempts to keep Thomas <b>Becket,</b> {{who had been in}} exile, from returning to England. Working with Gervase were Roger de Pont L'Évêque the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury, Reginald de Warenne the Sheriff of Sussex, and Ranulf de Broc. Gervase was part of the party that met <b>Becket</b> at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The lay members of the group, led by Gervase, complained that the archbishop was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the three ecclesiastics who were with the group, but <b>Becket</b> managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the ecclesiastics who had been excommunicated by <b>Becket.</b> Nothing further was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from <b>Becket</b> to consider other options. Afterwards, Gervase and Ranulf de Broc tried to discover which of the citizens of London had welcomed <b>Becket</b> back into the kingdom, but were frustrated by refusal of the London clergy to appear and by the laymen refusing to answer to anything but royal writs.|$|E
5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's case against <b>Becket</b> {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with <b>Becket</b> on 18November, it quickly became apparent that <b>Becket</b> would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel <b>Becket</b> to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said <b>Becket</b> was free to return at any time, but {{would still have to}} answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused <b>Becket</b> of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase <b>Becket</b> had made of the chancellorship, although {{there is no evidence that}} <b>Becket</b> bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against <b>Becket.</b>|$|E
