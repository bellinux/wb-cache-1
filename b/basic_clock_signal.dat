50|$|One {{method of}} dealing with the {{switching}} of unneeded components is called clock gating, which involves turning off the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> to unneeded components (effectively disabling them). However, this is often regarded as difficult to implement and therefore does not see common usage outside of very low-power designs. One notable recent CPU design that uses extensive clock gating is the IBM PowerPC-based Xenon used in the Xbox 360; that way, power requirements of the Xbox 360 are greatly reduced. Another method of addressing some of the problems with a global <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> is the removal of the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> altogether. While removing the global <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> makes the design process considerably more complex in many ways, asynchronous (or clockless) designs carry marked advantages in power consumption and heat dissipation in comparison with similar synchronous designs. While somewhat uncommon, entire asynchronous CPUs have been built without utilizing a global <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> Two notable examples of this are the ARM compliant AMULET and the MIPS R3000 compatible MiniMIPS.|$|R

40|$|Most digital {{circuits}} use a <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> to synchronize operations, {{the so called}} synchronous circuits. Although this <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> makes the design convenient, especially since practically all commercial EDA tools assume a synchronous design, some advantages can be exploited when using asynchronous circuits; circuits without <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> Those advantages can include typical case performance, low power consumption, less sensitive to variability, lower EMI admittance and protection against differential power analysis attacks. Disadvantages of asynchronous circuits include the lack of EDA tools, their sensitivity to hazards {{and in some cases}} performance loss. In this thesis, an asynchronous implementation for a scheduled data flow graph is proposed. This type of circuit contains a lot of operations with different latencies. Thus, the faster operations are delayed by the <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> in the synchronous case. Performance benefits could be gained when using asynchronous circuits instead of a <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> In this case, handshake signals are used to indicate the completion of an operation, instead of a <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> An asynchronous LWDF filter is synthesized.

30|$|The CU also {{internally}} communicates {{with every}} module in sequence for efficient data transfer with the card. The common signals {{for all the}} modules are Reset, CS, and <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> The CS and <b>clock</b> <b>signals</b> are also supplied to the card via multiplexer. Once Reset signal is received by CU, it issues a START signal to the CINM along with the <b>clock</b> <b>signal.</b> CU also issues START and <b>clock</b> <b>signal</b> for the other modules when {{they are about to}} initiate their action. In idle state, no clock is received by the modules and thus they work in power saving mode.
