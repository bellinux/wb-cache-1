40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} beams {{are designed}} to resist bending due to applied moments; however it is equally important to design them for shear {{in order to avoid}} sudden failure due to shear forces. This paper aims at studying the effectiveness and feasibility of the use of independent bent-up bars systems as shear reinforcement. The proposed systems are to replace the conventional stirrups and stand alone as shear reinforcement. The effect of different parameter involved in the shear phenomenon were reviewed in order to better understand the behavior of reinforced concrete beams when exposed to shearing forces. For verification, a beam with conventional stirrups was used as a control specimen to which the results obtained were compared. As was expected, all the proposed systems provided better shear resistance than the control; beam, this can be seen by the maximum loads at which they failed, the less cracks formed in the shear spans and by the type of failure where they all failed in bending except for specimen B 6. B 1 failed at load 220 kN, this beam was the control beams reinforced in shear with R 6 - 50 mm links. B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5 and B 6 failed at 245 kN, 230 kN, 230 kN, 240 kN and 240 kN, respectively. Specimen B 2 was reinforced with least amount of shear reinforcement of all the specimens, about 20 percent less than the control specimen, yet showed the highest resistance and the highest ductility where it failed at load 240 kN and a maximum deflection of 24. 51 mm. Similarly specimen B 4 failed at 230 kN and had relatively high ductility where the maximum deflection occurred at failure was 21. 71 mm. On the other hand B 3, B 5 and B 6 still provided more shear resistance than the control beam, however showed very low ductility where the beams failed at maximum deflections of 10. 5 mm, 9. 91 mm and 10. 22 mm, respectively. All in all, independent <b>bent-up</b> <b>bar</b> systems are effective in resisting shear and hence; should be used on their own and not only if combined with stirrup...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> were {{extensively}} used as {{shear reinforcement}} in beams and slabs {{from the first}} R/C developments up to the 1970 ’s. Their use was justified {{by the fact that}} they allowed enhanced development of the tensile reinforcement at the same time they acted as shear reinforcement. New reinforcing bars (with reduced development lengths) in combination with shear reinforcing systems led however to the abandon on their use. Recently, interest has again grown on the use of <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> in flat slabs. This is explained by their efficiency both as shear reinforcement (alone or in combination with stirrups) and as integrity reinforcement. In this paper, the results of 7 full-scale specimens (3. 0 × 3. 0 × 0. 25 m) reproducing the support region of an actual flat slab with different layout of <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> are presented. The tests show different potential failure modes and allow understanding the contribution of this reinforcement to the shear-carrying capacity of the specimens. Additionally, the performance of <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> as integrity reinforcement is discussed with reference to 9 half-scale specimens (1. 5 × 1. 5 × 0. 125 m) where the influence of the development conditions of the <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> is clearly assessed.

40|$|Shear {{failure of}} {{reinforced}} concrete beams is often sudden and catastrophic. This sudden failure, due to shear, made {{it necessary to}} explore more effective ways to design reinforced concrete beam for shear. The reinforced concrete beams show different behavior at the failure stage in shear compare to the bending, which {{is considered to be}} unsafe mode of failure. The shear cracks progressive rapidly without sufficient advanced warning, and the diagonal cracks that develop due to excess shear forces are considerably wider than the flexural cracks. The cost and safety of shear reinforcement in reinforced concrete beams led to the study of other alternatives. <b>Bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> have been used in the past. New form of <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> will be used. Cross bars will be welded to these <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> making rectangles capable of resisting shear in a plane compared to single bar performance. The main purpose is to identify the most efficient shape to carry shear forces at the lowest cost. Several reinforced concrete beams were carefully prepared and tested in the lab. The results of these tests will be presented and discussed. The deflection of each beam is also measure at a given applied load. The propagation of shear cracks was also closely monitored...|$|R
40|$|Shear {{failure in}} beams {{are caused by}} {{diagonal}} cracks near the support. Any form of effectively anchored reinforcement that intersects these cracks {{will be able to}} resist the shear stress to a certain extent. This project presents the results of an experimental investigation on six reinforced concrete beams in which their structural behaviour in shear were studied. All the beams were cast with the same grade of concrete, and provided with identical amount of main reinforcement. In order to investigate the contribution of the additional horizontal and independent <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> to the shear carrying capacity of the beam, two specimens each were provided with horizontal longitudinal <b>bars</b> and <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> in the high shear region. Two different quantities of additional bars in each of these cases were adopted. The fifth specimen was provided with sufficient amount of shear reinforcement in terms of vertical links, while the other one was cast without any shear reinforcement to serve as control specimens. The performances of the beams in resisting shear in the form of deflection, cracking, strain in the shear reinforcement and ultimate load were investigated. The results show that the shear capacities of the beams with additional horizontal and independent <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> larger than 1. 2 % of their cross-sectional area are higher than that of the conventionally designed beam with vertical links. It may therefore be suggested that these types of shear reinforcement be used to ease the congestion of links near the supports...|$|R
30|$|In the {{research}} {{presented in this}} paper, {{the density of the}} foam concrete varies from 800 to 1600  kg/m 3, which provide a good range of compressive and shear strengths. The connectors were placed between the two cold-formed thin-walled C steel embedment. This type of connectors is different to the normal connectors such as studs, channels and <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars,</b> which are widely used in the past. Its structural form is similar to batten plate or lace bar of the double-limb lattice column in the steel structure, which can effectively improve the overall stability between the two C-Channels. While it is used in the composite structures, it also can effectively improve the shear resistance of the composite members. The positions of connectors are set between flanges or webs. On the other hand, the relative thin wall thickness of C-Channel enables uses the self-drilling screws on the fast installation without drilling or welding. Laboratory push-out tests have been carried out on foam concrete and C-Channels with shear connectors to study the increasing of shear bearing capability.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{reinforced}} concrete patterns used in many countries until the First World War was the system of François Hennebique (1842 - 1921). The best known characteristics of the Hennebique design, which was used in buildings as well as in bridges, are the monolithic structure with continuous T-beams reinforced with <b>bent-up</b> <b>bars</b> overlapping the supports and the use of flat open U-shaped stirrups as transversal reinforcements. The reasons for the success of his company have been extensively studied. However, so far, the assessment of the carrying capacity of the system remains incomplete. The first part of this paper deals with the results of experimental bending tests up to failure performed on three full-scale T-beam segments removed from a narrow gage railway viaduct built in Braine-l'Alleud (Belgium) in 1904. They aim at identifying the mechanisms of failure. The second part of the paper presents retrofitting actions to counteract the observed principal structural weakness-the too short overlapping length of the tensile rebars over the supports.
