5000|$|Cannel coal or candle coal, {{is a type}} of {{bituminous}} coal, also {{classified as}} terrestrial type oil shale. [...] Due to its physical morphology and low mineral content cannel coal is considered to be coal but by its texture and composition of the organic matter it is considered to be oil shale. [...] Although historically the term cannel coal has been used interchangeably with <b>boghead</b> <b>coal,</b> a more recent classification system restricts cannel coal to terrestrial origin, and <b>boghead</b> <b>coal</b> to lacustrine environments.|$|E
5000|$|Torbanite, {{also known}} as <b>boghead</b> <b>coal,</b> is a variety of {{fine-grained}} black oil shale. It usually occurs as lenticular masses, often associated with deposits of Permian coals. [...] Torbanite is classified as lacustrine type oil shale.|$|E
50|$|Bathvillite is a {{naturally}} occurring organic substance. It is an amorphous, opaque, and very friable material of fawn-brown color, filling cavities in the torbanite or <b>Boghead</b> <b>coal</b> of Bathville, Lothian, Scotland. It has a specific gravity of 1.01, and is insoluble in benzene. It may resemble wood {{in its final}} stage of decay.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{extraction}} of {{oil on the}} shores of the North Sea dates back to 1851, when James Young retorted oil from torbanite (<b>boghead</b> <b>coal,</b> or oil shale) mined in the Midland Valley of Scotland. Across the sea in Germany, oil was found in the Wietze field near Hanover in 1859, leading to the discovery of seventy more fields, mostly in Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic reservoirs, producing a combined total of around 1340 m³ (8,400 barrels) per day.|$|E
50|$|As {{the price}} of whale oil escalated, {{scientists}} tried to create a cheap, artificial oil that would burn with a bright, smokeless flame, safer than “burning oil.” Two succeeded: Scottish chemist James Young, and Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner. Both distilled their lamp oils from coal or coal-like raw materials. James Young made his from coal, and discovered that the coal that yielded the most oil was cannel coal. Young filed a patent for his process in 1850, and built a highly successful plant at Bathgate, Scotland making an illuminating oil he called “paraffine,” from the cannel coal that was mined nearby, the <b>Boghead</b> <b>coal,</b> which yielded more oil {{than any of the}} other coals he tested.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Coal {{artifacts}} are occasionally excavated by archaeologists from Thule culture settlements (c. A. D. 1100 – 1700) in the Canadian Arctic and Alaska. This {{study examines}} two such artifacts from a Thule settlement {{located on the}} east coast of Axel Heiberg Island, Canada. One specimen has a petrographic composition typical of a cannel shale, in which sporinite is the most abundant organic constituent; the other is characterized by Botryococcus-alginite bodies typical of a <b>boghead</b> <b>coal.</b> Nearby exposures of Tertiary coal are generally woody and are not known to contain boghead layers or cannel shales. It is suggested that these artifacts may have their origin in Alaska, where <b>boghead</b> <b>coal</b> and cannel shales show strikingly similar petrographic features. Key words: Arctic Canada, Axel Heiberg Island, Thule culture, coal artifacts, coal petrology, archaeology RÉSUMÉ. Il arrive que des artefacts de charbon soient mis à jour lors de fouilles archéologiques dans les sites de peuplement de la culture Thulé (v. 1100 - 1700 apr. J. -C.) dans l’Arctique canadien et en Alaska. La présente étude se penche sur deux de ce...|$|E
