6000|$|The {{armed men}} {{broke into a}} rabble, flung down their weapons, and fled back towards the town-house. Here they almost ran against the {{soldiers}} in the square, who again forced them into the brae. Finding themselves about to <b>be</b> <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> the two forces, some crawled through the hedge, where they were instantly seized by policemen. Others sought to climb up the hillock and then escape into the country. The policemen clambered after them. The men were too frightened to fight, but a woman seized a policeman by the waist and flung him head foremost among the soldiers. One of these shouted [...] "Fire!" [...] but the captain cried [...] "No." [...] Then came showers of missiles from the women. They stood their ground and defended the retreat of the scared men.|$|E

5000|$|Naramata would {{occasionally}} carry passengers (maximum 22) {{up or down}} Okanagan Lake, but she was mainly employed as a tugboat for the Canadian Pacific Railway. CPR tugboats not only pushed and pulled barges filled with valuable goods, but in the winter months they would often work as icebreakers, {{clearing the way for}} other larger and often wooden-hulled passenger ships. Naramata would often run ahead of Sicamous with crew members leaving a cardboard trail as a way to mark the clear path. More commonly, however, was the barge service. CPR tugboats could push up to two barges at once, and with barges capable of holding up to ten railcars at one time this was no small feat. When transporting two barges, Naramata would <b>be</b> <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> them from astern, resulting in a [...] "V"-shape that allowed for easy maneuvering. Alternately, barges could also be pulled from behind the tugs.|$|E

30|$|Several {{mechanical}} {{approaches to}} remove screw remnants can be employed. Generally, after identifying {{the position and}} condition of the screw remnant, it can be carefully removed using manual instrumentation. A fine-tipped hand instrument may <b>be</b> <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> screw and implant. If this fails to do the trick, {{the use of a}} round burr applying occlusal pressure and turning counter clockwise may loosen the fragment. When a flared burr is wedged between implant and screw remnant, the drill should make a clockwise action, to direct the screw in the counterclockwise direction. Cutting a deep slot in the screw and subsequently removing it with a bladed screw driver has also been advised. The use of rotary instrumentation may cause damage to the cranial inner portion of the implant body. If that occurs, even when the fragment (finally) loosens, it will not screw out, and this complicates matters considerably.|$|E
40|$|The strings which {{correspond}} to the circled pitches are to be prepared with dimes. These notes on the piano have three strings per note, so the dime may <b>be</b> <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> the three strings. The pitches created will be lower than the written pitch. The target created pitches for d, e# and f% are a, c# and d respectively. The dimes may be adjusted {{along the length of}} the string to achieve these target pitches. The strings which {{correspond to}} these circled pitches (which are an octave above where written) should be prepared with the rubber insulation of a wire. The insulation should be stripped from the wire and then a cut must be length-wise along one side of the remaining insulating tube. These tubes will be wrapped around each of the three strings which create these pitches. The target pitches for c, e, and fare a, c# and d respectively. The pitches may be adjusted by altering the length of the insulation added to the strings, but these pitches may be slightly out of tune to create a more abstract prepared sound...|$|E
