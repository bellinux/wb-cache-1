What have Hanno and his friends done that you should listen to him? It is their incapacity which has lost Carthage so many of its possessions. It is their greed and corruption which place such <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> backs. They claim that they are generous. It is easy to be generous with the money of which they have plundered you; but let them know your will, and they must bend before it.

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the debate on the best way to reduce the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> the production sector in Brazil, by simulating an overlapping generations model calibrated to the country's economy. Our focus is on the comparison of the macroeconomic and welfare impacts brought about by policies that reduce the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> labour and policies based on the reduction of the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> capital. According to our results, reducing the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> capital may lead to substantial gains in terms of capital accumulation and GDP relative to reducing the <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> labour. Both types of policies must generate welfare losses to elderly generations alive when the reform takes place and welfare gains to future generations, but the effects on intermediate generations may differ substantially under each policy...|$|R
3000|$|The ITEP {{analysis}} {{indicates a}} very strong positive correlation between the <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> adjacent segments of the income distribution. The correlation between the <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> the top 5 percent and the next 15 percent is [...]. 92. This strong correlation means that higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> the next 15 percent in some states than others are not an indication of greater tax regressivity {{at the top of}} the income distribution. Hence, the revenue-dampening effect of higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> the next 15 percent cannot be interpreted as an effect of regressivity on tax volatility. We suspect that the result is related to the very weak correlation between next- 15 burdens and changes in AGI.|$|R

I would jog beside you, taking the strain a little from your aching shoulders; and we would walk nodding, our heads side by side, and you, remembering, should tell me of the fields where long ago you played, of the gallant races that you ran and won. And you, little pinched brats, with wondering eyes, looking from dirt-encrusted faces, I would take you {{in my arms and}} tell you fairy stories. Into the sweet land of make-believe we would wander, leaving the sad old world behind us for a time, and you should be Princes and Princesses, and know Love.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the comparison {{and development of the}} tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> labor costs in the European Union countries, with subsequent evaluation of the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> income of individuals in the Czech Republic, especially in the years 2005 - 2013.

Using the implicit tax rate on labor, there is an international comparison of the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> the income of the individual countries of the European Union and subsequently the position of the tax <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> labor costs in the Czech Republic is evaluated, there was found out a significantly highly above average tax burden in comparison with the European Union countries.

I tell you you can't do it. A fellow has no more right to get rid of obligations than he has to run away without paying his debts. It would be a <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> mind if you had a heavy debt you couldn't pay, and you would {{have a right to be}} angry if, when you were perfectly able to pay, your creditor refused to take the money. That's just the position in which you've placed my father. Well, anyhow, you've got to come and see him, or he's got to come and see you. I know he has something in his mind's eye which will just suit you, though he did not tell me what it was. For the last day or two he has been particularly anxious about finding you. Only yesterday when I came back and reported that I had been to half a dozen places without success, he said, 'Confound the young rascal, where can he be hiding? Here are the days slipping by and it will be too late. If you don't find him in a day or two, Dick, I will set the police after him--say he has committed a murder or broken into a bank and offer a reward for his apprehension.' So you must either come home with me this afternoon, or you will be having my father down here tonight." ...|$|E

It will also increase beneficial bacterias in your digestive system and help you to maintain a balance of bacteria {{and the production of}} stomach acid. Moreover, it will help you to prevent severe from diseases like cancer. Fermented food is not just directly beneficial, but also indirectly benefits us by helping us absorb the nutrients we’re consuming. Traditional fermented food help the body produce acetylcholine. It is also beneficial for people with diabetes. Fermented foods have been broken down or “pro-digested.” As a result, they do not put an extra <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> digestion system unlike ordinary carbohydrates.

50|$|The {{income levels}} {{associated}} with different time periods throughout American history {{are an important}} part of how econography works from a historical standpoint. After the obvious adjustment for inflation, a better perspective can be seen on the financial standing of that time period. This allows people of today to accurately measure just how bad the Great Depression would be in the present day environment. When given these modified figures, people can more easily conclude the depth of despair that the people living in this time had to endure on a daily basis. For example, today, a loaf of bread today can be obtained for under a dollar at the right location; however, during the Great Depression that same loaf of bread may have cost about eight cents. The value of eight cents compared to a dollar today would hold little to no merit as time, as well as prices, have changed. Now apply the inflation. The eight-cent loaf of bread becomes much more than a dollar and a greater <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> checkbook. The quality of the bread of the Great Depression is also below the margin of today's cheaper and more efficiently made counterpart. This example illustrates how econography can be used to show differences in not only location but also in generations and in times of increased hardship.|$|E
