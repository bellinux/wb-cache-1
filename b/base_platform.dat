5|$|One of {{the best}} {{preserved}} phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath {{the final version of}} the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the <b>base</b> <b>platform</b> up to the roof comb, including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the sky deity Itzamna in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes anthropomorphic mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Copán valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration — vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Copán site museum.|$|E

These <b>base</b> <b>platform</b> features, plus the ability to dramatically extend them all through substantial chip upgrades inside of each cartridge, represent a leap over the 8-bit NES generation and some supposed significant advantages over 16-bit competitors such as the Genesis.|$|E
500|$|Usually, {{only the}} podium or <b>base</b> <b>platform</b> used stone, with the upper parts {{of wood and}} mud-brick, greatly {{reducing}} what survives for archaeologists. [...] However, there is evidence for the portico columns sometimes using stone, as at Veii. [...] This has left much about Etruscan temples uncertain. The only written account of significance on their architecture is by Vitruvius (died after 15 BC), writing some two centuries after the Etruscan civilization was absorbed by Rome. He describes how to plan a [...] "Tuscan temple" [...] {{that appears to be}} a Roman [...] "Etruscan-style" [...] ("tuscanicae dispositiones") temple of a type perhaps still sometimes built in his own day, rather than a really historically-minded attempt to describe original Etruscan buildings, though he may well have seen examples of these.|$|E

500|$|The Minar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: Mīnār-ĕ Pākistān) or Tower of Pakistan is a 60metre tall {{concrete}} minaret in Iqbal Park in Lahore. The Minar {{was built}} on the site where the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding the creation of Pakistan. Pakistan now celebrates this day as a national holiday each year under the name of Pakistan Day which is also the day in 1956 when the country became the first Islamic Republic in the world. It was designed by Muhammad Wali Ullah Khan and built by Mian Abdul Khaliq Company. The base of the tower is raised about 4metres from the ground. The next 13metres form a sculpted, flower-like base and from this point the Minar tapers as it rises. The <b>base</b> <b>platform</b> is shaped like a five-pointed star and it encloses crescent shaped pools. It is constructed of reinforced concrete, with the floors and walls rendered in stone and marble.|$|E
500|$|The Xbox 360 was set as Oblivions <b>base</b> <b>platform,</b> {{being the}} [...] "easiest to develop for", {{in the words}} of Pete Hines; the PC, being more like a [...] "random {{amalgamation}} of graphics cards and RAM and processors", and poorly [...] "defined". As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like high dynamic range rendering and specular mapping. The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's Gamebryo engine, [...] "tricked out" [...] in collaboration with Bethesda's graphics programmers and NDL. Cheng has described the game as [...] "pixel-shader heavy", taking advantage of the feature in rendering [...] "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin," [...] in addition to water, which was the only use Morrowind made of the technology. In particular, Oblivion uses normal maps, diffuse maps, specular maps, and parallax maps, which Howard described as [...] "kind of like displacement mapping". Oblivion makes use of Radiant AI, a new artificial intelligence system that allows non-player characters to dynamically react and interact with the world around them. General goals, such as [...] "Eat at this city at 2pm" [...] are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how to achieve them. The absence of individual scripting for each character allowed {{for the construction of a}} world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aided in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an [...] "organic feel" [...] for the game.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, Web <b>based</b> <b>platforms</b> {{are quite}} common in any university, {{supporting}} a very diversified set of applications and services. Ranging from personal management to student evaluation processes, Web <b>based</b> <b>platforms</b> {{are doing a}} great job providing a very flexible way of working, promote student enrolment, and making access to academic information simple and in an universal way. Students can do their regular tasks anywhere, anytime. Sooner or latter, it was expected that organizations, and universities in particular, begin to think and act towards better educational platforms, more user-friendly and effective, where students find easily what they search about a specific topic or subject. Profiling is one of the several techniques that we can use to discover what students use to do, by establishing their user navigation patterns on Web <b>based</b> <b>platforms,</b> and knowing better how they explore and search the sites‟ pages that they visit. With these profiles Web <b>based</b> <b>platforms</b> administrators can personalize sites according with the preferences and behaviour of the students, promoting easy navigation functionalities and better abilities to response to their needs.
