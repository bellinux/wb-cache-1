5000|$|Economic {{development}} incentives {{have come}} under close scrutiny from many quarters. They question the economic <b>benefit</b> to <b>public</b> <b>bodies</b> and local communities, and {{the wisdom of the}} public policies, promoting them. Some suggest that most incentives are relatively modest in relation to the incentivized business activity and, therefore, have no demonstrative impact on the recipient’s decision making. [...] As a corollary, some argue economic development incentives merely facilitate the relocation of a private enterprise’s business or employment from one venue to another venue, and do not foster any new meaningful business activity. [...] Under this line of reasoning, a recipient can relocate essentially the same operation from one community to another community in a jurisdiction by taking advantage of the other community’s ad valorem property tax incentive program. The incentive, in effect, cannibalizes the public resources of the jurisdiction at the expense of affected taxing districts.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{report is}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 33 - 34). The procurement system of the Re-public of Bangladesh {{is a combination of}} centralized and decentralized systems. Centralized procurement can enhance the achievement of the following: (i) cost reduction through economies of scale; (ii) product and service standardization; (iii) quality optimization of products and services procured; (iv) knowledge sharing among specialists, resulting in better use of human resources. It also shows that centralized procurement tends to <b>benefit</b> small <b>public</b> <b>bodies,</b> allowing them to acquire better products at a lower cost and to allocate their limited human and financial resources in sectors more directly related to their core competencies. Public procurement is a major function of government in both developed and developing countries. Transparency, efficiency, accountability, competitiveness, equitable treatment and free & fair competition are essential to be ensured in the procurement using public funds. In Bangladesh, these could not be ensured earlier {{due to a lack of}} proper rules and regulation. To streamline the public procurement activities, the Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh has enacted Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2006 and thereafter issued Public Procurement Rules (PPR) 2008. Since then government agencies are bound to abide by the Act and Rules very strictly in their procurement activities. BRRI is an autonomous organization. The research has been designed under the questions if BRRI is following PPR 2008. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect primary data from different employs related to procurement activities of BRRI and contractors. The study result shows Centralized procurement can enhance the cost reduction, product and service standardization, product and service standardization quality and optimization.
