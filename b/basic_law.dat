The <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> outlines the responsibilities and processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific {{to be considered a}} constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment.|$|E

5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National Security) of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> aroused strong {{suspicion}} among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private property on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E

The Hong Kong <b>Basic</b> <b>Law,</b> based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990. The expiry of the 1898 lease on the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.|$|E

5|$|Hong Kong {{enjoys a}} high degree of {{religious}} freedom, guaranteed by the <b>Basic</b> <b>Law.</b> Hong Kong's main religions are Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism; a local religious scholar in contact with major denominations estimates there are approximately 1.5 million Buddhists and Taoists. A Christian community of around 833,000 forms about 11.7% of the total population; Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics by a ratio of 4:3, and smaller Christian communities also exist, including the Latter-day Saints and Jehovah's Witnesses. The Anglican and Roman Catholic churches each freely appoint their own bishops, unlike in mainland China. There are also Sikh, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and Bahá'í communities. The practice of Falun Gong is tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's <b>Basic</b> <b>Law,</b> {{implemented}} in the territory on 1 July 1997, consists of outstanding articles which require bill adoption by the Legislative Council before becoming effective laws. Two {{of the most prominent}} articles include Article 23 ("National Security") and universal suffrage of Chief Executive elections. In 2002, the government's motion of an anti-subversion bill pursuant to Article 23, was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Reform bills on universal suffrage, however, have made partial progress in expanding the Chief Executive election's committee (from 600 to 800 in 2007 and to 1,200 selected members in 2012) and the Legislative Council (from 60 to 70 seats). These additional 10 seats are created through directly elected members of District Offices.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Lumumba {{hoped that}} the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi-national {{peacekeeping}} force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government to suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining <b>basic</b> <b>law</b> and order. Rejected by both the UN and United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.|$|E

All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.

5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a <b>basic</b> <b>law</b> of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
5|$|Causeway Bay Books (銅鑼灣書店), {{located in}} Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, {{was founded in}} 1994 by Lam Wing-kee. It is one of about 110 {{independent}} Hong Kong bookshops that rent out space in upstairs locations to avoid high rents at street level. The bookstore sells a number of political books that are considered sensitive and banned in mainland China. Freedom of speech in Hong Kong is protected under <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> Article 27, and these independent publishers thrive as they cater predominantly to people interested in the machinations of mainland politics. The bookstore has become popular amongst mainland Chinese tourists for this reason. In 2014, the bookstore was sold to Mighty Current Media Company Limited (巨流傳媒有限公司), a publishing house. During {{the time of the}} disappearances, the company had three shareholders: Gui Minhai, Sophie Choi and Lui Bo. According to industry sources, Mighty Current is a prolific publisher with a number of publishing subsidiaries, and this group may be responsible for 30 to 60 percent of the output of salacious books about Chinese political figures that are widely available at newsstands and in book stores, including one at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E

On December 20, 2015, Pia Wurtzbach won the Miss Universe 2015, making her the third Filipino to win the Miss Universe title following Gloria Diaz in 1969 and Margarita Moran in 1973.

5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong <b>Basic</b> <b>Law</b> as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E

According to Barak's approach, which was adopted by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Revolution brought values such as the Right to Equality, Freedom of Employment and Freedom of Speech to a position of normative supremacy, and thereby granted the courts (not just the Supreme Court) the ability to strike down legislation which is inconsistent with the rights embodied in the <b>Basic</b> <b>Laws.</b> Consequently, Barak held that the State of Israel has been transformed from a parliamentary democracy to a constitutional parliamentary democracy, in that its <b>Basic</b> <b>Laws</b> were to be interpreted as its constitution.|$|R
