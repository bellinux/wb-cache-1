The three dimensional environment more closely mimics what the cells observe in vivo due to the application of mechanical and chemical stimuli in all dimensions 1. Three-dimensional hydrogels can either be made from synthetic polymers such as PEG-DA 2 and PLGA 3 or a number of naturally occurring proteins such as collagen 4, hyaluronic acid 5 or fibrin 6, 7.

Their hallmark is that they contain the so-called “classical” catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad. Although the classical serine proteases are the most widespread in nature, there exist a variety of “nonclassical” serine proteases where variations to the catalytic triad are observed. Such variations include the triads Ser/His/Glu, Ser/His/His, and Ser/Glu/Asp, and include the dyads Ser/Lys and Ser/His. Other variations are seen with certain serine and threonine peptidases of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily that carry out catalysis with a single active site residue. This work discusses the structure and function of these novel serine proteases and threonine proteases and how their catalytic machinery differs from the prototypic serine protease class...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{networks}} are ideal functional materials since they provide mechanical rigidity at low weight. Such structures are omnipresent in natural biomaterials from cells to tissues, {{as well as}} in man-made materials from polymeric composites to paper and textiles. Here, we demonstrate that fibrous networks of the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>protein</b> fibrin undergo a strong and irreversible increase in their mechanical rigidity in response to compression. This rigidification can be precisely predetermined from the level of applied compressive strain, providing a means to program the network rigidity without having to change its composition. To identify the mechanism underlying this programmable rigidification, we measure single fiber-fiber interactions using optical tweezers. We further develop a minimal computational model of adhesive fiber networks that shows that load-induced bond formation can explain the adaptation of the fibrin networks to compressive loading. The model predicts that the network stiffness after compressive programming obeys a universal power-law dependence on the prestress built in by new bond formation, which we confirm experimentally. The generality of this functional stiffening mechanism together with our ability to quantitatively predict it provides a new powerful approach to program the stiffness of fibrous materials and dynamically adapt them to different loading conditions...|$|E

40|$|The project {{objective}} was to characterize stabilization of human recombinant Factor VIII (FVIII) with two surfactants, Pluronic® F- 68 (F 68) and Polysorbate 80 (PS 80). Factor VIII is an essential <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>protein</b> manufactured for treatment of Hemophilia A. Factor VIII has multiple hydrophobic regions requiring the use of amphiphilic molecules, such as surfactants, to stabilize the protein in aqueous solutions. Over half of FVIII produced is lost due to adsorption and aggregation during current downstream processing using PS 80. Du Nouy ring interfacial tensiometry {{was used to measure}} surface tension depression of surfactant samples ranging from 10 - 150 ppm with and without 60 - 70 IU/mL FVIII injected into KG- 2 buffer at temperatures ranging from 4 to 60 °C. Addition of FVIII caused the rate of surface tension depression to increase by 15 % in PS 80 and decrease by 26 % in F 68. Surface tension depression data indicates that PS 80 preferentially binds to the air-water interface while F 68 prefers to associate with FVIII, helping to stabilize the protein in solution and prevent adsorptive and aggregative losses. The results suggest that FVIII yield could be substantially improved by the replacement of PS 80 with F 68 in commercial production...|$|E

However, recent evidence suggests that moderate alcohol intake can actually provide a measure of cardioprotection, particularly against coronary heart disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury. To explore the various dimensions of these opposing actions of alcohol, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a state-of-the-art workshop on “Alcohol and the Cardiovascular System: Research Challenges and Opportunities” in Bethesda, Maryland, in May 2003. Speakers discussed the following topics: the epidemiology of alcohol and cardiovascular disease, clinical manifestations of alcohol, genetics of alcohol and cardiovascular disease, mechanisms underlying the molecular and cellular effects of alcohol, the application of new and emerging technology, and translation from discovery to therapeutic modalities of treatment. The panel concluded that future studies are needed to: 1) determine the role of genes and the environment in assessing mechanisms underlying the benefits of alcohol use and cardiovascular disease risk; 2) define the biological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced peripheral vascular damage; 3) clarify the role of genetic variation in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, genetic susceptibility, and pharmacogenomics in determining cardiovascular disease risk and effective treatment; 4) determine common mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced cardiovascular disease, such as oxidative stress and inflammation; 5) assess the role of insulin resistance, <b>blood</b> <b>clotting,</b> <b>protein</b> kinase C isoforms, and signal transduction mechanisms mediating alcohol’s beneficial effects; and 6) explore the potential of stem cells in myocardial regeneration and repair in hearts damaged by alcohol...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> initiator <b>protein,</b> tissue factor (TF), participates in tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. In addition, a family of G protein-coupled-receptors known as protease-activated receptors (PARs) has also been implicated in tumor biology. These receptors might be activated by blood coagulation proteases thus eliciting a number of pro-tumoral responses, including the expression of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8). Therefore, in this study we analyzed the expression of TF, PAR- 1, PAR- 2 and IL- 8 genes in patients with esophageal cancer, one of the most aggressive neoplastic diseases. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples (tumor and the corresponding normal mucosa) obtained from patients submitted to esophagectomy or endoscopy and further analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase (RT-PCR) and/or real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Expression of full-length transmembrane TF was significantly higher in tumor samples whereas no differences were observed in alternatively spliced TF transcripts. Tumor tissue showed increased mRNA levels for PAR- 1 but not PAR- 2. Remarkably, IL- 8 expression was not detected in most normal tissues but showed very high expression in tumor samples. As expected, qPCR revealed greater differences in the expression pattern of all transcripts analyzed but the general profile was very similar to that observed by RT-PCR. Altogether our data suggest a possible role for <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>proteins</b> in the biology of human esophageal cancer...|$|R

40|$|Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> zymogen that is {{functionally}} defective {{or absent}} {{in patients with}} hemophilia B. A method of immunoaffinity chromatography has been developed for a one-step high yield purification of factor IX directly from plasma. The technique utilizes conformation-specific antibodies that bind solely to the metal-stabilized factor IX conformer, {{but not to the}} conformer of factor IX found in the absence of metal ions. Anti-factor IX-Ca(II) antibodies were immobilized on an agarose matrix. Human plasma in the presence of 7. 5 mM MgCl 2 was applied to the antibody-agarose column.

The addition of protein Ca to citrated whole blood in vitro, with the subsequent neutralization of protein Ca with antibodies, results in increased rates of lysis when plasma made from the treated blood is reinjected into the animal.

SCA function could not be restored by FReDs from human fibrinogen chain genes. However, proteins lacking any FReD still showed some function in both rescue and misexpression experiments, suggesting that putative effector-binding regions lie outside this domain. Consistent with this, proteins expressing only the FReD had no rescuing activity but were recessive negative; i. e., they enhanced the phenotype of sca mutations but had no phenotype {{in the presence of a}} wild-type sca allele.

More recently, {{a number of studies}} have focused on the procoagulant mechanisms exhibited by tumor cells. In the present study, we dissected the molecular mechanisms responsible for the procoagulant activity of MV 3, a highly aggressive human melanoma cell line. It was observed that tumor cells strongly accelerate plasma coagulation as a result of: i) expression of the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> initiator <b>protein,</b> a tissue factor, as shown by flow cytometry and functional assays (factor Xa formation in the presence of cells and factor VIIa), and ii) direct activation of prothrombin to thrombin by cells, as evidenced by hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate, S- 2238, and the natural substrate, fibrinogen. This ability was highly potentiated by the addition of exogenous factor Va, which functions as a co-factor for the enzyme factor Xa. In contrast, prothrombin activation was not observed when cells were previously incubated with DEGR-factor Xa, an inactive derivative of the enzyme. Moreover, a monoclonal antibody against bovine factor Xa reduced the prothrombin-converting activity of tumor cells.
