40|$|A {{district}} heating {{system is a}} centralized heating system widely used for space heating. They offer economic benefits and are acknowledged to be more energy efficient. Their energy efficiency can be further improved by optimally controlling and operating the overall system. With this as the motivation a thermal and hydraulic model of a {{district heating}} is developed in this thesis. The developed model consists of a boiler, six buildings, hot water distribution network, circulating pump, <b>balancing</b> and control <b>valves</b> and terminal heaters. Both dynamic and steady state hydraulic simulations were made to study supply, return water and zone temperature response; Pressure distribution in the piping network under different load conditions. A relationship between <b>balance</b> <b>valve</b> settings and outdoor temperature (heating load) was determined. It was shown that proper setting of <b>balance</b> <b>valves</b> {{as a function of}} heating load improves energy efficiency. PI controllers were designed for the boiler and zone temperature control. Closed loop simulations are presented to show the control performance. By using steady state optimization technique optimal set points for the boiler temperature and near-optimal <b>balance</b> <b>valve</b> positions as a function of outdoor temperature were determined. Simulation results show that the use of optimal set points and <b>balance</b> <b>valve</b> settings up to 20...|$|R

50|$|Larger buildings, such as offices or hospitals, {{have a more}} {{complicated}} heating and cooling system and require a more accurate balancing technique. To obtain a plant with the correct design flows, consultants design systems to include <b>balancing</b> <b>valves,</b> differential pressure controllers or pressure independent control <b>valves.</b> <b>Balancing</b> <b>valves</b> allow the measurement of differential pressures {{which can be used}} to calculate a flow.

50|$|A V port {{ball valve}} has either a 'v' shaped ball or a 'v' shaped seat. This allows for linear and even equal {{percentage}} flow characteristics. When the valve {{is in the}} closed position and opening is commenced the small end of the 'v' is opened first allowing stable flow control during this stage. This type of design requires a generally more robust construction due to higher velocities of the fluids, which might damage a standard valve. These {{can be referred to}} as a type of control valve but are typically not as accurate as a <b>balancing</b> <b>valve,</b> needle valve, globe valve, or pressure regulating valve.|$|R
50|$|After {{several years}} use, even the best-designed and best-built plants can suffer {{operational}} problems.

40|$|Evaporators {{found in}} most HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R {{applications}} use multiple circuits to address the multidimensional optimization problem of cost, capacity, and air-/refrigerant side pressure drop. However, an inherent problem of having multiple refrigerant circuits in evaporators is that maldistribution can occur. This maldistribution can be caused on the refrigerant side by quality and/or mass flow maldistribution at the refrigerant distributor. On the air-side, maldistribution {{can be caused by}} uneven airflow and/or air inlet temperature; on both sides the possibility of uneven fouling exists. To reduce the performance penalties caused by air-side maldistribution, the hybrid control method was used to optimize the refrigerant distribution to individual circuits. The hybrid control uses a primary expansion valve, which provides for most of the pressure drop, and smaller secondary <b>balancing</b> <b>valves,</b> which adjust the individual circuit mass flowrates. This approach was chosen since it is expected that the <b>balancing</b> <b>valves</b> can be manufactured at much lower cost than individual expansion valves for each circuit. In order to assess how severe the influence on maldistribution is, four applications with high potential for air-side maldistribution were selected and investigated experimentally, as well as in simulation studies. ^ Application 1 was a 3 -ton R 404 A walk-in cooler refrigeration system for a storage room with a target temperature of 2 °C (35. 6 °F). It was found that the increasing air-side maldistribution, caused by uneven frost built up over time can lead to severe hunting with liquid overfeed from the evaporator, when using the factory installed thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). An electronic expansion valve (EXV) was used as baseline for the performance evaluations. It was found, that in both the TXV and EXV case, significant refrigerant maldistribution occurred even if the system was tested with no enforced air-side maldistribution. After including the <b>balancing</b> <b>valves,</b> the system coefficient of performance (COP) increased by approximately 4...|$|R
