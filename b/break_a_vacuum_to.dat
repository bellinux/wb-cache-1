5000|$|Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) or Vacuum Injected Molding (VIM) is {{a closed}} mold, out of {{autoclave}} (OOA) [...] composite manufacturing process.

50|$|Locating those {{utilities}} {{was done}} mostly by backhoes or digging by hand. In 1997, Buckner launched Vac-Tron Equipment as a Division of American Manufacturing & Machine.He began educating directional drilling and underground industry leaders about a safer {{way to work}} around underground lines by physically locating them using <b>a</b> technique called <b>vacuum</b> excavation. Today, non-destructive excavating using pressurized water and <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> system <b>to</b> dig precisely is called hydro excavation.

50|$|Another {{observation}} is {{that unless the}} background metric tensor has a global timelike Killing vector, {{there is no way}} <b>to</b> define <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> or ground state canonically. The concept of <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. This is because a mode decomposition of a field into positive and negative frequency modes is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. If t&prime;(t) is a diffeomorphism, in general, the Fourier transform of expikt&prime;(t) will contain negative frequencies even if k > 0. Creation operators correspond to positive frequencies, while annihilation operators correspond to negative frequencies. This is why a state which looks like <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>to</b> one observer cannot look like <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> state <b>to</b> another observer; it could even appear as a heat bath under suitable hypotheses.|$|R
