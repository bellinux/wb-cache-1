5|$|Bloody Fun Day is {{a puzzle}} Flash game {{developed}} <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> Squall {{and published by}} Kongregate on March 12, 2009. Players control one {{of a family of}} three grim reapers and are tasked with moving around an island of hexagonal tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force. Cuties come in four colors. Only the red ones restore life; the others charge special abilities that give the player more ways to kill further Cuties.|$|E
5|$|One Rincon Hill is {{an upscale}} {{residential}} complex on {{the apex of}} Rincon Hill in San Francisco, California, United States. The complex, designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates and developed <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> West Associates, consists of two skyscrapers that share a common townhouse podium. It {{is part of the}} San Francisco Skyline and is visible from Mt. Diablo and Port of Oakland.|$|E
5|$|Portus Abonae was a Roman port at {{the mouth}} which {{provided}} an embarkation point for journeys across the River Severn to South Wales. In the 18th century there were short lived attempts at creating a port and a whale fishery here. The name Trym appears to have Anglo-Saxon roots. In recent years silting problems, caused <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> development have caused some difficulties, but alleviation works have helped reduce the problem.|$|E

5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{has very}} high water quality as far {{downstream}} {{as the old}} Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad corridor. The stream has received little impact from development above the Williams Bridge Reservoir. However, its banks are affected <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> debris such as yard waste {{in some parts of}} its lower reaches. Municipal sewers also sometimes overflow into the stream during rainy conditions. The borough of Moosic has a permit to discharge stormwater into the stream.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in a constant state of repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} reflects Troy's {{evolution from}} its origins as a Hudson River port into an early industrial center built around textile manufacture and steelmaking. During this period it was rebuilt {{twice in the}} wake of two devastating fires, resulting in its mix of architecture styles. After the decline of its industries in the mid-20th century, downtown Troy was threatened <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> renewal efforts that galvanized local preservationists, leading to the early NRHP listings and eventually the creation of the district.|$|E
50|$|Kalutara {{is governed}} <b>by</b> an <b>Urban</b> Council with a chairman.

50|$|The {{district}} formed {{two distinct}} areas: {{to the south}} the parishes of Barton Moss, Davyhulme and Flixton were surrounded to the north <b>by</b> Worsley <b>Urban</b> District and the Borough of Eccles; to the east by the County Borough of Salford; to the south <b>by</b> Urmston <b>Urban</b> District and <b>by</b> the boundary with Cheshire and to the west <b>by</b> Irlam <b>Urban</b> District. The parish of Clifton was a detached exclave to the north adjacent to the urban districts of Kearsley and Swinton and Pendlebury.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} {{developed as a}} demo <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> Squall during the group's annual development meeting, in a San Diego hotel during November 2008. The demo was further tested after the five-day meeting, resulting in the complete game being released during March. The game's theme {{was inspired by the}} short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez, which features a monster that clubs animals to death and is unable to interact with them in any other way.|$|E
5|$|The {{owners of}} the {{building}} defaulted on a $9 million loan from John Hancock Life Insurance resulting in the acquisition of the loan (and thus the property) for an undisclosed amount <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> Street Properties LLC in April 2010. The building had been acquired by the previous owners for $9.5 million in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{search and}} rescue efforts for {{thirteen}} people who were listed as missing through May 7 were assisted <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> {{search and rescue}} dogs from across the country. Nearly 1,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard were deployed throughout the affected region. The American Red Cross had set up ten mobile feeding stations by this time and stated that 30 more were en route. On May 8, a disaster recovery center was opened in Moore for individuals recovering from the tornadoes. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, roughly 500,000 cubic yards (382,277 cubic meters) of debris was left behind and would likely take weeks to clear. Within {{the first few days}} of the disaster declaration, relief funds began being sent to families who requested aid. By May 9, roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance.|$|E

5|$|Deckham's {{history is}} sparsely {{documented}} but {{suggests that the}} settlement was established at the junction of Carr Hill Road and the Old Durham Road in the early 19th century alongside the estate of Deckham Hall, built several centuries earlier and inhabited at one time by Thomas Deckham. The village grew, and {{at the turn of}} the 20th century was enveloped <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> spawl when neighbouring Gateshead absorbed its outlying villages and settlements. Deckham is largely distinguished from other areas by a commercial area on Old Durham Road which is the principal route through the suburb. Historically, Deckham was a village in County Durham and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Square {{released}} an original video animation sequel to Final Fantasy V, simply titled Final Fantasy. Produced by animation studio Madhouse, the anime {{was released in}} four 30-minute VHS tapes in Japan and was set two hundred years after the game. The story focuses on four warriors, one of them the descendant of Bartz, protecting the Wind Crystal from the villain Deathgyunos, who pursues it to achieve godhood. It was localized <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> Vision in 1998 and released in two VHS volumes for North America under the title Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals.|$|E
5|$|In Mahoning County, {{the route}} {{becomes part of}} the eastern city limits of Canfield, meeting US 224 at a parclo interchange. The highway crosses over the Ohio Turnpike, and becomes {{concurrent}} with I-80 few miles later. Here, most of the route is surrounded <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> areas. The interchange with I-80 and I-680 is incomplete, with ramps from I-680 west to I-80 east and I-80 west to I-680 east missing. I-80 and SR 11 travel northeast, leaves Mahoning County, and enters Trumbull County. SR 11 and I-80 split at the interchange at SR 711, east of Girard. This interchange is also incomplete, with ramps from I-80 east to SR 711 south and SR 711 to I-80 west missing.|$|E

5|$|Ingram's refusal allowed Rossy {{to take up}} the bishopric. He was consecrated by 16 July 1380. Oswald {{launched}} an appeal to Clement, but a letter to Thomas dated 29 October 1381, confirmed this had been rejected. A further letter was sent, as follows:To the bishops of St Andrews and Dunkeld. Mandate to enquire into the claim advanced by Oswald, claustral prior of Glenluys, O. Cist., Galloway diocese, to be the true bishop of Galloway in virtue of his election by the chapter of Galloway and subsequent provision made <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> VI. They are to impose silence on him and to put Thomas de Rossy, provided to the bishopric by Clement VII and duly consecrated, into peaceful possession. The cancellation of Oswald's appointment {{does not appear to have}} silenced Oswald, who appears active in England, a kingdom which supported Urban VII.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{smallest}} species have become extinct, requiring vigilance in the conservation of the wild species. Narcissi are increasingly under threat by over-collection and threats to their natural habitats <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> development and tourism. N. cyclamineus has been considered to be either extinct or exceedingly rare but is not currently considered endangered, and is protected. The IUCN Red List describes five species as 'Endangered' (Narcissus alcaracensis, Narcissus bujei, Narcissus longispathus, Narcissus nevadensis, Narcissus radinganorum). In 1999 three species were considered endangered, five as vulnerable and six as rare.|$|E
5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> sprawl.|$|E

5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a combined sewer system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|TMS Entertainment {{adapted the}} manga into a film titled Space Adventure Cobra, which was {{released}} on July 23, 1982, in Japan. It was directed by Osamu Dezaki, with screenplay by Terasawa and Haruya Yamazaki, and retold the Cobra involvement with the Royal Sisters, and his fight against Crystal Bowie. Manga Entertainment released the film in British theaters in 1995. An American dub was created by Carl Macek's Streamline Pictures, and was released in American theaters also in 1995, by Tara, and was later distributed <b>by</b> <b>Urban</b> Vision on VHS format in 1998. The film was later released on DVD in the Australasian region by Madman Entertainment in 2007, in the UK by Manga Entertainment in 2008, and on DVD (in 2012) and Blu-ray (in 2015) by Discotek Media in the US.|$|E
5|$|The land walls {{run through}} the heart of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland {{flanking}} their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed <b>by</b> <b>urban</b> pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.|$|E
