He and his supporters went on to hold a meeting in Brumunddal in August the same year, which resulted in street fights where hundreds of Blitz and other left-wing activists were chased away by his supporters and local youth.

Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> The Rights of Men is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable. She advocates, as one scholar writes, [...] "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence." [...] At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: [...] "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together." ...|$|E

When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will see exactly what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decline of}} Inzunza Inzunza's hegemony in the Sinaloa Cartel began in May 2008 when Édgar Guzmán López, son of [...] "El Chapo" [...] Guzmán, {{was killed by}} gunmen in Culiacán. During that time, the Sinaloa Cartel was engaged in an {{internal}} power struggle with the Beltrán Leyva Cartel. Alfredo Beltrán Leyva was captured by the Mexican Army in January 2008, and his brothers Arturo, Carlos, and Héctor had suspicions that Guzmán had tipped authorities to Alfredo's whereabouts. In an apparent revenge attack, the Beltrán Leyva Cartel reportedly killed Guzmán's son. However, there are also reports that Inzunza Inzunza might have possibly killed Guzmán López after confusing him {{with a member of}} a rival cartel. This episode complicated Inzunza Inzunza's business relationship with [...] "El Mayo" [...] Zambada, who turned his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and refused to give him protection. Around 2010, he was transferred by the top echelons of the Sinaloa Cartel to the states of Baja California and Sonora. His base of operations was in Mexicali, where he coordinated drug trafficking activities. He oversaw Mexicali alongside Cenobio Flores Pacho and/or Luis Fernando Castro Villa (alias [...] "El Checo"), a Sinaloa Cartel associate. The drug lord also oversaw the areas of San Luis Río Colorado, Puerto Peñasco, Nogales, Sonoyta, and Caborca in Sonora. His operational capacity also reached the states of Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Nayarit, Jalisco, and Sinaloa. With the help of his brother, who is identified by Mexican authorities by his alias [...] "El Peque", Inzunza Inzunza received large quantities of narcotics in Sinaloa from South America. He also had three major smuggling routes across Mexico that he oversaw to move narcotics to the United States. The first route was through a smuggling network that started in Venezuela, crossed through Honduras, Costa Rica, and ended in Sinaloa. The second route started in Chiapas and connected that state with Acapulco, Mexico City, Jalisco, and ended in the U.S. The third and final route started in Sinaloa, crossed through Sonora, Mexicali, Tijuana and ended north of the U.S.-Mexico border. Inzunza Inzunza was known for using violence to exercise control in the territories he oversaw for the Sinaloa Cartel to move marijuana and cocaine through the Calexico–Mexicali corridor.|$|E
2500|$|Hatton {{agreed to}} terms on 27 July for an 8 December 2007 welterweight fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. which was {{considered}} to be the biggest welterweight fight since the 1999 clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Puerto Rican legend Tito Trinidad. The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue on 17 August 2007. The fight was agreed to less than three months after Mayweather had said he planned to retire following a victory over Oscar De La Hoya. Hatton was able to bring the fight to Mayweather in the early rounds. In the 1st round, Hatton caught Mayweather with a left jab which knocked Mayweather off balance. His constant pressure appeared to make Mayweather uncomfortable at first. In the third round, Mayweather landed a right that cut Hatton above the right eye. In round six, referee Joe Cortez took a point away from Hatton after he appeared to hit Mayweather {{on the back of the}} head while Mayweather was rested between the ropes. However, the punch was revealed to have hit the rope rather than Mayweather's head, but Hatton was warned for punching behind the head on numerous occasions before the deduction. Hatton became angry at the referee's decision to deduct a point and turned his <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> Hatton later claimed he was angered by the referee, which caused him to lose his calm and contributed to his downfall. Hatton was able to hold his own until round eight, when Mayweather began to adapt to Hatton and started counterattacking. Mayweather knocked Hatton down to the mat in round ten. Hatton got up, but Mayweather quickly resumed his attack, resulting in Joe Cortez putting a stop to the fight and Hatton's corner threw in the towel. Mayweather commented post-match that [...] "Ricky Hatton is one tough fighter. He is still a champion in my eyes and I'd love to see him fight again... Ricky Hatton is probably one of toughest competitors I've faced. I hit him with some big ones but he kept coming and I can see why they call him the 'Hitman'."
