40|$|A method {{with easy}} {{operation}} procedure and simple calibration condition {{is presented in}} this paper to solve the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> calibration problem for cooperative robots. It is carried out through constructing a series of handclasp configurations and recording coordinates of the contact points, respectively, in <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> each robot. Then the rotation matrix and translation matrix between <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> cooperative robots can be calculated which is just the calibration result for cooperative robots. Based on typical installation mode for industrial robot, the floor mounted, wall mounted and ceiling mounted, constraints between <b>base</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> these robots are further explored. These constraints are used to improve the calibration results for <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> calibration problem. In order to validate the correctness and effectiveness of our method, experiments on two industrial robots (Motoman VA 1400 and HP 20) are carried {{out at the end of}} the paper. The calibration errors are less than 8 [*]mm in most cases, which satisfies the requirement of positioning accuracy for most industrial process, such as arc welding, transporting, and cutting.

40|$|Early event-related {{potential}} (ERP) hemispheric asymmetries {{recorded at}} occipitoparietal sites are usually observed following the sudden onset of a lateral peripheral stimulus. This is usually reflected in an onset-locked larger N 1 over the posterior contralateral hemisphere {{relative to the}} ipsilateral hemisphere, an early ERP asymmetry labeled N 1 pc. When the peripheral sudden onset {{is followed by a}} central stimulus, or by a bilaterally balanced visual array of stimuli, these events evoke a reversed N 1 pc, that is, a larger N 1 over the hemisphere ipsilateral to the peripheral sudden onset. This N 1 pc reversal has been taken as evidence for a remapping of the visual space from an absolute, retinally <b>based</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference to a relative, attentionally <b>based</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> reference that codes the spatial positions of objects relative to the peripheral sudden onset, rather than relative to the fovea.

In three experiments, we varied the spatial location of an object relative to a preceding sudden onset, and tested the opposite predictions generated by the frame-remapping and the reduced neural reactivity accounts. Taken together, the results from the present experiments were consistent with the reduced neural reactivity account and inconsistent with the frame-remapping account...|$|R

A planar mirror is maneuvered so as to allow the camera to observe the environment from several viewing angles.

The computed solution is refined using a maximum likelihood estimator, to obtain high-accuracy estimates of the camera-to-base transformation and the mirror configuration for each image.

40|$|When a robot is {{required}} to perform specific tasks defined in the world frame, {{there is a need}} for finding the coordinate transformation between the kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> the robot and the world <b>frame.</b> The kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> used by the robot controller to define and evaluate the kinematics may deviate from the mechanical <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> constructed <b>based</b> on structural features. Besides, by using kinematic modeling rules such as the product of exponentials (POE) formula, the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> can be arbitrarily located, and does not have to be related to any feature of the mechanical structure. As a result, the kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> cannot be measured directly.

A closed-form solution and an iterative solution are explicitly formulated and proved effective by simulations. Comprehensive analyses of the impact of key parameters to the accuracy of the solution are also carried out, providing four guidelines to better conduct practical operations. Finally, experiments on a 7 -DOF industrial robot are performed with an optical tracking system to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method using position data only over the method using full pose data...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} determining the six-degreeof-freedom (DOF) transformation between a camera and a <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> interest, while concurrently estimating the 3 D base-frame coordinates of unknown point features in the scene. The camera observes the reflections of fiducial points, whose base-frame coordinates are known, and reconstruction points, whose base-frame coordinates are unknown. In this paper, we examine the case in which, due to visibility constraints, none of the points are directly viewed by the camera, but instead are seen via reflection in multiple planar mirrors. Exploiting these measurements, we analytically compute the camera-to-base transformation and the 3 D base-frame coordinates of the unknown reconstruction points, without a priori knowledge of the mirror sizes, motions, or placements {{with respect to the}} camera. Subsequently, we refine the analytical solution using a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), to obtain high-accuracy estimates of the camera-to-base transformation, the mirror configurations for each image, and the 3 D coordinates of the reconstruction points in the <b>base</b> <b>frame.</b> We validate the accuracy and correctness of our method with simulations and real-world experiments. ...|$|R

Event-related potentials (ERP) and spatio-temporal current density reconstruction (stCDR) were applied to determine the mechanisms responsible for stimulus encoding. The retention of material-specific representations was investigated using frequency analysis of defined spectra. The encoding of consonants and matrices revealed a prominent P 2 (00) ERP response, the topography of which indicating a frontally initiated process that spread to posterior sites.

The metal-sheathed wooden frame was however so badly damaged, {{that it had}} to be completely built from scratch. A third-class wagon that had been stored at a different location and so had survived the fire, served as a template for the new coach-like wagons that were built by a Meiningen carpenter's shop. The cost ran to about a million euros, of which 200,000 euros was donated by the public. The director of the DB Museum Nuremberg assuaged fears before the reconstruction began that the rebuilding work would not be able to replicate the details of the locomotive damaged by the fire and explained: [...] "No compromises will be made!" [...] It was even more accurately built by using historical drawings, so for example the reconstruction of the chimney damaged in the fire was not based on the 1935 replica, but on the original design.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the control problem of a robot {{manipulator}} for a class of constrained motions in an unknown environment. To accomplish a task in the presence of uncertainties, we propose a new guidance and control strategy based on multisensor fusion. Three different sensors-robot joint encoders, a wrist force-torque sensor and a vision system-are utilized for our task. First of all, a sensor-based hybrid position/force control scheme is proposed for an unknown contact surface. Secondly, a new multisensor fusion scheme is utilized to handle an uncalibrated workcell, wherein the surface on which there is a path to be followed by a robot is assumed to be unknown but visible by the vision system and the precise position and orientation of camera(s) with respect to the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> the robot is also assumed to be unknown. Our work is related with areas such as visual servoing, multisensor fusion and robot control for constrained motion. The main features of the proposed approach are: (i) multi-sensor fusion is used both for two disparate sensors (i. e. force-torque and visual sensors) and for complementary observed data rather than redundant ones as in traditional way; (ii) visual servoing is realized on the tangent space of the unknown surface; (iii) calibration of the camera with respect to the robot is not needed.

40|$|The {{main problem}} that we address in this paper is how a robot {{manipulator}} is able to manipulate a part in a reconfigurable workcell which consists of a moving disc conveyor; a single CCD camera and a robot manipulator. The important assumption that distinguishes our work from what has been previously {{reported in the literature}} is that the position and orientation of the camera and the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> the robot is apriori assumed to be unknown; which is a common case in reconfigurable workcell and is `visually calibrated' during the operation of the manipulator. Moreover the part placed on the conveyor is assumed to be non-planar; i. e. the feature points observed on the part is assumed to be located arbitrarily in R 3. The novelties of the proposed approach in this paper includes a (i) multi-sensor fusion scheme based on complementary data for the purpose of part localization; and (ii) self-calibration between the turntable and the robot manipulator using visual data and feature points on the end-effector. The principle advantages of the proposed scheme are the following. (i) It renders possible to reconfigure a manufacturing workcell without re-calibrating the relation between the turntable and the robot. This significantly shortens the setup time of the workcell. (ii) It greatly weakens the requirement on the image processing speed. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
