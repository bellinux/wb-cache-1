40|$|In {{precious}} metals industry, heat treatments {{play a key}} role in the production process, since the type and the sequence of these treatments produce the right combination of hardness and workability. The production sequence usually involves rolling, plastic deformation, heat treating, and surface finishing. In this work, different heat treatments were performed on samples of 18 Kt 5 N gold–copper–silver alloy, and the evolution of the microstructure and the microindentation hardness was analyzed. The heat treatments were performed after the first and the second rolling process (a softening heat treatment) and before the final surface <b>brushing</b> and <b>polishing</b> (a hardening heat treatment). Two different softening heat treatments were tested: a continuous annealing treatment performed in a belt furnace and a solution heat treatment in static furnace. Two different hardening treatments were studied: an aging heat treatment and a treatment of solubilization followed by an aging treatment. The microstructural observation and mechanical analysis showed that the solution treatment in static furnace produced smaller and more homogeneous grain size than a continuous annealing treatment, whereas the hardness was not reduced. This could be very important because the reduction in the grain size results in a marked decrease in the orange peel defects on the final products. It was also found that between the two hardening treatments, solubilization and aging produced an increase of about 90 HV in the hardness with a significant reduction in the number of superficial defects during the final surface finishing steps. The optimization of the heat treatments, studied in this work, produces a significant decrease in the total number of defects at the end of the production cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The heat {{transfer}} performance of heat exchanger plate decreases {{as time goes}} by. The main reason for this phenomenon is the fouling of the heat exchanger plates. To remove the fouling, we have usually cleaned the plate of heat exchanger using chemicals or <b>polishing</b> <b>brush</b> or cloth with hand after stopping the equipment and disassembling the heat exchanger. However, to clean the plate using these methods, the heat exchanger equipment needs to be stopped and disjointed. In addition, it must be re-jointed after cleaning. Especially, the concern of environmental pollution happens in case of using chemicals. Therefore, {{we need to develop}} an automatic fouling removal equipment which can continuously keep high {{heat transfer}} efficiency and solve the problem of environmental pollution. So, in this paper, we developed and tested the equipment which can clean the fouling on heat exchanger plates automatically per constant period and interval using air bubbles. The total heat transfer coefficient decreased with a slower tendency when using air bubbles compared to the existing methods. There was 10 % higher heat transfer effect air bubbles every 10 minutes for 2 hours to remove the fouling ingredients on the heat transfer surface area concerned to the case without air bubbles after 192 hours...|$|R

Study design: Sixty four cylindrical giomer (Beautifil II, Shofu) samples with a diameter of 6 mm and a height of 2 mm were used. Subsequent to a 3 -month period of storage in distilled water at 37 ºC, the samples were randomly divided into four groups of 16. In group 1 (control), no prophylaxis procedure was carried out. In groups 2 to 4 the samples were exposed to pumice with rubber cup, pumice with brush, and APD prophylaxis methods, respectively. The surface roughness of the samples was measured using a profilometer and the effect of different prophylaxis methods on surface topography was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). All data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Duncan?s post hoc test at a significance level of P < 0. 05. Results: There were statistically significant differences in surface roughness among the groups (P < 0. 0005).

40|$|Background: Surface {{roughness}} {{associated with}} improper finishing/polishing of restorations {{can result in}} plaque accumulation, gingival irritation, surface staining, and poor esthetic of restored teeth. The study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of various finishing and polishing systems and time using various procedures on surface roughness of some esthetic restorative materials. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, samples of two composite materials, compomer and glass ionomer cement (GIC) materials, were fabricated. Finishing and polishing were done immediately (n = 40) and after 1 week (n = 40) using four systems (diamond bur + soflex discs; diamond bur + Astropol polishing brush; tungsten carbide bur + soflex discs; tungsten carbide bur + Astropol <b>polishing</b> <b>brush).</b> Surface roughness was measured using surface profilometer. Data were statistically analyzed by t-test (for each material and time period) and {{one-way analysis of variance}} followed by Tukey's post hoc (for finishing and polishing systems) at a significant level of P Filtek P 90 > Dyract AP, suggesting immediate polishing is better. Among the materials, Filtek P 90 had the least Ra values indicating the smoothest surface among all materials, followed by Z 100, Dyract AP, and GIC. Comparison of polishing and finishing systems irrespective of materials showed that Ra values were lower (P > 0. 05) in diamond + Astropol combination whereas diamond + soflex had the greatest Ra values. Conclusion: It might be concluded that: (i) Filtek P 90 showed least Ra values followed by < Z 100 < Dyract < GIC; (ii) immediate (24 h) finishing/polishing of materials is better than delayed; and (iii) among all these polishing systems, diamond bur–Astropol and Astrobrush showed good surface finish...|$|R

Due to the {{conditions}} {{at the place where}} the finds had been excavated, in the ditch between two walls of the temple where water found its own way to flow along even though filled with layers of soil and rubble (containing archaeological remains), few fragments of metal finds stuck in the vacuum of clay in a layer of soil where they had minimum contact with air and therefore oxidized more slowly. I received bronze material which was compressed within a clod of hardened soil, like a kind of “sandwich”. Only a few-millimetre wide rim of the vessel (Fig. 1) is completely preserved reaching the side that continues into the shallow bottom; together they form round 60 % of the preserved part of the bronze vessel. A precondition for easier conservation of the vessel remains would be separation of bronze sheet from the soil clod. In this respect I determined conservation and restoration phases: - Removal of earth layers - I immerged soil clod with the parts of vessel into a small ultrasound tub filled with distilled water. A part of soil turned into mud and fell off, and the thin bronze sheet was now clean; - Stabilisation of metal surface - I immerged separated parts of the sheet vessel into a wide fire-proof measure filled with distilled water saturated with sodium carbonate NaHCO 3, and put them to simmer on a moderately warm ring. Afterwards, I boiled the complete material one more time in the distilled water, so that the remains of sodium carbonate were neutralised after the previous cooking; - Flattening the dish rim- I warmed the bent edge of rim (softened the structure of the alloy at its critical point at high temperature) and folded it back to the bow direction of the rim line; - Gluing dish fragments - having found the connecting surfaces of sheet parts, I glued them with both quick-drying adhesive and two-component epoxy resin; - Reconstruction and removal of calcite layers - in accordance with the material of the object to be reconstructed (thin bronze sheet) I decided to use thin sheet of brass alloy (Fig. 3), which could easily be folded into a wished shape, and was thinner than the original so that when the whole vessel was reinforced, a few layers of artificial patina/verdigris (Verdigris: a greenish blue substance that forms on the surface of some metals in wet conditions) could be applied. Having additionally reinforced the object, I could more safely remove the remains of calcite film o? the bottom of the shallow vessel; - Fixing artificial verdigris and polishing - I used fine machine <b>brushes</b> to <b>polish</b> the original surface of the vessel in order to make green verdigris lustreless (Fig. 4); - Application of protective lacquer - {{the next step was to}} protect the whole surface of bronze vessel with Paraloid B 72 protective lacquer in Ksilen C 8 H 10 solvent; - Conclusion - all the above mentioned phases of conservation work on the bronze vessel aimed at the reconstruction of the vessel; they should be stressed because these vessel parts were in a very poor condition that they crumbled at a touch. I achieved two crucial things by the reconstruction: I reinforced the old weak material, and visually filled the empty surface of the metal vessel...|$|R
