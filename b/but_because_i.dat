When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance.

500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking. [...] is so in control—I wanted him to break through." [...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the camera, a hole had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|E

Influences of jazz fusion were also noted by a contemporary review by The New York Times. In a 1995 interview with Pulse, Björk {{was reluctant to}} listing other female vocalists as an inspiration, stating: [...] "I've never really compared myself to other people, not because I'm too big-headed or I've got a minority complex, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know I just can't sing like anyone else." [...] Nevertheless, in 2015 Björk acknowledged that as she grew older, she understood [...] "that music like Kate Bush has really influenced [...]" [...] The Pulse article also read: [...] "a lot of Björk's early influences were books (George Bataille's Story of the Eye, Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita) and films (Tampopo, Star Wars, The Tin Drum) available internationally.

By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and [...] Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches. Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate: “I would try to answer, not because of a mental block <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> would {{want to try to}} find solutions to help my team to do it – try to find a different way, try to find the reasons why it goes all the time against my team." [...] He also attempted to play down the significance of the match, given Arsenal had won the previous year's contest but finished third in the league.|$|E
500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of der, die, das, not because I caught them <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> couldn't." ...|$|E

He was educated at Gresham's School, an {{independent}} boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, from 1956 to 1965, when his father died of cancer.

[...] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.|$|E

2500|$|Ballou's antislavery sentiments are {{exemplified}} in his 1843 Fourth of July address entitled [...] "The Voice of Duty," [...] {{in which he}} called on Americans to honor {{the foundations of the}} country by not being selective or hypocritical in their judgment of who should be free: [...] "We honor liberty only when we make her impartial--the same for and to all men." [...] Ballou also responded to those who claimed that abolitionists dishonor the U.S. Constitution, saying that he stood [...] "on a higher moral platform than any human compact." [...] Of the Founding Fathers Ballou stated: [...] "I honor them with all my heart for their devotion to right principles, for all the truly noble traits in their character, for their fidelity to their own highest light. <b>But</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> honor their love of liberty, must I honor their compromises with slavery?" ...|$|E

In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed forward air controllers during ground operations in the Philippines, until it received delivery of P-51s.

I adore melodrama, it's a noble genre, a truly great genre, but I was very clear that I didn't want anything epic, I wanted something else. Simply put, this had to be a very dry, tearless film". In an interview with the BBC, Almodóvar said there were comic situations in rehearsals, but he wanted to set the humour aside: [...] "I wanted something more intense; I wanted something cleaner to make sure the message got through". Almodóvar stated that he wanted to create something more austere and restrained than his previous films; he also reflected on the physical pain he had experienced in the past years which he believed to have inspired him to create a piece about solitude.|$|E
2500|$|On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act {{aimed at}} {{stemming}} veteran suicides.

Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that despite {{his reputation as a}} budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved. [...] “It’s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,” he said. “If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.” Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said “I object, not because I don’t want to save suicides, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don’t think this bill will do the first thing to change what’s happening,” arguing the bill" [...] "throws money and doesn’t solve the real problem" ...|$|E

2500|$|Bridgeman became First Sea Lord in November 1911, and {{allegedly}} [...] "got the job by default. [...] From a thin list, Bridgeman had one unusual {{quality in}} the pre-1914 navy: a willingness to delegate". By October 1912 he had clashed with First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill on technical issues as well as matters relating to a perceived overriding of naval traditions. [...] Churchill's actions were denigrating the authority of senior officers and harming {{the efficiency of the}} service, thought Bridgeman who planned to take his case to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and King George V. Churchill acted on reports of personal correspondence from Bridgeman to other officers concerning his attacks of appendicitis and bronchitis, and advised Bridgeman on 2 December 1912 that his resignation would be accepted. [...] He was replaced that month. It was subsequently acknowledged, in response to questions in Parliament, that the initiative for resignation on grounds of health emanated from Churchill rather than from Bridgeman himself. In the opinion of one historian: [...] "The combination of frequent change and weak appointees (Wilson, Bridgeman and Battenberg) ensured that the professional leadership of the Royal Navy lost its direction in the four years preceding the war." [...] However, others have taken a more nuanced view of these men. Arthur Marder wrote that while Bridgeman and Battenberg [...] "were not especially forceful and allowed Churchill a good deal of rope", Bridgeman [...] "did possess sound judgement and he might have made a moderately successful First Sea Lord had he served under anybody but Churchill." [...] Indeed, it was Bridgeman's efforts to blockade some of Churchill's more controversial schemes that led to his dismissal, as he himself recognized in a letter to Francis Hopwood: [...] "I was forced out without warning, but it was not because I was too weak, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was too strong!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{also saw}} the {{potential}} political changes in the Mideast {{as an opportunity for}} an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative). She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt – [...] "If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible" [...] – as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present Nujood Ali and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age. At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, {{but it is also a}} big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us." [...] She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying [...] "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> see it as [...] to increase security to fulfill American interests.
