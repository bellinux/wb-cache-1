5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation. This low level wind shear can create a large <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E

40|$|A two-blade rotor {{having a}} {{diameter}} of 4 feet and a solidity of 0. 037 was tested in the Langley 300 -MPH 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel to obtain information {{on the effect of}} certain rotor variables on the blade periodic <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and flapping angles during the various stages of transformation between the helicopter and autogiro configuration. Variables studied included collective pitch angle, flapping-hinge offset, rotor angle of attack, and tip-speed ratio. The results show that the blade periodic <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> generally increase with tip-speed ratio up into the transition region, diminish over a certain range of tip-speed ratio, and increase again at higher tip-speed ratios. Above the transition region, the <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> increase with collective pitch angle and rotor angle of attack. The absence of a flapping hinge results in a significant amplification of the periodic <b>bending</b> <b>moments,</b> the magnitudes of which increase with tip-speed ratio. When the flapping hinge is used, an increase in flapping-hinge offset results in reduced period <b>bending</b> <b>moments.</b> The aforementioned trends exhibited by the <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> for changes in the variables are essentially duplicated by the periodic flapping motions. The existence of substantial amounts of blade stall increased both the periodic <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and the flapping angles. Harmonic analysis of the <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> shows significant contributions of the higher harmonics, particularly in the transition region...|$|R
30|$|The {{reaction}} {{forces in the}} stiffeners, with the principle of action and reaction, act in the column’s flanges as concentrated <b>bending</b> <b>moments,</b> similar {{to the case of}} the beam’s flanges. However, these local <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in the column have an opposite direction compared to the local <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in the flange of the beam. For instance, in Fig.  3, the beam’s moment vectors of the flanges are inward oriented, while, in the column, these vectors are outward oriented.|$|R
30|$|Following {{this idea}} {{and by the}} third Newton’s law, the local <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in the column’s flanges have an “incoming” direction, such as the local <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in the beam’s flanges. Therefore, there is no {{inversion}} of the warping and bi-moment direction.|$|R
25|$|By forming slope {{deflection}} equations {{and applying}} joint and shear equilibrium conditions, the rotation angles (or the slope angles) are calculated. Substituting {{them back into}} the slope deflection equations, member end moments are readily determined. Deformation of member is due to the <b>bending</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under these {{simplifying}} assumptions, {{every member}} of the truss is then subjected to pure compression or pure tension forces – shear, <b>bending</b> <b>moment,</b> and other more-complex stresses are all practically zero. Trusses are physically stronger than other ways of arranging structural elements, because nearly every material can resist a much larger load in tension or compression than in shear, bending, torsion, or other kinds of force.|$|E
25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be brake fade - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} and compare <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>moments</b> across mandibular fractures, for different positions of the bite point and different sites of the fracture. Three identical resin mandibles, each with a single fracture, were used. The fracture sites were in the angle, body and symphyseal regions. A polyethylene bone plate was used for fixation. Simulated bite forces were applied at 13 bite points. For each bite point, the displacements of the fragments were registered and converted into <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>moments</b> across the fracture. Positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were defined as those moments that caused compression at the lower border and tension at the alveolar side of the mandible; negative <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> did the opposite, Angle fractures had relatively high positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments.</b> Body fractures had positive as well as negative <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and the highest torsion moments. Symphyseal fractures had negative <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> only and relatively high torsion moments. It was found that angle, body and symphyseal fractures each have a characteristic load pattern. These load patterns should play a decisive role in the treatment of mandibular fractures with regard to number and positioning of plates...|$|R

25|$|Component {{connections}} {{are critical to}} the structural integrity of a framing system. In buildings with large, clearspan wood trusses, the most critical {{connections are}} those between the truss and its supports. In addition to gravity-induced forces (a.k.a. bearing loads), these connections must resist shear forces acting perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} truss and uplift forces due to wind. Depending upon overall building design, the connections may also be required to transfer <b>bending</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{airframe}} of the A330 {{features a}} low-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually {{identical to that}} of the A340. On the A330-300 one engine is installed at the inboard pylon while the outboard pylon position is not used, while for the A340-300 both engine pylons are used, which allows the A340-300 wing to able to sustain a higher (wing limited) MTOW. This is as the A340's two engines at each wing provide a more equal force distribution (engine weight) over the wing, while also the total engine weight counteracting moment is located more outboard with more engine weight located further outboard on the wing, hence the wing root <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> with equal TOW is less on the A340-300 than on the A330-300. The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe, which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency. The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and, along with other design features, allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0.86. The wing has a very high thickness-to-chord ratio of 12.8 per cent, which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty. For comparison, the rival MD-11 has a thickness-to-chord ratio of 8–9 per cent. Each wing also has a [...] tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and {{fracture}} patterns of different zirconia abutments with internal implant-abutment connections after static loading and to compare their <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> to those of internally connected titanium abutments. Materials and METHODS: Three types of customized zirconia abutments (Straumann CARES abutments/Straumann BL implants [T 1], Astra ZirDesign abutments/Astra Micro Thread OsseoSpeed implants [T 2], Zirabut prototype abutments/Straumann SP implants [T 3]) and one type of customized titanium abutment (control group, Straumann CARES abutments/Straumann BL implants [C]) were included. All abutments were one-piece abutments with an internal implant-abutment connection and were customized to the same shape but featured different implant-abutment connection designs. For each group, 20 identical copies of a master abutment were fabricated and fixed on their corresponding implants. Half of the abutments in each group were left unrestored, and the other 10 received glass-ceramic crowns. Static loading was applied at a 30 -degree angle to the palatal surface until failure, and <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were calculated. The type of failure was characterized visually by dismounting the abutments and by examination of cross-sections of the embedded specimens. The results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The mean range of <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> was higher for the unrestored groups (158. 2 to 678. 2 Ncm) than for the restored groups (117. 9 to 419. 4 Ncm). The highest mean <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were seen in the control group, both restored and unrestored (419. 4 / 678. 2 Ncm). Unrestored, T 1 and T 2 exhibited significantly higher <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> than T 3. This was also observed in the restored groups. CONCLUSION:Both the abutment material and the implant-abutment connection design affected the <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> of abutments after static loading. Internally connected zirconia abutments with horizontal mismatch to the implant exhibited significantly higher <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> compared to those without horizontal mismatch...|$|R

2500|$|Torque {{is defined}} mathematically as {{the rate of}} change of angular {{momentum}} of an object. The definition of torque states that {{one or both of the}} angular velocity or the moment of inertia of an object are changing. Moment is the general term used for the tendency of one or more applied forces to rotate an object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is called torque in physics). For example, a rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a torque. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a <b>bending</b> <b>moment),</b> but since the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> is not called a torque. [...] Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a torque.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Different animal {{models are}} used as {{fracture}} models in orthopaedic research prior to implant use in humans, although biomechanical forces can differ to a great extend between species due to variable anatomic conditions, {{particularly with regard to}} the gait. The rabbit is an often used fracture model, but biomechanical data are very rare. The objective {{of the present study was}} to measure axial forces, <b>bending</b> <b>moments,</b> and <b>bending</b> axis directly in the rabbit tibia in vivo. The following hypothesis was tested: Axial forces and <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in the mid-diaphysis of rabbit tibia differ from other experimental animals or indirectly calculated data. Methods A minifixateur system with 4 force sensors was developed and attached to rabbit tibia (n = 4), which were subsequently ostectomised. Axial forces, <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and <b>bending</b> angles were calculated telemetrically during weight bearing in motion between 6 and 42 days post operation. Results Highest single values were 201 % body weight [% bw] for axial forces and 409 % bw cm for <b>bending</b> <b>moments.</b> Whereas there was a continous decrease in axial forces over time after day 10 (P = 0. 03 on day 15), a decrease in <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> was inconsistent (P = 0. 03 on day 27). High values for <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were frequently, but not consistently, associated with high values for axial forces. Conclusion Axial forces in rabbit tibia exceeded axial forces in sheep, and differed from indirectly calculated data. The rabbit is an appropriate fracture model because axial loads and <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in rabbit tibia were more closely to human conditions than in sheep tibia as an animal model. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an extensive parametric study on single piles and pile groups embedded in a two-layer subsoil profile, and is aimed to evaluate kinematic <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> developing during earthquakes. A quasi three-dimensional finite element program has been used to perform dynamic analyses in the time domain. Piles have been considered as elastic beams, while the soil has been modelled using a linear elastic constitutive model. The aims of the paper are: (i) to evaluate kinematic <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in single piles and pile groups with dynamic analyses in the time domain, in different subsoil conditions; (ii) to review some existing design methods; (iii) to propose a simplified analysis procedure to evaluate maximum kinematic <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> between two subsequent soil layers. The results of the dynamic analyses have shown that some of the simplified approaches provided in published literature tend to be conservative and can predict <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> at the soil-layer interface with adequate accuracy only within certain depths of the soil layer interface. On the basis of the obtained results, a modified criterion to evaluate the transient peak <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> at interfaces between layers is proposed...|$|R

40|$|The loads {{across the}} {{fracture}} depend on {{variables such as}} position of the fracture and the bite point. Up to now, no study has described systematically the influence of these two variables on these loads. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe and compare value and direction of the loads across the fracture for different positions of fractures in the mandible. In a three-dimensional model, <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>moments</b> and shear forces were compared for five mandibular fractures. The fractures were located in, respectively, the angle, posterior body, anterior body, canine and symphysis region. Positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were defined to give compression at the border, negative <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> to give compression at the alveolar side of the mandible. The angle and posterior body fracture have high positive <b>bending</b> <b>moments,</b> small torsion moments and high sheer forces. The anterior body, canine and symphysis fracture have high negative <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> and high torsion moments with similar maximum values. The number of bite points with negative <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> were different for all fractures. These bite points were always located on the fractured side.
