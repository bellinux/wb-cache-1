5|$|Several cheeses may <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> {{together}} in its formulation, {{and each has}} individual browning and blistering characteristics. For example, a combination of Mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.|$|E

5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; {{in the end it}} proved to be a failure.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E

5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of a 25-minute test an early R engine would consume 60Imperial gallons (gal) (270L) of {{pre-heated}} castor oil. The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E

5|$|Myriad {{additional}} ingredients can be used, including onion, {{roasted red}} bell pepper, {{red and green}} chili peppers, cilantro, lime, lime juice and lime zest, lemon juice, sour cream, oil, lard, vinegar and apple cider vinegar, water, and spices such as garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and cayenne, hot sauce, salt and pepper. The various ingredients can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> or puréed together using a food processor, a blender, or by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|E
5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E

40|$|The natural {{invertible}} extension T* of an Nd-action T {{has been}} studied by Lacroix. He showed that T* may fail to <b>be</b> <b>mixing</b> even if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for d ³ 2. We extend this observation by showing that if T <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> on (k+ 1) sets then T* <b>is</b> in general <b>mixing</b> on no more than k sets, simply because Nd has a corner. Several examples are constructed when d = 2 : (i) a mixing T for which T*(n,m) has an identity factor whenever n·m < 0; (ii) a mixing T for which T* is rigid but T*(n,m) <b>is</b> <b>mixing</b> for all (n,m) ¹ (0, 0); (iii) a T mixing on 3 sets for which T* <b>is</b> not <b>mixing</b> on 3 sets...|$|R

5|$|The {{buildings}} are often purpose-built {{on a site}} where around 30-40m2 of playing space is available for each child in the playground. Around 6 m2 per child is allocated indoors. The institutions are intended to <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in some smaller communities these may be grouped together.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated, with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions. When new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts, domains act as modules with simple independent functions, which can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions. For example, polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics; they contain {{up to one}} hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process, like a step in an assembly line.|$|E

5|$|According to Rolf Singer's infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Pluteus, the fungus belongs in the section Celluloderma. Species in this section have pleurocystidia that are either absent or non-. Furthermore, the majority have a cap cuticle comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, {{that may or may}} not <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with elongated cystidia-like cells. Other species in Celluloderma include P.romellii, P.aurantiorugosus, P.pulverulentus, P.thompsonii, and P.horakianus. Molecular analyses of internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas. The specific epithet nevadensis refers to the mountain, Nevado de Colima, where the type material was collected.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} can be used, such as lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion, scallions, shallots, chives, garlic, {{and pepper}} sauce. The ingredients can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> using a food processor. It is sometimes {{served as a}} hot dip, which can be kept warm using a chafing dish, and melted cheese {{can be used as}} an ingredient in hot versions. It is also sometimes served at room temperature. Clam dip can be served in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, such as sourdough. It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudités to accompany the dish can include red peppers, carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a freezer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can <b>be</b> <b>mixed</b> with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
