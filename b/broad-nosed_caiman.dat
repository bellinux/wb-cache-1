5000|$|According to a 2006 {{report issued}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), {{threatened}} species included 32 types of mammals, 55 species of birds, 5 types of reptiles, 30 species of amphibian, 12 species of fish, and 42 species of plants. Endangered species in Argentina include the ruddy-headed goose, Argentinean pampas deer, South Andean huemul, puna rhea, tundra peregrine falcon, black-fronted piping guan, glaucous macaw, spectacled caiman, the <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>caiman,</b> Lear's macaw, the guayaquil great green macaw, and the American crocodile.|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemic}} of pneumonia with fibrinous polyserositis and multifocal arthritis emerged in captive American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in Florida, United States, in 1995. Mycoplasma alligatoris sp. nov. was cultured from multiple organs, peripheral blood, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid of affected alligators. In a subsequent experimental inoculation study, the Henle-Koch-Evans postulates were fulfilled for M. alligatoris as the etiological agent of fatal mycoplasmosis of alligators. That finding was remarkable because mycoplasmal disease is rarely fatal in animals. An {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{for the detection of}} antibodies produced by alligators in response to M. alligatoris exposure was developed by using plasma obtained from naturally infected alligators during the original epidemic. The assay was validated by using plasma obtained during an experimental dose-response study and applied to analyze plasma obtained from captive and wild crocodilian species. The ELISA reliably detected alligator seroconversion (P < 0. 05) beginning 6 weeks after inoculation. The ELISA also detected seroconversion (P < 0. 05) in the relatively closely related <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>caiman</b> Caiman latirostris and the relatively distantly related Siamese crocodile Crocodylus siamensis following experimental inoculation with M. alligatoris. The ELISA may be used to monitor exposure to the lethal pathogen M. alligatoris among captive, repatriated, and wild crocodilian species...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} {{the growth rate of}} <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>caiman,</b> Caiman latirostris hat-chlings, fed on four animal protein diets: (a) dead poultry from a poultry farm; (b) dead piglet from nursery and farrowing house in a swine farm; (c) whole tilapia (Tilapia rendalli e Oreochromis nilo-ticus); and (d) a balanced mixture of a, b, and c sources. Sixteen seven-month old caimans, average weight of 208 g and, 38 cm of total lenght (TL) were distributed in four treatments. Four groups of four caimans each were placed in cement enclosures inside a greenhouse. Diets were supplied at the average rate of 97. 8 % ± 34. 8 % of the body weight per week (average and standard deviation; wet weight basis). Body mass and total length of caimans were measured every 30 days for six months (Nov. 1995 -April. 1996). An analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed. Diets provided suitable growth for weight and TL (mean ± standard deviation, respectively) : (a) 2, 157 ± 743 g and 79. 5 ± 6. 9 cm; (b) 1, 811 ± 222 g and 75. 7 ± 1. 9 cm; (c) 2, 431 ± 780 g and 80. 7 ± 5. 8 cm; (d) 1, 683. 5 ± 736 g and 74. 5 ± 7. 2 cm. There was no significant effect of diet on weight, but diet effect on TL of hatchlings ap-proached significance (p < 0. 10). It is concluded that all diets have good potential, in growth sense, to be used in commercial farms or ranches and for captivity propagation programs of caimans...|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{inoculation}} of American alligators (Alligator mississippienis), Siamese crocodiles (Crocdylus siamensis), and <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>caimans</b> (Caiman latirostris) with M. alligatoris yielded {{growth of}} the bacteria in all species tested. However, the infected Siamese crocodiles showed no symptoms of disease as seen in alligators and caimans. The commensal relationship observed between M. alligatoris and C. siamensis suggests the crocodilian as a potential natural reservoir for M. alligatoris. The transmission of M. alligatoris is unknown, but due to its presence in captive alligators, researchers warn against returning captive alligators to their natural habitats, fearing these animals may function as a vector for infecting wild populations.|$|R
