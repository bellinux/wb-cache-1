5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital narrowing of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants. Treatment of this cardiac abnormality can require surgery, or non-surgical procedures like balloon valvuloplasty (widening the valve with a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter).</b>|$|E

25|$|Stents, {{which are}} {{specially}} manufactured expandable {{stainless steel mesh}} tubes, mounted on a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter,</b> are {{the most commonly used}} device beyond the <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter.</b> When the stent/balloon device is positioned within the stenosis, the balloon is inflated which, in turn, expands the stent and the artery. The balloon is removed and the stent remains in place, supporting the inner artery walls in the more open, dilated position. Current stents generally cost around $1,000 to 3,000 each (US 2004 dollars), the drug coated ones being the more expensive.|$|E

40|$|During {{coronary}} angioplasty, perfusion {{distal to}} the inflated angioplasty balloon {{can be maintained}} with autoperfusion <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> and coronary perfusion pumps. The blood flow rates through the autoperfusion <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> and the flow rates achieved with a perfusion pump were compared in vitro with fresh human blood at 37 degrees C. In a specially designed system, blood flow rates through StackTM autoperfusion <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> were measured at 40, 60 and 80 mmHg continuous pressure. In another system, driving pressures were measured during perfusion with the pump, through a specially designed forced perfusion catheter at 20, 40 and 60 ml/min flow. The pressure applied in the autoperfusion experiments was converted into atmospheres (atm) to facilitate comparison with the driving pressures measured during pumping (1 mmHg = 1. 316 x 10 (- 3) atm). Mean flow rates through the autoperfusion <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> were: 46 ml/min at 0. 05 atm, 66 ml/min at 0. 09 atm and 75 ml/min at 0. 1 atm. Mean pressures during pumping were: 1. 8 atm at 20 ml/min, 3. 5 atm at 40 ml/min, 5 afm at 60 ml/min. Due to the phasic nature of coronary blood flow, the flow through autoperfusion balloons is generally lower than the minimum required for adequate myocardial protection (= 60 ml/min). Thus, autoperfusion <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> are simpler and cheaper devices than perfusion pumps, but generally they {{are not able to}} provide adequate myocardial protection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnlike {{the initial}} <b>balloon</b> {{ablation}} <b>catheters</b> which {{were designed to}} deliver ablation lesions within the pulmonary veins (PVs), the current <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> are fashioned to deliver lesions out of the PV ostia. Using {{the current generation of}} <b>balloon</b> ablation <b>catheters,</b> electrical isolation occurs {{at the level of the}} PV ostia, but the antral regions are largely unablated because of its initial technical feasibility and presumed safety benefits, balloon cryoablation was being increasingly employed for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation. Other balloon technology—endoscopically navigated laser balloon—was introduced as first real catheter “one fits all” with adjustable size of balloon infation. While high percentage of acute isolation has been demonstrated in most patients with both <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters,</b> little data are available on the chronic durability of cryoballoon or laser balloon lesions. Our own data show that cryoballoon ablation and laser balloon ablation allow for durable PV isolation with the use of a single balloon.

50|$|Balloon {{catheters}} used in angioplasty {{are either}} of Over-the-Wire(OTW) or Rapid Exchange(Rx) design. Rx catheters nowadays are about 90% of the Coronary Intervention market. While OTW Catheters {{may still be}} useful in highly tortuous vascular pathways, they sacrifice deflation time and pushability. When a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> is used to compress plaque within a clogged coronary artery it {{is referred to as}} a plain old balloon angioplasty or POBA. Balloon catheters are also utilized in the deployment of stents during angioplasty. Balloon catheters are supplied to the cath lab with a stent premounted on the balloon. When the cardiologist inflates the balloon it expands the stent. When the cardiologist subsequently deflates the balloon the stent stays behind in the artery and the <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> can be removed.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{our experience}} {{with the use of}} prophylactic pelvic artery <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> in cases of placenta accreta diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound and to compare these cases with contemporary controls. Methods: In this prospective study, all patients seen at our institution between January 1994 and August 1997 with the antenatal sonographic diagnosis of placenta accreta were offered prophylactic preoperative pelvic artery balloon catheterization. Patients who were delivered by cesarean hysterectomy for unsuspected placenta accreta in our institution during the same time interval served as controls. Five patients with the sonographic diagnosis of placenta accreta underwent prophylactic pelvic artery balloon catheterization. Surgical outcomes in patients who received <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> were compared with those managed without them. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Five patients with placenta accreta or one of its variants were correctly identified with antenatal ultrasonography. Of the five patients who underwent pelvic artery balloon catheterization, all had placenta accreta and four required cesarean hysterectomy. The mean estimated blood loss, transfusion requirement, and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing hysterectomy managed with and without the <b>balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> was not different (P. 0. 06). Conclusions: Antenatal sonographic diagnosis of placenta accreta enables preoperative planning. In our experience, use of pelvic artery <b>balloon</b> occlusion <b>catheters</b> in patients requiring a cesarean hysterectomy for placenta accreta did not improve surgical outcomes compared with patients managed without them. These preliminary findings are based on a small number of patients; therefore, further investigation is needed. J...|$|R
