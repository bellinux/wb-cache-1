Standards that define the goals {{in relation to the}} respective national building practice standards do not yet exist. The Swiss MINERGIE-A Certificate, released in March 2010, has become a pioneer and a proposal towards a calculation process in the context of German standardisation has been formulated and accompanied by a relevant calculation tool. NZEB are generally entirely self-supplying by means of renewables. Equipping buildings to produce their own electricity is not only technological demanding, the maintenance of such systems is complex and expensive, which means that connecting the building to an electricity grid offers a significant advantage. Through the interaction of architecture, building construction and energy technology the studies presented utilise diverse possibilities: from the geometry to the U-values of the parts of the building envelope to the performance of combined heat and power units or photovoltaic. Designing and building a NZEB means that from the very start energy demand and energy generation must be consistently kept in balance.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop design criteria for sanitary landfills which lead to a reduction in the stabilization times of MSW, based on experiment results obtain from a pre-pilot scale operation of two sanitary landfills (0. 5 Ton), one with recirculation of leachates treated in an anaerobic digester and the other with recirculation of untreated leachates. This was complemented by another pilot scale sanitary landfill (1440 Ton) with recirculation of leaches treated in an anaerobic filter, and additionally by a computer simulation of leachate generation through the water balance of a theoretical cell of MSW (850 Ton), in which the initial humidity of the MSW and the type of final cover were evaluated. The results obtained on the pre-pilot scale indicate that recirculation of anaerobically treated leachates, when compared to the recirculation of untreated leachates, increased the rate of MSW stabilization, projecting a stabilization time reduction of 72 %. In the pilot sanitary landfill an increase in the settling rate of around 200 % was observed when operating with the recirculation of anaerobically treated leachates as opposed to operation without recirculation. The water <b>balance</b> <b>carried</b> out on the theoretical cell of MSW demonstrated the importance to leachate generation of both the initial landfill water saturation and the type of final barrier.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the heat transfers and fluid flows within a direct thermosyphonic solar-energy water-heater has been undertaken. The collector energy equations when cast in a two-dimensional form enabled heat transfer and thermal capacitance effects to be simulated accurately at the small flow rates encountered commonly in such systems. An investigation of thermocline relaxation processes within the store indicated negligible mixing at the store inlet over a wide range of Richardsons numbers (43, 608 < Ri < 729, 016). Thermal relaxation under conditions of no flow was shown to be due predominantly to axial conduction along the store wall. The use of an appropriate non-isothermal friction factor correlation when calculating frictional losses in the collector's riser pipes, produced predicted steady-state flow rates which were corroborated experimentally to within 2 %. An indoor test facility, monitored and controlled by a microcomputer, enabled "real" operating conditions to be simulated. The predicted responses of the system to identical conditions showed good agreement with the corresponding experimental observations, the predicted heat delivery being within 2. 8 % of the measured value. A technique for correlating the daily performances of thermosyphon solar-energy water-heaters has been developed. The five dimensionless groups which form the basis of the correlations and the functional relationships between these groups were derived from an analytical solution of a linear first-order differential transient heat <b>balance</b> <b>carried</b> out on a generic system. Thermal performance data used in the correlations was generated by the numerical simulation using representative U. K. hourly weather data and operating conditions. The minimum amount of data required to establish a characteristic curve for an individual system was found to be thirty days. Using such a curve, the total annual solar fraction agreed with that predicted by the high level model to within 3 %. Two universal curves were determined in which the gradients of characteristic curves were correlated against the derived dimensionless groups. The accuracy of the resulting two-stage algorithm in determining annual solar fractions was established as ranging from 5. 5 % for predominantly multiple-pass systems to a mean of 10. 5 % for single-pass systems...|$|E

40|$|Oil palm was {{introduced}} to Sri Lanka from Malaysia in late nineteen sixties. As of now, after approximately {{three and a half}} decades, it has spread over 10, 000 acres of {{the southern part of the}} Island. Watawala, Namunukula, Agalawatta and Elpitiya are the four key companies that share oil palm plantations, which are distributed mainly in the Galle District. However the country has only one palm oil mill owned by Watawala Plantations Ltd. located at Nakiyadeniya in Galle District, processing over 19, 000 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches annually. The main objective of the research is to identify the applicability of cleaner production in to the Sri Lankan palm oil industry and to present places where CP can be adopted in the Sri Lankan palm oil industry through technical, financial and environmental evaluation of CP options and identification of their priority levels in implementation. In addition, development of a proposed Industry-Specific Effluent Discharge Standard for Sri Lankan Palm Oil Industry is considered as a key objective in this study. After comparing some of the Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) performed for similar products in other countries, it was identified that the crude palm oil extraction process is the area that we have to concentrate, as it was the main stage of energy usage and environmental pollution. Therefore the scope of the study was narrowed down to factory operations, which covers all the stages of crude palm oil extraction. To fulfil the main objective of developing cleaner production options for the factory operations, a walk-through audit was carried out followed by a detailed audit considering each and every process step of the factory. Detailed assessments were conducted in areas including material handling & consumption and waste generation with their characteristics. Electrical & thermal energy utilisation was analysed in detail to evaluate the current operational efficiencies and methods to minimise the losses. Energy and material balances were done in calculating actual process requirements and estimating existing losses. A Boiler heat balance and evaluation of electrical efficiencies of each and every process machinery were conducted with industry experts to find out the losses and to identify the places where improvements can be made without drastic changes to the existing operational methods. Calorific values and moisture contents of key waste streams of the plant were analysed in order to determine energy inputs and evaluate the possibilities of operating the- plant self-sufficiently, energy wise. Opportunities of modifying the physicalstate ofraw material and recycling of utilities & waste materials from the process were assessed during the audit. Observations and conversations with the employees were major tools used in the audit and the employee recommendations or comments on CP improvements were considered important in identifying and prioritising the final CP options. Technical feasibility and environmental sustainability were the main evaluating criteria of selecting the key cleaner production options for the factory processes. The measured moisture-free base calorific values of EFB, PPF & PKS indicate that it is possible to have a cogeneration plant onsite which could fulfil the Plant's electrical and heat (steam & hot water) requirements. The flue gas analysis carried out in the factory boiler indicates that the excess air percentage is higher than the recommended value. Correcting this will increase the boiler efficiency as the flue gas losses decrease. In addition, complete burning of the fuel will decrease the amount of hazardous pollutants being emitted into the surrounding environment. According to the measured values and the boiler heat <b>balance</b> <b>carried</b> out it is seen that there is a possibility of using flue gas heat to replace steam at some processes. Blow down losses of the boiler could be further reduced by treating (reducing TDS) inlet water to the boiler. As a result of the electric power analysis of almost all the plant electrical machinery it is seen that most of the machines (over 60 %) are operated at less than half load conditions, which contributes to low operation efficiencies, low power factors and due to all these considerable wastage in electrical energy consumption. It was identified that by making effortless changes to the existing handling systems could minimise the product losses and at the same time improve the [mal product quality, making the operation more profitable. In addition, income from by-products will enhance the economic viability of implementing the selected cleaner production options. Wet extracting of crude palm oil from palm fruits generates large quantities of wastewater. Raw Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) can be considered as one of the highest industrial polluting sources having BOD, COD and TDS values as high as 26, 000, 67, 000 and 72, 000 mg/l respectively. As there is no industry specific standard for palm oil industry in Sri Lanka, the factories have to comply with the General Effluent Discharge Standards specified by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). The treated effluent quality of the range BOD 520 1000 - 1, 360 mg/l, COD 2, 371 - 2, 880 mg/l and TDS 21, 800 - 22, 410 mg/l achieved in the existing pond system of Nakiyadeniya Pail Oil Mill does not comply with the CEA general standards. Analysis of POME treatment technologies in practice and in experimental scale revealed that achieving compliance with set CEA General Standards is a difficult task. Further, the effluent discharge standards laid out in other countries, applicable to POME discharge, shows the stringent nature of the Sri Lankan general standards and difficulty in complying with the set standards. The generation of the proposed standard considered applicability of treatment technologies used worldwide in Sri Lankan conditions (Best Practical Technologies) and effluent disposal standards adopted in other countries...|$|E
