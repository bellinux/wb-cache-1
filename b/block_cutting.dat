50|$|Reduction {{printing}} {{is a name}} used {{to describe}} the process of using one block to print several layers of color on one print. This usually involves cutting a small amount of the block away, and then printing the block many times over on different sheets before washing the <b>block,</b> <b>cutting</b> more away and printing the next color on top. This allows the previous color to show through. This process can be repeated many times over. The advantages of this process is that only one block is needed, and that different components of an intricate design will line up perfectly. The disadvantage is that once the artist moves on to the next layer, no more prints can be made.|$|E

5000|$|According to Forrer (Die Kunst des Zeugdrucks, 1898) medieval Rhenish monasteries {{were the}} cradles {{of the artistic}} craft of {{ornamental}} stamp or <b>block</b> <b>cutting,</b> although it is now recognised {{that some of the}} examples he relied on are modern forgeries. In rare monastic manuscripts earlier in date than the 13th century, initial letters (especially those that recurred frequently) were sometimes stamped from hand-cut blocks; and German deeds of the 14th century bear names of block cutters and textile stampers as those of witnesses. Amongst the more ancient relics of Rhenish printed textiles are some of thin silken stuff, impressed with patterns in gold and silver foil. Of these, and of a considerable number of later variously dyed stout linens with patterns printed in dark tones or in black, specimens have been collected from reliquaries, tombs and old churches.|$|E

Work activities were performed by union-sponsored apprentices and included tuck-point grinding, surface grinding, paver block and brick cutting (masonry saw), and concrete <b>block</b> <b>cutting</b> (hand-held saw). In a randomized block design, implemented under controlled field conditions, three ventilation rates (0, 30, and 75 cfm) were tested for each tool. Each ventilation treatment was replicated three times in random order {{for a total of}} nine 15 -min work sessions per study subject. With the exception of the hand-held saw, the use of LEV resulted in a significant (p � 0. 05) reduction in respirable dust exposure.

In some cases, {{there is the}} possibility of releasing asbestos fibres into the atmosphere from the rock or soil, subsequently exposing workers and the general population, which can lead to an increased risk of developing asbestos-related diseases. In the present study, air contaminated with asbestos fibres released from serpentinites was investigated in occupational settings (quarries and processing facto-ries) and in the environment close to working facilities and at urban sites. The only naturally occurrence of asbestos found in Valmalenco area was chrysotile; amphibole fibres were never detected. An experimental cut-off diameter of 0. 25 mm was established for distinguishing be-tween Valmalenco chrysotile and antigorite single fibres using selected area electron diffrac-tion analyses.

40|$|PurposeLong-term {{success of}} {{contemporary}} total knee replacements relies {{to a large}} extent on proper implant alignment. This study was undertaken to test whether specimen-matched <b>cutting</b> <b>blocks</b> based on computed axial tomography (CT) scans could provide accurate rotational alignment of the femoral component. MethodsCT scans of five fresh frozen full leg cadaver specimens, equipped with infrared reflective markers, were used to produce a specimen-matched femoral <b>cutting</b> <b>block.</b> Using those blocks, the bone cuts were made to implant a bi-compartmental femoral component. Rotational alignment of the components in the horizontal plane was determined using an optical measurement system and compared with all relevant rotational reference axes identified on the CT scans. ResultsAverage rotational alignment for the bi-compartmental component in the horizontal plane was 1. 9 ° (range 0 °– 6. 3 °; standard deviation 2. 6 °). One specimen that showed the highest deviation from the planned alignment also featured a completely degraded medial articular surface. ConclusionsThe CT-based specimen-matched <b>cutting</b> <b>blocks</b> achieved good rotational alignment accuracy except for one specimen with badly damaged cartilage. In such cases, imaging techniques that visualize the cartilage layer might be more suitable to design <b>cutting</b> <b>blocks,</b> as they will provide a better fit and increased surface support. status: publishe...|$|R

Waterjet technology, used firstly in excavation processes of soft rocks in mining, has increased its usability with the hydraulic excavation of coal. Nowadays, it is commonly used for <b>block</b> <b>cutting</b> in quarries and processing of natural stones for the purposes of decorative production.

40|$|Here {{we study}} {{the effect of}} point {{mutations}} in proteins on the redistributions of the conformational substates. We show that regardless of {{the location of a}} mutation in the protein structure and of its type, the observed movements of the backbone recur largely at the same positions in the structures. Despite the different interactions that are disrupted and formed by the residue substitution, not only are the conformations very similar, but the regions that move are also the same, regardless of their sequential or spatial distance from the mutation. This observation leads us to conclude that, apart from some extreme cases, the details of the interactions are not critically important in determining the protein conformation or in specifying which parts of the protein would be more prone to take on different local conformations in response to changes in the sequence. This finding further illustrates why proteins manifest a robustness toward many mutational events. This nonuniform distribution of the conformer population is consistently observed in a variety of protein structural types. Topology is critically important in determining folding pathways, kinetics, building <b>block</b> <b>cutting,</b> and anatomy trees.

40|$|Marble {{extraction}} in the Carrara basins {{has occurred}} since the 1 st millennium BC, with relevant exploitation periods during the Roman {{period and the}} Renaissance, when Michelangelo visited the Carrara quarries to personally select the marble blocks he used for sculpting his legendary works of art. As a consequence of this long-lasting activity, the landscape is almost completely notched by extensive quarry fronts and covered by huge quarry dump deposits, locally named ravaneti. Through a detailed field survey and the interpretation of aerial photographs, we compiled a geomorphological map at a scale of 1 : 10, 000 of the Carrara marble basins. Additionally, a raised-relief model at a scale of 1 : 10, 000 {{was derived from the}} geomorphological map. To our knowledge, this model is the first product of this kind. A geomorphologic survey, historical documents, and stratigraphic and grain-size analyses allowed us to reconstruct the evolution of the anthropogenic landscape and allowed for the characterization of past and current geomorphic processes. Four main stratigraphic units are recognizable in the ravaneti. The different textures and structures of these units reflect the evolution of marble quarrying techniques. The oldest and deepest debris layer dates back to pre-Roman and Roman periods and is made up of flat pebbles with an open-work structure. In several localities, this manually produced debris is associated with very distinctive excavation cutting traces (caesurae in Latin), covering paleosoils predating the Roman excavation activity. Medieval and Renaissance ravaneti are locally documented on top of this unit, burying post-Roman soil. Coarse multi-decimeter-sized cobbles («head man» size cobbles) with a scarce fine matrix constitute the typical ravaneto of the end of 19 th century. The uppermost layer, with boulders and an abundant fine matrix (ranging from sand to silt), is the consequence of the new diamond wire cutting methods that were introduced in the 1970 s. The fine matrix produced by the recent techniques of <b>block</b> <b>cutting</b> and grinding destabilizes the dump deposits, making them very prone to hazardous remobilization of debris flows and shallow landslides. These are the most significant geomorphologic processes acting in this anthropogenic landscape. In general, the geomorphological map of this extractive environment offered the opportunity i) to verify that anthropogenic landforms archived the principal steps of technological development of such industrial context strictly linked to important cultural events, and ii) to evaluate what are the technological developments in excavation activities that could generate situations of geomorphological risk...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{key to a}} {{successful}} total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is {{the restoration of the}} mechanical axis with balanced flexion and extension gaps. Patient-specific <b>cutting</b> <b>block</b> technique has been the latest development in total knee arthroplasty. This technique uses a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the patient's symptomatic knee to create bone models and cutting jigs. This study was designed to evaluate the intraoperative accuracy of the patient-specific <b>cutting</b> <b>block</b> as compared to the preoperative template. Methods. Visionaire (Smith and Nephew, Genesis 2 Knee Arthroplasty) patient-specific TKA was used in all patients. An independent research officer was responsible for measuring all the resected articular surfaces of femur and tibia during surgery and compared it to the <b>cutting</b> <b>block</b> manufactured according to the preoperative template. Seven different measurements from each patient were obtained; four different measurements from the femur and three from the tibia were recorded. The differences between the actual resections made intraoperatively, as compared to the original pre-operative templates, were noted as the error. The surgical team was blinded to the measurements of the resections and the calculations of the errors. Results. Twenty-six Visionaire patient-specific TKA were included in the study. A total of 182 readings of bone resections made intraoperatively (seven for each patient). Eighty five percent of all collected readings were below the error margin of ≤ 1. 5 [*]mm. Size of resection had no effect on the error margin. All patients had satisfactory post-operative alignment, and at discharge all 26 patients achieved more than 90 ° of knee flexion. Conclusion. This observational study provides evidence that patient-specific TKA is comparable to other forms of TKA and may have some distinct advantages. In addition, we have shown that the <b>cutting</b> <b>blocks</b> are able to consistently deliver accurate cuts that are reproducible. We recommend intra-operative measurement of the bone resection and its comparison with the <b>cutting</b> <b>block</b> as a routine surgical step to confirm the MRI scan data, block placement, and instant validation of the bony resection before implant placement.
