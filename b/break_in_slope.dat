50|$|Alba's {{size and}} low profile {{makes it a}} {{difficult}} structure to study visually, {{as much of the}} volcano's relief is indiscernible in orbital photographs. However, between 1997 and 2001, the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft took over 670 million precise elevation measurements across the planet. Using MOLA data, planetary scientists are able to study subtle details of the volcano's shape and topography that were invisible in images from earlier spacecraft such as Viking.The volcano consists of two, roughly concentric components: 1) an oval-shaped central body with approximate dimensions of 1500 km by 1000 km across surrounded by 2) a vast, nearly level apron of lava flows that extends an additional 1000 km or so outward. The central body is the main topographic edifice of the volcano, marked by pronounced <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> at the inner boundary of the apron. Extending east and west from the central edifice are two broad fan-shaped lobes (or shoulders), which give the volcano its elongation in the east-west direction. The central edifice has the steepest slopes on the volcano, although they are still only 1°. The crest and upper flanks of the edifice are cut by a partial ring of graben {{that are part of the}} Alba and Tantalus Fossae fracture system. Inside the ring of graben is an annulus of very low and in places reversed slopes that forms a plateau on top of which lies a central dome 350 km across capped by a nested caldera complex. Thus, the central edifice of Alba Mons resembles a partially collapsed shield volcano with a smaller, summit dome sitting on top (pictured right). The summit dome has a distinct tilt to the east.|$|E

40|$|The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) {{were one}} of the first regions where apatite fission track (AFT) thermochronology was applied {{routinely}} to study exhumation processes and long term landscape evolution. Pioneering publications from the region introduced or refined interpretation concepts of thermochronological data such as the <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> in vertical age profiles as qualitative marker for the onset of accelerated rock cooling. New AFT data were compiled from vertical profiles in the Eisenhower Range, northern TAM, and compared with published data. Samples originally examined by population technique were re-analysed via the external detector technique. AFT ages increase from 32 ± 2 Ma at an elevation of 220 m to 175 ± 14 Ma at 2380 m. Geological evidence and thermal history modeling of the AFT data require Jurassic to Late Eocene reheating of the samples and an onset of cooling at ~ 35 - 30 Ma. This requires the deposition of a ~ 3 to 3. 5 km thick sedimentary sequence on the granitic basement subsequent to Jurassic Ferrar magmatism at ~ 180 Ma. The regression of paleotemperatures against sample altitudes infers a high Jurassic geothermal gradient of ~ 60 °C/km related to rifting processes and Ferrar magmatism, and a moderate Cretaceous/Eocene geothermal gradient of ~ 30 °C/km. Comparison of ages generated with population and external detector technique shows the importance of determining single-grain ages for each sample, even from granitic rocks of the same intrusion, and thus strongly supports previous cases made for the determination of annealing kinetics and grain-age evaluation. Age comparison additionally illustrates, that samples above a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> record larger deviations between population and external detector ages than samples below a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope.</b> We demonstrate that position and shape of a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> result from various factors, such as the thermal history prior to final cooling, maximum paleotemperatures, cooling rate, and geothermal gradient. A <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> does not straightly date the onset of final cooling and cannot substitute thermal history modeling. Therefore, earlier studies from the TAM and similar settings elsewhere need to be validated by combining thermal history modeling of thermochronological data and supplementary geological information...|$|E

Perennial seepage areas are simulated over 4 % of the island, and are generally confined to <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> <b>in</b> low topography areas.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the sediment transported by rivers (e. g. sediment flux, grain size distribution – GSD) dictate whether rivers aggrade or erode their substrate. They also condition the architecture and properties of sedimentary successions in basins. In this study, we investigate the relationship between landscape steepness and the grain size of hillslope and fluvial sediments. The study area is located within the Feather River basin in northern California, and studied basins are underlain exclusively by tonalite lithology. Erosion rates {{in the study area}} vary over an order of magnitude, from > 250 mm ka − 1 in the Feather River canyon to < 15 mm ka − 1 on an adjacent low-relief plateau. We find that the coarseness of hillslope sediment increases with increasing hillslope steepness and erosion rates. We hypothesise that, in our soil samples, the measured 10 -fold increase in D 50 and doubling of the amount of fragments larger than 1 mm when slope increases from 0. 38 to 0. 83 m m − 1 is due to a decrease in the residence time of rock fragments, causing particles to be exposed for shorter periods of time to processes that can reduce grain size. For slopes in excess of 0. 7 m m − 1, landslides and scree cones supply much coarser sediment to rivers, with D 50 and D 84 more than one order of magnitude larger than in soils. In the tributary basins of the Feather River, a prominent <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope</b> developed in response to the rapid incision of the Feather River. Downstream of the <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope,</b> fluvial sediment grain size increases, due to an increase in flow competence (mostly driven by channel steepening) as well as a change in sediment source and in sediment dynamics: on the plateau upstream of the <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope,</b> rivers transport easily mobilised fine-grained sediment derived exclusively from soils. Downstream of the <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>slope,</b> mass wasting processes supply a wide range of grain sizes that rivers entrain selectively, depending on the competence of their flow. Our results also suggest that, in this study site, hillslopes respond rapidly to an increase in the rate of base-level lowering compared to rivers...|$|E
