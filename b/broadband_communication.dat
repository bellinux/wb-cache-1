25|$|Secondly, the Internet {{facilitates}} language revitalization. Throughout the years, {{the digital}} environment has developed in various sophisticated ways {{that allow for}} virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses {{to encourage students to}} communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions. Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken {{can take advantage of the}} Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone <b>broadband</b> <b>communication</b> such as Skype, language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of policies and strategies for broadband infrastructure and access, and <b>broadband</b> video <b>communication</b> development and use in First Nation communities in Canada. Although using <b>broadband</b> for video <b>communication</b> remains underdeveloped in First Nation communities as a whole, successful initiatives have been underway for many years, particularly in the areas of distance education and telehealth applications. The research conducted to date on broadband video in Aboriginal communities has focused almost exclusively on evaluations of distance education and telehealth applications, which have primarily been positive evaluations. There has been little research on other kinds of applications. The authors discuss approaches to doing research with Aboriginal communities. Clearly there are many opportunities for researchers to investigate and explore the possibilities of <b>broadband</b> video <b>communication</b> for First Nations across Canada. However researchers working on these projects in First Nation communities will face a number of challenges. The authors discuss these challenges and outline some ways forward. Before First Nation communities develop <b>broadband</b> video <b>communication</b> applications, concrete First Nation community-specific planning and development that looks at the needs, priorities, and long-term goals of the community and its members must be fully addressed.
