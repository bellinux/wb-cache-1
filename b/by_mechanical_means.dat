5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell also {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.|$|E

25|$|Song {{is usually}} {{delivered}} from prominent perches, although some species may sing when flying. The production of sounds <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> {{as opposed to}} the use of the syrinx has been termed variously instrumental music by Charles Darwin, mechanical sounds and more recently sonation. The term sonate has been defined as the act of producing non-vocal sounds that are intentionally modulated communicative signals, produced using non-syringeal structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers.|$|E
25|$|An {{anchored}} {{retaining wall}} {{can be constructed}} {{in any of the}} aforementioned styles but also includes additional strength using cables or other stays anchored in the rock or soil behind it. Usually driven into the material with boring, anchors are then expanded {{at the end of the}} cable, either <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> or often by injecting pressurized concrete, which expands to form a bulb in the soil. Technically complex, this method is very useful where high loads are expected, or where the wall itself has to be slender and would otherwise be too weak.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{house had}} begun with 50 staff, but swelled {{over time to}} over 1,200 staff. This was work that {{required}} painstaking attention to detail, finesse and craftsmanship – a Worth bodice might have up to 17 pieces of material to ensure the perfect fit to its wearer. Seamstresses would be assigned to different workshops where they specialized in, for instance, making sleeves, stitching hems or skirt making. Most of the sewing of Worth garments was by hand, although {{the advent of the}} early sewing machine meant some main seams could be stitched <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A wool bale is a {{standard}} sized and weighted pack of classed wool compressed <b>by</b> the <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> of a wool press. This is the regulation required method of packaging for wool, to keep it uncontaminated and readily identifiable. A [...] "bale of wool" [...] is also the standard trading unit for wool on the wholesale national and international markets.|$|R
25|$|While {{there is}} not any {{specific}} formula the team obeys in terms of physical procedure, most myths involve construction of various objects to help test the myth. They use their functional workshops to create whatever is needed, often including mechanical devices and sets to simulate {{the circumstances of the}} myth. Human actions are often simulated <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> in order to increase safety, and to achieve consistency in repeated actions. Methods for testing myths are usually planned and executed in a manner to produce visually dramatic results, which generally involves explosions, fires, and/or vehicle crashes. Thus, myths or tests involving explosives, firearms and vehicle collisions are relatively common.|$|E
25|$|In admixture, the {{combined}} solubility of ammonium nitrate and urea {{is so much}} {{higher than that of}} either component alone {{that it is possible to}} obtain a stable solution (known as UAN) with a total nitrogen content (32%) approaching that of solid ammonium nitrate (33.5%), though not, of course, that of urea itself (46%). Given the ongoing safety and security concerns surrounding fertilizer-grade solid ammonium nitrate, UAN provides a considerably safer alternative without entirely sacrificing the agronomic properties that make ammonium nitrate more attractive than urea as a fertilizer in areas with short growing seasons. It is also more convenient to store and handle than a solid product and easier to apply accurately to the land <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{a mention}} of the Kuusamans rapidly {{building}} a new port in a newly conquered island by magic, which is evident from all buildings being the same (indicating that the spells made extensive use {{of the law of}} similarity). It is noted that only a country with many skilled mages could have spared the resources for such construction. In another place it is noted that printing is usually done <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> but the Valmieren resistance utilises magic for reproducing a propaganda sheet in order to avoid detection by the occupying authorities. The result of this magical duplication is readable, but the ink smudges easily as it was produced without the aid of a power point or an experienced mage.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{mechanical}} {{organs are}} pipe organs although some instruments were built using reeds {{similar to those}} found in a harmonium. Since the 1950s, some instruments have been built using electronics to generate the sound, though still operated <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> or pneumatic <b>means.</b> From the 1990s pipe organs have been built that are operated by MIDI rather than the earlier <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b>|$|R
50|$|Paper-based cones {{account for}} {{approximately}} 85% of the cones sold worldwide. The ability of paper (cellulose) {{to be easily}} modified <b>by</b> chemical or <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> gives it a practical processing advantage not found in other common cone materials.|$|R
50|$|Rock dust, {{also known}} as rock powders, rock minerals, rock flour, soil remineralization, and mineral fines, {{consists}} of finely crushed rock, processed <b>by</b> natural or <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> containing minerals and trace elements widely used in organic farming practices.|$|R
500|$|As Isabeau {{crossed the}} Grand Pont to Notre Dame, a person dressed as an angel {{descended from the}} church <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> and [...] "passed through an opening of the hangings of blue taffeta with golden fleurs-des-lis, which covered the bridge, and put a crown on her head." [...] The angel was then pulled back up into the church. An acrobat {{carrying}} two candles walked along a rope suspended from the spires of the cathedral to the tallest house in the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} means of asexual {{reproduction}} in colonial stony corals is by fragmentation. Pieces of branching corals may get detached [...] during storms, by strong water movement or <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> and fragments {{fall to the}} sea bed. In suitable conditions, these are capable of adhering to the substrate and starting new colonies. Even such massive corals as Montastraea annularis {{have been shown to}} be capable of forming new colonies after fragmentation. This process is used in the reef aquarium hobby to increase stock without the necessity to harvest corals from the wild.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Joseph Boscovich pointed out, that Le Sage's {{theory is}} the first one, which {{actually}} can explain gravity <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b> However, he rejected the model because of the enormous and unused quantity of ultramundane matter.

50|$|Quaker George W. Taylor {{established}} a textile mill which used only non-slave cotton. He worked {{to increase the}} quality and availability of free produce cotton goods. Abolitionist Henry Browne Blackwell invested his and his wife Lucy Stone's money in several ventures seeking to make cheaper sugar <b>by</b> using <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> and non-slave labor, but the product was never viable, even when he switched his focus from sugar cane to sugar beets.|$|R
2500|$|Another subgenre is [...] "biopunk" [...] (cyberpunk themes {{dominated}} by biotechnology) {{from the early}} 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> but by genetic manipulation. Paul Di Filippo {{is seen as the}} most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious ribofunk. Bruce Sterling's Shaper/Mechanist cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age to be postcyberpunk.|$|E
2500|$|Refrigeration is {{a process}} of {{removing}} heat from a low-temperature reservoir and transferring it to a high-temperature reservoir. The work of heat transfer is traditionally driven <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> but can also be driven by heat, magnetism, electricity, laser, or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including, but not limited to: household refrigerators, industrial freezers, cryogenics, and air conditioning. Heat pumps may use the heat output of the refrigeration process, and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to air conditioning units.|$|E
2500|$|... (1) Engraving by hand is {{the oldest}} and most obvious method of engraving, but is the least used at the present time on account of its slowness. The design is {{transferred}} to the roller from an oil colour tracing and then merely cut out with a steel graver, prismatic in section, and sharpened to a beveled point. It requires great steadiness of hand and eye, and although capable of yielding the finest results it is only now employed for very special work and for those patterns that are too large in scale to be engraved <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b>|$|E
50|$|Her {{physical}} aids included a boneless corset for sufferers of scoliosis, a brace for hernias and {{a device that}} effected a facelift <b>by</b> simple <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b> Farrell also developed a sling for carrying a baby, {{at a time when}} these were not in common use in Western countries. According to the author Ruth Park, this device promoted the comment from Americans that Australian mothers had learnt from kangaroos to carry their babies in pouches.|$|R
50|$|A jib is {{somewhat}} {{more complicated than}} a simple lever, since almost always the camera's aim needs to be controlled independently of the swing of the jib arm.

50|$|Beyond {{the basic}} {{profiles}} or contours (smoothwall, corrugated, or ribbed), innerduct {{is also available}} in an increasing variety of multiduct designs. Multiduct may be either a composite unit consisting of up to four or six individual innerducts that are held together <b>by</b> some <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> or a single extruded product having multiple channels through which to pull several cables. In either case, the multiduct is coilable, and can be pulled into existing conduit {{in a manner similar}} to that of conventional innerduct.|$|R
2500|$|The gold can be sorted {{into two}} groups based on purity and {{separated}} by the concentration of silver and copper. The less pure gilding, which is thicker, {{can be considered a}} later repair, as the thinner, purer inlay adheres better to the silver. The adherence of the overall gold is quite poor. The lack of mercury from the gold analysis suggests that a fire-gilding technique was not used on the Gundestrup cauldron. The gilding appears to have instead been made <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> which [...] explains the function of closely spaced punch marks on the gilded areas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{river was}} first crossed {{with a wooden}} bridge in the 1850s. This was {{replaced}} with the iron [...] "Jervois Bridge" [...] in 1878; It was named by Sir William Jervois after himself. Jervois Bridge was an opening bridge first operated by horse power, and later <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b> It was replaced with a fixed bridge {{in the same position}} in 1969, when there was no longer a need for small boats to pass. Birkenhead Bridge, the first bascule bridge in Australia, opened in 1940. In 2004 Premier Mike Rann said the State government would build new rail and road bridges over the Port River at a cost of $178 million. On 3 April [...] 2005 he announced that the 'opening and closing' bridges would be toll-free and would be opened twice a day to minimise disruptions to road traffic. It was opened for traffic on 3 August 2008. It is between Docks 1 and 2 at Port Adelaide and links with Francis Street to the east and Victoria Road to the west.|$|E
2500|$|For example, it {{is still}} widely {{perceived}} that gastric bypass works <b>by</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>means,</b> i.e. food restriction and/or malabsorption. Recent clinical and animal studies, however, have indicated that these long-held inferences about the mechanisms of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may not be correct. A {{growing body of evidence}} suggests that profound changes in body weight and metabolism resulting from RYGB cannot be explained by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption. One study in rats found that RYGB induced a 19% increase in total and a 31% increase in resting energy expenditure, an effect not exhibited in vertical sleeve gastrectomy rats. [...] In addition, pair-fed rats lost only 47% as much weight as their RYGB counterparts. Changes in food intake after RYGB only partially account for the RYGB-induced weight loss, and {{there is no evidence of}} clinically significant malabsorption of calories contributing to weight loss. Thus, it appears RYGB affects weight loss by altering the physiology of weight regulation and eating behavior rather than by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption.|$|E
50|$|Hardpan can be {{a problem}} in farming and {{gardening}} by impeding drainage of water and restricting the growth of plant roots. In these situations, the hardpan can be broken up <b>by</b> either <b>mechanical</b> <b>means</b> such as digging or plowing, or through the use of soil amendments. The broadfork is a manual tool specifically designed for this task; a digging fork or a spade might also be used. The chisel plow does a similar job {{with the help of a}} tractor.|$|R
5000|$|Chopra {{coined the}} term quantum healing to invoke {{the idea of a}} process whereby a person's health [...] "imbalance" [...] is {{corrected}} <b>by</b> quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>means.</b> Chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing. He has attempted to integrate Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, with quantum mechanics, in order to justify his teachings.
