40|$|INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{differences in}} Canadian, Norwegian, and Dutch parents' perceptions of vulnerability of their infants born preterm and their childrearing practices. METHODS: This observational study included 62 infants born preterm (46 % boys) and their parents. Parents completed the Beliefs About My <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Daily Activities of Infants Scale when infants were between 4 and 11 months corrected age. One-way {{analyses of variance}} were conducted. RESULTS: Parents in the Netherlands perceived their infants as being more vulnerable than parents in the other countries (P <. 001). The total Daily Activities of Infants Scale scores did not differ across countries. Parents who received therapy services had greater perceptions of their infants' vulnerability than parents not receiving services (P =. 01).

The Alarm Distress <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale</b> is the best instrument to identify withdrawal in infants between 2 and 24 months of age. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the association between infant social withdrawal behavior and maternal pathology in the perinatal period. Method: The target sample of the study was 134 mo- ther-child couples examined at the Policlinico Agos- tino Gemelli General Pediatric Outpatient Clinic and Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic, in Rome. We analyzed the relationship between withdrawal behavior and psychological and organic prenatal/postnatal pathol- ogy, using the Chi Square exact test. Results: When the mother suffers from both organic and psycho- logical pathologies in the perinatal period, the risk of withdrawal is increased: the probability of infant withdrawal behavior is increased by maternal or- ganic postnatal pathology by 14 times, by maternal psychological postnatal pathology by 9 times, and by maternal psychological postnatal depression, meas- ured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, by almost 4 times.

40|$|Infants seek contingent, companionable {{interactions}} with others. Infants in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), while receiving care that optimizes {{their chances of}} survival, often {{do not have the}} kind of interactions that are optimal for their social development. Live music therapy (MT) with infants is an intervention that aims for contingent, social interaction between therapist and infant. This study, with a limited numbers of infants, examined the effectiveness of an MT intervention in the NICU at The Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne. Two groups of late pre-term and full-term infants were recruited to the study; one was given MT and the other was not. A healthy group of infants not given MT served as an additional control. The effect of MT was indexed using two measures reflecting infant social engagement: the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI) and the Alarm Distress <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale</b> (ADBB). Results suggest that the MT intervention used at The Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne supports infants’ neurobehavioral development. In particular, hospitalized infants who received MT were better able to maintain self-regulation during social interaction with an adult, were less irritable and cried less, and were more positive in their response to adult handling, when compared with infants who did not receive the intervention. These are important prerequisites for social interaction and development. Further and larger scale research using MT with this population is indicated...|$|E

This study aims to analyze the association between feeding practices and underweight of children under two. This study was an observational analytic study with cross-sectional design. Using structured questionaire, interview was conducted to 51 mothers or caregivers who have children aged 6 - 24 months old and was selected by simple random sampling technique in Bluru Kidul and Magersari, Sidoarjo.

Maternal sensitivity was assessed by nurses' ratings in the neonatal care unit and at three months during mother–infant interaction observation. Cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that neonatal irritability did not influence sensitivity at 3 months nor did maternal sensitivity in the newborn period lead to reduced irritability at 3 months. Both irritability and maternal sensitivity showed moderate stability over time (r = 0. 55 and r = 0. 60, respectively).

The study has been carried out in the General Paediatric Outpatient Clinic of the University General Hospital Agostino Gemelli in Rome. Both paediatricians and psychologists used the ADBB scale during ordinary paediatric check-ups. First and second axes of the Zero-To-Three scale were used as Gold Standards. The cut-off of 5 and over (4 / 5) yielded the best validity (0. 82) and specificity (0. 85), as was previously found in the French validation. Axis II DC O- 3 R disorders in the mother-infant interaction always lead to a positive ADBB score. ADBB scores over the threshold were associated with maternal postpartum depression. Positive correlations between infant birth type, breast-feeding, current psychiatric pathology in the mother, and total ADBB scores were found. These data confirm that both children born by caesarian, feeling less pain, and breastfed children, who had more intense physical contacts with the maternal body, and children having good relationship with the caregiver, tend to socialize better.

Ninety-four 8 -week-old infants were assessed using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS, Brazelton & Nugent, 1995) and the Alarm Distress <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale</b> (ADBB, Guedeney & Fermanian, 2001). Saliva samples were collected at 8 - 12 weeks old, both before and after a routine inoculation for cortisol reactivity measurement. Mother-infant interaction was evaluated at 12 - 16 weeks, using the Global Rating Scales (GRS, Murray, Fiori-Cowley, Hooper, & Cooper, 1996). Mothers' reports on infant temperament at 3 and 12 months were collected using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ, Rothbart, 1981). Significant differences in mothers' perception of infant temperament were found at both 3 and 12 months in infants with distinct psychophysiological profiles. Stability was observed in most of the temperament's dimensions from 3 to 12 months old; still, there were changes in mothers' perception of infant temperament in terms of level of distress, cuddliness, sadness and approach. Infant psychophysiological profile and mother-infant interaction both influence with the pattern of those changes.

The case-fatality rate for PEM was 28. 4 % despite hospitalization (1). Magnesium (Mg) modulates vasomotor tone, blood pressure, and peripheral blood flow. Mg deficiency was shown to trigger vasoconstriction and enhance vascular endothelial injury (2). On the other hand, endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide, produced by vascular endothelial cells (3). We investigated the effects of hypomagnesaemia on mortality and other mortality risk factors in patients with PEM. The study included 25 children with PEM. Their mean age was 4. 7 + 2. 9 months. In the study groups, malnutrition was not related to malabsorption. Malnutrition was diagnosed using the Wellcome classification. All children had severe malnutrition without malabsorption (mean weight-forheight z-score was- 3. 1). Weights were measured using the same equipment by the same observer. Weights were measured to the nearest 10 g using a digital electronic instrument (Seca 727 Digital <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale,</b> serial interface RS 232, Seca Corporation, Vogel&Holke, Germany).

One method {{that can be}} done to overcome these problems in accordance with the self-care nursing theory is the autogenic training relaxation. This method teaches mothers to be self-sufficient in building a positive intention and motivation to help the process of breastfeeding. This study aimed to examine the influence of autogenic training relaxation to the effectiveness of breastfeeding and the enhancement of breast milk volume on maternal postpartum. Method: By using an experimental posttest only-non equivalent control group design, 26 samples were taken based on the criteria and divided into two groups by matching technuiqe. autogenic training was given through MP 3 Player for 3 weeks.

40|$|Background The main {{causes of}} {{maternal}} mortality in Indonesia are pre-eclampsia, hemorrhage, and infection. Oxidative stress has a primary role in pre-eclampsia {{and one of}} its parameters is 8 -isoprostane serum level. The objective {{of this study is to}} measure 8 -isoprostane and to analyze the relationship between 8 -isoprostane level and birth weight in pre-eclampsia. Methods A cross-sectional study involving 23 pre-eclampsia and 29 normotensive pregnant women with normal or cesarean delivery at Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang from January to May 2011. Collected maternal blood samples were assessed for 8 -Isoprostane levels by means of a specific ELISA kit. Neonatal birth weight was measured immediately after delivery by means of calibrated <b>baby</b> <b>scales.</b> Differences in 8 -isoprostane levels between pre-eclampsia and normotensive women were assessed using independent t-test for normal distributed data, and the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed data. Results Mean 8 -isoprostane level was significantly higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in normotensive women (62. 52 ± 12. 19 pg/mL vs 28. 64 ± 8. 81 pg/mL) (p< 0. 05). Low birth weight was twice as frequent in pre-eclampsia than in normotensives. There was no correlation between 8 -isoprostane serum level and neonatal birth weight in pre-eclampsia. Conclusion The level of 8 -isoprostane was higher in pre-eclampsia than in normotensives. It is recommended to conduct further studies to determine whether 8 -isoprostane may be used as a predictive marker of pre-eclampsia...|$|R

Para isto, participaram na investigacao 180 puerperas portuguesas, com idades compreendidas entre os 20 e os 44 anos, que deram a luz na Maternidade Dr. Alfredo da Costa ou no Hospital D. Estefania, 87 por via vaginal e 93 por cesariana. Estas tiveram de responder ao Questionario Socio- Demografico; a segunda subescala do CPQ (Childbirth Perceptions Questionnaire), que avalia a satisfacao da mae com o tipo de parto e com a sua conduta durante o trabalho de parto e ao MABS (Mother and <b>Baby</b> <b>Scales),</b> que avalia a percepcao materna em relacao ao comportamento do seu bebe e o nivel de confianca materna para cuidar deste. Concluiu-se que, quando uma mae da a luz atraves de cesariana, quando comparada com uma mae que da a luz vaginalmente, fica menos satisfeita com o tipo de parto que teve e com a sua conduta durante o trabalho de parto; percepciona o comportamento do seu bebe como sendo mais negativo em varios aspectos, sobretudo quando este esta directamente relacionado com a situacao de amamentacao; e sente menos confianca em si mesma para amamenta-lo. Deste modo, e proposto um modelo teorico baseado numa abordagem psicanalitica e sao discutidas varias estratégias para reduzir o numero de partos por cesariana ou diminuir muitas das suas consequências psicologicas negativas. The {{present research}} intends to investigate if {{the type of}} delivery (vaginal versus caesarean section) has some influence, during the first days after the delivery, in the mother's satisfaction regarding it and her conduct during the labor, in the maternal perception of the baby's behaviour, in and out the breastfeeding situation, and {{in the level of}} maternal confidence to take care of him. In order to achieve this goal, 180 portuguese mothers participated in this investigation, with ages between 20 and 44 years old, who had recently given birth at Maternidade Dr. Alfredo da Costa or at Hospital D. Estefania, 87 of them through vaginal delivery and 93 through caesarean section. They had to answer to the Social-Demographic Questionnaire, to the second subscale of the CPQ (Childbirth Perceptions Questionnaire), which evaluates the mother's satisfaction with the type of delivery and her conduct during labor, and the MABS (Mother and <b>Baby</b> <b>Scales),</b> which evaluates the maternal perception of her baby's behaviour and the level of maternal confidence to take care of him. It was concluded that a mother who gives birth through caesarean section, when compared to a mother who gives birth vaginally, is less satisfied with the type of delivery that she had and with her conduct during the labor, perceives the baby's behaviour as being more negative in several aspects, mainly when this is directly related with the breastfeeding situation, and feels less confidence in herself to breastfeed the baby. In this way, a theoretical model based on a psychoanalytic approach is proposed and several strategies {{in order to reduce the}} number of caesarean sections or to decrease many of its negative psychological consequences, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim was to}} investigate the feasibility of assessing mother-infant interactions at discharge and at 6 months infant corrected age in singletons born before 32 weeks of gestation. The secondary aims were to describe these interactions and their disorders, explore the association between maternal emotional state and the interactions, and assess the relationship between disordered interactions and infant social withdrawal behaviour. OLIMPE is an ancillary study of the population-based study EPIPAGE 2, which recruited preterm neonates in France in 2011. 163 dyads participated at discharge and 148 at 6 months. Interactions were observed with the Attachment During Stress (ADS) scale, which includes two behavioural subscales, for the mother (m-ADS) and her infant (i-ADS). Two professionals independently completed the ADS scales for one third of the observations. Maternal emotional state was assessed using self-administered questionnaires of depression, anxiety, and stress. Infant's social withdrawal behaviour at 6 months was measured by the Alarm Distress <b>Baby</b> <b>scale.</b> At discharge, 15. 3 % of the m-ADS scales and 43. 3 % of the i-ADS scales had at least one unobserved component. At 6 months, all items on both scales were noticeable in > 90 % of the dyads. Reliability, estimated by the kappa coefficient, ranged between 0. 39 and 0. 76 at discharge, and between 0. 21 and 0. 69 at 6 months. Disordered interactions were indicated on 48. 6 % of the m-ADS scales and 36. 5 % of the i-ADS scales at discharge. At 6 months, these rates were 32. 6 % and 26. 0 %. Disordered interactions at 6 months were associated with identified disorder at discharge. Insecure infant attachment was not influenced by maternal mental health but was strongly associated with infant social withdrawal behaviour. The ADS scale can be used to screen for early interaction disorders after premature birth and may help to target dyads that would most benefit from early intervention...|$|E

This dissertation examined mothers' and fathers' perceptions of early (prenatal and postnatal) attachment in relationship to expectations for and experiences in childbirth as a variable for successful learning. The participants were obtained from three area hospitals, Evanston Northwestern, Sherman, and Rockford Memorial, and consisted of 65 couples who were primarily Caucasian, middle-class, and between 26 and 34 years of age. The study examined differences between mothers' and fathers' perceptions of early attachment expectations and experiences in childbirth. It also examined relationships between early attachment and expectations for and experiences in childbirth for mothers and for fathers separately. Finally, differences between primipara parents (parents with one child) and multipara parents (parents with more than one child) in regard to early attachment and expectations and experiences in childbirth were studied. The participants completed questionnaires during their third trimester consisting of a demographic questionnaire, Cranley's Maternal/Paternal Fetal Attachment Scale, and the Childbirth Expectations Questionnaire. After delivery they completed the Childbirth Experiences Questionnaire. Finally, when the infant was six-weeks old they filled out the My <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale.</b> Results indicated that there were differences for mothers and fathers with regard to prenatal attachment and experiences in childbirth. There were positive relationships between prenatal and postnatal attachment, between expectations for and experiences in childbirth, and between experiences in childbirth and postnatal attachment for both mothers and fathers. There was a positive correlation for mothers between prenatal attachment and their experiences in childbirth. There were differences between primiparas and multiparas as it related to expectations for childbirth only. This study has implications for practice. The results suggest that parents' expectations for childbirth may enhance their experiences in childbirth. This in turn may increase postnatal attachment and the development of secure infant/young child and parent attachment relationships. Secure attachment has been linked to positive outcomes for children in the area of socioemotional learning such as peer cooperation and less aggressive behaviors and cognitive learning such as memory retention, emergent literacy, and information processing...|$|E

Ultra micro methods for the measurement of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, acetoacetate, 3 -hydroxybutyrate, alanine and glycerol were described which make measurement of these substances using capillary blood samples possible, and permit longitudinal study of infants with nutritional problems. A study of test weighing in newborn infants demonstrated the inaccuracy of test weighing as a procedure for the determination of feed intake and the importance of the development of accurate <b>baby</b> <b>scales</b> for the measurement of body weight in low birth weight infants. No clear advantage for either continuous jejunal or intermittent gastric feeding was demonstrated in the first 3 weeks of life in a study of these enteral feeding methods in infants of 1. 5 kg. or less at birth. If nasojejunal feeding was continued, a slower rate of growth ensued than that of infants fed gastrically. The significance and possible explanations for these observations was discussed. Metabolic studies of low birth weight infants fed continuously by the transpyloric or nasogastric route showed no differences in metabolic profile. Considerable fluctuations of the levels of hormones and metabolites took place despite the continuous infusion of milk. Continuous enteral feeding did not abolish hormone and metabolite fluctuations thought to be of significance in promoting optimal growth. A study of two alternative regimens of total parenteral nutrition in infants with surgical gastrointestinal problems showed that there were greater fluctuations in metabolite levels in infants receiving nutrients sequentially than in infants to whom the nutrients were given continously.

After controlling for the kind of anesthesia received in labour, three conclusions must be taken into account: 1) between WCB with regional anaesthesia and WCB with general anaesthesia there is only one significant difference, with the former having higher scores for perception of baby as alert during feeds; 2) between WVB with regional anaesthesia and WVB with no anaesthesia there are only two significant differences, with the former having higher scores for lack of confidence in feeding and having lower scores for global confidence; 3) between WCB with regional anaesthesia and WVB with regional anaesthesia four significant differences emerge, with the former having a lower level of satisfaction with delivery and conduct in labour and having lower scores for perception of baby as alert responsive, and also having higher scores of perception of baby as irritable in feeds and higher scores for lack of confidence in feeding. Data seem compatible with the hypothesis that caesarean birth has some negative consequences upon mothers’ satisfaction and perceptions and, for this reason, psychological surveys should constitute a routine procedure in maternity hospitals, especially when newly mothers pertain to families affected by risks of psychological or social nature...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breastfeeding is well {{established}} as the optimal method for ensuring healthy infant nutrition. However, many adolescents remain unaware {{of the role of}} breastfeeding. Adolescent mothers continue to have the lowest rate of breastfeeding in many countries including Thailand, with only 17 % of Thai adolescent mothers continuing to breastfed at 6 months postpartum. Objective: Examine factors influencing breastfeeding behaviors in adolescent mothers, particularly those in Thailand. Methods: This dissertation project involved two research studies focusing on breastfeeding influencing factors in adolescent mothers. The first study was an integrative review of 22 articles published in 2000 - 2012. The findings revealed that personal factors appear {{to be the most important}} to the decision to initiate and maintain breastfeeding for adolescent mothers. Perceptions of cultural expectations also influence breastfeeding decisions and behaviors. Additionally, infant factors seem to be considerations in breastfeeding duration for the adolescent mother. The second study used a prospective cohort design to explore personal, social, cultural, and infant factors that explain and predict breastfeeding initiation and maintenance at 4 weeks postpartum in Thai adolescent mothers. The sample of 96 adolescent mothers was recruited at two prenatal clinics in Thailand. There were three time points for data collection; the initial visit was completed in the prenatal period, the second visit was within 48 hours postpartum, and the third was at 4 weeks postpartum. Instruments were the Iowa Infant feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS), Breastfeeding Influencing Factor Assessment (BIFA), Hughes Breast-Feeding Support Scale (HBSS), Pictorial Assessment of Temperament (PAT), Vulnerable <b>Baby</b> <b>Scale</b> (VBS), and Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC), all of which were translated into the Thai language. Results: Personal, social, and cultural factors were significantly correlated with breastfeeding initiation and were significant positive predictors of exclusive breastfeeding duration. Infant temperament was a significant negative predictor of exclusive breastfeeding duration. Maternal competence was also positively correlated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion: Facilitating the support mothers receive from their personal support systems is important to breastfeeding duration and maternal competence in the postpartum period. Enhancing exclusive breastfeeding and maternal competence provides a supportive environment for new adolescent mothers to develop their maternal role...|$|E
40|$|Background : Numerous {{research}} {{have been made}} to find out contributive factors of the exclusive breastfeeding. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} find out whether mothers’ nutritional status had any influence on the exclusivity of breastfeeding and  on the growth of their babies up to 4 months. Methods: This observational study was carried out with a prospective cohort design and lasted from November 2004 to May 2005. The subjects were 80 pairs of mother and baby treated at the Obstetric and Gynecology Unit (UPF) of Local Public Hospital (RSUD) Prof. Dr. W. Z. Johannes at Kupang – NTT. The subjects were divided into two groups namely Undernutrition status group marked by 23, 5 cm. Observed babies were those of normal or spontaneous delivery, non twin with > 2500 g birth weight. Follow up observations were made at family home and the data on breastfeeding characteristics were collected by interview, babies weight were measured by Secca <b>baby</b> <b>scale</b> with 0, 01 kg level of accuracy mid arm-circumference was measured by means of LILA tape, and body length was measured using length-board. Tools measure with 0, 1 cm level of accuracy. Some statistical tests were used namely Chi-Square; student’s t-test; and while Kaplan Meier log-rank test as needed. Results: More than 50 % of under-nutrition mothers were under 25 years old. Chi-Square test shows that significant difference between mother’s age was (p= 0, 04). More than 50 % of the KEK group gave birth for the first time or ‘primipara’ (p= 0, 25). Kaplan Meier analysis showed that  there was no difference between survival median of breastfeeding be- tween the both group (p= 0, 53). t-test showed that there were significant differences of the babies body weight of the both KEK and non KEK mothers, namely pd” 0, 01, p= 0. 01, and p= 0. 03 in the first, second, third, and the fourth month respectively. In terms of the average babies body length, the t-test also showed significant differences between both groups with p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 01 in the third and the fourth month respectively. Conclusion: I can be concluded that mother’ nutrition status did not have any influence on the exclusivity of breastfeeding, however, it did significantly influence babies growth from 0 - 4 month...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ultrasound to {{estimate}} fetal weight is done often {{in our country}} as part of investigations of pregnant women. In most of the developed countries and some developing countries, {{studies have been done}} to determine the validity of an ultrasound in estimating fetal weight, but no similar studies which have been done in Tanzania. Objective: To determine validity of ultrasound in estimating fetal weight in singleton pregnancies at MNH. Methodology: A diagnostic study was conducted from 1 st June 2011 to 31 st December 2011 at Muhimbili National Hospital Dar es salaam. All women who met inclusion criteria with indication for elective delivery were identified. Data on demographic, obstetric, social and medical history, the indication for elective delivery was collected. Ultrasound {{to estimate}} fetal weight was done 24 hours before delivery. The actual birth weight of the fetus was measured by using a desktop <b>baby</b> <b>scale</b> weighing machine. The estimated fetal weight by ultrasound was correlated with direct birth weight as gold standard. Data was entered in epi info version 6 and analyzed by using SPSS version 16. Results: A total of 800 pregnant women were recruited for the study. All of women consented and underwent an ultrasound estimation of fetal weight 24 hours before delivery. The median age was 30 years (range 25 - 34 years). Most were married or cohabiting (97. 8 %). about half of the participants (51. 2 %) had primary school education. The median actual birth weight was 3040 g (range 1200 – 5000 g). One hundred and twenty two infants (15. 2 %) weighed less than 2500 g and 31 (3. 9 %) weighed more than 4000 g. Good correlation was established between actual birth weight and estimated birth weight(r = 0. 892, p< 0. 001), the sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting birth weight below 2500 g was 59. 8 % and specificity was 99. 3 %. In the study population in estimating low birth weight, there was positive predictive value of 93. 6 %, negative predictive value of 93. 2 % and likelihood ratio of 87. The sensitivity of ultrasound in detecting birth weight more than 4000 g was 54. 8 % and specificity was 97. 8 %. In this study population there was positive predictive value of 47. 2 %, negative predictive value of 98. 2 % and likelihood ratio of 22 in estimating large birth weight babies. Conclusion; In a clinical setting Ultrasound is useful in diagnosing low birth weight babies while its usefulness in detecting large birth babies is questionable. As the sensitivity of ultrasound estimation of fetal weight to detect larger babies is poor, the use of such an objective measurement in the management of suspected macrosomia in singleton pregnancies should complement other clinical diagnostic methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{parent and child}} {{is one of the}} most important and most studied of all human relationships. The purpose of this descriptive study was to compare first-time fathers’ attendance at an entire series of prepared childbirth classes and presence at the delivery with father-infant acquaintance/attachment at three to four months post-birth. First-time fathers living with the infant’s mother were asked to complete the How I Feel About My <b>Baby</b> Now <b>scale</b> and a demographic survey. Two groups of fathers were compared. The first group attended classes, and the other group did not attend classes. Results of a statistical analysis utilizing descriptive statistics, t-tests, and one way ANOVA indicated that fathers who attended the classes felt significantly more angry at their babies than those who did not, and that fathers in the group under 30 years of age felt more playful toward their babies than those over thirty years...|$|R
40|$|Providing {{abandoned}} {{children the}} necessary medical and psychological care as possible after their institutionalization may minimize developmental delays. We describe psychomotor development in infants admitted to an orphanage in Khartoum, Sudan, assessed at admission and over an 18 -month follow-up. Psychological state and psychomotor quotients were determined using a simplified Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (NBAS), the Brunet-Lezine and Alarm distress <b>baby</b> (ADBB) <b>scale.</b> From May-September 2005, 151 children were evaluated 2, 4, 9, 12 and 18 months after inclusion. At admission, ∼ 15 % of children ≤ 1 month had a regulation impairment {{according to the}} NBAS, and 33. 8 % presented a distress state (ADBB score > 5). More than 85 % (129 / 151) recovered normal psychomotor development. The results of the program reinforce the importance of early detection of psychological disorders followed by rapid implementation of psychological case management to improve the development of young children in similar institutions and circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between social withdrawal behaviour at one year and motor and language milestones. One-year old children from the EDEN French population-based birth cohort study (Study on the pre- and postnatal determinants of the child's development and prospective health Birth Cohort Study) were included. Social withdrawal at one year was assessed by trained midwives using the Alarm Distress <b>BaBy</b> (ADBB) <b>scale.</b> Midwives concurrently examined infants' motor and language milestones. Parents reported on child's psychomotor and language milestones, during the interview with the midwife. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, social withdrawal behaviour was significantly associated with concurrent delays in motor and language milestones assessed by the midwife or the parents. Higher scores on social withdrawal behaviour as assessed with the ADBB were associated with delays in reaching language milestones, and to a lesser extent with lower motor ability scores. Taking the contribution of social withdrawal behaviour into account may help understand the unfolding of developmental difficulties in children...|$|R
