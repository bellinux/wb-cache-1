40|$|The {{replica plating}} method as {{developed}} by Lederberg {{has been used}} to differentiate between "true" and "false" histidine-requiring revertant bacterial colonies which develop on minimal agar plates in the Ames test. Strains of S. typhimurium LT 2, TA 100, when exposed to either sodium dichromate or the fumes from the welding of stainless steel, develop colonies whose apparent numbers are directly in proportion to the Cr(VI) content per plate in both cases, over a wide dose range. Replica impressions of the resulting colonies were transferred to Vogel Bonner minimal agar plates and incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C. It was then observed that considerable numbers of "false" revertant colonies were obtained at those Cr(VI) doses which resulted in a pronounced toxic effect, albeit with an acceptable level of the bacterial <b>background</b> <b>lawn.</b> No morphological distinction between "true" and "false" revertant colonies could be made. Although it would appear that at low doses (i. e., low toxicity) the true mutagenicity of stainless steel welding fumes can be completely accounted for by the presence of Cr(VI), the dose range over which the mutagenicity assay is reliable cannot be estimated from examination of the <b>background</b> <b>lawn</b> or from an estimate of the degree of survival of the treated cultures. Thus there is raised a serious question concerning the reliability of quantitative data published in bacterial mutagenicity testing where replica testing of the histidine requirement of the resulting "revertant" colonies is not routinely made. It is suggested that the replica technique can easily be developed as a simple and useful tool for the control of histidine requirement and ampicillin resistance in routine mutagenicity testing.

40|$|The {{mutagenic}} potential of lewisite was evaluated {{in the standard}} plate incorporation method and by the preincubation modification of the Ames Salmonella/microsomal assay with tester strains TA 97, TA 98, TAlOO and TA 102. All strains were tested with activation (20 and 50 {micro}l/ plate) and without activation. The lewisite was screened initially for toxicity with TA 98 over a range of concentrations from 0. 01 to 250 {micro}g of material per plate. However, concentrations selected for mutagenicity testing were adjusted {{to a range of}} 0. 001 to 5 {micro}g/plate because of the sensitivity of tester strain TA 102, which exhibited cytotoxicity at 0. 01 ug/plate. No mutagenic response was exhibited by any of the strains in either method used. All other tester strains showed evidence of cytoxicity (reduction in mutagen response or sparse <b>background</b> <b>lawn)</b> at 5. 0 {micro}g/plate or lower...|$|E

5000|$|Others {{appreciated}} the subtlety and wit in its direction: [...] "The intellectual {{thrust of the}} film hinges on alienation — from both the text and the staging. This is a wry critique of the theatrical mode whose ample pleasures derive from minute touches which offer {{a reminder of how}} the camera, its placement and a delicate edit here or there, can charge a banal text with added emotion and import." [...] And: [...] "Life of Riley isn’t, as far as one can tell from the film, one of Ayckbourn’s most interesting or most formally inventive plays—the key conceit is that Riley himself is never seen but hovers in the background like a convivial Godot. But what’s fascinating is the amount of formal mischief that Resnais whips up. One running joke is the excess of establishing shots, of a singularly artificial variety: every time the scene shifts to one of the characters’ houses, Resnais shows us a cartoon of the place (by French artist Blutch), which then is replaced by a stylized stage-set version of the same locale, designed in dizzyingly distinctive color schemes by Jacques Saulnier, with gorgeously painted curtains standing in for trees, houses, <b>background</b> <b>lawns</b> alike...." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{stood near}} the window, the center figure of the group, {{offering}} a little slate that hung by her side, with a pencil attached to it, to the rector's eldest daughter, who was sitting at her right hand on a stool. The second of the young ladies knelt on the other side, with both her arms round the dog's neck; holding him back as he {{stood in front of}} the child, so as to prevent him from licking her face, which he had made several resolute attempts to do, from the moment when she first entered the room. Both the Doctor's daughters were healthy, rosy English beauties in the first bloom of girlhood; and both were attired in the simplest and prettiest muslin dresses, very delicate in color and pattern. Pity and admiration, mixed with some little perplexity and confusion, gave an unusual animation to their expressions; for they could hardly accustom themselves as yet to the idea of the poor child's calamity. They talked to her eagerly, as if she could hear and answer them--while she, on her part, stood looking alternately from one to the other, watching their lips and eyes intently, and still holding out the slate, with her innocent gesture of invitation and gentle look of apology, for the eldest girl to write on. The varying expressions of the three; the difference in their positions, the charming contrast between their light, graceful figures and the bulky strength and grand solidity of form in the noble Newfoundland dog who stood among them; the lustrous <b>background</b> of <b>lawn</b> and flowers and trees, seen through the open window; the sparkling purity of the sunshine which fell brightly over one part of the group; the transparency of the warm shadows that lay so caressingly, sometimes on a round smooth cheek, sometimes over ringlets of glistening hair, sometimes on the crisp folds of a muslin dress--all these accidental combinations of the moment, these natural and elegant positions of nature's setting, these accessories of light and shade and background garden objects beautifully and tenderly filling up the scene, presented together a picture which it was a luxury to be able to look on, which it seemed little short of absolute profanation to disturb.|$|R
