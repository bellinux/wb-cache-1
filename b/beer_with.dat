5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar.

5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of <b>beer</b> <b>with</b> whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits {{at the mouth of the}} River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden {{staircase}} known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past <b>Beer,</b> <b>with</b> Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study we aimed at investigating, for the first time, {{phenolic}} compounds in Brazilian beers of different types and styles. We also aimed at applying chemometrics for modeling beer’s antioxidant capacity {{as a function of}} their physicochemical attributes (density, refractive index, bitterness and ethanol content). Samples (n= 29) were analyzed by PCA originating five groups, especially according to ethanol contents and bitterness. In general, Group V (alcoholic <b>beers</b> <b>with</b> very high bitterness) presented higher refractive index, bitterness, ethanol and phenolics contents than Groups I (non-alcoholic beers) and II (alcoholic <b>beers</b> <b>with</b> low bitterness). Brazilian beers phenolics profile was distinct from that of European <b>beers,</b> <b>with</b> high contents of gallic acid (0. 5 – 14. 7 mg/L) and low contents of ferulic acid (0. 2 – 1. 8 mg/L). Using PLS, beer’s antioxidant capacity measured by FRAP assay could be predicted with acceptable precision by data of ethanol content and density, bitterness and refractive index values...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, {{while serving}} his prison sentence, Sajal Barui {{showed signs of}} an alleged kidney ailment and was {{transferred}} to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital for examination. On 15 September 2001 he escaped from the hospital and was at large until early 2003. On the night of his escape, Sajal Barui hosted a beer party to which he invited the two police constables that had been put on guard to watch him. He often offered beer to the constables after it had been smuggled in by his girlfriend, so they did not suspect his motives. On that night, however, he spiked the two bottles of <b>beer</b> <b>with</b> sleeping pills and watched them fall asleep. He then {{walked out of the}} hospital unhindered.|$|E
25|$|For {{hundreds}} of years the English ancestors of the colonists had consumed beer and ale. Both in England and in the New World, people of both sexes and all ages typically drank <b>beer</b> <b>with</b> their meals. Because importing a continuing supply of beer was expensive, the early settlers brewed their own. However, {{it was difficult to}} make the beer they were accustomed to because wild yeasts caused problems in fermentation and resulted in a bitter, unappetizing brew. Although wild hops grew in New England, hop seeds were ordered from England in order to cultivate an adequate supply for traditional beer. In the meantime, the colonists improvised a beer made from red and black spruce twigs boiled in water, as well as a ginger beer.|$|E
