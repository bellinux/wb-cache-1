25|$|The city {{opened its}} Public Electronic Network (PEN) in 1989, {{providing}} citizens with a <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> <b>system</b> (<b>BBS)</b> to discuss local issues and access city services.

The SWASHLOCK (Showers, WASHers, and LOCKers) plan was developed on PEN and implemented in 1993. PEN also served as a center to organize opposition to the 1990 proposal to redevelop 415 PCH.|$|E
40|$|The present studies {{demonstrate}} two computerized {{approaches to}} examining {{the expression of}} depression on the Internet. Study 1 observed linguistic markers of depression in English and Spanish forums. English and Spanish posts by depressed (N= 160) and non-depressed individuals (N= 160) were collected from Internet forums using <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>bbs).</b> A computer program (LIWC 2001) {{was used to compare}} linguistic categories across groups within the English and Spanish language. Study 2 analyzed the themes people use when talking about their depression in forums in English and Spanish. Posts by English speaking (N= 404) and Spanish speaking depressed people (N= 400) were collected from bbs. An automated inductive approach to content analysis was used to compare how the expression of depression varies across cultures. The results for Study 1 showed that linguistic cues previously associated with depression were found to be higher in depressed than in nondepressed posts in English and Spanish. Study 2 showed that depressed people who wrote in Spanish were more likely to mention relational concerns than depressed people who wrote in English, who were more likely to mention medicinal concerns. Implications for informational and support needs and concerns in psychotherapy vs. online support across cultures are addressed and discussed...|$|R

500|$|A <b>bulletin</b> <b>board</b> <b>system</b> (<b>BBS)</b> {{based on}} the {{interface}} of the large Japanese Internet forum 2channel (2ch) was formed on January 26, 2000 named , otherwise nicknamed as [...] The board originated from 2ch's video game discussion board due to a dispute involving the game Kizuato in December 1999; Kizuato was an early game of another visual novel producing brand named Leaf. Ultimately, fans of the game moved to 2ch's adult game board, but {{there was not much}} resolution, and at the time Key fans on the board were being shunned for discussions on Kanon and, at the time, Key's upcoming game Air. This resulted finally with the Leaf and Key fans moving away from 2ch and forming again on the PINKchannel Internet forum. The board serves as a discussion board for anything related to Leaf and Key. This includes the games the companies produce, but also the companies themselves and the staff that make up those companies. The BBS gets approximately 900 posts per day as of March 2010. Like 2ch, the board has a default anonymous posting setting, and the default name is , a reference to the heroine [...] from [...] who uses the words [...] "dayo" [...] and [...] "mon" [...] frequently.|$|E
