5|$|In {{addition}} to a commercially prepared seed mix, a <b>balanced</b> <b>diet</b> for a Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in vitamins and minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry leaves, are also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity.|$|E
5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A <b>balanced</b> <b>diet</b> for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E

This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E

5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A <b>balanced</b> <b>diet,</b> based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a <b>balanced</b> <b>diet,</b> moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to concern}} over {{nitrogen}} (N) emissions, this study attempted to evaluate dietary approaches to reduce N excretion by dairy cattle. Knowledge about potential N sources that were either unaccounted for or under-predicted by CPM Dairy and the Dairy NRC (2001) {{was used to}} formulate rations that were much lower in crude protein (CP) than typically fed to dairy cattle but would potentially not decrease production. Specifically, the three diets fed were predicted to have: (1) positive rumen N and metabolizable protein (MP) <b>balances</b> (<b>Diet</b> P) (2) negative MP balance and positive rumen N <b>balance</b> (<b>Diet</b> N), or (3) negative rumen N balance but positive MP <b>balance</b> (<b>Diet</b> T) as predicted by CPM Dairy version 3. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether, and to what extent, the decrease in predicted ruminally available N and MP supply would affect milk production. Eighty-eight multiparous lactating Holstein cows (83 ± 20 DIM), were blocked by average daily milk yield to 50 DIM and parity and assigned to three diets differing in N content or predicted rumen degradability of the feed N.

40|$|Growth {{performance}} of pigs on smallholder {{farms in the}} tropics is low. Lack of feedstuffs, seasonal feed shortages, and feeding nutritionally unbalanced diets contribute to slow growth. Low-cost <b>balanced</b> <b>diets</b> are needed to improve pig performance. In this study, we estimated the nutrient requirements of local pigs on smallholder farms in Kenya and developed <b>balanced</b> low-cost <b>diets</b> using seasonally available local feedstuffs. Diets were formulated to provide pigs with 80 % of the nutrient density in corn and soybean meal-based (reference) diets to minimize the cost per unit of energy and other nutrients. Estimated requirements for starting and growing pigs (8 to 35 kg body weight) were as follows: digestible energy (DE) 2960 kcal/kg of dry matter (DM), standardized ileal digestibility (SID) lysine 5. 8 g/kg of DM, calcium 2. 8 g/kg of DM, standardized total tract digestible (STTD) phosphorous 1. 4 g/kg of DM, and crude protein 85 g/kg of DM. Nutrient requirements of local pigs on smallholder farms in Kenya were {{lower than those of}} exotic breed pigs raised in commercial settings. Seasonally available local feedstuffs were used to develop low-cost <b>balanced</b> <b>diets.</b> Twenty-two diets are presented based on season, cost, and feedstuff availability. This study has broad applicability as a case study of an approach that could be applied in other tropical regions in which smallholder pig keeping is practiced and where local feedstuffs for pigs are available seasonally.
