25|$|The M34 was {{designed}} to hold 76 M125 bomblets, arranged in four groups of 19. Each bomblet held 2.6 pounds of the nerve agent sarin, and 8.8 ounces of the explosive tetryl. The ten pound cylindrical M125 bomblet also held an opening delay, fuze and parachute, {{as well as a}} <b>burster,</b> which contained the explosive. A M34 cluster bomb, fully loaded with M125 bomblets, had an agent weight to weapon weight ratio of 17 percent; the M34 and M125 were not the best delivery system. Eventually, cylindrical chemical bomblets, such as the M125, were supplanted by spherical models because they could obtain a greater coverage area.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in compact clusters. They may be round or {{barrel-shaped}} with a lid or a cap {{at the top}} (known as the operculum). They also contain a ring of small protuberances near the cap called micropylar processes. They permit the passage of sperm into the egg for fertilization and enable gaseous exchange from within the egg and the outside world for the embryos. The eggs are white or cream colored when freshly laid but can change color as the embryo matures. When hatching, the prolarva (the advanced embryo) exit the egg by opening the lid through peristaltic movements {{and with the help}} of a T-shaped internal structure in the egg (known as the egg <b>burster).</b>|$|E
30|$|This is {{not true}} for slow-wave <b>bursters,</b> in which the whole {{trajectory}} in the unfolding must be specified.

30|$|There {{are other}} classes of {{bursting}} dynamics {{in which the}} active phase of the burst terminates in a fold of limit cycles, but in which the initiation event is different from those considered here. For example, from the classification in Table 1.6 of [7], one sees that there are also super-Hopf/fold cycle <b>bursters.</b> For these, the active phase of the burst initiates with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. However, since the termination event is also a fold of limit cycles, we hypothesize that these <b>bursters</b> will also exhibit torus canards. We note that, for these super-Hopf/fold cycle <b>bursters,</b> the slow passage effect through a Hopf bifurcation will {{play a role in}} determining the system parameters for which torus canards exist, just as it did for the sub-Hopf/fold cycle <b>bursters.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} work we {{systematically}} extend the work by Golubitsky et al. to the deg. TB singularity and investigate its four unfoldings. We aim at uncovering {{the presence or}} absence not only of paths for <b>bursters</b> known from cell activity, but of all planar <b>bursters</b> present in Izhikevichâ€™s classification. This would provide a general model ready to be applied in cell bursting and in any other field for which bursting classification is in progress, such as epileptic seizure modeling [15]. We give indications on how to build slow-wave <b>bursters,</b> which is in line with the work of [20]. Furthermore we make use of hysteresis, when present, to build hysteresis-loop <b>bursters.</b> This allows less constraints on the required path and make it simpler to implement transitions between different bursting classes (see also Franci et al. [21]).|$|R
40|$|We have {{systematically}} investigated Galactic {{models for}} classical gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in which gamma-ray <b>bursters</b> are {{ejected from the}} Galactic disk. It {{is relatively easy to}} construct models in which the predicted GRB sky distribution is isotropic and consistent with the present BATSE data if the outer halo is not spherically symmetric. The <b>bursters</b> must receive a velocity kick larger than similar to 600 - 700 km s(- 1) at birth and remain active <b>bursters</b> for at least 10 (9) yr. We suggest strongly magnetized neutron stars with magnetic fields of order 10 (15) G as possible sources of classical GRBs...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that classical gamma ray bursts (GRB) occasionally repeat {{from the same}} locations on the sky {{would be difficult to}} reconcile with models where the <b>bursters</b> lie at cosmological distances. The competing models in which the <b>bursters</b> have a galatic origin can often accomidate repeating <b>bursters,</b> so these models would be favored if some <b>bursters</b> were found to repeat. At present, there is some controversy about whether there is evidence for burst repetition in the BATSE data. We introduce a gamma ray burst ``pair matching" statistic {{that can be used to}} search for a repeater signal in the BATSE data. Unlike the statistics that have been used previously, the ``pair matching" statistic makes explicit use of the reported position errors for each burst and is less likely to produce (false) evidence of burst repetition due to correlations in the positions that are inconsistent with repeating <b>bursters.</b> We find that the excesses in ``matched" and ``antipodal" pairs seen with other statistics are caused by an excess of pairs with a separation smaller than their error bars would indicate. When we consider all separations consistent with the error bars, no significant signal remains. Furthermore, when we repeat this test with samples which have had several selection biases removed or with well determined positions, the signal at very small separations becomes insignificant. Thus, we conclude that the publicly available BATSE 1 B and 2 B data sets contain no evidence for repeating gamma ray <b>bursters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} kick {{velocity}} to newly born pulsars {{on the distribution}} of #gamma#-ray <b>bursters</b> is examined {{in the context of the}} disk origin model and the halo model of the #gamma#-ray <b>bursters.</b> The conversion formula from two-dimensional velocity distribution function to a three-dimensional distribution function is derived and it is applied to reproduce the distribution function of the kick velocity of radio pulsars. Monte Carlo simulations of the kicked neutron stars show that the disk neutron star model of the #gamma#-ray <b>bursters</b> still needs unnatural assumptions if the velocity distribution of the #gamma#-ray <b>bursters</b> is same with that of neutron stars; only the neutron stars with very high kick velocity could become the #gamma#-ray <b>bursters</b> and there are silent majorities. On the other hand, the core radius of #gamma#-ray <b>bursters</b> is found not to be extended by the kick velocity if the core-halo structure similar to the Galactic dark matter distribution is assumed on the initial distribution of the halo neutron stars. Thus the kick velocity to the neutron stars do not improve the statistics both of the disk model and the halo model. Two possibilities to save the Galactic models are suggested: (1) The #gamma#-ray <b>bursters</b> are old neutron stars which were accelerated to be faster than 750 km s"-" 1 by jet propulsion and passed the death line for pulsar due to the spin down caused by the rotational energy loss by the jet ejection. (2) The initial distribution of the neutron stars is fairly uniform and the extent of the halo is large enough for the halo model to be consistent with the observations. It implies that the initial star formation burst of the Galaxy occurred fairly uniformly in the extended halo region. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Most burst models require <b>bursters</b> {{to reside}} in normal host galaxies with peak luminosities of L = 1 1057 photon sâˆ’ 1 or L = 2 1058 photon sâˆ’ 1. These models can be {{directly}} tested by looking for host galaxies in small GRB error boxes in either of two data sets: (1) 8 optical transients detected for SAX bursts and (2) 23 of the all-time bright bursts. If the hosts are normal galaxies, then analysis of either data set shows L> 6 1058 photon sâˆ’ 1. This result strongly rejects both luminosity cases provided <b>bursters</b> appear in normal host galaxies, with the bright burst sample being free of problems relating to galaxy evo-lution.
