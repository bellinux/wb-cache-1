25|$|Analogues of {{hydroxyzine}} include <b>buclizine,</b> cetirizine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, etodroxizine, meclizine, and pipoxizine among others.|$|E
25|$|Other drugs {{related to}} {{hydroxyzine}} are cyclizine, <b>buclizine,</b> and meclizine, and they share {{all or most}} of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine cetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not reported to appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier, but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing {{some or all of the}} anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.|$|E

50|$|Meclizine is a first-generation {{antihistamine}} (nonselective H1 antagonist) of the piperazine class. It is structurally and pharmacologically {{similar to}} <b>buclizine,</b> cyclizine, and hydroxyzine, {{but has a}} shorter half-life of six hours compared to cyclizine and hydroxyzine with about 20 hours (though half-life {{should not be confused}} with duration). It is used as an antivertigo/antiemetic agent, specifically in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Meclizine is sometimes combined with opioids, especially ones of the open-chain class like methadone, dextropropoxyphene, and dipipanone (originally combined with meclizine's parent drug cyclizine, the brand name of this combination is Diconal).|$|E

50|$|Whilst the {{individual}} component drugs may be prescribed individually, as a combination, {{it is only}} available as the branded Paramax preparation in the UK. In the UK {{there are only two}} other combination analgesics with antiemetics (i.e., anti-nausea) products available: MigraMax (aspirin with metoclopramide) and the over-the-counter drug Migraleve (paracetamol and codeine for analgesia, with <b>buclizine</b> as the antiemetic). The role for these products is between just the use of simple analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen) and the triptan class of drugs; although the latter are not options during pregnancy. In the elderly although triptans are generally avoided, so too are antiemetics such as metoclopramide due to higher risks of side effects. In Australia and New Zealand, the combination is available without prescription from pharmacies.|$|E
40|$|<b>Buclizine</b> {{is a first}} {{generation}} antihistaminic with some anticholinergic potential. This drug has specific pharmacological indications in allergy, morning sickness, migraine, motion sickness and insomnia with some or doubtful success. It is an obsolete drug of decline use due to better availability of second and third generation antihistamines. <b>Buclizine,</b> a forgotten drug used in past is now re-introduced as an appetite stimulant. Previously one of the counterpart &# 8220;cyproheptadine&# 8221; was used but currently banned from most {{part of the world}} due to untoward effects. The standard textbook of pediatrics has not mentioned <b>buclizine</b> as an appetizer. On the other side, no article published (Pub med search) in last few decades to favors this claim. This drug has no space in WHO essential medicine list probably due to doubtful safety. A scientific issue arises- Does children require appetite stimulant? Appetizers are never be a rational solution. They can be used as adjunct because of their placebo effect. Meanwhile placebo has limited role in children on behalf of other party (parents) involvement. Misperception about diet, feeding practice, dysfunctional &# 8216;parent child interaction&# 8217; etc. needed proper counselling rather than prescribing an appetite stimulant. There may be risk, that <b>buclizine</b> to become &# 8220;OTC&# 8221; appetizer in future due to current promotional spurt by pharmaceutical. However, large scale multicentric clinical trials are needed before promotion of <b>buclizine</b> as pediatric appetite stimulant, with careful watch of pharmacovigilance perspective.

40|$|A rapid, {{fast and}} precise method has been {{developed}} and validated for the simultaneous determination of amlodipine with H 1 -receptor antagonists (cetirizine, fexofenadine, and <b>buclizine)</b> from dosage forms. The chromatography was performed on a PurospherÂ® Star, C 18 (5 mm, 250 Ã— 4. 6 mm) column using acetonitrile: buffer (0. 01 mM) (40 : 60, v/v, pH adjusted to 3. 0), as a mobile phase. The mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 1. 0 mLÂ·min- 1 and UV detection was performed at 240 nm. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision and specificity. The method was applied to study the interaction between amlodipine and H 1 -receptor antagonists. These interactions were carried out in simulated gastric juice (pH 1), simulated full stomach (pH 4), blood pH (pH 7. 4) and simulating GI (pH 9). The interacting drugs were heated at 37 â„ƒ with intermit-tent shaking and the samples were withdrawn every thirty minutes for three hours and drug contents were analyzed by RP-HPLC techniques. In most cases the in vitro availability of amlodipine was decreased. It was observed that the change in in vitro availability was pH dependent...|$|E
