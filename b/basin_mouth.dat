40|$|Humid {{tropical}} {{regions are}} often characterized by extreme variability of fluvial processes. The Rio Terraba drains the largest river basin, covering 4767 km 2, in Costa Rica. Mean annual rainfall is 3139 ± 419 sd mm and mean annual discharge is 2168 ± 492 sd mm (1971 – 88). Loss of forest cover, high rainfall erosivity and geomorphologic instability all {{have led to}} considerable degradation of soil and water resources at local to basin scales. Parametric and non-parametric statistical methods were used to estimate sediment yields. In the Terraba basin, sediment yields per unit area increase from the headwaters to the <b>basin</b> <b>mouth,</b> and the trend is generally robust towards choice of methods (parametric and LOESS) used. This {{is in contrast to}} a general view that deposition typically exceeds sediment delivery with increase in basin size. The specific sediment yield increases from 112 ± 11 · 4 sd t km− 2 year− 1 (at 317 · 9 km 2 on a major headwater tributary) to 404 ± 141 · 7 sd t km− 2 year− 1 (at 4766 · 7 km 2) at the <b>basin</b> <b>mouth</b> (1971 – 92). The analyses of relationships between sediment yields and basin parameters for the Terraba sub-basins and for a total of 29 basins all over Costa Rica indicate a strong land use effect related to intensive agriculture besides hydro-climatology. The best explanation for the observed pattern in the Terraba basin is a combined spatial pattern of land use and rainfall erosivity. These were integrated in a soil erosion index that is related to the observed patterns of sediment yield. Estimated sediment delivery ratios increase with basin area. Intensive agriculture in lower-lying alluvial fans exposed to highly erosive rainfall contributes {{a large part of the}} sediment load. The higher elevation regions, although steep in slope, largely remain under forest, pasture, or tree-crops. High rainfall erosivity (> 7400 MJ mm ha− 1 h− 1 year − 1) is associated with land uses that provide inadequate soil protection. It is also associated with steep, unstable slopes near the <b>basin</b> <b>mouth.</b> Improvements in land use and soil management in the lower-lying regions exposed to highly erosive rainfall are recommended, and are especially important to basins in which sediment delivery ratio increases downstream with increasing basin area.

Differences of fault patterns between shelf and slope are obvious. In order to investigate the tectonic evolution, five series of analogue modeling experiments were compared. The aim of this study is to investigate how crustal thickness influences fault structures, and compare this to the observed present-day fault structures in the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin.</b> The initial lithospheric rheological structure can be derived from the best fit between the modeled and observed faults.

The younger rocks occupy the northern and eastern parts while the older Proterozoics are divided {{into a number of}} tectonic groups in the west and south (GSI 2004). The area is cut across by a number of thrusts, namely the Purola Thrust, Main Central Thrust and Jutogh Thrust, which indicate the dynamic pressures the rocks have been subjected to and account for the large varieties of metamorphics seen here. Near the <b>basin</b> <b>mouth,</b> the Jaunsar Group comprises of rocks of Neo Proterozioc age with constituents like grey and green phyllites, quartzites and schists.

The Central Crystalline Group, occupying the middle part of the basin, can be divided into lower grade and higher grade categories. The lower grades (called the Gangar Formation), comprise of inter-calated sequences of schists, mica, quartzites, biotites, quartz and gneiss. The higher grades (called the Har-ki-dun Formation) thrust over these lower grades (via the Main Central Thrust), and comprise of schist, gneiss, migmatites and basic intrusives.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the role of}} aquatic systems in the global N cycle using a spatially distributed, within-basin, aquatic nitrogen (N) removal model, implemented within the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES-N). The model predicts mean annual total N (TN) removal by small rivers (with drainage areas from 2. 6 ¿ 1000 km 2), large rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, using a 30 ¿ latitude × longitude river network to route and process material from continental source areas to the coastal zone.

Model-predicted TN concentrations at <b>basin</b> <b>mouths</b> corresponded well with observations (median relative error = ¿ 12 %, interquartile range of relative error = 85 %), an improvement over assumptions of uniform aquatic removal across basins. Removal by aquatic systems globally accounted for 14 % of total N inputs to continental surfaces, but represented 53 % of inputs to aquatic systems. Integrated aquatic removal was similar in small rivers (16. 5 % of inputs), large rivers (13. 6 %), and lakes (15. 2 %), while large reservoirs were less important (5. 2 %). Bias related to runoff suggests improvements are needed in nonpoint N input estimates and/or aquatic biological activity.

40|$|Based on the {{flexural}}-cantilever {{model and}} flexural isostasy model, three independent quantitative {{methods have been}} used to calculate the stretching factors of the upper crust, whole crust, and whole lithosphere in the deep-water area of the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin,</b> northern South China Sea. These results demonstrate that depth-dependent stretching has occurred within the lithosphere of the study area. The lithospheric extension shows lateral differences between the Baiyun Sag and the KaipingâShunde Sags. The broad forearc pre-rifting basement and hot thinned lithosphere tend to generate a structural style of wide half-graben in the Baiyun Sag, while the volcanic arc basement and normal or thickened lithosphere form a structural style of narrow half-graben in the KaipingâShunde Sags. In line with the lithospheric deformational features and tectonic evolution stages, we propose three various dynamic mechanisms at different tectonic stages, and they are probably uniform, composite, and depth-dependent extension models, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} deep crustal {{architecture of}} the Baiyun Sag of the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin,</b> northern South China Sea based on velocity analysis, time-depth conversion and seismic interpretation of the deep seismic reflection profile DSRP- 2002. The profile was acquired and processed to 14 S TWT by the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) in 2002. It extends across the Baiyun Sag of the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin,</b> from the northern continental shelf of the SCS to the deepwater province. As the first deep seismic reflection profile in the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin,</b> this profile reveals seismic phases from basement down to upper most mantle. The Moho surface appears in the profile as an undulating layer of varying thickness of 1 - 3 km. It {{is not a single}} reflector interface, but a velocity gradient or interconversion layer. The crust thins stepwisely from the shelf to the continental slope and the abyssal plain (from north to south), and also thins under depocenters. The crustal thickness is only 7 km in the depocenter of the main Baiyun Sag, which corresponds to a Moho upwelling mirroring the basement topography. In the lower slope and the ocean-continental transition zone of the southernmost portion of the profile, three sub-parallel, NW-dipping strong reflectors found at depths around 10 - 21 km are interpreted as indications of a subducted Mesozoic oceanic crust. Crustal faults exist in the northern and southern boundaries of the Baiyun Sag. The intense and persistent subsidence of the Baiyun Sag might be related to the long-term activity of the crustal faults...|$|R

30|$|Based on a {{large amount}} of seismic, {{drilling}} and core data, the characteristics of the early-middle Miocene submarine fans in the Baiyun Sag, northern South China Sea are investigated. By analyzing the sedimentary processes of submarine fans in SQ 21 (SQ 21 refers to the 3 rd-order sequence with its bottom boundary 21 Ma), a sedimentary model of the sand-rich fans is established and the main factors controlling fan deposition are detailed. The results indicate that from early to middle Miocene the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin</b> developed seven 3 rd-order sequences in all, with each lowstand systems tract (LST) of the sequence corresponding to submarine fans. However, only the fans in SQ 13.8 and SQ 21 are sand-rich fans, the others being mud-rich fans. The cores reveal that the submarine fans in the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin</b> developed five lithofacies: (1) mud clast-bearing sandstone, interpreted as channel deposits; (2) typical turbidite sandstones, also interpreted as channel deposits; (3) thin-bedded sandstone and mudstone, interpreted as channel-levee complex deposits; (4) massive sandstones, interpreted as lobe deposits; (5) massive mudstone, interpreted as hemipelagic mud. The sand-rich submarine fans in the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin</b> mainly developed in LST, and in LST reverse faults were active, which {{led to the formation of}} accommodation on the shelf. Different from the theory of classic sequence stratigraphy, the accommodation on the shelf captures terrigenous debris transported by the Pearl River, and the uplift at the edge of shelf serves as a “Linear Source” for the deep water area instead of the Pearl River. Therefore, the fans mainly derived from the eroded debris from the uplift. Factors controlling fan deposition include the basin’s tectonic framework, the evolution of the slope break, relative sea-level changes as well as the evolution of the fault system, and the fans are formed under the combination of the above factors.|$|R

In general, the three wells contain a fairly well-preserved, abundant foraminiferal fauna. The proposed planktonic foraminiferal zonation follows the scheme updated by Wade et al. (2011). Nineteen planktonic foraminiferal zones have been recognized, 14 zones (zones M 1 –M 14) for the Miocene and 5 zones (zones PL 1 –PL 5) for the Pliocene. The zonation is correlated with previously published biostratigraphic subdivisions of the Neogene succession in the PRMB and with international foraminiferal zonations. The zonal boundaries are mostly defined by the last appearance datum of zonal taxa of planktonic foraminifera, which is more reliable than the FAD (first appearance datum) events for ditch cutting sampling. Changes in the coiling of Globorotalia menardii (s. l.) are also used to define the zonal boundaries, where no LADs (last appearance datum) are available. The Fohsella fohsi group, comprising useful taxa for delimiting zonal boundaries of the middle Miocene in other areas, has a poor record within the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin</b> due to unfavorable ecological conditions, and cannot {{be used for the}} studied wells.

Most rifting in the basin was completed by 25 Ma, shortly after the time sea floor spreading began. Extension during rifting events was determined using McKenzie equations.

Each location had different relative intensities of red versus blue wavelengths of light, and they also had marked differences in phytoplankton community structure and chlorophyll concentrations. Larger cells and greater chlorophyll concentrations seem to be related to light regimes in which red light intensity is much greater than blue, but other locations where red light is similar in intensity to blue or where blue light intensity is greater are dominated by smaller cells with a lower chlorophyll concentration. Extreme differences in the intensities of red and blue light also seem to be related to increased total concentrations of phytoplankton cells. Acknowledgment...|$|R
40|$|A new 3 D seismic {{reflection}} {{data volume}} acquired in 2012 has {{allowed for the}} detailed mapping and characterization of gas hydrate distribution in the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin</b> in the South China Sea. Previous studies of core and logging data showed that gas hydrate occurrence at high concentrations {{is controlled by the}} presence of relatively coarse-grained sediment and the upward migration of thermogenic gas from the deeper sediment section into the overlying gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ); however, the spatial distribution of the gas hydrate remains poorly defined. We used a constrained sparse spike inversion technique to generate acousticimpedance images of the hydrate-bearing sedimentary section from the newly acquired 3 D seismic data volume. High-amplitude reflections just above the bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) were interpreted {{to be associated with the}} accumulation of gas hydrate with elevated saturations. Enhanced seismic reflections below the BSRs were interpreted to indicate the presence of free gas. The base of the BGHSZ was established using the occurrence of BSRs. In areas absent of well-developed BSRs, the BGHSZ was calculated from a model using the inverted P-wave velocity and subsurface temperature data. Seismic attributes were also extracted along the BGHSZ that indicate variations reservoir properties and inferred hydrocarbon accumulations at each site. Gas hydrate saturations estimated from the inversion of acoustic impedance of conventional 3 D seismic data, along with well-log-derived rock-physics models were also used to estimate gas hydrate saturations. Our analysis determined that the gas hydrate petroleum system varies significantly across the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin</b> and that variability in sedimentary properties as a product of depositional processes and the upward migration of gas from deeper thermogenic sources control the distribution of gas hydrates in this basin...|$|R
40|$|Free gas is an {{important}} trigger of instability on continental slopes, and resulting mass-wasting strata can potentially form competent seals to hydrocarbon accumulations. This work uses two high-quality 3 D seismic volumes to investigate fluid accumulations {{at the base of}} mass-transport deposits in the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin,</b> South China Sea. In parallel, IODP/ODP borehole data are used to document the petrophysical character of mass-transport deposits formed in similar continental-slope environments to the South China Sea. The interpreted data show gas accumulations as comprising enhanced seismic reflections that are discordant, or vertically stacked, below mass-transport deposits with chaotic seismic facies. Gas was accumulated in basal shear zones of mass-transport deposits in response to differences in capillary pressure and porosity. Free gas in Zone A covers an area of at least 18 km 2. In Zone B, the free gas is sub-circular in plan view and covers an area of 30. 58 km 2 for a volume of sediment approaching 1. 5 km 3. This work is important as it shows that vertical migration of gas is not significant in mass-transport deposits from the Pearl River <b>Mouth</b> <b>Basin,</b> but up-dip migration along their basal shear zones is suggested in multiple locations. As a result, free gas can pinch-out laterally to extend 1 – 2 km beyond these same basal shear zones. As a corollary, we show that free gas accumulations below mass-transport deposits comprise {{an important}} geohazard and should be taken into account when drilling continental-slope successions in both the South China Sea and continental margins recording important mass wasting. Strata charged with free gas form weak layers, hinting at a novel trigger of retrogressive slope failures on continental slopes worldwide...|$|R
