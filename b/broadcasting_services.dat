The two stations were both licensed to Country <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Services</b> (also {{the owner of}} radio station 2GZ in Orange). CWN was a full-time relay of CBN—the first Australian television station to relay another. The two stations thus formed the country's first regional television network.|$|E

5|$|WIN Television {{began to}} {{introduce}} digital television soon after it became available to metropolitan areas in January 2001. Under Section 38A of the <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Services</b> Act, {{the network has}} been able to introduce, in partnership with other stations, additional digital-only Network Ten affiliates. These have included Tasmanian Digital Television, launched in late 2003 in partnership with Southern Cross Broadcasting, and Mildura Digital Television in January 2006, with Prime Television Limited.|$|E
5|$|Funding issues {{meant that}} in May 2003 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation closed ABC Kids and Fly TV. In the same year, Tasmanian Digital Television {{became the first}} digital-only {{commercial}} station to be launched in the country, under Section 38A of the <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Services</b> Act. The new station was {{a joint venture between}} existing commercial networks Southern Cross Broadcasting and WIN Television. Tasmanian Digital Television, affiliated to Network Ten, was initially available only in Hobart, before expanding to Launceston and, by early 2009, the remainder of the state. The introduction of this fifth channel resulted in significantly higher digital television takeup in Tasmania than other parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, WIN {{purchased}} two stations in South Australia, SES8 in Mount Gambier and RTS-5a in the Riverland region. They {{became known as}} WIN SA and until recently featured news bulletins presented from studios at both stations (bulletins are now presented from the set of studios in Mount Gambier). In 2002 supplementary licences were granted under Section 38A of the <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Services</b> Act, allowing the network to launch additional channels, using the callsigns MGS in Mount Gambier and LRS in the Riverland, and known as WIN Ten, thus converting SES/RTS into the sole Nine affiliate for regional viewers in SA. This was the case until the affiliation moved to the Seven Network due to advertising problems with Nine's then owners in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} {{during the first}} few days of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed {{during the first few}} days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Services,</b> who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
