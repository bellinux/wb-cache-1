2500|$|Braking: Standard finned {{aluminum}} {{drum brakes}} were again offered and were effective. The Bendix 4 piston disk <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> were available. 12" [...] x 1" [...] vented steel rotors were {{coupled with the}} cast iron caliper assemblies.|$|R
50|$|The front {{underhood}} compartment {{contains the}} charger, an electric air conditioner, the power steering mechanism, the power <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> (otherwise conventional), a radiator {{for the air}} conditioner, and a vacuum pump and reservoir for the power brakes and a reservoir for the windshield washer. Charger and battery liquid cooling service is performed here but is not an owner-operator service item.|$|E
50|$|The SSG 2000 {{is derived}} from the Sauer 80/90 target rifle. It has a bolt action with {{rotating}} handle, but non-rotating bolt. When the handle is rotated to close the action, six lugs are driven onwards from the rear part of the bolt body to lock into the receiver. The action also features a loaded chamber indicator. The heavy barrel is hammer-forged and has a flash hider/muzzle <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> installed. The wooden stock is adjustable. The trigger is two-stage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> {{ensures that}} the travel speed of the pig is much slower than the fluid velocity, thus {{allowing}} it to entirely remove deposits from the pipe wall before it travels across the cleaned surface. The deposits removed are immediately flushed down the pipeline with the main jet of the cleaning head which is directed {{to the middle of}} the pipeline. With all deposits removed from the pipe wall and transported downstream by the fluid flow there remains no risk of the pig getting stuck in debris accumulated in front of it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{improved}} design {{incorporated a}} Continental V-12 [...] air-cooled, AVDS-1790-2 diesel engine, extending operational range to over 300 mi while reducing both refueling and servicing. Power was transmitted through a CD-850-6 cross drive transmission, a combined transmission, differential, steering, and <b>braking</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
50|$|The impact landers are {{equipped}} with flexible solar panels, located on the upper side of the inflatable <b>braking</b> <b>unit,</b> that will provide approximately 0.6 W during the day. As the provided power output is insufficient to operate all instruments simultaneously, they are activated sequentially according to the different environmental constraints.|$|R
50|$|The {{market was}} largely pioneered by Sturmey-Archer with their Dynohub of the 1930s - 1970s. This competed {{effectively}} with contemporaneous bottle dynamos and bottom-bracket generators, but the Dynohub was heavy with its steel housing and was discontinued in the 1980s. Around 2009, Sturmey-Archer released new hub dynamo/drum <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> with an aluminum housing, designated X-FDD and XL-FDD.|$|R
50|$|All {{units have}} {{openings}} {{that allow the}} entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following seal unit, which channels it into the openings of the cleaning head. The seal unit and cleaning head restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the cleaning head's nozzles, creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.|$|E
5000|$|The end of train device (ETD), {{sometimes}} referred to as an EOT, flashing rear-end device (FRED) or sense and braking unit (SBU) is an electronic device mounted on the end of freight trains in lieu of a caboose. They are divided into three categories: [...] "dumb" [...] units, which only provide a visible indication of the rear of the train with a flashing red taillight; [...] "average intelligence" [...] units with a brake pipe pressure gauge; and [...] "smart" [...] units, which send back data to the crew in the locomotive via radio-based telemetry. They originated in North America, and are also used elsewhere in the world, where they may include complete End of Train Air System (ETAS) or Sense and <b>Brake</b> <b>Unit</b> (SBU) devices.|$|E
50|$|Although {{dual wheels}} {{are the most}} common, use of two single, wider tires, known as super singles, on each axle is {{becoming}} popular among bulk cargo carriers and other weight-sensitive operators. With increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{the use of the}} super-single tire is gaining popularity. There are several advantages to this configuration. The first of these is that super singles reduce fuel consumption. In 1999, tests on an oval track showed a 10% fuel savings when super singles were used. These savings are realized because less energy is wasted flexing fewer tire sidewalls. Second, the lighter overall tire weight allows a truck to be loaded with more freight. The third advantage is that the single wheel encloses less of the <b>brake</b> <b>unit,</b> which allows faster cooling and reduces brake fade.|$|E

Location identifier is the location reference read by train borne RFID reader through track side RFID tags.|$|R
5000|$|Braking {{choppers}} {{some times}} {{also referred to}} as <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> are used in the DC voltage intermediate circuits of frequency converters to control voltage when the load feeds energy back to the intermediate circuit. This arises, for example, when a magnetized motor is being rotated by an overhauling load and so functions as a generator feeding power to the DC voltage intermediate circuit.They are an application of the [...] chopper principle, using on-off control of a switching device.|$|R

5000|$|The wheels were {{designed}} and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA {{for developing the}} [...] "resilient wheel". They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a 32 in diameter, 9 in wide tire made of zinc-coated woven 0.033 in diameter steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a 25.5 in diameter bump stop frame to protect the hub. Dust guards were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a direct current (DC) series-wound motor capable of [...] at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

50|$|The term 'power {{hydraulic}} brakes' {{can also}} refer to systems operating on very different principles where an engine-driven pump maintains continual hydraulic pressure {{in a central}} accumulator. The driver's brake pedal simply controls a valve to bleed pressure into the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> at the wheels, rather than actually creating the pressure in a master cylinder by depressing a piston. This form of brake is analogous to an air brake system but with hydraulic fluid as the working medium rather than air. However, on an air brake air is vented from the system when the brakes are released and the reserve of compressed air must be replenished. On a power hydraulic brake system fluid at low pressure is returned from the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> at the wheels to the engine-driven pump as the brakes are released, so the central pressure accumulator is almost instantly re-pressurised. This makes the power hydraulic system highly suitable for vehicles that must frequently stop and start (such as buses in cities). The continually circulating fluid also removes problems with freezing parts and collected water vapour that can afflict air systems in cold climates. The AEC Routemaster bus is a well-known application of power hydraulic brakes and the successive generations of Citroen cars with hydropneumatic suspension also used fully powered hydraulic brakes rather than conventional automotive brake systems.|$|R
50|$|Long {{delays in}} the {{production}} of the prototype meant that the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> had to be stored for an extended period before being installed. The change from oil to water-glycol mix required the cylinders to be covered internally with an anti-corrosion coating, which broke down during storage. In testing the cylinders repeatedly failed, and the loss of pressure caused the train to take nearly as long to slow from 25 mph to a standstill as it did to slow from 125 mph to 25 mph. During commissioning, because of this and other development issues, every axle on the trains was modified and exchanged.|$|R

Author of this final goal is to assess vehicle brake problems Toyota Avanza G 1. 3 M / T. the use of disc brakes (ventilated disc) on the front wheel and brake drum (leading-tailing) on the rear wheels.

30|$|Considering the {{hazardous}} nature of high-speed train operation, {{the assessment of}} vehicle reliability is essential to guarantee its safe operation. It is therefore necessary to assess the reliability of key components in high-speed trains, which represent issues that have been widely and thoroughly studied. Meng et al. [22] researched a reliability evaluation method using Markov model to describe the trend of the system reliability, and assessed the reliability of high-speed train traction transmission system. However, the system reliability needs research component reliability, which is statistical inference under small sample problem. Wang et al. [23] employed the least squares method to analyze {{the reliability of the}} key components of trains based on the Weibull distribution. The results of the study indicated that the sample size had a significant effect on the estimation precision. Wu et al. [24] assessed the reliability of relay valves based on the characteristic that the failure rate gradually increases according to an assumed Weibull distribution. Wang et al. [25] performed a durable test to evaluate the reliability of a <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> for urban rail vehicles. The methods discussed above for the reliability assessment of high-speed trains can achieve satisfactory results under large sample size. Tian [26] employed a virtual expansion method to expand data sample size from n[*]=[*] 2 – 3 to n[*]=[*] 12, and then employed the method to analyze the reliability of the center sill and body bolster of a C 70 gondola car based on a Bayesian method. The authors assumed that the lifetimes of parts followed normal distributions, and the approach was demonstrated to improve the assessment precision. Zhu et al. [27] extended the Bayesian method to the Weibull distribution, and verified the robustness of the model by assessing the reliability of bearings in a high-speed train. Subjective selection was employed to define the prior distribution and its hyperparameters, and these estimators were solved using an analytical method. Dong [28] assessed the reliability of braking systems in urban railway vehicles using a goal-oriented (GO) methodology and Bayesian theory based on the assumption of an exponential distribution. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for analyzing conditions where a component follows the rule that the failure rate is constant. Akama [29] calculated the crack propagation rate of cracks in a Shinkansen vehicle axle using Bayesian analysis by combining crack propagation rates derived from small specimens with crack propagation rates derived from full-scale models. The results showed that the method can narrow the variance of the fatigue life distribution, and provide more confident failure probability values.|$|E

25|$|The Skeeter {{possessed a}} {{relatively}} conventional configuration for a helicopter, being {{powered by a}} single piston engine which drove a 29-foot (8.84metre) three-bladed main rotor and a three-bladed anti-torque rotor, which was mounted {{at the end of}} a triangular-section tailboom. The main rotor-blades made used of a composite construction, utilising a steel-tube spar that was bonded to wooden veneers, formers, and ribs, as well as brass balance-weights; these reportedly delivered a cost-effective and relatively simplistic rotor blade that also possessed favourable fatigue properties.

50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake hose {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|R
