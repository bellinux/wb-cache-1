5|$|A {{few years}} after being married, Anne Dallas Dudley became {{involved}} in the temperance movement as a supporter of alcohol prohibition. Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley became convinced that women's place in society could only <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> if women were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process.|$|E

5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of obesity {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).|$|E
5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, was to <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was {{chartered}} on November 14, 1803. The charter {{provided that the}} road {{be turned over to}} the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its first two years of existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers {{to the federal government}} so they could <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable but less beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to <b>be</b> <b>improved,</b> creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England. These were intended to carry artillery pieces able to engage enemy naval vessels should they approach the coast, and to deter any enemy landings. As part of this programme of work, Camber Castle was considerably expanded {{at a cost of}} £5,660.|$|E
50|$|Telecommunications network <b>is</b> <b>improving</b> with {{international}} direct dialing available in many areas. A fiber-optic network has been installed that <b>is</b> <b>improving</b> broadband and communication services between major urban centers with multiple companies providing inter-city fiber-optic cable services.|$|R

5|$|In 1621, a {{subcommittee}} of the House of Lords concluded that the Lords' record keeping should <b>be</b> <b>improved,</b> and the tower was renovated to improve its storage facilities. The {{first floor of the}} tower, used to store the documents, was renovated with brick vaulting, providing better fire protection than the original wooden ceiling, by Thomas Hicks at a cost of £6. The chamber was further protected by a new iron door.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, a new {{cultivar}} called 'Student' {{was developed}} by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated plants to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> by selective breeding. This experiment was so successful, 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Bell {{applied for}} a patent on an {{invention}} which would improve fibre optic communication speeds and assist in transmitting long distances. Although yet to produce any fibre, Bell states his mathematical models show the velocity of light within the fiber can <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> to from 68% to 98% {{of the speed of}} light with lower optical loss and dispersion which would allow light pulses to be transmitted for longer distances without being smeared together over time and distance.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, {{the line}} <b>was</b> <b>improved</b> again. All trips were {{extended}} to the Moravia loop, and midday service <b>was</b> <b>improved</b> from intervals of 50 to 35 minutes. Evening hours were extended to midnight, and Saturday service was doubled to intervals of 45 minutes.|$|R
5|$|Moderate {{to severe}} croup may <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> {{temporarily}} with nebulized epinephrine. While epinephrine typically produces {{a reduction in}} croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is typically discharged from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} largely one {{of peace and}} declining {{industrial}} prosperity in Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society being founded in 1777 to improve methods. John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 but found that methods could still <b>be</b> <b>improved.</b>|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigated}} the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7WTC. The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{alternative}} route via Horseway sluice and the Old Bedford River {{has been closed}} for several years. The lock at Welches Dam has been closed as being unsafe and a reedbed has taken hold. Very low water levels between Horseway sluice and Welches Dam lock often prevented passage. This stands to <b>be</b> <b>improved,</b> however, {{as part of the}} Fens Waterways Link project, which includes plans for improving the route through the Middle Levels from Stanground to Salters Lode and to Welches Dam.|$|E
5|$|The line {{is due to}} be {{electrified}} {{as part of the}} 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, {{which will}} also see the addition of two new running lines to increase capacity, although no platforms will be built for these lines.
