Single-use process steps available are: media and <b>buffer</b> <b>preparation,</b> cell harvesting, filtration, purification and virus inactivation. Other manufacturers include Cellexus with their CellMaker with an air lift system for bacterial production,PBS Biotech, Inc. with its novel Air-Wheel mixing mechanism and low shear and scalability from lab to cGMP (Good manufacturing practice) production and is fully integrated, easy to use www.pbsbiotech.com as well as Millipore, which is primarily upstream equipment www.millipore.com, GE Healthcare Life Sciences with its WAVE brand rocking, single-use bioreactor and Thermo Scientific [...] www.thermo.com with its traditional stirred or impeller shaft based mixing approach does also have some of this technologies available. Only Sartorius Stedim, PBS Biotech, Thermo Fisher Hyclone, and Xcellerex (now part of GE Healthcare Life Sciences) {{have the ability to}} provide a fully scalable solution for a complete lab-to-production bioprocess. The BioProcess Systems Alliance (BPSA) is the single use association advocating broader application of single-use to include cGMP Good manufacturing practice use which will require FDA support. The agency has stated in public forums it is a major backer of single use technology in general, as the technology provides significant benefits and value, including mitigation of cross contamination and reduced industry costs. The FDA has stated it will not issue guidance to the industry on single use but may issue Q and As on its web site. When an FDA approved single use production site is approved, the gates will open for broader and faster single use adoption worldwide. Already single use has shown itself to be a huge cost saver and to increase process flexibility and operational efficiency for biosimilar applications and for biotech startups and CROs. Emerging markets are expected to embrace single use vs stainless given their lack of legacy infrastructure and desire to drive capex and opex costs out of the biotech operation. The market today is approx. $200M and could grow to over $1B or more in the next 4-5 years.|$|E

40|$|Gene electrotransfer is a {{physical}} method used to deliver genes into the cells by application of short and intense electric pulses, which cause destabilization of cell membrane, making it permeable to small molecules and allows transfer of large molecules such as DNA. It represents an alternative to viral vectors, due to its safety, efficacy and ease of application. For gene electrotransfer different electric pulse protocols are used {{in order to achieve}} maximum gene transfection, one of them is changing the electric field direction and orientation during the pulse delivery. Changing electric field direction and orientation increase the membrane area competent for DNA entry into the cell. In this video, we demonstrate the difference in gene electrotransfer efficacy when all pulses are delivered in the same direction and when pulses are delivered by changing alternatively the electric field direction and orientation. For this purpose tip with integrated electrodes and high-voltage prototype generator, which allows changing of electric field in different directions during electric pulse application, were used. Gene electrotransfer efficacy is determined 24 h after pulse application as the number of cells expressing green fluorescent protein divided with the number of all cells. The results show that gene transfection is increased when the electric field orientation during electric pulse delivery is changed. Protocol 1.

In order to shed light on the differences of other Zn compound buffers deposited in conventional chemical baths CBD compared to the buffer layers deposited by this alternative CBD process, the composition of the deposited buffers was investigated by x ray excited Auger electron and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy to potentially clarify their superiority in terms of device performance. We have found that {{in the early stages of}} this alternative CBD process a thin ZnS layer is formed on the CIS, whereas in the second half of the CBD the growth rate is greatly increased and Zn S,O with a ZnS ZnS ZnO ratio of approx. 80 is deposited. Thus, a ZnS Zn S,O bi layer buffer is deposited on the CIS thin film solar cell absorbers by the alternative chemical deposition route used in this investigation.

The structural properties of the polycrystalline Glass/CuGaSe 2 layers and the epitaxial (001) GaAs/CuGaSe 2 films were studied by SEM, TEM, XRD and ECP. The Mo/CuGaSe 2 /CdS/ZnO solar cells reach efficiencies of 7. 9 %. For the diode characteristics important values like the diffusion length of the minority carriers, space-charge region width, doping concentration and built-in voltage were determined using quantum efficiency measurements. The solar cell characteristics were improved by modifying the CdS <b>buffer</b> <b>preparation,</b> whereby the density of occupied surface defects at the heterjunction could be reduced. By Hall effect and conductivity measurements a grain boundary model for polycrystalline chalcopyrites could be provided for the first time. Hereby it is shown that the charge carrier transport is limited by potential barriers at the grain boundaries. The density of charged defect states and the band bending at the grain boundaries, {{as well as the}} doping in the volume of the crystallites were quantified. Concerning the dominating acceptor in CuGaSe 2 it is demonstrated that the corresponding thermal activation energy is identical in the infinite dillution limit, but decreases with rising defect concentration.

After identifying the deposited Zn compound, as ZnS Zn S,O bi layer buffer in former investigations [M. Bär, A. Ennaoui, J. Klaer, T. Kropp, R. S ez Araoz, N. Allsop, I. Lauermann, H. W. Schock, and M. C. Lux Steiner, Formation of a ZnS Zn S,O bilayer buffer on CuInS 2 thin film solar cell absorbers by chemical bath deposition, J. Appl. Phys., accepted. ], this time the focus lies on potential diffusion intermixing processes at the buffer absorber interface possibly, clarifying the effect of the heat treatment, which drastically enhances the device performance of respective final solar cells. The interface formation was investigated by x ray photoelectron and x ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy. In addition, photoelectron spectroscopy PES measurements were also conducted using tuneable monochromatized synchrotron radiation in order to gain depth resolved information. The buffer side of the buffer absorber heterointerface were investigated by means of the characterization of Zn S,O ZnS CIS structures where the ZnS Zn S,O bi layer buffer was deposited successively by different deposition times. In order to make the in terms of PES information depth deeply buried absorber side of the buffer absorber heterointerface accessible for characterization, in these cases the buffer layer was etched away by dilute HClaq. We found that while out leached Cu from the absorber layer forms together with the educts in the chemical bath a Zn 1 Z,Cu 2 Z S like interlayer between buffer and absorber, Zn is incorporated in the uppermost region of the absorber. Both effects are strongly enhanced by postannealing the Zn S,O ZnS CIS samples. However, it was determined that the major fraction of the Cu and Zn can be found quite close to the heterointerface in the buffer and absorber layer, respectively. Due to this limited in the range of one monolayer spatial extent, these diffusion mechanisms were rather interpreted as a CBD induced and heat treatment promoted Cu Zn ion exchange at the buffer absorber interface. Possible impacts of this intermixing on the performance of the final solar cell devices will also be discusse...|$|E

In the challenge at 3 months post vaccination, the protection levels were 52 % and 77 % for the modified and current vaccine preparations, respectively. At 16 months post vaccination, the protection levels were 56 % and 62 % for the modified and current vaccine preparations, respectively. These findings indicate that there are no differences in protection levels between the two vaccines.

This activity is immediately lost when the vesicles are {{transferred from the}} sucrose-phosphate-citrate <b>preparation</b> <b>buffer</b> into dilute phosphate <b>buffer.</b> Similar <b>preparations</b> from Phormidium laminosum, a thermophilic cyanobacterium retain activity under such conditions. Photosystem I activities of both cyanobacterial vesicle preparations were determined by direct spectrophotometric measurement of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine photooxidation {{in the presence of}} anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonate. The rates so determined were compared with rates of O 2 taken up in the presence of methyl viologen or anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonate as electron acceptors. The predicted stoichiometry of two was observed for moles of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine oxidized per mole of oxygen taken up. Anthraquinone- 2 -sulfonate was the better electron acceptor, and maximal rates of 943 micromoles per hour per milligram chlorophyll for O 2 uptake were observed for Phormidium laminosum preparations in the presence of superoxide dismutase. For purposes of comparison, spinach chloroplasts were assayed for similar activities. All preparations were readily assayed for photosystem I activity by the direct spectrophotometric method, which has advantages of simplicity and freedom from errors introduced by photoxidation of other substrates by photosystem I when O 2 uptake is measured...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Tremendous and {{potentially}} infinite volumes of data streams are often generated by real-time surveillance systems, communication networks, Internet traffic, on-line transactions {{in the financial}} market or retail industry, electric power grids, industry production processes, scientific and engineering experiments, remote sensors, and other dynamic environments. Unlike traditional data sets, stream data flow {{in and out of}} a computer system continuously and with varying update rates. It may be impossible to store an entire data stream or to scan through it multiple times due to its tremendous volume. To discover knowledge or patterns from data streams, it is necessary to develop single-scan and on-line mining methods.

40|$|The {{effect of}} using an In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As buffer layer on the {{crystalline}} quality of InGaAsBi epilayer with Bi concentration up to 3. 1 % grown by gas source {{molecular beam epitaxy}} was investigated. It is found that use of the buffer layer has a dramatic effect on the improvement of surface morphology, structural, electrical and optical properties of InGaAsBi epilayers. Bi incorporation in InGaAs up to a concentration of 3. 1 % causes no degradation of the electron mobility and induces p-type carriers that compensate the background n-type carriers resulting in mobility enhancement with increasing Bi concentration. With the <b>buffer</b> layer <b>preparation,</b> a maximum electron mobility of 5550 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) at room temperature is demonstrated in InGaAsBi with x(Bi) = 3. 1 %, which is the highest value reported in InGaAsBi with x(Bi) > 2. 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Short-lived TCP connections, which {{transmit}} small-sized data, {{suffer from}} significant low throughput compared with long-lived TCP connections, which transmit large-sized data, {{because of the}} inherent nature of the ACK-based window flow control of TCP. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} unfairness problem caused by transmitting differently sized data. We first confirm the unfairness property through simple simulation results, and show the necessity of devising a method to improve the fairness property at the router <b>buffer.</b> As <b>preparation</b> for realizing this method, we next introduce a new analysis approach to estimate the throughput of a TCP connection when the packet loss probabilities of each transmitted packet are different. Our analysis gives a better estimation of the TCP throughput than the existing analyses. Using the analysis results, we propose a new method to improve the fairness property, and show that our proposed method can improve the fairness property without degradation of the network link utilization...|$|R
40|$|Drinking and {{environmental}} water samples contain a {{diverse array of}} constituents that can interfere with molecular testing techniques, especially when large volumes of water are concentrated to the small volumes needed for effective molecular analysis. In this study, a suite of enteric viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites were seeded into concentrated source water and finished drinking water samples, in order to investigate the relative performance of nucleic acid extraction techniques for molecular testing. Real-time PCR and reverse transcription-PCR crossing threshold (CT) values were used as the metrics for evaluating relative performance. Experimental results were used to develop a guanidinium isothiocyanate-based lysis buffer (UNEX buffer) that enabled effective simultaneous extraction and recovery of DNA and RNA from the suite of study microbes. Procedures for bead beating, nucleic acid purification, and PCR facilitation were also developed and integrated in the protocol. The final lysis <b>buffer</b> and sample <b>preparation</b> procedure {{was found to be}} effective for a panel of drinking water and source water concentrates when compared to commercial nucleic acid extraction kits. The UNEX buffer-based extraction protocol enabled PCR detection of six study microbes, in 100 L finished water samples from four drinking water treatment facilities, within three CT values (i. e., within 90 % difference) of the reagent-grade water control. The results from this study indicate that this newly formulated lysis <b>buffer</b> and sample <b>preparation</b> procedure can be useful for standardized molecular testing of drinking {{and environmental}} waters. 26016775 PMC 449347...|$|R

DNA prepared from these pellicles was analysed on a CsCl gradient, and contained 3 components of buoyant densities 1 - 685, 1 - 688, and 1698 g cm" " 3 in variable proportions. The component at 1 - 685 g cm " 1 {{is similar in}} density to mitochondrial DNA and those at 1 - 688 and 1 - 698 g cm " 1 to components of nuclear DNA. Most pellicle preparations contained {{a higher proportion of}} the heavy component (1 - 698 g cm " 3) than does nuclear DNA. A similar enrichment of this component could be demonstrated in high-speed pellets from fragmented nuclei. No unique pellicle-associated component could be demonstrated. No DNA could be isolated from very pure preparations of oral plates and we conclude that there is no evidence for the presence of a specific DNA associated with the pellicle...|$|R

40|$|DownReaction 3 is the {{solvolysis}} reaction for the melts. The electrochemical {{window of}} the melts {{is defined by the}} melt acidity. In basic melts, the anodic limit [relative to Al/Al(III) in a 1. 5 : 1 melt, the standard reference electrode for these systems] is at about 11 V, due to the oxidation of chloride. The cathodic limit is at about 21. 9 V, due to the reduction of the EMI 1 ion, giving a melt window of about 2. 9 V. In acidic melts, the anodic limit is at about 12. 6 V, due to the oxidation of AlCl 42 to give chlorine, while the cathodic limit is at about 20. 5 V due to the deposition of aluminum metal from the Al 2 Cl 72 ion, giving a melt window of about 3. 1 V. In a neutral melt, where neither Cl 2 nor Al 2 Cl 72 is present in significant amounts, the voltage window is about 4. 5 V, limited by the reduction of EMI 1 and the oxidation of AlCl 42. However, it is difficult, to work with neutral melts as they are not <b>buffered,</b> their <b>preparation</b> is difficult, and the addition of even small amounts of acidic or basi...|$|R
