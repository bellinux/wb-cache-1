25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E
25|$|The {{southwest}} corner of town includes part of the Silvermine neighborhood (which also extends into New Canaan and Norwalk).

Other neighborhoods in town are South Wilton, Wilton Center, Gilbert Corners, Cannondale, and North Wilton.|$|E
25|$|The {{tip of the}} gimlet bit acts as a tapered screw, to {{draw the}} <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without {{necessarily}} cutting them. The cutting action occurs {{at the side of}} the broadest part of the cutter. Most drill bits cut the base of the hole. The gimlet bit cuts the side of the hole.|$|E

50|$|However, as {{the logical}} right-shift inserts value 0 <b>bits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> most {{significant}} <b>bit,</b> instead of copying the sign bit, it {{is ideal for}} unsigned binary numbers, while the arithmetic right-shift is ideal for signed two's complement binary numbers.|$|R
50|$|In {{a network}} based on packet switching, {{transmission}} delay (or store-and-forward delay, {{also known as}} packetization delay) {{is the amount of}} time required to push all <b>the</b> packet's <b>bits</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wire. In other words, this is the delay caused by the data-rate of the link.|$|R
25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|E
25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E

500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

2500|$|Masonry bits {{typically}} are {{used with a}} hammer drill, which hammers the <b>bit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. [...] Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.|$|E

Rewritable CDs and DVDs usually use aluminium reflective layers, because the phase changing film degrades faster than aluminium oxidizes.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that when}} using 4 bits to modify a colour {{component}} {{you should use}} the 4 bits in the upper 4 bits of the component AND in the lower 4 bits (to avoid reducing the overall colour gamut).

50|$|Likewise, {{adding the}} BCD values 39 and 48 {{produces}} 81. This result {{does not have}} a non-decimal low nibble, but it does cause a carry out of the least significant digit (lower four <b>bits)</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> most significant digit (upper four bits). This is indicated by the CPU setting the half-carry flag. This value must also be corrected, by adding 06 to 81 to produce a corrected BCD result of 87.|$|R
50|$|Serial data {{communications}} can also embed the clock within the serial data stream. This {{eliminates the need}} for a parallel clock to synchronize the data. There are multiple methods for embedding a clock into a data stream.

Another method is 8b/10b encoding.|$|R
