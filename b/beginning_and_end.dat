5|$|Every {{night after}} shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his {{assistant}} Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and {{ready for the next}} day. While new footage was being captured, the previously filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel. After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing. Edwards originally had the ending of the film both at the beginning and the end. He and the film's producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological ending of the film at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils bellow comes from the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch stage show {{featured}} DeLange and Waylon using a specially-designed microphone {{stand to}} allow them to face each other, both playing guitars, while a bassist, a drummer and a cellist performed in the background.

On the floor of the stage LED screens simulated road markings, while further screens on the background showed a rainy forest scene, transforming into a dry forest scene towards the end of the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of the Isla Cruces battle, before {{production}} took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the Flying Dutchman were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting {{with the fact that}} the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, {{who had gotten}} involved in the series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end.</b> Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{has been}} used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film The Break-Up, which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming. It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of Source Code. Director Duncan Jones felt the structure was a metaphor for the movie's subject matter and aimed for it to be shown at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of the movie. The sculpture served as an aesthetic and symbolic setting for the 2012 film The Vow when the lead characters share a kiss under it.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and {{was transferred to}} Norway in June 1941 {{as part of the}} preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Richard Beitzen spent some time {{at the beginning of the}} campaign conducting anti-shipping patrols in Soviet waters, but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year. The ship escorted several German heavy cruisers at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of their anti-shipping raids in 1942. She participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea when Convoy JW 51B was attacked on 31 December 1942 near the North Cape, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated bus lanes {{have existed}} on the Kwinana Freeway {{since the late}} 1980s, when a project {{was set up to}} {{decrease}} bus commuters' travel times into Perth from suburbs south of the Swan River. In 1987, Main Roads Western Australia and Transperth trialled a contraflow bus lane along the Kwinana Freeway, from the Canning Interchange to the Narrows Interchange. The lane operated between 7:00 am and 9:30 am, the period with the most traffic congestion on the freeway. After two months, the results were examined, and the agencies decided to build an additional bus lane on the northbound carriageway. The construction included bus-only ramps at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of the lane. The works were mainly funded by Transperth, which contributed $8.22 million out of the $10.23 million total cost. The remaining $2.01 million was provided by Main Roads Western Australia. The bus lane opened on 20 November 1989, and received an Institute of Engineers award for engineering excellence.|$|E
