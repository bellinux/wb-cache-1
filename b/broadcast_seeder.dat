50|$|A <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeder,</b> {{alternately}} {{called a}} broadcast spreader or centrifugal fertilizer spreader(Europe), is a farm implement commonly used for spreading seed, lime, fertilizer, sand, ice melt, etc., {{and is an}} alternative to drop spreaders/seeders.|$|E
50|$|Compact utility {{tractors}} require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements {{include the}} box blade, the grader blade, the landscape rake, the {{post hole digger}} (or post hole auger), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeder,</b> a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models are available with front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumbere tractor brands, so CUT owners have {{a wide selection of}} implements.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} are handheld with {{a hopper}} of several liters and which operate via hand cranking. A bit larger are push units with the spinning disk powered by gearing to the wheels. The next size up {{is designed to}} be towed behind a garden tractor or ATV. Very similar in size to the tow behind units are <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeders</b> that mount to the three-point hitch of a compact utility tractor, these are ideal for landscape and small property maintenance. Still larger are commercial broadcast seeders/spreaders designed and sized appropriately for agricultural tractors and mount to the tractor's three point hitch. The <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeders</b> that are mounted to a three-point hitch are powered by a power take-off (P.T.O.) shaft from the tractor. At the largest size are pull behind or chassis mounted units for agricultural use that can spread widths of up to 90 feet.|$|R
6000|$|At dinner we laid {{ourselves}} out to impress our host. We {{told him of}} the mile-wide fields of the west, and enlarged upon the stoneless prairies of Dakota. We described the <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeders</b> they used in Minnesota and bragged {{of the amount of}} hay we could put up, and both of us professed a contempt for two-wheeled carts. In the end we reduced our prospective employer to humbleness. He consulted his wife a moment and then said, [...] "All right, boys, you may take hold." ...|$|R
6000|$|The hens {{were singing}} their cheerful, changeless song below the stable wall; calves were bawling from the {{neighboring}} farm-yards {{and on the}} mellow soil the shining, <b>broadcast</b> <b>seeders</b> were clattering to their work, while over the greening hills a faint mist wavered, delicate as a bride's veil. Was it not a kind of madness to exchange the security, the peace, the comfort of this homestead, for the hardships of a trail whose circuit could not be less than ten thousand miles, a journey which offered possible injury and certain deprivation? ...|$|R
