In {{his own words}} from the preface: these plays were [...] "aimed at {{carrying}} on the West-Penwith tradition of turning local folk tales into plays for Christmas acting. What they took over from these guise-dance drolls, as they were called, was their love of the local speech and their readiness to <b>break</b> <b>here</b> and there into rhyme or song". And of the music he says [...] "the simple airs do not ask for accompaniment or for trained voices to do them justice. They are only a slight extension of the music that West-Penwith voices will put into the dialogue." ...|$|E

60|$|Comparatively few {{of those}} who {{nowadays}} run down to Southend for {{a breath of fresh}} air give a thought to the fact that the wide stretch of low country lying between the railroad and the Thames, from Pitsea to Leigh, was at one time, and that not so many centuries back, a mud flat, a continuation of the great line of sand that still, with but a short <b>break</b> <b>here</b> and there, stretches down beyond Yarmouth; still less that, were it not for the watchfulness of those who dwell upon it, it would in a short time revert to its original condition, the country lying below the level of higher water.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last they}} opened {{a deep and}} still bight, wooded to the water's edge; and lying in the {{roadstead}} a caravel, and three boats by her. And at that sight {{there was not a}} man but was on deck at once, and not a mouth but was giving its opinion of what should be done. Some were for sailing right into the roadstead, the breeze blowing fresh toward the shore (as it usually does throughout those islands in the afternoon). However, seeing the billows <b>break</b> <b>here</b> and there off the bay's mouth, they thought it better, for fear of rocks, to run by quietly, and then send in the pinnace and the boat. Yeo would have had them show Spanish colors, for fear of alarming the caravel; but Amyas stoutly refused, [...] "counting it," [...] he said, [...] "a mean thing to tell a lie in that way, unless in extreme danger, or for great ends of state." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamical {{supersymmetry}} breaking is {{an important}} issue for applications of supersymmetry in particle physics. The functional renormalization group equations allow for a nonperturbative approach that leaves supersymmetry intact.

6000|$|The {{surface of}} the plateau is about 4100 feet above {{the level of the}} sea: it is a space of rolling ground, stony and white with broken limestone. Water is found in pools, and in widely {{scattered}} springs: it is very scarce, and in a district near and south of the hills Lieutenant Speke was stopped by want of this necessary. The climate appeared to our traveller delightful In some places the glass fell at 6 A.M. to 25°, yet at noon on the same day the mercury rose to 76°. The wind was always N. E., sometimes gentle, and occasionally blowing strongly but without dust. The rainy monsoon must <b>break</b> <b>here</b> with violence, and the heat be fearful in the hot season. The principal vegetation of this plateau was Acacia, scarce and stunted; in some places under the hills and in the watercourses these trees are numerous and well grown. On the other hand, extensive tracts towards the south are almost barren. The natives speak of Malmal (myrrh) and the Luban (incense) trees. The wild animals are principally antelopes; there are also ostriches, onagers, Waraba, lions (reported to exist), jackals, and vermin. The bustard and florikan appear here. The Nomads possess large flocks of sheep, the camels, cows, and goats being chiefly found at this season on the seaward side of the hills, where forage is procurable. The horses were stunted tattoos, tolerably well-bred, but soft for want of proper food. It is said that the country abounds in horses, but Lieutenant Speke [...] "doubts the fact." [...] The eastern portion of the plateau visited by our traveller belongs to the Warsingali, the western to the Dulbahantas: the former tribe extends to the S. E., whilst the latter possess the lands lying about the Tuk Der, the Nogal, and Haud. These two tribes are at present on bad terms, owing to a murder which led to a battle: the quarrel has been allowed to rest till lately, when it was revived at a fitting opportunity. But there is no hostility between the Southern Dulbahantas and the Warsingali, on the old principle that [...] "an enemy's enemy is a friend." ...|$|E

5000|$|Making pop about a {{specific}} tragedy is necessarily a tricky job. So it's no crime {{that some of}} the other mainstream original songs memorializing Orlando have been as rote as issue-oriented singles are often stereotyped as being. ... But [...] "The Greatest" [...] is very potent, a work of art, not charity. ... There's no <b>break</b> <b>here</b> from the rest of Sia's catalogue about pain and release in everyday life: You hear a sad voice wailing about bucking up, very stark emotional peaks and valleys, and a danceable backing of explosive drums, toy-box melodies, and reggae grooves. Sia and Greg Kurstin may have written the song even before the massacre. But in the context of Orlando, the possible platitude of the chorus becomes gutting: [...] "I'm free to be the greatest / I'm alive." [...] She's pepping the listener up, but she's also defining the value of life, marking the human potential that's been lost.|$|E
40|$|Thousands of {{cellular}} single-strand breaks (SSBs) arise in cells each day, from attack of deoxyribose and DNA bases by {{reactive oxygen species}} and other electrophilic molecules, and from the intrinsic instability of DNA.

On later issues of Brian's debut album and subsequent remakes and live {{performances of the}} song, the credit was amended to only include Wilson as the song's sole writer. Wilson has said of the song: I was in my piano room, playing [...] "What the World Needs Now," [...] and I just went into my own song…worked {{very hard to get}} out what was in my heart on that one…it’s a personal message from me to people.…We wanted people to be covered with love, because there’s no guarantee of somebody waking up in the morning with any love. It goes away, like a bad dream. It disappears. Mercy would be a deeper word than love. I would think love is a gentle thing and mercy would be more desperate, ultimately more desperately needed, thing in life. Mercy-a little <b>break</b> <b>here</b> and there for somebody who’s having trouble.…"Love and Mercy" [...] is probably the most spiritual song I’ve ever written.|$|E
50|$|The K.D.St.V. Saarland was {{established}} on June 18, 1961 as a spin-off of the fraternity K.D.St.V. Carolus Magnus Cartellverband at the University of the Saarland. Final {{act of the}} foundation was the publication on June 30. 1962. The K.D.St.V. Saarland was separated from Carolus Magnus because of the significant effects of the referendum of 1955, concerning the Saarstatut. With this referendum {{the citizens of the}} Saarland had to decide whether to reunite the Saarland with Germany or to be an independent territory, governed by an elected government, in matters of foreign policy represented by a commissar of the Western European Union and with an economy connected to France. There were heavy arguments between the supporters of both solutions. The break ran through Families, clubs and friendships and continued to exert an influence even after the conclusion of the referendum and the reunion to Germany. The new founded K.D.St.V. Saarland was the result of such a <b>break.</b> <b>Here</b> mainly the supporters of the Europastatut tried to form a new fraternity, separated from the supporters of the reunion to Germany, who mainly stayed in the Carolus Magnus fraternity.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Until We Meet Again, Murray {{announced}} that the band would continue working on new music, leading up to a release of a full-length album. In July 2014, the band announced that they would reconvene to work on more material in August. In September, the band provided an update that they were working on writing more music, making plans to record material, and practicing for live shows. In November, Fahnstock revealed that he had been recording bass parts for six new songs, and shortly after it was announced that the band was aiming for a release for sometime in 2015. The band later announced that the full-album release was pushed back to 2016. Hunt explained the reasons for the delay:We have been working on new material now {{for the better part of}} a year. We have got some really cool stuff and it is certainly much different than anything I have ever been a part of. I think that we have got a deal in play right now, and I cannot say what it is yet, but it is not from America, it is for overseas. We are still working on America. For America, it is a new band, which you know is hard to <b>break</b> <b>here</b> as a Rock band. It is really tough, and I guess the thing is, with White Noise Owl, we are just looking for the right situation. None of us are young anymore, none of us can say, 'Hey, let’s just hop in the van and eat bologna sandwiches and try and break our band that way', that is just not realistic. We are taking our time with it, we are not in any hurry at all, and I think that the thing is, that the way that we carry ourselves about it, that it is kind of this open ended thing. We are hoping that this deal that I am talking about will allow us to go tour overseas for a little bit." [...] In January 2016, the band revealed that the record deal previously referred to had been in reference to signing to Warner Music of New Zealand. Final recording sessions for the album began on December 13, 2015 and went through the month of February, starting the mixing process on February 29, 2016. In March 2016, the band announced that the album had been made, and that more information on its release would be arising [...] "very soon".|$|E
