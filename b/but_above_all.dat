5|$|<b>But</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> Mario Vargas Llosa {{uses the}} fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E

She was still living alone in her home on her 115th birthday. In 2016 she credited her long life to her diet of raw eggs and cookies, and to staying single.|$|E
25|$|The fiery {{enthusiasm of}} the Gordons and other clans often carried the day, but Montrose relied more upon the disciplined {{infantry}} from Ireland. His strategy at Inverlochy, and his tactics at Aberdeen, Auldearn and Kilsyth furnished models of the military art, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> his daring and constancy marked him out {{as one of the}} greatest soldiers of the war.

25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E

25|$|Alacoque was {{subjected}} to many trials to prove the genuineness of her vocation. She was admitted to wearing the religious habit on 25 August 1671, but {{was not allowed to}} make her religious profession on the same date of the following year, which would have been normal. A fellow novice described Margaret Mary as humble, simple and frank, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> kind and patient. Finally, she was admitted to profession on 6 November 1672. It is said that she was assigned to the infirmary and was not very skillful at her tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} episcopal {{encounter}} {{took place in}} May 1923 in Gothenburg. The Vicars Apostolic of Sweden (Mgr. Johannes E. Müller: 1877-1965), Denmark (Mgr. Josef Brems: 1870-1958), and Norway (Mgr. Jan O. Smit: 1883-1972) discussed themes of common interest such {{as the best way}} of dealing with the congregations of women religious, how to foster the spiritual life of their priests, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> how to prepare for the announced Scandinavian tour of the Cardinal Prefect of the Roman Congregation Propaganda Fide, Willem Marinus van Rossum, the first such dignitary to enter Scandinavia since the Reformation.|$|E
25|$|Referring {{to these}} manuscripts, {{he called his}} own {{transcription}} Gradual Lagal.

His intention {{was to provide a}} corrected melody in rhythmic notation <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> – he was also a choirmaster – suited for practical use, therefore a simplex, integrated notation. Although fully admitting the importance of Hakkennes' melodic revisions, the rhythmical solution suggested in the Graduale Lagal was actually found by Van Kampen (see above) to be rather modestly related to the text of the chant.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, Fiorentina {{started to}} achieve {{consistent}} top-five finishes {{in the domestic}} league.

This team won Fiorentina's first scudetto (Italian championship) in 1955–56, 12 points ahead of second-place Milan. Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team {{to play in a}} European Cup final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Alfredo Di Stéfano's Real Madrid.|$|E
25|$|The West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) is a warm, salty current {{that runs}} poleward {{just west of}} Spitsbergen, (formerly called West Spitsbergen), in the Arctic Ocean. The WSC {{branches}} off the Norwegian Atlantic Current in the Norwegian Sea. The WSC is of importance because it drives warm and salty Atlantic Water into the interior Arctic. The warm and salty WSC flows north through {{the eastern side of}} Fram Strait, while the East Greenland Current (EGC) flows south through the western side of Fram Strait. The EGC is characterized by being very cold and low in salinity, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> else it is a major exporter of Arctic sea ice. Thus, the EGC combined with the warm WSC makes the Fram Strait the northernmost ocean area having ice-free conditions throughout the year in all of the global ocean.|$|E
25|$|Developing itself {{later than}} {{witnessed}} {{in the rest}} of Europe, in Portugal it only gained real significance after the second quarter of the 12th century, although previous buildings of the same style already existed. Various factors contribute to this aspect, mainly the unstable environment experienced in the Iberian Peninsula at the time due to the Reconquista and the consequent political reorganisation of peninsular geography. In fact, {{one of the most significant}} aspects of Romanesque architecture in the Peninsula, but particularly in Portugal, is the noticeable connotation that we find between its spreading and land organisation and occupation. The arrival in Portugal of the religious orders mentioned above must be understood in the general context of the Reconquista. In fact, those monastical institutions received immense privileges from the Portuguese monarchs and nobility, contributing to the security of the territory, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all,</b> to its social organization. This Reconquista took place from North to South, resulting in the same spread of Romanesque architecture with a decreasing density to the South. Almost no Romanesque artifacts survive in Southern Portugal.|$|E

25|$|Under these {{circumstances}} any political bargaining {{might well have}} been disastrous to Home Rule. Redmond desperately wanted and needed a rapid enactment of the Home Rule Act, and undoubtedly his words were a means to that end. He called on the country to support the Allied and British war effort and Britain's commitment under the Triple Entente; this was a calculated response to the situation principally in the belief that the attained measure of self-government would be granted in full after the war and to be in a stronger position to stave off a final partition of Northern Ireland. His added hope was that the common sacrifice by Irish nationalists and Unionists would bring them closer together, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> that nationalists could not afford to allow Ulster Unionists to reap the benefit of being the only Irish to support the war effort, when they spontaneously enlisted in their 36th (Ulster) Division. He said Let Irishmen come together in the trenches and risk their lives together and spill their blood together, and I say there is no power on earth that when they come home can induce them to turn as enemies upon one another.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{adventure}} tour sites is boating upward on the Chay River into primitive forests, as the river becomes sinuous with several waterfalls and whirlpools until tourists arrive at Tro Mong. This tour sites have been surveyed and included in local travel agents besides cave exploration tour. In Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park, {{there is a}} 50 m-high waterfall, Chai Waterfall. There is a bull field called Ran Bo (Bull Field) because wild bulls usually comes and reproduce in mating season. There are also some interesting tourist attractions in this park like Nước Ngang ("Horizontal Spring"), a spring runs horizontally instead of vertically as usual; Ðá Nằm (Crouching Stone), a stone blockading a stream current; Chân Thớt (Chopping Board), a chopping-board-shaped stone. <b>But</b> <b>above</b> <b>all,</b> the most spectacular scene is this area is Nước Trồi (Surfacing Stream), a stream surfacing from the ground. Several streams here run for a long distance, then disappear under the ground. The provincial Centre for Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng's Ecotourism and Culture currently has 248 boats, creating jobs for 500 locals. Every boat has two trained boatmen earning VND70,000 per day. This income is relatively high for peasants in this province. This centre also launched a programme in 2000 to train former loggers to work as photographers taking pictures for tourists and about 300 former loggers are now doing this.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Turin {{started a}} {{scramble}} for peace. With the continual disruption {{of trade and}} commerce politicians from England and the Dutch Republic were desirous {{for an end to}} the war. France was also facing economic exhaustion, <b>but</b> <b>above</b> <b>all</b> Louis XIV was becoming convinced that Charles II of Spain was near death and he knew that the break-up of the coalition would be essential if France was to benefit from the dynastic battle ahead. The contending parties agreed to meet at Ryswick (Rijswijk) and come to a negotiated settlement. But as talks continued through 1697, so did the fighting. The main French goal that year in the Spanish Netherlands was Ath. Vauban and Catinat (now with troops freed from the Italian font) invested the town on 15 May while Marshals Boufflers and Villeroi covered the siege; after an assault on 5 June the Count of Roeux surrendered and the garrison marched out two days later. The Rhineland theatre in 1697 was again quiet: the French commander, Marshal Choiseul (who had replaced the sick de Lorge the previous year), was content to remain behind his fortified lines. Although Baden took Ebernberg on 27 September, news of the peace brought an end to the desultory campaign, and both armies drew back from one another. In Catalonia, however, French forces (now also reinforced with troops from Italy) achieved considerable success when Vendôme, commanding some 32,000 troops, besieged and captured Barcelona. The garrison, under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, capitulated on 10 August. Yet it had been a hard fought contest: French casualties amounted to about 9,000, and the Spanish had suffered some 12,000 killed, wounded or lost.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in open order formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. <b>But</b> <b>above</b> <b>all,</b> the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to take the risk of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he {{would have a hard time}} extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E
