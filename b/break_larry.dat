Though the documentary repeated many claims already made, King said he had now had enough. King's attorney said [...] "It was slanted to show Don in the worst way. It was one-sided from day one, Don is a strong man, {{but he has been}} hurt by this." ...|$|E

Murray's father, who is of Irish descent, is a former rodeo hand who owned a {{business}} in which he operated starter equipment at horse racing venues all over the United States. Ty Murray's mother was a young rider in the National Little Britches Rodeo Association and won {{first place in the}} national Little Britches Rodeo Bull Riding competition. As a child Murray was taught rodeo fundamentals by his father and mother. Later he was mentored by then world champion bull rider and all-around cowboy, Larry Mahan, who had won more National Finals Rodeo (NFR) first place [...] "All Around Cowboy" [...] championships than anyone in history. At the age of 9, Ty Murray was asked by his school teacher to write a paper on what he wanted to be when he grew up. His entire essay was as follows: [...] "I want to <b>break</b> <b>Larry</b> Mahan's record".|$|E

5000|$|Although his fielding range had declined, Groh {{continued}} to better his accuracy. In [...] {{he set a}} league record with a [...]975 fielding average, topping Hans Lobert's [...] mark of [...]974; he also hit [...]290 during the season. The Giants won the pennant again, becoming {{the first team to}} remain in first place all season, but lost the World Series in six games to the Yankees, with Groh batting only [...]182. In 1924 he bettered his own mark by setting a new major league record with a [...]983 fielding average, <b>breaking</b> <b>Larry</b> Gardner's record of [...]976 with the 1920 Cleveland Indians. Willie Kamm would set a new record of [...]984 with the [...] White Sox, but Groh's mark remains the best by an NL third baseman. In 1924 Groh also broke Nash's major league record of 265 career double plays, and again led the league in times being hit by a pitch. The Giants went to the World Series for the fourth straight year, but lost again to the Washington Senators in seven games. Groh, who had suffered a knee injury late in the season, made just a single pinch-hitting appearance, singling in 11th inning of the final game; the Giants lost 4-3 in the 12th when, with one out and runners on first and second, Earl McNeely hit a ground ball to rookie third baseman Freddie Lindstrom which apparently struck a pebble and bounced over his head for a double.|$|R

Unfortunately, in August he was again injured, this time breaking his left shoulder in a sprint car accident. However, Butler missed only one race weekend during his recovery.

5000|$|He tracks Margaret down to Hawaii and {{eventually}} follows her onto {{a cruise ship}} she is taking to her book signing. He then apparently pushes her overboard while she tries to retrieve an earring that fell. Owen returns from Hawaii to tell Larry of Margaret's death and that Larry now [...] "owes" [...] him {{the murder of his}} mother, lest he inform the police that Larry was the killer. After having spent the night drinking alone during the hours of Margaret's disappearance, Larry panics because he lacks a sufficient alibi. That, along with a news report announcing that the police suspect foul play, convinces Larry that he's the prime suspect. He decides to stay with Owen and his mother in an attempt to hide from the police. Larry meets Mrs. Lift, but despite her harsh treatment of him he refuses to kill her. Eventually, when Mrs. Lift drives Owen to <b>breaking</b> point, <b>Larry</b> finally relents and agrees to go through with the murder.|$|R

Larry rescues Carol and they call the police.|$|R

Fine would liven up a {{scene with a}} random improvised remark or ridiculous action. In the hospital spoof Men in Black (1934), Larry, dressed as a surgeon and wielding a large kitchen knife, chortles: [...] "Let's pluck him... and see if he's ripe!" [...] In Disorder in the Court (1936), a tense courtroom scene is interrupted by <b>Larry</b> <b>breaking</b> into a wild Tarzan yell. Of course, after each of his outbursts, Moe would gruffly put him down.

5000|$|The Stooges are icemen {{that have}} fallen asleep in their {{delivery}} wagon. Their horse wakes them up. Curly finds {{his face and}} head embedded in a large block of ice after having used it for a pillow. Moe and <b>Larry</b> <b>break</b> him out of it, and they begin their ice block deliveries. After several deliveries they are called to make a delivery at a house atop a long, high staircase. It's so high that every time they go up, the ice melts to a cube. They make several attempts including relaying it successfully to the top, only to have Curly drop it. It's during these attempts and arguments that they bump into Mr. Lawrence (Vernon Dent) and ruin his cakes.|$|R
50|$|When Larry, Richard, and Claudia are reunited, {{they are}} shocked to {{discover}} that Bernie is moving and realize he is leading them towards the money. To keep him moving, they put headphones on his head. As Bernie finds a large chest underwater, Larry accidentally shoots {{him in the head}} with an underwater speargun, destroying the headphones. They attempt to bring Bernie back to the surface but he will not let go of the chest, which is too heavy to hoist out of the water. They end up attaching Bernie to a horse carriage with music playing. It seems to work at first, but when they go downhill, the carriage goes out of control. Eventually, the carriage ends up at Mobu's compound. Bernie hits a large tree branch and spins himself into a somersault before knocking out Mobu. The crash also causes Bernie to drop the chest on the ground and it <b>breaks</b> open. <b>Larry</b> tries to scoop up the money but is caught by Hummel (now slightly unhinged upon seeing the undead Bernie walk) and he relinquishes the money to him. With Mobu out of commission, Claudia's father, a medical doctor, says that he can cure Richard if he can get the blood of a virgin (which Larry confesses he can provide). The mobsters and Mobu are arrested, and Bernie is last seen leading Henry and Charles, who have been transformed into goats by voodoo, in a carnival parade.|$|R

In anger, he sends Ben on an assignment, one that (unbeknownst to him) puts him aboard a ship bound for Russia. Meanwhile, Tarlock assigns Pat to take a series of {{photographs}} of a fake murder for the magazine's readers to try to solve. However, the photo of Pat, as the [...] "victim", looks just like a real police photo of the dead Dolores, slumped face down on a couch. Pat is indicted for murder. Larry tries to get Ben back to corroborate Pat's story, but learns that Ben was not among the survivors when his ship was torpedoed. Fortunately, Larry proves that Dolores was killed by Sonny. Afterward, <b>Larry</b> <b>breaks</b> up with Pat, guilt-ridden over Ben's death. Then Ben shows up and punches him. It turns out Ben spent 20 days on a raft with another woman and married her.|$|R
5000|$|In Den of Geek, Chris Longo wrote that, as {{the first}} season played out, Vause [...] "was vilified, then the tables turned when she won Piper’s friendship, then they turned upside down during their {{inevitable}} hookup. Alex, for all the bad she’s done, seems like a woman who stays true to her word. And now after <b>breaking</b> Alex’s (and <b>Larry’s)</b> heart, Piper is the one who’s vilified." [...] Longo praised Prepon’s performance, and hoped the series progressed Vause’s storylines. The Guardians Tom Meltzer wrote that Prepon plays Chapman's [...] "jilted" [...] former lover [...] "with subtlety and unabashed smoulder". In his review of the first season, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described pre-prison Vause as [...] "icy cool", and called Prepon a [...] "revelation" [...] in the role. David Hiltbrand wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer that Prepon plays the character with [...] "real vigor". Maureen Ryan of HuffPost also praised Prepon’s portrayal, commenting that [...] "underneath the cool-girl exterior {{is a whole lot}} of pain and loneliness, and Prepon has done a wonderful job of subtly bringing those notes forward." [...] Chris Jancelewicz of The Huffington Post Canada deemed Vause [...] "charismatic", adding that Prepon [...] "excels as the bad girl influence".|$|R
