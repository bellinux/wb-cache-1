5|$|Battle of <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 in 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the seventh instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during the Battle of Britain campaign of the Second World War and revolves around Britain's defence and prevention against a Nazi invasion. In the game, the player commands the Royal Air Force as they must defend key cities against the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries, {{the status of}} women amongst masons in <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and {{instruct}} masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.|$|E
5|$|SS Great <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> {{a museum}} ship and former {{passenger}} steamship, which was advanced for her time. She {{was the longest}} passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller, Great Britain {{was the first to}} combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.|$|E

5|$|Somerset is a {{historic}} county in the south west of England. There is evidence of human occupation since prehistoric times with hand axes and flint points from the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras, {{and a range of}} burial mounds, hill forts and other artefacts dating from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. The oldest dated human road work in Great <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden planks in the 39th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than it is today, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house for which there is evidence in <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims {{were also more likely to}} report this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E

5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|In 899 Alfred the Great, king of Wessex, died {{leaving his}} son Edward the Elder as ruler of Britain {{south of the}} River Thames and his {{daughter}} Æthelflæd and son-in-law Æthelred ruling the western, English part of Mercia. The situation in the Danish kingdoms of eastern <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> less clear. King Eohric was probably ruling in East Anglia, but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of Guthfrith of York in Northumbria. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or {{one after the other}} is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Viking kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by Eadulf, based at Bamburgh who controlled the lands from the River Tyne or River Tees to the Forth in the north.|$|E
5|$|The Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a {{principal}} supplier of church bells in <b>Britain,</b> <b>is</b> based at No.32–34 Whitechapel Road. The buildings date from 1670 and are Grade II listed. Originally a coaching inn {{known as the}} Artichoke, it has been occupied by the foundry since 1738, replacing smaller premises {{on the north side}} of the road. Davenant Foundation School moved to No.173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed.|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and focuses on air battles during the Battle of Britain campaign of the Second World War. The player commands squadrons of the Royal Air Force and the main objective {{of the game is}} to defend key cities and radar installations from the Luftwaffe. Unlike previous games in the series, Battle of <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> the first to include cursor movement, a scrolling interface and elements of first-person shooter gameplay. At the start of the game, the player is given the option of how many RAF squadrons they wish to allocate for offensive and defensive purposes; a proportionate amount must be sent to attack Luftwaffe squadrons whilst the others will be left to defend key cities from air raids.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{military}} withdrawals left Britain open to {{invasion by}} pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians {{who had long}} raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially {{in the eastern part}} of the country. Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards. Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about haircuts and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{house for}} which there is {{evidence}} in <b>Britain</b> <b>is</b> the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the oldest}} surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.|$|E
