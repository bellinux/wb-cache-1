40|$|International audienceThis paper reports an {{investigation}} of the thermal degradation of a poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) triblock terpolymer compared with those of <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> and poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate). According to sol-gel properties changes, it was proposed that polybutadiene blocks undergo mainly crosslinking. However, these latter coexist with chain scissions occurring in polybutadiene blocks, which generates poly(butadiene-b-methyl methacrylate) and poly(butadiene-b-styrene) diblock chains, and possibly chain scissions occurring in polystyrene and poly(methyl methacylate) blocks. The consequences of the degradation on the self-assembly of triblock terpolymer were studied through the annealing kinetics monitored by Atomic Force Microscopy. It appears that at low conversion degrees, chain scissions induce a faster self-assembly kinetics. At higher oxidation degrees, crosslinking of butadiene phase combined with scissions induces a “frozen” state at high annealing times characterized by a macrophase separation...|$|R

40|$|Tough, {{moisture}} resistant laminating resins for employment with graphite fibers were developed. The new laminating resins exhibited cost, handleability and processing characteristics equivalent to 394 K (250 F) curing epoxies.

By 2004, the range for timing belt life for new engine designs was 60000 - 100000 mi, with some designs having no fixed replacement schedule but with continued use based on visual inspection. Torque loading, vibration, oil, heat and dirt reduce belt life. Timing belts are regularly replaced during engine overhauls.|$|E
50|$|The PCPD stator, {{which is}} a major {{component}} of the pump, is usually lined with an elastomer. Most of PCPD pump failures are due to this elastomer part.

50|$|ASA is {{structurally}} {{very similar}} to ABS. The spherical particles of slightly crosslinked acrylate rubber (instead of <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber),</b> functioning as an impact modifier, are chemically grafted with styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer chains, and embedded in styrene-acrylonitrile matrix. The acrylate rubber differs from the butadiene based rubber by absence of double bonds, which gives the material about ten times the weathering resistance and resistance to ultraviolet radiation of ABS, higher long-term heat resistance, and better chemical resistance. ASA is significantly more resistant to environmental stress cracking than ABS, especially to alcohols and many cleaning agents. n-Butyl acrylate rubber is usually used, but other esters can be encountered too, e.g. ethyl hexyl acrylate. The latter has lower glass transition temperature than the former, -65 °C vs -45 °C, providing better low-temperature properties to the material.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{microstructure}} and tribological performance of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films prepared by plasma {{chemical vapor deposition}} on hydrogenated nitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubbers</b> (HNBR) are studied. Different negative variations of temperature during film growth were selected by proper changes of the bias voltage. Raman measurements show a similar bonding regardless of the voltages used. A columnar growth and a tile-like microstructure of the DLC films were identified by scanning electron microscopy. Patch sizes can be correlated with the deposition conditions. The coefficient of friction (CoF) of DLC film coated HNBR {{was found to be}} much lower than that of the unprotected rubber, and more reduced for the DLC films with smaller patch sizes, which is explained by a better flexibility and conformity of the film during testing. In one of the samples, unexpected low CoF was observed, which was attributed to a modification of the mechanical properties of the rubber during the plasma treatment at high voltage. This issue was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicated a modification of the cross linking in the rubber. ...|$|R
