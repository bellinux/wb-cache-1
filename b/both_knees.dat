5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began {{experiencing}} inflammation in his right knee. The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on <b>both</b> <b>knees.</b> After there was optimism he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was unsure whether he could continue playing.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on <b>both</b> <b>knees</b> in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} season, Portland was overcome with injuries {{from the start of}} the 2010–11 season. Jeff Pendergraph and rookie guard Elliot Williams both suffered knee injuries that sidelined them for the season; Portland later waived Pendergraph. In November, they announced that Oden would have microfracture surgery on his left knee, ending his 2010–2011 season. This injury marked Oden's third NBA season cut short due to a knee injury. Three-time All-Star Brandon Roy underwent double-arthroscopic surgery on January 17, 2011, to repair <b>both</b> <b>knees</b> after dealing with constant struggles, leaving his future up in the air. Just days after, Marcus Camby also underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to repair his left knee.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on <b>both</b> <b>knees</b> {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch the puck with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of the puck with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his soccer players and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a fighter sweep ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before bailing out. Landing heavily, he broke <b>both</b> <b>knees</b> and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his arm. From April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he had been seeing over the past year.|$|E

50|$|He was {{considered}} one of the most dominant and best defensive players early in his PBA Career.

When Howe was in the lineup, the Flyers looked like a playoff team. Without him, they looked disorganized in their own end.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Association of {{knee and}} {{low back pain}} with sleep {{disturbance}} is poorly understood. We aimed to clarify the independent and combined effects of these orthopedic symptoms on sleep in a large-scale general population. Methods: Cross-sectional data about sleep and knee/low back pain were collected for 9, 611 community residents (53 Â± 14 years old) by a structured questionnaire. Sleep duration less than 6 h/ d was defined as short sleep. Sleep quality {{and the presence of}} knee and low back pain were evaluated by dichotomous questions. Subjects who complained about knee or low back pains were graded by tertiles of a numerical response scale (NRS) score and a Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) score respectively. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine the correlates of short sleep duration and poor sleep quality. Results: Frequency of participants who complained of the orthopedic symptoms was as follows; knee pain, 29. 0 %; low back pain, 42. 0 % and <b>both</b> <b>knee</b> and low back pain 17. 6 %. <b>Both</b> <b>knee</b> and low back pain were significantly and independently associated with short sleep duration (knee pain: odds ratio (OR) = 1. 19, p< 0. 01; low back pain: OR = 1. 13, p = 0. 01) and poor sleep quality (knee pain: OR = 1. 22, p< 0. 01; low back pain; OR = 1. 57, p< 0. 01). The group in the highest tertile of the NRS or RDQ score had the highest risk for short sleep duration and poor sleep quality except for the relationship between the highest tertile of the RDQ score and short sleep duration.

25|$|More recently, another {{starting}} position choice has been allowed, {{known as the}} optional offensive {{starting position}} or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes {{to either side of}} the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or <b>both</b> <b>knees.</b> The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position.

25|$|The Sixers {{started the}} 2012–13 season with high {{expectations}} {{with the help}} of Andrew Bynum and the growth of the young Sixers. However, Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, in relation to the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the Sixers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on <b>both</b> <b>knees.</b> Bynum wasn't the only Sixer to suffer through injuries. On February 8, Jason Richardson also went through a season-ending knee surgery. Jrue Holiday, Thaddeus Young, Nick Young, and Royal Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes were the only Sixers to play in every game during the season.

The Lakers lost 116–107 to the Knicks in D'Antoni's first game back to New York since he left the previous season. The Lakers allowed another big quarter as they trailed 41–27 in the first quarter.

The Lakers overcame an 18-point deficit for their third win in a row, {{only the second time in}} the season the streak had been achieved. Nash started against the Golden State Warriors after missing 24 games, and he had 12 points and nine assists in a 118–115 overtime road victory.
