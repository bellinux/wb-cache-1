As the history suggests rural credit, poverty alleviation, and micro finance are inextricably interwoven. Any effort to understand one without the reference to other can give fragmented results. The Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are regarded as ‘outside ’ actors perceived to work {{in the interests of the}} poor, and in the absence of the state, many NGOs have played a vital role in the provision of basic services to the poor. The present paper seeks to delineate the role of NGOs in microfinance and <b>banking</b> <b>inclusion</b> in the remote rural areas...|$|E
40|$|In {{examining}} bank {{cost efficiency}} in <b>banking</b> <b>inclusion</b> of risk-taking of banks is very important. In this paper we {{depart from the}} standard modeling approach and view risk intimately related to the technology. Thus, instead of controlling for risk by viewing them as covariates in the standard cost function we argue that the technology differs with risk, thereby meaning that {{the parameters of the}} parametric cost function changes with risk in a fully flexible manner. This is accomplished by viewing the parameters of the cost function as nonparametric functions of risk. We also control for country-specific effects in a fully flexible manner by using them as arguments of the nonparametric functions along with the risk variable. The resulting cost function then becomes semiparametric. The standard parametric model becomes a special case of our semiparametric model. We use the above modeling approach for banks in the EU countries. Actually, European financial integration is seen as a stepping stone {{for the development of a}} competitive single EU market that promotes efficiency and increases consumer welfare, changing the risk profile of the European banks. Particularly, financial integration allows more risk diversification and permits banks to use more advanced risk management instruments and systems, however it has at the same time increased the probability of systematic risks. Financial integration has increased the risk of contagion and changed its nature and scope. Consequently the bank’s risk seems to be an important issue to be investigated...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{inclusion}} is {{the broad}} based delivery of banking {{and other financial}} services at affordable cost to the poorest sections of society. In India, financial inclusion emphasizes to include maximum number of people under formal financial systems. The {{most important part of}} financial services in a region is typically measured by {{number of people who have}} access to bank accounts. The present study investigates the drive to financial inclusion in the form of the growth in bank accounts of scheduled commercial banks and the changes in below poverty line population. The result suggests that the growth in bank accounts is not significantly associated with the reduction in below poverty line population across states. Providing banking services to maximum number of people is unsuccessful as a poverty reduction strategy. As a poverty reduction strategy, developing inclusive financial systems should give priority, which is financially and socially sustainable. <b>banking,</b> financial <b>inclusion,</b> poverty...|$|R

The irrigation systems in Sri Lanka mostly designed for up-stream discharge control operation, with manually/mechanically adjusted gated structures, under steady state flow conditions. Further, topographical features of many gravity irrigation systems are varying at sub-system level due to presence of single and double <b>bank</b> reaches, <b>inclusion</b> of in-lined storage tanks. However, irrigation systems are operated under varying flow regime due to scheduled or unscheduled flows in water delivery. The adjustments of gates in structures in such situations are done by manually/mechanically by operators at different frequencies. Therefore these situations are analyzed by hydraulic simulations using SIC hydraulic model for three different topographical sub-systems under different frequency of adjustments. The actual performance in water delivery is evaluated by effective volume of water delivered, timeliness in water delivery, at the final delivery location while maintaining on-line water adequacy through delivery points along the canal. The results will provide guidance for operation of regulation structures for effective conveyance of water under varying flow conditions...|$|R

Inclusion Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity poses {{this question in}} the World Bank’s first comprehensive examination of social inclusion. Most people would agree that inclusion matters simply from a moral standpoint. The book explains that inclusion also matters {{because it is the}} foundation for shared prosperity. Social exclusion is simply too costly—socially, politically, and economically.

By identifying key factors that shape inclusion, the book presents an abstract idea in a more concrete manner. That “social inclusion is the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of people, disadvantaged {{on the basis of their}} identity, to take part in society ” is a powerful statement. Understanding that “the poor ” are not one homogenous mass, but are differentiated on the basis of occupation, ethnicity, place of residence, or race, is central to developing effective and inclusive policies.

Using firm-level data for a sample of 55, 596 firms in 79 countries, we find that financial inclusion, i. e., the distribution of financial services across firms, has a positive impact on firm growth. This positive impact is magnified when bank markets are less concentrated, a proxy for more competition among banks.
