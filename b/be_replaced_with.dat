5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975. Many problems {{followed in the}} two years after completion; the rigid concrete carriageway broke up, due to the road being built on a poor subbase with rigid concrete along a historically heavily mined route. The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> asphalt.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>with</b> a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
