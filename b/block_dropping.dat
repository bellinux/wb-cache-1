40|$|Rate shaping {{plays an}} {{important}} role in transmitting compressed video on a network with dynamic bandwidth. In this paper, we present a scheme for rate shaping JPEG/MPEG-precompressed image /video with feature analysis in scale space. The proposed scheme draws its strengths from a technique for identifying perceptually important features based on geometry-driven diffusion, an interpolation scheme allowing many intentionally dropped blocks to be recovered faithfully from neighboring transmitted blocks, and some careful observations about the close interactions between <b>block</b> <b>dropping</b> and feature analysis. Compared with a successful rate shaping scheme based on joint <b>block</b> <b>dropping</b> and uniform coefficient truncation, the new scheme not only produces images of significantly higher visual quality, but also better PSNR at low bit rates. 1 Introduction Recently much attention has been focused on adapting the rate of pre-compressed video bitstreams to transmission media of lower rate capacity [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods for}} attacking watermarks in images and videos have been proposedinthispaper. The first attack {{is to remove}} robust watermarks by {{iterative}} <b>block</b> <b>dropping</b> and concealment. Our study suggests that the block size chosen by robust watermark embedding system should belarge enough to circumventing concealment based attacks.

INTRODUCTION Anumber of methods have been proposed {{in recent years to}} embed watermarks in images for various applications. Awatermark can be robust or fragile, private or public. A robust watermark can survive common signal processing and simple attempts at removing or obliterating it. They are used primarily for ownership protection, copycontrol, or similar purposes.

40|$|In local {{wireless}} communications, retransmission {{techniques to}} recover from channel errors are a feasible solution, which in some instances may be more efficient than forward error correction. In this paper, we compare the performance of BCH block codes and pure ARQ when a continuous stream of bits is to be transmitted across a bursterror channel. The presence of a delay constraint is considered, which causes degraded BCH error-correction performance (due to non-ideal interleaving) and <b>block</b> <b>dropping</b> in ARQ (due to retransmission delay). In most cases, for practical values of the parameters, better performance is achieved by ARQ schemes. I.

This will increase the degree of flexibility in managing the traffic, and will open up new opportunities.

3000|$|We {{developed}} {{a method for}} reducing <b>blocking</b> and <b>dropping</b> probabilities. The method used adaptive coding of handover connection service requests and the parameter adjustment of CAC policy functions in a multi-service cellular system. Mobility and handovers are important factors in cellular systems, so multiservices based on models with user mobility and a CAC policy were considered. Our study considered the mobility and arrival (departure) rate of user connection requests, the capacity of each cell, CAC policy, the adaptive coding probability of the âdual mode full-rate service typeâ, and <b>blocking</b> (<b>dropping)</b> probabilities of connection requests for each service. An efficient method is proposed to derive a better connection-level QoS, which was verified by performance simulations. The {{results indicate that the}} reservation policy for the new connection requests threshold Ï and the adaptive coding threshold Ï were effective in providing a better connection-level QoS for new and handover calls.

40|$|Since the Vaiont Dam {{disaster}} in 1963, {{there has been}} an awareness among design engineers of the rockfall problem, where a large landslide into shallow water can generate water waves of appreciable size. The prediction of landslide properties, like size and speed, is qualitative. However, for a given landslide into shallow water, this study aims to provide a quantitative prediction of some important wave properties. Rectangular <b>blocks</b> were <b>dropped</b> vertically into a long horizontal channel of constant width. The leading or first waves generated were mostly unbroken and, although assymmetrical, were similar to solitary waves. Only large, heavy <b>blocks</b> <b>dropped</b> from well above the water surface caused broken waves, these converting into solitary waves at substantial distances downstream. A long oscillatory wave train followed the leading wave, but because its height was usually smaller and subsided at a greater rate than the leading wave, it was not considered to be important. The first wave height is related to the block dimensions and density and its fall height. Subsidence is also studied...|$|R
30|$|However, {{previous}} studies of call <b>blocking</b> and <b>dropping</b> performance with CAC have not considered adapting multiservices in cellular systems. Mobile cellular systems can now support multiple call services, such as voice and video calls. The bandwidth of these call services is usually fixed. If the bandwidth of these call services can be adapted, the CAC used by such adaptive multirate (AMR) services may reduce the call <b>blocking</b> and <b>dropping</b> probabilities, thereby increasing cellular system utilization to meet a guaranteed level of QoS. For example, G. 722 can change the bandwidth of voice call services while Multiple Description Coding (MDC) can vary the bandwidth of video call services.|$|R
