50|$|A {{magnetic}} starter has a contactor and an overload relay, {{which will}} open the control voltage to the starter coil if it detects an overload on a motor.Overload relays may rely on heat produced by the motor current to operate a <b>bimetal</b> <b>contact</b> or release a contact held closed by a low-melting-point alloy. The overload relay opens a set of contacts that are wired in series with the supply to the contactor feeding the motor. The characteristics of the heaters can be matched to the motor so that the motor is protected against overload. Recently, microprocessor-controlled motor digital protective relays offer more comprehensive protection of motors.|$|E

Purpose of the work: {{creation of a}} metal-saving technology and development of theoretical fundamentals for calculating technological parameters of busbar production with partial cladding at special alloy working plants. A mathematical model is developed for the process of rolling of bimetal based on the usage of discontinuous velocity fields. This model accounts for {{the position of the}} layer adhesion point in the deformation centre and thus provides for the analysis of the metal laminar flow deformation with regard to the interaction of layers. The results of the work include the development of <b>bimetal</b> <b>contacts</b> of a new configuration with partial clading and proposals on the technology of their production. An experimental production lot of the contacts is manufactured and has undergone an industrial trial. The economic effect is expected owing to the reduction of expenditure of precious metals.

30|$|The period {{ratio of}} the {{prototype}} designed in the previous work was adjustable in a range from 1.5 to 5.4 by changing the height of weights attached to its legs. Successful walking was obtained when the period ratio was 3.2, but, at the smallest period ratio, 1.5, the body swing was not excited and the walker did not walk. The reason would be overheat of the bimetal sheets. Smaller period ratio could be obtained when the body swing was small, which, however, made the <b>bimetal</b> sheets <b>contacting</b> with the hot surface at a limited area. Then, the bimetal and the leg would be heated up too much around the limited contact area and the minute protrusion would not be created.|$|R
40|$|In the {{investigations}} presented here, {{the feasibility of}} producing magnetic-nonmagnetic bimetals made of 3161 / 17 - 4 PH and 316 L/Fe powders by micro-metal injection moulding process (micron-MIM) was studied. In order to achieve sound replication of small specimens with dimensions less than 1 mm, very fine powders with mean particle sizes {{in the range of}} 3 - 7 micrometer were used. A wax-polymer binder system specially designed for micro-moulding was used to make up the feedstock. The isothermal and non-isothermal sintering behaviour of the moulded components was evaluated under hydrogen atmosphere. The effect of powder-binder-ratio of the feedstock, master alloy addition, and sintering conditions on the co-sintering compatibility between the components was investigated. In this study, 316 L and 17 - 4 PH showed the best co-sintering compatibility and sound joining of the materials was achieved. When combining 316 L and iron, using a 316 L master alloy (MA) mixed from NiCrMo and iron powder reduced the mismatch incompatibility with plain iron from 12. 7 % to 1. 6 %. So the 316 L/ 17 - 4 PH and 316 L MA/Fe were found to be suitable for micro-co-injection moulding. The systems can be used for fabrication of small magnetic-nonmagnetic <b>bimetals</b> with <b>contact</b> areas less than 1 mm(exp 2). Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
