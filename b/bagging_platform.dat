50|$|Although speed {{bags are}} {{normally}} hung vertically, recently the additional method of hanging a bag horizontally {{on a wall}} has regained popularity. This was very popular during the early twentieth century, specifically the 1920s-1940s era. The same punching skills may be used on the horizontal bag that are used when it hangs vertically. Coordination Bag is {{a new type of}} a speed bag that moves unpredictably rather than rhythmically. Additionally, due to the tedious mounting and anchoring necessary when installing a traditional speed <b>bag</b> <b>platform,</b> a portable speed <b>bag</b> <b>platform</b> that installs in a doorway has been created. Designed so that downward pressure stabilizes this portable speed <b>bag</b> <b>platform,</b> it can be installed and removed through a tension system that allows for use in any doorway.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Continental Airlines {{successfully}} completed the world’s first flight using Jeppesen Airport Surface Area Moving Map (AMM) showing “own ship” {{position on a}} Class 2 Electronic Flight <b>Bag</b> <b>platform</b> - which was the navAero t•BagC22 EFB system. The AMM application uses a high resolution database to dynamically render maps of the airport. Through the use of GPS technology, the application show pilots their position (“own-ship”) on the airport surface map. The result is much improved positional/situational awareness among flight crews which is a critical safety factor for reducing runway incursions during ground operations especially at busy commercial airports with complex runway and taxiway layouts. The STC underwhich the navAero EFB system was deployed (ST02161LA) also provided for the dual EFB systems to be cross-connected which allowed for the Airport Moving Map to be shared (or “pushed”) from one EFB system to the other.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the wreck}} of Costa Concordia was towed away, Costa Crociere put Micoperi {{in charge of the}} salvage site remediation. This project is also known as phase WP9. Initially, $85 million were {{assigned}} to the project, which was to start at the end of 2014, and take about 15 months for its completion. The main activities included ocean floor cleaning, anchor block removal, grout <b>bag</b> removal, and <b>platform</b> removal. [...] The project continued into mid-2016. The entities involved regularly publish details of the activity.|$|R
50|$|Blobbing is {{an outdoor}} water {{activity}} in which a participant sits {{on the end of}} a partially inflated air bag (known as a water trampoline or blob) and is launched into the water when another participant jumps onto the air <b>bag</b> from a <b>platform</b> on the opposite side. The activity is popular at summer camps in North America. Various tricks may also be performed while the participant is in the air. The air bag is approximately 10 m long by 2 m wide. The recommended height for the tower is 15 feet above the water surface, or 10 feet above the air bag.|$|R
500|$|This {{underground}} station has two tracks and one island platform. Both track walls have a lime green trim {{line with a}} medium Kelly green border. Small [...] "205" [...] signs are placed below them at regular intervals. The platform has a row of concrete-clad I-beam columns on both sides; these are painted medium Hunter green. There is clear evidence of water damage and mold due to poor drainage in numerous areas along the platform ceiling, the wall tiles, and {{to a number of}} the support columns. The station is also notorious for having piles of trash <b>bags</b> on the <b>platform</b> and at entrances, as well as for large amounts of litter on the tracks due to an absence of trash cans. 205th Street station was declared one of the five worst in the system in terms of maintenance and appearance by the New York City Transit Riders Council in 2005, problems which have persisted into the 2010s.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Traffic Aware Planner (TAP) is a cockpit {{decision}} support tool {{that has the}} potential to achieve significant fuel and time savings when it is embedded in the data-rich Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) airspace. To address a key step towards the operational deployment of TAP and the NASA concept of Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR), a system evaluation was conducted in a representative flight environment in November, 2013. Numerous challenges were overcome to achieve this goal, including the porting of the foundational Autonomous Operations Planner (AOP) software from its original simulation-based, avionics-embedded environment to an Electronic Flight <b>Bag</b> (EFB) <b>platform.</b> A flight-test aircraft was modified to host the EFB, the TAP application, an Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) processor, and a satellite broadband datalink. Nine Evaluation Pilots conducted 26 hours of TAP assessments using four route profiles in the complex eastern and north-eastern United States airspace. Extensive avionics and video data were collected, supplemented by comprehensive inflight and post-flight questionnaires. TAP was verified to function properly in the live avionics and ADS-B environment, characterized by recorded data dropouts, latency, and ADS-B message fluctuations. Twelve TAP-generated optimization requests were submitted to ATC, of which nine were approved, and all of which resulted in fuel and/or time savings. Analysis of subjective workload data indicated that pilot interaction with TAP during flight operations did not induce additional cognitive loading. Additionally, analyses of post-flight questionnaire data showed that the pilots perceived TAP to be useful, understandable, intuitive, and easy to use. All program objectives were met, and the next phase of TAP development and evaluations with partner airlines is in planning for 2015...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{devices are}} {{becoming}} part of modern digital avionics. Mobile devices {{can be applied to}} a range of scenarios, from Electronic Flight <b>Bags</b> to maintenance <b>platforms,</b> in order to manage and configure flight information, configure avionics networks or perform maintenance tasks (including offloading flight logs). It can be argued that recent developments show an increased use of personal mobile devices playing an integral part in the digital avionics industry. In this paper, we look into different proposals for integrating mobile devices with various avionics networks [...] either as part of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) or Corporate Owned Personally Enabled (COPE) paradigms. Furthermore, we will evaluate the security and trust challenges presented by these devices in their respective domains. This analysis will also include the issues related to communication between the mobile device and the aircraft network via either wired or wireless channels. Finally, the paper puts forward a set of guidelines with regards to the security and trust issues that might be crucial when enabling mobile devices to be part of aircraft networks.

40|$|The {{adoption}} {{of information and}} communications technology to support cancer research has triggered the use of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequencing to generate complete genomes {{of different types of}} human cancer. This usually results in huge volume of genomics data which contain hidden mutations’ profiles that cannot be accurately mined with molecular approach. However, using digital techniques to unravel the inherent mutations holds a lot of promises for early diagnosis of cancerous patients accurately and efficiently. In this research work, pre-processing and features extraction algorithms were developed to implement a genomics and bagged Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ensemble-based diagnostic system for non-small cell lung cancer. The pre-processing algorithm encodes and vectorises the genomics nucleotides using their relative molecular masses and normalizes the resultant vectors for any given patient. For the features extraction algorithm, two distance metrics were hybrided to extract eight features from the normalized genomics vectors. This helped to eliminate the “curse of dimensionality” for the <b>bagged</b> ANNs ensemble <b>platform</b> that was adopted as the classifier in the system. The performance of the system was evaluated using Mean Square Error (MSE) and confusion matrix when a single ANN was utilized and when bagged ANNs ensemble was employed. The ensembled ANNs option did not only achieve perfect output stability but also achieved a good MSE of 0. 0139 and an accuracy of 100...|$|R
