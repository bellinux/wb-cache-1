5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King BolesÅ‚aw I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the sword <b>by</b> <b>hitting</b> it against the Golden Gate, Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to KrakÃ³w until 1959. In the 20th century, an image of the sword was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.|$|E
