25|$|They {{also share}} traits {{with the work}} of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant who {{together}} had founded Purism, a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the impulsiveness of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, Léger's Nude on a Red Background (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. The Siphon of 1924, a still life based on an advertisement in the popular press for the aperitif Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in Léger's work. Its <b>balanced</b> <b>composition</b> and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.|$|E

The Baptist's decapitation portrayed by Memling, is subdued and restrained, and the apocalyptic scenes on the opposite panel are [...] "more poetic than horrific". Maryan Ainsworth says it shows a carefully <b>balanced</b> <b>composition,</b> painted in light clear colors. Memling catered to foreign patrons, most of whom were Italian, and he became known for his unique style that combined southern Italian elements with those of the northern Netherlandish tradition. He juxtaposed [...] "an Italianate monumentality and simplification of form with a northern sense of atmosphere and light in a format that often placed his subjects before a charming locally inspired landscape background", according to Ainsworth.|$|E

There {{might have been the}} last ring of an appeal or a show of {{persistent}} and perverse tenderness in it, however preposterous any such matter; but in point of fact her large, clean, plain, brown face--so much too big for her head, he now more than ever felt it to be, just as her head was so much too big for her body, and just as her hats had an irritating way of appearing to decline choice and conformity in respect to any of her dimensions--presented itself with about as much expression as his own shop-window when the broad, blank, sallow blind was down. He was fond of his shop-window with some good show on; he had a fancy for a good show and was master of twenty different schemes of taking arrangement for the old books and prints, [...] "high-class rarities" [...] his modest catalogue called them, in which he dealt and which his maternal uncle, David Geddes, had, as he liked to say, [...] "handed down" [...] to him.

He could enjoy his happiest collocations and contrasts and effects, his harmonies and varieties of toned and faded leather and cloth, his sought color-notes and the high clearnesses, here and there, of his white and beautifully figured price-labels, which pleased him enough in themselves almost to console him for not oftener having to break, on a customer's insistence, into the <b>balanced</b> <b>composition.</b> But the dropped expanse of time-soiled canvas, the thing of Sundays and holidays, with just his name, [...] "Herbert Dodd, Successor," [...] painted on below his uncle's antique style, the feeble penlike flourishes already quite archaic--this ugly vacant mask, which might so easily be taken for the mask of failure, somehow always gave him a chill.|$|E
