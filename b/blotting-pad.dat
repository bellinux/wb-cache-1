60|$|Priscilla Wimbush {{was lying}} on the sofa. A <b>blotting-pad</b> rested on her knees and she was thoughtfully sucking the end of a silver pencil.|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{offered his}} hand in congratulation. Geoffrey never noticed it. His eyes were off the <b>blotting-pad</b> again. He was looking {{out of the window}} near him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think, Flo. There must be no uncertainty." [...] Miss Schuyler {{slipped out}} of the room and when she came back she brought an envelope, splashed with red wax, on a <b>blotting-pad.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then proudly smiled {{that old}} man To see the eager lad Rush madly for his pen and ink And for his <b>blotting-pad</b> - But, when he thought of PUBLISHING, His face grew stern and sad.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey absently {{took up a}} paper-knife. Still {{with his}} head down, he began shaving off the topmost layer of paper from the <b>blotting-pad</b> under his hand. Still with his head down, he {{abruptly}} broke the silence in a whisper.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} still that accursed dedication, lying, you remember, beneath the <b>blotting-pad.</b> I had no longer any desire to crush her with it. I wished that she had succeeded in writing the book on which her longings had been so set.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Waddington nodded. Alfred had {{propped up}} the book of {{engravings}} before him, was holding {{a sheet of paper}} on the <b>blotting-pad,</b> and with a pencil was intently copying one of the heads. They crossed the room and peered over his shoulder. For an untrained child it was an amazing piece of work.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BURLACOMBE. Ivy, take Mr. Strangway his ink, or we'll never 'eve no sermon to-night. He'm in his thinkin' box, but 'tis {{not a bit}} o' yuse 'im thinkin' without 'is ink. [She {{hands her}} {{daughter}} an inkpot and <b>blotting-pad.</b> Ivy Takes them and goes out] What ever's this? [She picks up the little bird-cage.] ...|$|E
60|$|Naudheim's disapproval {{was very}} marked and evident. He {{scoffed at the}} great bowl of pink roses which stood upon the writing-table. He pushed scornfully on one side the elegantly shaped inkstand, with its burden of pens; the <b>blotting-pad,</b> with its silver edges; the piles of cream-laid foolscap. Most of all he looked with scornful disapprobation at his young host.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose we'd better {{wait and}} find out what the umpires will say. The Admiral won't be exactly pleased." [...] Captain Malan spoke very soothingly. Moorshed looked out through the stern door at Two Six Seven. Pyecroft and I, at attention, studied the {{paintwork}} opposite. Captain Panke had dropped into his desk chair, and scribbled nervously at a <b>blotting-pad.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sheets {{of virgin}} {{manuscript}} paper littered my desk, {{the smoke of}} much uselessly consumed tobacco hung about the room in a little cloud. Many a time I had dipped my pen in the ink, only to find myself {{a few minutes later}} scrawling ridiculous little figures upon the margin of my <b>blotting-pad.</b> It was not at all an auspicious start for one who sought immortality.|$|E
6000|$|With the quickness of David at the switch, I {{slipped a}} <b>blotting-pad</b> over the dedication, and then, [...] "Pray be seated," [...] I said coldly, but she {{remained}} standing, {{all in a}} twitter and very much afraid of me, and I know that her hands were pressed together within the muff. Had there been any dignified means of escape, I think we would both have taken it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{your house}} will be the <b>blotting-pad.</b> Have you {{realized}} that half the papers of Europe and the United States will publish pictures of it? By the way, I've sent some photographs {{of you and your}} sister, that I found in the library, to the MATIN and DIE WOCHE; I hope you don't mind. Also a sketch of the staircase; most of the killing will probably be done on the staircase." ...|$|E
6000|$|Will {{you believe}} me that I {{had to tell her}} what it was? And when I had told her she exclaimed with {{extraordinary}} callousness, [...] "The book? I had forgotten all about the book!" [...] And then after reflection she added, [...] "Pooh!" [...] Had she not added Pooh I might have spared her, but as it was I raised the <b>blotting-pad</b> rather haughtily and presented her with the sheet beneath it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a pity he did {{not write}} in pencil," [...] said he, {{throwing}} them down again with a shrug of disappointment. [...] "As you have no doubt frequently observed, Watson, the impression usually goes through--a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage. However, I can find no trace here. I rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote with a broad-pointed quill pen, and I can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this <b>blotting-pad.</b> Ah, yes, surely {{this is the very}} thing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Excepting, always, {{falling off}} a horse {{there is nothing}} more fatally easy than {{marriage}} before the Registrar. The ceremony costs less than fifty shillings, and is remarkably like walking into a pawn-shop. After the declarations of residence have been put in, four minutes will cover the rest of the proceedings--fees, attestation, and all. Then the Registrar slides the <b>blotting-pad</b> over the names, and says grimly, with his pen between his teeth:-- [...] "Now you're man and wife;" [...] and the couple walk out into the street, feeling as if something were horribly illegal somewhere.|$|E
60|$|The {{little room}} had been {{transformed}} for present emergencies. The desk had been pushed aside, and a small iron bedstead fitted up for the night nurse. A woman's paraphernalia was scattered about on the massive early Victorian furniture: a comb and brush, a cap and apron neatly folded, a couple of long pins, littered the table which used to look so severe with its heavy inkstand and firm <b>blotting-pad.</b> The piano had been relegated into a corner, and the portrait of Luke which always hung over the mantlepiece had been removed.|$|E
60|$|Deringham {{was in the}} {{meanwhile}} hastily writing out telegraphic messages {{which were}} to cause a little astonishment on the London stock market, and hamper the working {{of one or two}} companies. He would, so far as he could see, be a much poorer man in a few months or so, but he fancied he could gain time to save the reputation that would help him to commence again, and to men of his attainments there are always opportunities. Then he sent off a mounted messenger, and rode slowly back towards Somasco, while Horton spent some time examining a <b>blotting-pad</b> in his back store.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{there was}} {{something}} of this in his face, for the clerk, staring at him, bade him {{sit down for a}} moment, and again vanished into the mysterious interior. Clarence had no conception how long he was absent, or indeed anything but his own breathless thoughts, for he was conscious of wondering afterwards why the clerk was leading him through a door in the counter into an inner room of many desks, and again through a glass door into a smaller office, where a preternaturally busy-looking man sat writing at a desk. Without looking up, but pausing only to apply a <b>blotting-pad</b> to the paper before him, the man said crisply-- ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{sensible}} {{that the}} girl's hand was very cold {{as he drew}} her from the room, but he left her with his wife on the verandah {{and then went back}} hastily. Forel was a kindly man, but he knew that speculation in Western mines has its under-side, and it was for the girl's sake he stripped off the top sheet of the <b>blotting-pad,</b> which had a recent impression on it, and afterwards poured the remaining contents of a wineglass out into the stove. Then he glanced all round the room before he went out to send for a doctor. It was an hour later when he found his wife alone.|$|E
60|$|Ruth, as {{has been}} stated, sat during her hours of work behind a {{ground-glass}} screen, unseen and unseeing. To her the patrons of the establishment were mere disembodied voices--wheedling voices, pathetic voices, voices that protested, voices that hectored, voices that whined, moaned, broke, appealed to the saints, and in various other ways endeavoured to instil into M. Gandinot more spacious and princely views on the subject advancing money on property pledged. She was sitting behind her screen this morning, scribbling idly on the <b>blotting-pad,</b> for {{there had been a}} lull in the business, when the door opened, and the polite, 'Bonjour, monsieur,' of M. Gandinot announced the arrival of another unfortunate.|$|E
6000|$|The {{apartment}} in which Filmer {{came to his}} last solution was a pleasant little room very simply furnished with green furniture and an old bureau--for Banghurst was simple in all his private ways. It was hung with little engravings after Morland {{and it had a}} shelf of books. But as it happened, Banghurst had left a rook rifle he sometimes played with {{on the top of the}} desk, and on the corner of the mantelshelf was a tin with three or four cartridges remaining in it. As Filmer went up and down that room wrestling with his intolerable dilemma he went first towards the neat little rifle athwart the <b>blotting-pad</b> and then towards the neat little red label ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Shalford rose, {{and handing}} Kipps a <b>blotting-pad</b> and an inkpot to carry--mere symbols of servitude, for {{he made no}} use of them--emerged into a counting-house where three clerks had been feverishly busy ever since his door handle had turned. [...] "Booch," [...] said Mr. Shalford, [...] "'ave y'r copy of the rules?" [...] and a down-trodden, shabby little {{old man with a}} ruler {{in one hand and a}} quill pen in his mouth, silently held out a small book with green and yellow covers, mainly devoted, as Kipps {{presently}} discovered, to a voracious system of fines. He became acutely aware that his hands were full, and that everybody was staring at him. He hesitated a moment before putting the inkpot down to free a hand.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{no doubt}} {{doing his best to}} express the {{attitude}} of society toward these wearily heroic defendants, but he seemed to be merely rude and unfair to Ann Veronica. He was not, it seemed, the proper stipendiary at all, and there had been some demur to his jurisdiction that had ruffled him. He resented being regarded as irregular. He felt he was human wisdom prudentially interpolated.... "You silly wimmin," [...] he said over and over again throughout the hearing, plucking at his <b>blotting-pad</b> with busy hands. [...] "You silly creatures! Ugh! Fie upon you!" [...] The court was crowded with people, for the most part supporters and admirers of the defendants, and the man with the light eyelashes was conspicuously active and omnipresent.|$|E
6000|$|And {{suddenly}} there came upon him a mad fear lest his father should have locked him in. The notion had no ground in sense; {{it was probably}} {{no more than a}} reminiscence of similar calamities in childhood, for his father's room had always been the chamber of inquisition and the scene of punishment; but it stuck so rigorously in his mind that he must instantly approach the door and prove its untruth. As he went, he struck upon a drawer left open in the business table. It was the money-drawer, a measure of his father's disarray: the money-drawer - perhaps a pointing providence! Who is to decide, when even divines differ between a providence and a temptation? or who, sitting calmly under his own vine, is to pass a judgment on the doings of a poor, hunted dog, slavishly afraid, slavishly rebellious, like John Nicholson on that particular Sunday? His hand was in the drawer, almost before his mind had conceived the hope; and rising to his new situation, he wrote, sitting in his father's chair and using his father's <b>blotting-pad,</b> his pitiful apology and farewell:- ...|$|E
6000|$|The soldier {{had all the}} {{responsibilities}} and perplexities he could master without the addition of Elsie Brisbane's disturbing lure. The value of her good opinion was enormously enhanced by the news of her intended departure, and {{for a day or}} two Curtis went about his duties with absent-minded ineffectiveness; he even detected himself once or twice sitting with his pen in his hand creating aimless markings on his <b>blotting-pad.</b> Wilson, the clerk, on one occasion waited full five minutes for an answer while his chief debated with himself whether to call upon Miss Brisbane at the studio or at the house. He began to find excuses for her--"A man who is a villain in business may be a very attractive citizen in private life--and she may have been very fond of Sennett. From her point of view--anyhow, she is a lovely young girl, and it is absurd to place her among my enemies." [...] The thought of her face set in bitter scorn against him caused his heart to contract painfully. [...] "I've been too harsh. These people are repugnant to one so dainty and superrefined. There are excuses for her prejudice. I can't let her go away in anger." [...] And in this humble mood he stopped at the door of her studio one morning, prepared to be very patient and very persuasive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that's {{because you}} don't know what it's {{like to have}} faith. You've no idea how amusing and {{exciting}} life becomes when you do believe. All that happens means something; nothing you do is ever insignificant. It makes life so jolly, you know. Here am I at Crome. Dull as ditchwater, you'd think; but no, I don't find it so. I don't regret the Old Days a bit. I have the Stars..." [...] She picked up the sheet of paper that {{was lying on the}} <b>blotting-pad.</b> [...] "Inman's horoscope," [...] she explained. [...] "(I thought I'd like to have a little fling on the billiards championship this autumn.) I have the Infinite to keep in tune with," [...] she waved her hand. [...] "And then there's the next world and all the spirits, and one's Aura, and Mrs. Eddy and saying you're not ill, and the Christian Mysteries and Mrs. Besant. It's all splendid. One's never dull for a moment. I can't think how I used to get on before--in the Old Days. Pleasure--running about, that's all it was; just running about. Lunch, tea, dinner, theatre, supper every day. It was fun, of course, while it lasted. But there wasn't much left of it afterwards. There's rather a good thing about that in Barbecue-Smith's new book. Where is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Once a year came stock-taking, and at {{intervals}} gusts of [...] "marking off" [...] goods newly arrived. Then the splendours of Mr. Shalford's being shone with oppressive brilliancy. [...] "System!" [...] he would say, [...] "system. Come! 'ussel!" [...] and issue sharp, confusing, contradictory orders very quickly. Carshot trotted about, confused, perspiring, his big nose {{up in the}} air, his little eye on Mr. Shalford, his forehead crinkled, his lips always going to the formula [...] "Oh, my heart and lungs!" [...] The smart junior and the second apprentice vied {{with one another in}} obsequious alacrity. The smart junior aspired to Carshot's position, and that made him almost violently subservient to Shalford. They all snapped at Kipps. Kipps held the <b>blotting-pad</b> and the safety inkpot and a box of tickets, and ran and fetched things. If he put the ink down before he went to fetch things Mr. Shalford usually knocked it over, and if he took it away Mr. Shalford wanted it before he returned. [...] "You make my tooth ache, Kipps," [...] Mr. Shalford would say. [...] "You gimme n'ralgia. You got no more System in you than a bad potato." [...] And at the times when Kipps carried off the inkpot Mr. Shalford would become purple in the face and jab round with his dry pen at imaginary inkpots and swear, and Carshot would stand and vociferate, and the smart junior would run to the corner of the department and vociferate, and the second apprentice would pursue Kipps, vociferating, [...] "Look Alive, Kipps! Look Alive! Ink, Man! Ink!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Muggeridge drew {{a darker}} {{attitude}} from Kingsmill's sardonic wit. Kingsmill's parody of A. E. Housman's poetry has been recognised as definitive:What still alive at twenty-two,A clean, upstanding chap like you?Sure, if your throat 'tis hard to slit,Slit your girl's, and swing for it.Like enough, you won't be glad,When {{they come to}} hang you, lad:But bacon's not the only thingThat's cured by hanging from a string.So, when the spilt ink of the nightSpreads o'er the <b>blotting-pad</b> of light,Lads whose job is still to doShall whet their knives, and think of you. [...] Housman himself said of this parody: [...] "It's the best I have seen, and indeed, the only good one." ...|$|E
