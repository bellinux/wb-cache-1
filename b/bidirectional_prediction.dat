Recent gene array attempts {{to identify the}} molecular underpinnings of the illness in human postmortem subjects have not yielded a consensus. The authors hypothesized that controlling several sources of clinical and technical variability and supporting their analysis with array results from a parallel study in the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) rodent model of depression would facilitate identification of the molecular pathology of major depression. Method: Large-scale gene expression was monitored in postmortem tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala in paired male subjects with familial major depression and matched control subjects without major depression (N= 14 – 16 pairs). Area dissections and analytical approaches were optimized. Results from the major depression group were compared with those from the UCMS study and confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Gene coexpression network analysis was performed on transcripts with conserved major depression-UCMS effects. Results: Significant and <b>bidirectional</b> <b>predictions</b> of altered gene expression were identified in amygdala between major depression and the UCMS model of depression. These effects were detected at the group level and also identified a subgroup of depressed subjects with a more homogeneous molecular pathology. This phylogenetically conserved “molecular signature” of major depression was reversed by antidepressants in mice, identified two distinct oligodendrocyte and neuronal phenotypes, and participated in highly cohesive and interactive gene coexpression networks.

40|$|The general array model (GAR) is {{extended}} to calculate bidirectional reflectance (reflectance {{as a function}} of angle of view and angle of illumination) of a plant stand. The new model (BIGAR) defines the plant canopy as one or more foliage-containing ellipsoids arranged in any desired pattern. Foliage is assumed randomly distributed within each ellipsoid, with a specified distribution of inclination angles and random azimuthal orientation distribution. A method of specifying sub-ellipsoids that contain foliage of varying properties is discussed. Foliage is assumed to scatter radiation in a Lambertian fashion. The soil bidirectional reflectance is modelled separately as a boundary condition. The reflectance of any given grid point within the plant stand is calculated from the incident radiation (direct beam, diffuse sky, and diffuse scattered from the soil and foliage) and a view weighting factor that is based upon how much of the view is occupied by that particular grid point. Integrating this over a large number of grid locations provides a <b>prediction</b> of the <b>bidirectional</b> reflectance.

The presence of tassles in the corn may be the cause of unpredicted row effects later in the season. Predicted nadir reflectances are accurate for soybean, but are low for full cover corn.

This paper is premised on the realization that such standard prediction treats each pixel independently and ignores underlying spatial correlations, while transform-domain prediction would eliminate much of the spatial correlation before signal components (transform coefficients) are independently predicted. Moreover, the true temporal correlations emerge after signal decomposition, and vary considerably from low to high frequency components. This precise nature of the temporal dependencies is entirely masked in spatial domain prediction by the high temporal correlation coefficient (ρ ≈ 1) imposed on all pixels by the dominant low frequency components.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate algorithms that yield improved image quality for motion compensated frame interpolation or frame rate up-conversion. We address the problems of having broken edges and deformed structures in an interpolated frame by hierarchically refining motion vectors on different block sizes. The proposed novel, low complexity motion vector processing algorithm at the decoder explicitly considers the reliability of each received motion vector based on the received residual energy and motion vector correlation. By analyzing the distribution of residual energies and effectively merging blocks that have unreliable motion vectors, the structure information can be preserved. In addition to the unreliable motion vectors due to high residual energies, there are still other unreliable motion vectors that cause visual artifacts but cannot be detected by high residual energy or <b>bidirectional</b> <b>prediction</b> difference in motion compensated frame interpolation. We further propose a correlation-based motion vector processing to classify motion vector reliability and correct identified unreliable motion vectors by analyzing motion vector correlation in the neighborhood. These unreliable motion vectors are gradually corrected based on their bidirectional difference energy levels {{so that we can}} effectively discover the areas where no motion is reliable to be used, such as occlusions and deformed structures. For these areas, we further propose an adaptive frame interpolation scheme by analyzing their surrounding motion distribution and accurately choosing forward or backward predictions. Since the proposed motion vector processing method exploits the spatial information such as residual energy and motion vector correlation, experimental results show that our interpolated results have better visual quality than other methods. However, we still can observe the flickering effects during video display especially in motion boundaries and areas having uniformly distributed texture. Therefore, to further ensure the temporal stability in these motion sensitive areas or video frames, a novel motion vector processing approach based on motion temporal reliability analysis is proposed.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous lesion, {{electrical}} self-stimulation {{and drug}} addiction {{studies suggest that}} the midbrain dopamine systems are parts of the reward system of the brain. This review provides an updated overview about the basic signals of dopamine neurons to environmental stimuli. Methods The described experiments used standard behavioral and neurophysiological methods to record the activity of single dopamine neurons in awake monkeys during specific behavioral tasks. Results Dopamine neurons show phasic activations to external stimuli. The signal reflects reward, physical salience, risk and punishment, in descending order of fractions of responding neurons. Expected reward value is a key decision variable for economic choices. The reward response codes reward value, probability and their summed product, expected value. The neurons code reward value as it differs from prediction, thus fulfilling the basic requirement for a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>prediction</b> error teaching signal postulated by learning theory. This response is scaled in units of standard deviation. By contrast, relatively few dopamine neurons show the phasic activation following punishers and conditioned aversive stimuli, suggesting a lack of relationship of the reward response to general attention and arousal. Large proportions of dopamine neurons are also activated by intense, physically salient stimuli. This response is enhanced when the stimuli are novel; it appears to be distinct from the reward value signal. Dopamine neurons show also unspecific activations to non-rewarding stimuli that are possibly due to generalization by similar stimuli and pseudoconditioning by primary rewards. These activations are shorter than reward responses and are often followed by depression of activity. A separate, slower dopamine signal informs about risk, another important decision variable. The prediction error response occurs only with reward; it is scaled by the risk of predicted reward. Conclusions Neurophysiological studies reveal phasic dopamine signals that transmit information related predominantly but not exclusively to reward. Although not being entirely homogeneous, the dopamine signal is more restricted and stereotyped than neuronal activity in most other brain structures involved in goal directed behavior. </p...|$|E

Experiments 2 a and 2 b showed that chemogenetic excitation of BLACaMKIIα was sufficient to attenuate associative blocking of fear, such that fear learning was restored to a CS that would not otherwise be learned about. Experiment 2 c showed that this same manipulation was not sufficient to influence simple fear acquisition. The third set of experiments assessed chemogenetic excitation of BLACaMKIIα on negative prediction error. Experiments 3 a and 3 b showed that chemogenetic excitation of BLACaMKIIα was sufficient to attenuate overexpectation of fear, such that CSs that would normally undergo fear loss failed to do so. While the second and third set of experiments suggest that BLACaMKIIα are causal to aversive prediction errors, they are not immediately informative about how this error signal is supported in BLACaMKIIα.
