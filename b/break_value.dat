Herein, we evaluated the response of tenocytes, osteoblasts and corneal fibroblasts to the topographies created through electro-spinning and solvent casting. We also evaluated the influence of topography on mechanical properties. At day 14, human osteoblasts seeded on aligned orientated electro-spun mats exhibited the lowest metabolic activity (P 0. 05). Osteoblasts and corneal fibroblasts aligned parallel to the direction of the aligned orientated electro-spun mats, whilst tenocytes aligned perpendicular to the aligned orientated electro-spun mats. Mechanical evaluation demonstrated that aligned orientated electro-spun fibres exhibited significant higher stress at <b>break</b> <b>values</b> than their random aligned counterparts (P < 0. 006) and random orientated electro-spun fibres exhibited significant higher strain at <b>break</b> <b>values</b> than the aligned orientated scaffolds (P < 0. 006).

Symmetry-breaking in {{constraint}} satisfaction problems (CSPs) is a well-established area of AI research which has recently developed strong interactions with symbolic computation, {{in the form}} of computational group theory.

In this paper we analyse the structure of symmetry groups of CSPs, and implement several combinations of GE-trees and the classical SBDD method for breaking all symmetries.

In a recent series of papers, we have studied methods to <b>break</b> <b>value</b> symmetries (Walsh 2006 a; Walsh 2007). Our results identify computational limits on eliminating value symmetry. For instance, we prove that pruning all symmetric values is NP-hard in general. Nevertheless, experiments show that much value symmetry can be broken in practice.

40|$|We {{investigate}} why BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) have {{values of}} the Ca H&K break (a stellar absorption feature) lower than low-power radio galaxies and if its use is justified to separate the two classes. For this purpose we relate this parameter to the radio and optical core emissions, {{as well as to}} the X-ray powers, for a sample of ∼ 90 radio sources. We find that the Ca H&K <b>break</b> <b>value</b> decreases with increasing jet powers, and that it also anti-correlates with the radio core dominance parameter but not with extended radio emission. Based on this we conclude that the Ca H&K <b>break</b> <b>value</b> of BL Lacs and radio galaxies is a suitable indicator of orientation. From the luminosity ratios between objects with low and high Ca H&K break values we constrain the average Lorentz factors for BL Lacs and low-power radio galaxies in the radio and X-ray band to Γ ∼ 2 − 4 and derive average viewing angles for the galaxies. Our values are in agreement with results from independent methods. We find that the correlations between Ca H&K break and radio core and X-ray luminosity hold independently for low- (LBL) and high-energy peaked BL Lacs (HBL). We derive average viewing angles for their parent populations, which turn out to be similar to the ones for our entire sample, and compare for the first time the luminosities of LBL and HBL at different orientations.
