Different species have different requirements for their larvae with regard to water depth, water movement and pH.The European common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) for example can occur at high densities in acid waters where fish are absent, such as in bog pools.The scarce blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura pumilio) in contrast requires base-rich habitats and water with a slow flow-rate. It is found in ditches, quarries, seeps, flushes, marshes and pools. It tolerates high levels of zinc and copper in the sediment but requires suitable emergent plants for egg-laying without the water being choked by plants. Damselflies' dependence on freshwater habitats makes them very vulnerable to damage to wetlands through drainage for agriculture or urban growth.|$|E

40|$|Bio-sampling is a {{function}} of <b>bio-indication.</b> <b>Bio-indication</b> with honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L) is where the research fields of environmental technology and apiculture overlap. The honeybees are samplers of the environment by collecting unintentionally and simultaneously, along with nectar, pollen, water and honeydew from the flowers or on the leaves, other matter (in <b>bio-indication</b> terms: target matter) and accumulating this in the colony. Collected target matter, in this thesis heavy metals, the plant pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora and the soil pollutant γ-HCH, is collected from the colony by subsampling. Subsampling the honeybee colony is done by taking and killing bees from the hive (sacrificial) or by collecting target matter from the bee’s exterior without killing the bee (non-sacrificial). In environmental technology terms the application of the honeybee colony is a Passive Sampling Method (PSM). In this thesis the possibilities and restrictions of the PSM honeybee colony are explored. <b>Bio-indication</b> is a broad research field with one common factor: a living organism (bio) is applied to record an alteration of the environment (indication). The environment may be small such as a laboratory or big such as an ecosystem. Alterations in the organism may vary from detecting substances foreign to the body to mortality of the organism. In environmental technology the concept Source-Path-Receptor (SPR) is applied to map the route of a pollutant. It describes where in the environment the pollution is, how it moves through the environment and where it ends. This environment is the same environment of all living organisms, ergo also honeybees. Honeybees depend on flowers for their food. In the SPR concept, a flower can be a source, path or receptor. Along with collecting pollen, nectar, water and honeydew, target matter is collected by honeybees. Each honeybee functions as a micro-sampler of target matter in the environment, in this case the flower. Each honeybee is part of a honeybee colony and in fact the honeybee colony is the bio-sampler. The honeybee colony is a superorganism. The well-being of the colony prevails over the individual honeybee. Food collection is directed by the colony’s need. Foragers are directed to the most profitable food sources by the bee dance and food exchange (trophallaxis). The result of this feature is that mainly profitable sources are exploited and poor food sources less or not at all. During the active foraging period hundreds to thousands of flowers are visited daily. The nectar, pollen, water and honeydew plus the unintentionally collected target matter is accumulated in the honeybee colony. In order to obtain target matter the colony must be subsampled. This is done by picking bees from the hive-entrance (hive-entering bees) or inside the hive (in-hive bees) and processing them for analysis (sacrificial). This is the most commonly applied method. However, it is possible to subsample the colony without picking and processing the bees by collecting target matter from the hive-entering bee’s exterior (non-sacrificial). For non-sacrificial subsampling of the honeybee colony the Beehold device with the sampling part Beehold tube has been developed. The results of <b>bio-indication</b> with honeybee colonies are qualitative and indicative for follow up study (Chapter 1). Six <b>bio-indication</b> studies with honeybee colonies for <b>bio-indication</b> of heavy metals, the plant pathogens Erwinia pyrifoliae and Erwinia amylovora and the soil pollutant γ-HCH are presented. Chapter 2 describes how the concentration of eighteen heavy metals in honeybees fluctuate throughout the period of July, August and September (temporal) at the study sites: the city of Maastricht, the urban location with an electricity power plant in Buggenum and along the Nieuwe Waterweg at Hoek van Holland (spatial). A number of the metals have not been previously analysed in honeybees. To study whether honeybees can be used for <b>bio-indication</b> of air pollution, the concentrations of cadmium, vanadium and lead were compared to concentrations found in honeybees. The honeybee colonies were placed next to the air samplers. Only significant differences of metal concentrations in the ambient air also show in honeybees. This was the case with vanadium in ambient air and honeybees. The spatial and temporal differences of cadmium and lead were too futile to demonstrate a correspondence (Chapter 3). In a national surveillance study in 2008 the concentration of eighteen metals in honeybees has been analysed. The results showed a distinct regional pattern. Honeybees in the East of the Netherlands have higher concentrations of heavy metals compared to the bees in the West. Besides regional differences local differences were also recorded. An approximate description of the land use around 148 apiaries (> 50 % agriculture, > 50 % wooded area, > 50 % urban area and mixed use) indicated the impact of land use on metal concentrations in honeybees. In areas with > 50 % wood significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals were detected (Chapter 4). Subsampling of the honeybee colonies in Chapter 2, 3 and 4 was done sacrificially. In the studies presented in Chapter 5, 6, and 7 the honeybee colonies were subsampled non-sacrificially or simultaneously non-sacrificially and sacrificially. The plant pathogen E. pyrifoliae causes a flower infection in the strawberry cultivation in greenhouses. In greenhouse strawberry cultivation honeybees are applied for pollination. In Chapter 5 the combination pollination / <b>bio-indication</b> by honeybee colonies is studied. This proved to be a match. E. pyrifoliae could be detected on in-hive bees prior to any symptom of the infection in the flowers. In the Beehold tube, the bacterium was detected {{at the same time as}} the first tiny symptoms of the infection. In Chapter 5 the principles on which the Beehold tube is based are presented and discussed. The plant pathogen E. amylovora causes fireblight in orchards. The combination pollination / <b>bio-indication</b> has also been applied in this study performed in Austria in 2013. It is known that E. amylovora can be detected on honeybees prior to any symptom in the flower or on the fruit tree. A fireblight outbreak depends on flowering period, humidity and temperature. In 2013 no fireblight infection emerged in the orchards where the study was performed. Therefore, the bacterium could not be detected on the honeybees. γ-HCH (Lindane) is one of the soil pollutants in the Bitterfeld region in Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. It is the result of dumping industrial waste around the production locations. Although γ-HCH is bound to soil particles there is a flux to groundwater and surface water. Consequently, the pollution may end up in the sediments of the streambed and flood plains. The study objective was to investigate the hypothetic route of γ-HCH from polluted soil (source), via soil erosion and atmospheric deposition (route) to the receptor (flowering flowers) by detecting γ-HCH in the Beehold tube. Although on average over 17000 honeybees passed through the Beehold tube daily for a maximal period of 28 days, no γ-HCH has been detected. The pollen pattern in the Beehold tube revealed where the bees collected the food (Chapter 7). The application of the honeybee colony has pros and cons. Distinctive pros are many micro samplers, the extensive collection of matter (both food and target matter) and the accumulation in the colony. For successful <b>bio-indication</b> with honeybee colonies, determining factors are: the target matter, location of the target matter, distance between target matter and the honeybee colony, individual or pooled subsampling, the minimal sampling frequency and sample size, and sacrificial or non-sacrificial subsampling applied solely or in combination. Taking bees from a colony impacts upon the colony’s performance and consequently the passive sampling method. Based on a long-years’ experience and inter-collegial discussion it is stated that 3 % of the forager bees (hive-entering) and 1. 5 % of the in-hive bees can be sampled safely without impacting upon the colony. This restriction does not apply when carrying out non-sacrificial subsampling of the honeybee colony (Chapter 8). Performing <b>bio-indication</b> with honeybee colonies has more applications than have been exploited so far. Further research can make a change. In particular I mention here the combination of pollination and <b>bio-indication</b> and the application of non-sacrificial subsampling solely or in combination with sacrificial subsampling. Everywhere Apiculture is practiced (all over the world except the polar areas) <b>bio-indication</b> with honeybee colonies can be applied in a simple, practical and low cost way.  ...|$|E

The Workshop was organized by IIASA in cooperation with the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO) and the Systems Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. The objectives of the Workshop were to seek a consensus about the status and knowledge of forest decline, especially in Europe, to identify the choices that international organizations, the forestry community, governments and industry must face, and to discuss ways to avoid further forest decline and facilitate the sustainability of the forest sector. A special field study trip was arranged to the Niepolomice Forest where special attention was given to the <b>bio-indications</b> of industrial damage and the disturbances of the main forest functions were discussed. The Workshop was attended by some 90 senior scientists and agency representatives from East and West Europe, North America, Scandinavia and Japan. Great interest was shown by the ECE/FAO Team of Experts on Forest Decline whose representatives attended as observers. The Team of Experts held a special Committee Meeting in connection with the results achieved. In addition to presentations of some 60 papers on forest decline, the Workshop organizers and a number of key speakers prepared a set of resolutions that were adopted by the Workshop participants. Briefly, the resolutions call for reductions of air pollutant emissions, improved monitoring of the extent and growth rate of forest decline, more research in specific areas, and increased international cooperation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Bio-indication</b> is only {{possible}} because algal communities respond to environmental {{changes in a}} consistent way. In particular, the vectors of algal changes over latitudes and altitudes are well correlated with respective climatic gradients. The relationships between biotic and climatic changes are insufficiently studied so far, but regularities are analyzable provided the adequate geographic scale. Thus the impact of seasonality requires ecological study of the aquatic object as a whole or a considerable part of it. For the gradient analysis of altitudinal changes the sampling data must cover a region of diverse relief, whereas latitudinal gradients are traceable of sizeable parts of continents encompassing different climatic zones. In our studies, the impact of temperature changes is invariably significant when revealed {{with the help of}} <b>bio-indication</b> analysis. In the boreal realm, algal development most typically show three seasonal peaks correlated with the dynamics of ice cover, whereas two to single peak are distinguished down the latitudes.

40|$|The {{increasing}} contamination by micropollutants in freshwater {{systems has}} become a major problem in modern societies, giving rise to toxicological, sanitary and economical concerns. In 2010 the French government adopted a plan for a 50 % reduction over 10 years in the use of pesticides which promotes research on contamination monitoring. Diatom <b>bio-indication</b> tools in rivers have been standardized and normalized (AFNOR NFT 90 354; CEN – EN 13946 & EN 14407) and are adapted to assess nutrient and organic matter levels. However these indicators do not assess micropollutants contamination despite diatoms being known to be sensitive to pesticide pollution. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess whether bio-indicators based on diatom communities could be developed to assess the impact of pesticide contamination, especially herbicides, on freshwater ecosystems quality. The hypothesis that increasing herbicide concentration reduces diatom diversity wastested on a diatom data set from the French Water Framework Directive monitoring network.

Metabolic {{fingerprinting}} for <b>bio-indication</b> {{of nitrogen}} responses in Calluna vulgaris heath communities. Metabolomics, 1, (3), 279 - 285. Sponsorship: BBSRC/NERCIncreased atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) {{over the last}} 50 years {{is known to have}} led to deleterious effects on the health of Calluna vulgaris heathland, with increased proliferation of grasses and loss of species diversity. However, currently it is difficult to attribute damage specifically to N deposition rather than other drivers of change such as inappropriate management. Metabolic fingerprinting using FT-IR offers a rapid, cost-effective and ?holistic? means for quantifying foliar biochemistry responses specifically to N deposition. To test the potential of this approach we used a long term lowland heath N addition study in Chesire, England. FT-IR spectra of treated C. vulgaris shoot material showed that responses were detectable above 20 kg N ha? 1 year? 1. Differentiation was also evident in C. vulgaris metabolic fingerprints due to additional watering. We have shown that FT-IR is able to identify biochemical variations in C. vulgaris related to increases in received N and water.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a new bio-indicator method for assessing wetland ecosystem health; as such, {{the study is}} particularly relevant to current legislation such as the EU Water Framework Directive, which provides a baseline of {{the current status of}} surface waters. Seven wetland sites were monitored across northern Britain, with model construction data for predicting eco-hydrological relationships collected from five sites during 1999. Two new sites and one repeat site were monitored during 2000 to provide model test data. The main growing season for the vegetation, and hence the sampling period, was May?August during both years. Seasonal mean concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 -) in surface and soil water samples during 1999 ranged from 0. 01 to 14. 07 mg N l ? 1, with a mean value of 1. 01 mg N l ? 1. During 2000, concentrations ranged from trace level (? 1) to 9. 43 mg N l ? 1, with a mean of 2. 73 mg N l? - 1. Surface and soil-water nitrate concentrations did not influence plant species composition significantly across representative tall herb fen and mire communities. Predictive relationships were found between nitrate concentrations and structural characteristics of the wetland vegetation, and a model was developed which predicted nitrate concentrations from measures of plant diversity, canopy structure and density of reproductive structures. Two further models, which predicted stem density and density of reproductive structures respectively, utilised nitrate concentration as one of the independent predictor variables. The models were tested where appropriate using data collected during 2000. This approach is complementary to species-based monitoring, representing a useful and simple tool to assess ecological status in target wetland systems and has potential for <b>bio-indication</b> purposes.

40|$|The {{survival}} of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) depends on the protection and preservation of the suitable biotypes {{that is why it}} is necessary to know its requirements for environmental conditions. This species indicates the quality of suitable biotypes with its specific requirements for food and environment. During its life, the freshwater pearl mussel is undergoing complicated development cycle and in each phase it has different requirements for food. In the juvenile phase, it is very sensitive to quality of environment as well as quality and composition of its food, which consists of organogenic detritus, which is mainly decomposed mass of vegetable and animal origin together with bacteria. Its food arises in river basin areas as well as in river spring areas-from where it is carried downstream by a river and so pearl mussels may ingest it filtering the water. This highly specialized species that is sensitive to environmental changes, especially within its juvenile life phase, is very important as to its bio-indicating ability. The experimental part of this work was focused on the evaluation of the detritus carrying-capacity performed by the <b>bio-indication</b> method ex-situ in a laboratory out of its natural environment. For evaluating the carrying-capacity and quality of the tested detritus under optimal temperature conditions ex-situ for 10 days, there were used juvenile pearl mussels from a semi-natural breeding.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{incorporate}} genomics {{data into}} environmental assessments a mechanistic perspective of interactions between chemicals and induced biological processes {{needs to be}} developed. Since chemical compounds with structural similarity often induce comparable biological responses in exposed animals, gene expression signatures {{can serve as a}} starting point for the assessment of chemicals and their toxicity, but only when relevant and stable gene panels are available. To design such a panel, we isolated differentially expressed gene fragments from the soil arthropod Folsomia candida, a species often used for ecotoxicological testing. Animals were exposed to two chemically distinct compounds, being a metal (cadmium) and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (phenanthrene). We investigated the affected molecular responses resulting from either treatment and developed and validated 44 qPCR assays for their responses using a high throughput nano-liter RT-qPCR platform for the analysis of the samples. Results Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to retrieve stress-related gene fragments. SSH libraries revealed pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and protein degradation for cadmium and biotransformation for phenanthrene to be overrepresented. Amongst a small cluster of SSH-derived cadmium responsive markers were an inflammatory response protein and an endo-glucanase. Conversely, cytochrome P 450 family 6 or 9 was specifically induced by phenanthrene. Differential expressions of these candidate biomarkers were also highly significant in the independently generated test sample set. Toxicity levels in different training samples were not reflected by any of the markers' intensity of expressions. Though, a model based on partial least squares differential analysis (PLS-DA) (with RMSEPs between 9 and 22 % and R 2 s between 0. 82 and 0. 97) using gene expressions of 25 important qPCR assays correctly predicted the nature of exposures of test samples. Conclusions For the application of molecular <b>bio-indication</b> in environmental assessments, multivariate analyses obviously have an added value over univariate methods. Our results suggest that compound discrimination can be achieved by PLS-DA, based on a hard classification of the within-class rankings of samples from a test set. This study clearly shows that the use of high throughput RT-qPCR could be a valuable tool in ecotoxicology combining high throughput with analytical sensitivity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) {{comprises}} {{a fairly}} well-studied invertebrate taxon. The {{body of knowledge}} that has been acquired, especially on butterflies, allows for more convincing assessments {{of the significance of}} species distributions, for example assessments of rarity and endemism. In spite of their taxonomically well-known status, {{little is known about the}} different ranges and limiting factors controlling habitat specificity amongst species at a local scale. Aiming at ensuring more efficient and inclusive conservation planning for new developments and for rehabilitation of disturbed areas this study focused on the identification of species specific and local scale (biotopic) microhabitat attractants. This was done by identifying and classifying locally occurring butterflies in the context of small scale habitat preferences on a spatial and temporal scale taking into account correlations in distributions of butterflies, plants and bio-physical gradients. Results were compared to previous studies to evaluate the use of recorded species as bio-indicators. The methodology entailed the use of twelve 250 m fixed belt transects that were sampled in alternating directions across four sites within the West Coast National Park. Seven sampling sessions were set out during four sampling months mainly during the summer of the 2006 / 07 season. Sampling was conducted through visual observations while walking transects at a constant pace. Distributional variation between species was observed within a relatively small area with limited apparent variation in vegetation, topography and altitude. Pronounced temporal variation and correlation between butterfly species distribution and microhabitats were observed although this is strongly linked to the scale of the study in relation to the species studied. Factors that will affect the choice of microhabitat across time include amongst others: the prevailing sex ratio, temperature and the presence of invasive ants. The influence of plant distribution in predicting butterfly species distribution seemed to be less important. Myrmecophilous butterflies could probably play some role in <b>bio-indication</b> although much more work needs to be done to confirm this. The identification of stepping stone sites with optimum microhabitats during the environmental assessment phase in areas with endangered butterfly species should determine the face of the development and not the other way around.
