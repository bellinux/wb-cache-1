50|$|A <b>bill</b> <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by a Governor-General or colonial Governor {{would pass}} into law, but {{might still be}} {{disallowed}} by the King or Queen in Council, usually within a certain timeframe after its passage. Once notice of the disallowance was communicated to the colonial authorities, the Act in question would cease to operate as law. Disallowance was not retroactive, so anything validly done under an Act's terms before its disallowance remained legal.|$|R

5000|$|In debate {{during the}} third reading, on 25 and 26 March, Senator Joan Fraser said that the Canadian {{parliament}} was being asked <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> a <b>bill</b> passed by a foreign parliament, the final form of which {{had not yet been}} seen, and that the Canadian <b>bill</b> was <b>to</b> give <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bill</b> [...] "laid before" [...] the parliament at Westminster, which had been amended since first presented there. Fraser commented that when the Senate had given the bill third reading, she would take that as formal notification that assent was being given to the bill eventually passed in Westminster, {{but it would have been}} preferable if Canada had done as Australia and New Zealand were doing: instead of passing a <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> another parliament's legislation, they were passing their own, standalone legislation, thereby asserting that the monarch of each country is whomever each country's laws determines it to be.|$|R
50|$|Senator Serge Joyal {{responded by}} saying that <b>Bill</b> C-53 <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> the British <b>bill</b> by its title, not all its clauses. He argued that the legal force of a bill is {{essentially}} a legislative intention, to which some precision can be given, as had been done through the amendments made to the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012 by the British parliament. The original intention approved {{by all of the}} 16 prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms had not been altered, but instead made more precise.|$|R

The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 25 July 2016. The Rajya Sabha passed the Bill on 2nd, August 2016. The <b>Bill</b> was <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by the President of India on 9 August 2016 and a Gazette Notification was published on 10 August 2016.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the <b>bills</b> awaiting <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|R
50|$|Hopetoun also notably {{exercised}} {{influence over}} the content and passage of the Immigration Restriction Bill of 1901. Instructions from the Colonial Office revealed that in its original form, the bill was unacceptable to the British government, and Hopetoun was instructed <b>to</b> reserve Royal <b>Assent</b> until changes had been made. Hopetoun was left in a difficult position, as fears of immigration were rampant in Australia {{at the time and}} the bill was popular, notwithstanding the disapproval of the British government. A difficult period of private manoeuvring followed, after which Hopetoun was obliged <b>to</b> reserve <b>assent</b> on further amendments to the bill in the absence of instructions from London in an attempt to balance the interests of the Commonwealth and the Colonial Office. Eventually, important concessions were made by the Barton government and the <b>bill</b> was <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by Hopetoun, although still not completely in line with imperial policy. Hopetoun's use of the <b>assent</b> power <b>to</b> negotiate changes in Commonwealth legislation was effective and skilfully deployed so as to avoid public confrontation over the issue.|$|R
25|$|Despite the opposition, the High Court of Parliament Bill {{was forced}} through Parliament. It {{was passed by}} the House of Assembly on 15 May 1952 and by the Senate on 27 May. A {{petition}} asking the Governor-General <b>to</b> withhold <b>assent</b> was rejected and the <b>bill</b> was <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> on 3 June. The Speaker of the House of Assembly was nominated as President of the High Court of Parliament, and he appointed a Judicial Committee of six government members and four opposition members, with , the Minister of Justice, as chairman. The opposition members resigned before the first meeting of the committee on 21 July 1952. After three days of hearings the committee recommended the reversal of the Appellate Division's ruling and the validation of the Separate Representation of Voters Act. The High Court of Parliament, which consisted only of Nationalist members of Parliament due to an opposition boycott, approved this recommendation on 27 August.|$|R
50|$|With some exceptions, a law is {{made when}} a bill is passed by both houses and has {{received}} royal assent from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, which is deemed given if the <b>bill</b> is not <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> {{within 30 days}} of presentation. The Dewan Rakyat's passage of a bill is not required {{if it is a}} money bill (which includes taxation bills). For all other bills passed by the Dewan Rakyat which are not Constitutional amendment bills, the Dewan Rakyat has the power to veto any amendments to bills made by the Dewan Negara and to override any defeat of such bills by the Dewan Negara.|$|R
50|$|National Referenda {{are governed}} by the Constitution. The Constitution {{provides}} that the a simple majority {{of the total number}} of votes cast and counted shall be required for a referendum to be adopted, however results are subject to review and confirmation by the Election Commission. Referenda may be initiated by the king if, in his opinion, a bill that fails in a joint sitting of Parliament is of national importance; if Parliament likewise insists on the passage of a <b>bill</b> not <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by the king; or if an appeal is made by not less than fifty percent {{of the total number of}} members of all Dzongkhag Tshogdus. A National Referendum may not be held regarding taxes or any other grounds as might be prescribed by law made by Parliament, and a Referendum may not be withdrawn once initiated. Referenda are approved by a simple majority. The Constitution further mandates Parliament to prescribe the procedure for holding a National Referendum, which it has done; as of 2011, the National Referendum Act is available only in Dzongkha, however.|$|R
50|$|In the Province of Canada, {{responsible}} {{government was}} introduced with {{the ministry of}} Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine and Robert Baldwin in spring 1848; it was {{put to the test}} in 1849, when Reformers in the legislature passed the Rebellion Losses Bill. This was a law that provided compensation to French-Canadians who suffered losses during the Rebellions of 1837-1838 in Lower-Canada. The Governor General, Lord Elgin, had serious misgivings about the <b>bill</b> but nonetheless <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> it despite demands from the Tories that he refuse to do so. Elgin was physically assaulted by an English-speaking mob for this, and the Montreal Parliament building was burned to the ground in the ensuing riots. Nonetheless, the Rebellion Losses Bill helped entrench responsible government into Canadian politics.|$|R
50|$|In July 1860, Cass {{resigned}} {{both from}} the Executive Council and his council membership due to ill health. He was re-appointed to the Executive Council on 10 November 1863 by the third Superintendent, Samuel Bealey, during his leadership crisis, but most of his executive (including Cass) resigned on 4 December 1863. Bealey was succeeded by Moorhouse in May 1866, and Cass {{was appointed to the}} Executive Council on 8 June 1866. Cass remained on the executive until 14 December 1866. Immediately after his departure, the Provincial Council discussed an honorarium for Cass, who had signalled his intention to retire as chief surveyor due to his chronic asthma. The Cass Pension <b>Bill</b> 1867 was <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by the Superintendent in mid-January of that year, which gave Cass an annual honorarium of £250.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{delivery}} of the Budget Statement in Parliament, Members of Parliament {{also known as the}} Committee of Supply will debate on the statement and the proposed Budget for the following financial year. Upon approval, the Parliament will give its approval by passing the Supply <b>Bill.</b> <b>Assent</b> by the President of Singapore will then be sought to allow the Bill to come into effect. Once the President gives its <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> the Supply <b>Bill,</b> it is then enacted as law known as the Supply Act. The Supply Act controls the Government’s spending in the following financial year.|$|R
25|$|At about 5:00pm, the {{governor}} gave the royal <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> the <b>bill</b> in the Legislative Council room, {{in the presence}} of members of both houses of Parliament. Since he was already in town, {{the governor}} decided <b>to</b> also give <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> some forty one other bills passed by the houses and awaiting <b>to</b> be <b>assented.</b> Among those <b>bills</b> was the Rebellion Losses <b>Bill.</b> The <b>assent</b> of this law seemed to take some people by surprise, and the galleries where some visitors were standing became agitated.|$|R

500|$|One {{reading of}} Article 14(2) {{is that in}} order to {{restrict}} the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association, Parliament must impose the restrictions by passing written laws, that is, Acts of Parliament, since it exercises the legislative power of Singapore by passing <b>bills</b> that are <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by the President. However, in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1990), a case involving defamation law, the Court of Appeal took a much broader approach. The Court noted that according to Article 2(1), law in Article 14(2) includes the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore. In May 1963, the Parliament of Malaysia had enacted the Malaysia Act 1963, which extended the Defamation Act 1957 to Singapore, then a state in the Federation of Malaysia. Since the Act, now the , was premised on common law rules of the tort of defamation, the Court held that the Legislature had [...] "clearly intended that the common law relating to defamation, as modified by the Act, should continue to apply in Singapore". Thus, it is [...] "manifestly beyond argument that Art 14(1)(a) is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Act".|$|R
500|$|According to Article 109 of the constitution: [...] "The King {{sanctions}} and promulgates laws". In Belgium, the royal assent is called sanction royale / koninklijke bekrachtiging (Royal Sanction), and is {{granted by the}} King signing the proposed statute. The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives. The monarch promulgates the law, meaning {{that he or she}} formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In 1990, when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the Council of Ministers, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The <b>bill</b> was then <b>assented</b> <b>to</b> by all members of the Council of Ministers [...] "on behalf of the Belgian People". In a joint meeting, both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.|$|R

50|$|The power <b>to</b> {{withhold}} royal <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bills</b> is controversial.
