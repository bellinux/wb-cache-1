50|$|In March, Walker {{offered a}} {{compromise}} to keep certain collective bargaining rights {{in place for}} state workers. Workers {{would be able to}} continue bargaining over their salaries with no limit as well as allowing collective bargaining to stay in place on mandatory overtime, performance bonuses, hazardous duty pay and classroom size for teachers. The Democratic Senators rejected the proposals as an inadequate compromise. The day after Democrats rejected Walker's compromise, Republicans held a joint Assembly-Senate committee meeting to discuss quorum requirements. The Senate requires a quorum to take up any measures that spend money, however by removing parts of the bill related to money, they had discovered a way to <b>bypass</b> the <b>chamber's</b> missing Democrats. After the meeting, the Senate passed the legislation 18-1. The next day, the Wisconsin Assembly passed the collective bargaining bill with a vote of 53-42.|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{representations}} of the Russian government on the main problems of the Orthodox Church {{in the early twentieth}} century. The ﬁ rst Russian revolution of 1905 - 1907 led to the proclamation of the principle of freedom of conscience, which must be reconciled with the maintaining principle of the dominant Church. For political reasons, the government embarked on a search for union with the Old Believers, but the Church was against this trend. The procurator of the Holy Synod P. P. Izvolsky tried to defend its interests in the government, but rarely found support. Meanwhile, Stolypin`s government feared complications of their relationship with the Synod. The government originally set itself the task of fully implement all the principles of the decree 17 April 1905. The revival of parish life was the main task in the ﬁeld of Church according to the government. This problem was more urgent as political stability was realized. These particular problems are identiﬁed the appointment of V. C. Sabler to oﬃ ce of the procurator of the Holy Synod. Sabler adjusted its policies in the confrontation with the III State Duma. It castigated the Synod and the alleged abolition of parochial schools. Sabler drafted a reform of the parish, which unlike Izvolsky and Duma`s projects did not imagine electing clergy, moreover, he retained bishop`s control over the parish council. Sabler developed parish reform, but its implementation is complicated by the opposition of the executive and legislative powers. However Sabler could not get consent from the Council of Ministers in carrying out reforms parish <b>bypassing</b> legislative <b>chambers.</b> Policy of the Council of Ministers are supported by the monarch, who used his supreme power by the prime minister or the procurator only in special cases. ...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] ultraphyric basalts (PUBs) have been sampled along most mid-ocean ridges with ultraslow to intermediate spreading rates. Over the past 40 years, the prevalent models for their origin assume positive buoyancy of plagioclase in basaltic liquids resulting in selective concentration of plagioclase phenocrysts by floatation. However, when the global population of PUB lavas is examined, this hypothesis becomes less compelling. PUB host lavas demonstrate a large range of compositions and densities, similar to aphyric glasses from the same ridge segments. Most importantly, the majority of PUB host liquids are less dense than their phenocryst cargo, meaning that plagioclase floatation within a magma chamber cannot be the driving force for phenocryst enrichment. Furthermore, PUB lavas have never been sampled on axis at fast-spreading centers or from locations with noted contemporaneous axial magma chambers, where PUBs should be abundant if plagioclase is buoyant in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). Instead, we argue that the high modal abundance of plagioclase results from interaction between magma and preexisting zones of crystal cumulates within the lower crust, possibly followed by loss of olivine during magma ascent. PUBs erupt when the magma maintains an ascent velocity greater than the settling rate of the plagioclase phenocrysts, which precludes long crustal residence times for these magmas. In addition to being a proxy for lower spreading rates, our findings also suggest that PUB eruption can also be used as a proxy for the absence of a magma chamber or transport through a conduit system that <b>bypassed</b> an axial <b>chamber...</b>|$|R
