40|$|Abstract: For tactile-haptical {{feedback}} in {{minimally invasive}} surgery, a tactile actuator array consisting of 8 x 8 actuators is being built. The system {{is combined with}} a tactile optical sensor system mounted in a laparoscopic forceps, providing 8 X 8 signals. These signals have to be shown as a true-scale representation through the actuator array. Therefore each peasured pressure signal is coded into a corresponding actuating displacement. Each actuator {{is made out of}} a SMA-spring conditioned with the one way effect. The SMA spring works against a bias spring and both are mounted on an electrically isolated <b>base</b> <b>pin.</b> The bias spring produces a linear rising force against the SMA-spring for resetting the actuator during the passive cooling time. The whole actuator has a diameter of 1. 6 mm, a length of 25 mm and is mounted at a distance of 3. 2 mm from the next actuator. The resulting force of a single actuator while pressing against the surgeon's fingertip is over 2. 5 N, and the actuating displacement is about 3. 5 mm. Each pin has analogue adjustment and can be stopped at all positions within these 3. S mm deflection. The resetting time is about 10 seconds and is reached with 3 fans mounted on three sides of the actuator array. The aim is to build a minimally invasive palpation system so that the surgeon can 'feel ' with his laparoscopic forceps. 1...|$|E
5000|$|The loctal tube's {{structure}} was supported {{directly by the}} connecting pins passing through the glass [...] "button" [...] base. Octal tube structures were supported on a glass [...] "pinch", formed by heating {{the bottom of the}} envelope to fusing temperature, then squeezing the pinch closed. Sealing the pinch embedded the connecting wires in the pinch's glass and gave a vacuum-tight seal. The connecting wires then passed through the hollow <b>base</b> <b>pins,</b> where they were soldered to make permanent connections.|$|R

40|$|We present {{infrared}} transmittance {{and reflection}} modulation spectra {{for changes in}} the reverse bias voltage across a variety of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) <b>based</b> <b>pin</b> and min solar cells and diodes. The spectra originate with the change in charge state of levels near the two intrinsic-layer interfaces. The spectra vary significantly for differing interfaces, and we therefore propose their application to ex situ monitoring of the interfaces in solar cell manufacturing. The measurements also support the model that phosphorus doping occurs through dopant complex formation at the concentrations commonly used for solar cell fabrication...|$|R

We compared the power density under solar illumination calculated with this model with published results for as-deposited a-Si:H solar cells. The agreement is within 4 % for a range of thicknesses, suggesting that the power from as-deposited cells is close to the bandtail limit...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} computer calculations to explore {{effects of the}} p/i interface on the open-circuit voltage in a-Si:H <b>based</b> <b>pin</b> solar cells. The principal conclusions are that interface limitation can occur for values of VOC significantly below the built-in potential of VBI of a cell, and that the effects can {{be understood in terms}} of thermionic emission of electrons from the intrinsic layer into the p-layer. We compare measurements of VOC and electroabsorption estimates of VBI with the model calculations. We conclude that p/i interface limitation is important for current a-Si:H based cells, and that the conduction band offset between the p and i layers {{is as important as the}} built-in potential for future improvements to VOC...|$|R

40|$|When a user {{enters a}} {{personal}} identification number (PIN) into an automated teller machine or a point of sale terminal, {{there is a risk}} of some one watching from behind, trying to guess the PIN code. Such shoulder-surfing is a major security threat. In order to overcome this problem different PIN entry methods have been suggested. In this regard, gaze interaction methods are receiving attention in recent years, owing to the lowering cost of eye tracking technology. In this paper, we present SafetyPIN - an eye tracking <b>based</b> <b>PIN</b> entry system - which is aimed at making the PIN entry more secure {{with the help of an}} eye tracking device.

40|$|We present {{computer}} modeling for {{effects of}} the p/i interface upon the open-circuit voltage VOC in amorphous silicon <b>based</b> <b>pin</b> solar cells. We show that the modeling is consistent with measurements on the intensitydependence for the interface effect, and we present an interpretation for the modeling based on thermionic emission of electrons over the electrostatic barrier at the p/i interface. We present additional modeling of the relation of VOC with the intrinsic layer bandgap EG. The experimental correlation for optimized cells is VOC = (EG/e) - 0. 79. The correlation is simply explained if VOC in these cells {{is determined by the}} intrinsic layer, and in particular by the (variable) bandgap and by a nonvarying valence bandtail width (about 48 meV) of this layer...|$|R
50|$|The railway route Bangkok-Chiang Mai {{had been}} {{designed}} to avoid the Khun Tan Mountains, a barrier between Lampang and Lamphun. The tunnel was built ease trade barriers between the northern and central provinces. Surveys for the tunnel route were started in 1905. Construction began in 1907. First, <b>base</b> <b>pins</b> were set up at a level behind the mountain aligned with the tunnel route so that the tunnel could be blasted to the width needed. Then air compressors were used to drill through the mountain. If these air compressors broke down, then metal chisels were hammered into the rock, explosives inserted and then the rock was blasted {{to make way for}} track-laying. The tunnel was finished in 1918 and remains in daily use.|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{for reducing the}} vibration sensitivity of laser-stabilizing optical reference cavities is based upon an improved design and mounting method for the cavity, wherein the cavity is mounted vertically. It is suspended at one plane, around the spacer cylinder, equidistant from the mirror ends of the cavity. The suspension element is a collar of an extremely low thermal expansion coefficient material, which surrounds the spacer cylinder and contacts it uniformly. Once the collar has been properly located, it is cemented in place so that the spacer cylinder is uniformly supported and {{does not have to}} be squeezed at all. The collar also includes a number of cavities partially bored into its lower flat surface, around the axial bore. These cavities are support points, into which mounting <b>base</b> <b>pins</b> will be inserted. Hence the collar is supported at a minimum of three points...|$|R
