Travel 2.0 model allow user {{to create their own}} contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites. The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities. For example, TripAdvisor is an online travel community which enables user to rate and share autonomously their reviews and feedbacks on hotels and tourist destinations. Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior. Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools {{have a significant impact on}} travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from <b>business-to-customer</b> marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we suggest}} a secure and {{cost-effective}} fuzzy access control protocol in mobile cloud computing. It is especially designed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) providing <b>business-to-customers</b> services. Our protocol allows the SME to outsource its services to a cloud {{to reduce the}} running cost. At the same time, {{it does not require}} any communication between the cloud and the SME during user authentication stage. That is, SME can be offline after users have been registered. Users directly deal with the cloud for gaining access. This helps the SME to save a lot of resources, including a large bandwidth connecting with the cloud and a strong firewall system. Meanwhile, the user database never leaves the SME. In addition, our protocol can withstand common attacks such as dictionary attacks for server and phishing attacks for client. Our security protection is especially important for mobile users as mobile devices are easily exposed to such attacks. Furthermore, our protocol provides user traceability to SME and it is very efficient for mobile devices.

40|$|The extant {{literature}} {{provides a}} limited {{understanding of the}} role of customer-based corporate reputation (CBR) in <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships. Cognitive CBR and affective CBR are two distinct attitudinal components of CBR. However, research into CBR largely neglects to test the separate effects of both CBR components on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships. In particular, the affective aspects of CBR have been underrated in comparison with the cognitive aspects of CBR in the conceptualization of CBR as a whole. The underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions {{of the effects of the}} CBR components on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships also invite researchers’ attention to better explain how these effects operate and how different circumstances influence these effects. This study, therefore, distinguishes between both the cognitive and affective components of CBR to investigate their relative effects on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships, and examines the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions of such effects. For this purpose, customer trust, customer commitment, intentional loyalty, and customer perceived risk are adopted as representative constructs of <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships, from the existing literature. This study developed a conceptual model comprising of 21 hypotheses representing the inter-construct effects. Quantitative methodology was adopted to test the model. For this purpose, a systematic sample of 1059 customers was surveyed from the fast-food services industry in Pakistan. By disentangling the effects of CBR on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships, this study makes several theoretical contributions. First, this study reveals that cognitive CBR and affective CBR have differential effects on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships. Second, this study extends the application of social exchange theory into the areas of corporate reputation and <b>business-to-customer</b> exchanges by identifying that the underrated affective component of CBR has a strong impact on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships. Third, this study explicates the mechanisms through which CBR affects <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships, by analysing the role of mediating factors that explain the effects of both CBR components on intentional loyalty. Fourth, this study finds relationship age as an important moderator (i. e. boundary condition) for the effects of CBR on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships. Fifth, drawing on the international business perspective, this study theorizes and tests the moderating effects of firm type (local versus MNEs) for the impacts of CBR components on <b>business-to-customer</b> relationships. The findings help the service providers to better understand the ways in which CBR may affect their relationship marketing activities. The findings also suggest some useful implications in the areas of integrated marketing communication, customer segmentation, and international business management...|$|E
