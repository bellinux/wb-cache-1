25|$|When <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born,</b> {{they are}} kept indoors {{for seven days}} because Ghanaians {{believe that this is}} the period in which they are most {{vulnerable}} to both physical and spiritual harm. During this period, it is believed that the child is wandering between the spiritual and physical world and may decide {{to go back to the}} spiritual world at any point. They are known as strangers until the end of the seven days when they are acknowledged and welcomed into society with an elaborate naming ceremony, or outdooring ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> head first; however about 4% {{are born}} feet or buttock first, known as breech. During labour {{a woman can}} {{generally}} eat and move around as she likes, but pushing is not recommended during the first stage or during delivery of the head, and enemas are not recommended. While making a cut {{to the opening of}} the vagina, known as an episiotomy is common, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by a surgical procedure known as Caesarean section. Caesarean sections may be recommended for twins, signs of distress in the baby, or breech position. This method of delivery can take longer to heal from.|$|E
25|$|The {{disorder}} affects all genders but is {{more prevalent}} in certain ethnicities and age groups. 20 people die per year causing thalassemia to be listed as a “rare disease”. In the United States, thalassemia’s prevalence is approximately 1 in 272,000 or 1,000 people. There have been 4,000 hospitalized cases in England in 2002 and 9,233 consultant episodes for thalassemia. Men accounted for 53% of hospital consultant episodes and women accounted for 47%. The mean patient age is 23 with only 1% of consultants the patient is older than 75 and 69% were 15-59 year olds. The Children’s Hospital Oakland formed an international network to combat thalassemia. “It is the world’s most common genetic blood disorder and is rapidly increasing”. 7% of the world’s population are carriers and 400,000 <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> with the trait annually. It is usually fatal in infancy if blood transfusion are not initiated immediately.|$|E

25|$|There are {{large-scale}} {{shortages of}} facilities across Philippine public schools - these include classrooms, teachers, desks and chairs, textbooks, and audio-video materials. According to 2003 Department of Education Undersecretary Juan Miguel Luz, reportedly over 17 million students {{are enrolled in}} Philippine public schools, and at an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, about 1.7 million <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> every year which means {{that in a few}} years time, more individuals will assert ownership over their share of the (limited) educational provisions. To sum it up, there are too many students and too little resources. Albeit the claims the government makes on increasing the allocated budget for education, there is a prevalent difficulty the public school system faces with regard to shortages. Furthermore, state universities and colleges gradually raise tuition so as to have a means of purchasing facilities, thus making tertiary education difficult to access or more often than not, inaccessible to the poor. However, it is worth taking note of what the Aquino administration has done in its five years of governance with regard to classroom-building - the number of classrooms built from 2005 to {{the first half of the}} year 2010 has tripled. Additionally, the number of classrooms that were put up from the year 2010 to February 2015 was recorded to be at 86,478, significantly exceeding the 17,305 classrooms that were built from 2005 to 2010 and adequate enough to counterbalance the 66,800 classroom deficit in the year 2010.|$|E
500|$|Teeth {{are among}} the most {{distinctive}} (and long-lasting) features of mammal species. Humans, like other mammals, are diphyodont, meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set (called the [...] "baby", [...] "milk", [...] "primary", or [...] "deciduous" [...] set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> with one or more visible teeth, known as natal teeth.

Muskrat populations appear to go through a regular pattern of rise and dramatic decline spread over a six- to 10-year period. Some other rodents, including famously the muskrat's close relatives the lemmings, go through the same type of population changes.|$|E

2500|$|Addiction to any substance, {{including}} crack, {{may be a}} {{risk factor}} for child abuse or neglect. Crack addiction, like other addictions, distracts parents from the child and leads to inattentive parenting. Mothers who continue to use drugs once their <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> have trouble forming the normal parental bonds, more often interacting with their babies with a detached, unenthusiastic, flat demeanor. Conversely, low-stress environments and responsive caregiving may provide a protective effect on the child's brain, potentially compensating for negative effects of PCE.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{developing}} knowledge of a system as complex as natural language is learning to distinguish the important language-specific classes of sounds, called phonemes, that distinguish meaning between words. UBC psychologist Janet Werker, since her influential series of experiments in the 1980s, {{has been one of}} the most prominent figures in the effort to understand the process by which human babies develop these phonological distinctions. While adults who speak different languages are unable to distinguish meaningful sound differences in other languages that do not delineate different meanings in their own, <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> with the ability to universally distinguish all speech sounds. Werker's work has shown that while infants at six to eight months are still able to perceive the difference between certain Hindi and English [...] consonants, they have completely lost this ability by 11 to 13 months.|$|E

2500|$|Likewise, the 1951 Oregon statute prohibiting {{self-service}} gasoline lists 17 different justifications, {{including the}} flammability of gas, {{the risk of}} crime from customers leaving their vehicles, the toxic fumes emitted by gasoline, and the jobs created by requiring mini service. In addition, the [...] ban on self-service gasoline is {{seen as part of}} Oregonian culture. One commentator noted, [...] "The joke is when <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> in Oregon, the doctor slaps their bottom, 'No self-serve and no sales tax'... It's as much a cultural issue as an economic issue. It's a way of life." [...] However, recent years have shown that this opinion might be changing, as a 2014 Public Policy Poll showed that although self-serve was favored by a narrow margin of all Oregonians, Oregonians under 45 favored self-serve gas by 53 percent to 33 percent.|$|E
