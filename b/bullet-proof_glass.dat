5|$|The Brazilian {{team won}} the tournament {{for the third time}} in 1970, {{allowing}} them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro in a cabinet with a front of <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Manji has {{received}} numerous death threats. In a CNN interview, Manji {{stated that the}} windows of her apartment are fitted with <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass,</b> primarily {{for the protection of}} her family.|$|E
50|$|Buddha Attack: By {{reducing}} {{the diameter of}} his mouth when he uses the Katsu, Raionji can perform a Katsu which is five time more powerful and has five time the range of a usual Katsu. By using the Buddha Attack, Raionji can pierce <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hull {{was made}} of {{ballistic}} 10mm mild steel plate; front windscreen and side windows had 40mm <b>bullet-proof</b> laminated <b>glass.</b>|$|R
5000|$|German magician Ralf Bialla {{started to}} perform the bullet catch in the 1950s for a fee of 2,000 DM a performance. He wore <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glasses,</b> strong gloves on his hands with which he covered parts of his face, and his front teeth were made of steel. A [...]22 rifle was fired, and the bullet {{had to go through}} three glass panes before Bialla caught it with his teeth. He was seriously wounded nine times but survived. He was portrayed in the 1972 {{documentary}} film [...] "Wer schießt auf Ralf Bialla?". He died in 1975 after falling off a cliff, supposedly because of constant dizziness caused by the injuries.|$|R
25|$|Upon its {{arrival in}} Spain in September 1981, {{it was first}} {{displayed}} behind bomb-and <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> screens at the Casón del Buen Retiro in Madrid in time to celebrate the centenary of Picasso's birth, 25 October. The exhibition was visited by almost a {{million people in the}} first year. Since that time there has never been any attempted vandalism or other security threat to the painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{week before}} she arrived on campus, her mother {{published}} {{an open letter}} in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm. With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.|$|E
25|$|The two RUC {{officers}} were travelling without escort in Buchanan's personal unmarked car: a red Vauxhall Cavalier with {{the registration number}} KIB 1204 which was not armoured-plated and didn't have <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b> Buchanan had used this same car on all of his previous visits to Dundalk and other locations in the Republic of Ireland. Both {{officers were}} unarmed, as it was illegal to transport weapons into the Republic of Ireland, {{and they were in}} plain clothes. Buchanan drove away from the Dundalk Garda station after the meeting had ended at about 3.15 p.m. and turned off the main Dublin-Belfast road onto the Edenappa Road which is a minor rural road which passes through the village of Jonesborough. Buchanan was known by the British Army to regularly take this route when going to or from Dundalk Garda station.|$|E
50|$|To further aid the pilot's {{field of}} view, the unpressurised cockpit was mounted well {{forward in the}} {{fuselage}} and was housed under an aft-sliding perspex blister canopy. The three-panel windscreen was designed so that refraction through the panels meant {{that there were no}} obvious blind spots caused by the corner tie-rods; all three panels were <b>bullet-proof</b> laminated <b>glass.</b> An armour-plated bulkhead (hinged near the top to provide access {{to the back of the}} instrument panel and the rudder pedals), was part of the nose structure, with the pilot's back and head being protected by another armoured bulkhead built into the cockpit. Below and behind the cockpit floor was a bay housing the aircraft's principal armament of four 20 mm cannon, which had a maximum of 190 round per cannon which fired through short blast tubes. The Sea Hornet had a similar armament to its land-based counterparts.|$|R
25|$|A {{policy change}} {{resulted}} in the pressurised PR variant of the Mk VII being renamed PR Mk X (type 387). This version followed the PR Mk XI into production and {{was based on the}} Mk VII airframe with PR Mk XI wings and camera installation. It had the pressurised Mk VII cockpit, with the Lobelle sliding canopy, and retained the fighter style windscreen with the <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> panel. The long thin air intake to the cockpit pressurisation system was fitted under the exhaust stacks on the starboard cowling. The performance was {{similar to that of the}} PR XI although the pressurised cockpit meant that this version could stay at altitudes of over 40,000ft for longer without the exhausting physiological effects experienced by the pilots of unpressurised cockpits. Sixteen Mk Xs were built during April and May 1944, with the first mission being flown on 11 May. All saw limited service in 541 and 542 Squadrons in a high altitude reconnaissance role. Experience with this version led to the development and production of the pressurised version of the PR Mk XIX.|$|E
25|$|This IFV variant is {{essentially}} a Fahd 240, fitted with a dual-weapon turret that has a 12.7mm machine gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. The addition of a turret requires a third crewman, the gunner, {{but it does not}} affect the Fahd 240's passenger capacity. The turret is the French BTM-208 turret, produced under license from the French SAMM company. It is air-tight, and provides NBC protection. It incorporates and aiming telescopic periscope, forward–observation, rotating mirror periscope in co-axial alignment with weapons, and five or six <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> ports insuring all-round vision and ballistic protection. 200 rounds are provided for the 7.62mm machine gun, and another 100 for the 12.7mm machine gun. Elevation limits are -8 and +45, the turret provides 360 degrees of traversion for the weapons. The vehicle has a rotating seat, and an armored hatch for the turret. The machine guns can be fired by means of a foot pedal, freeing the gunner's hands. A central console groups control switches and warning lights governing weapon selection. The addition of a turret increases the vehicle height to 2.85 meters.|$|E
500|$|In April–May 2015, {{there were}} two Real IRA bomb attacks in Derry. One {{exploded}} at the Probation Board offices, and two partially exploded at the perimeter fence of a British Army Reserve base. Later in May, four men, one an alleged associate of Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, were reportedly arrested during an explosives seizure by police in Northern Ireland. In August, a firebomb exploded in a post van parked inside Palace Barracks, Holywood, a British military base which is home to MI5 in Northern Ireland. The firebomb destroyed the van and set nearby vehicles and garages on fire. On Halloween morning, three men were {{arrested and charged with}} IRA membership in addition to firearm offences. In November, a PSNI vehicle in Belfast was riddled with automatic gunfire, fired from an AK-47. [...] On Christmas Day in North Belfast, police came under fire again but were not injured. The attacker was charged with attempted murder. Days later, on 27 November 2015, police in West Belfast came under heavy fire yet again. No officers were wounded because of the armour-plating and <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b> The Real IRA or another dissident Republican group was suspected to be behind the attack.|$|E

2500|$|Once again, on September 6, 2008, Armenia and Turkey {{faced each}} other in a 2010 FIFA World Cup {{qualification}} match in Yerevan. In an unprecedented step, Turkish President Abdullah Gül was invited to watch the match, where he and his Armenia counterpart, Serzh Sargsyan, sat together, albeit behind <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b> However, the Turkish national anthem was almost drowned out by booing from 35,000 Armenian fans, showing there is still a lot of mistrust between the two countries. However, the gesture [...] "between the presidents showed that they believed 'football diplomacy' had achieved the most important result." [...] This was a first for the two countries divided by the legacy of the 20th century's first genocide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{portrait}} {{was executed}} on a fabric support of natural material constituted by two pieces (originally three) joined together. [...] The join is clearly visible as a seam passing {{from top to}} bottom, with the Virgin's face and hands {{and the head of}} the angel on the left piece. It passes through the left wrist of the Virgin. [...] The fabric is mounted on a large metal sheet to which it has been glued for some time. [...] The image, currently set in a massive frame protected behind <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass,</b> hangs inclined at a slight angle on the wall of the basilica behind the altar. [...] At this point, there is a wide gap between the wall and the sanctuary facilitating closer viewing from moving walkways set on the floor beneath the main level of the basilica, carrying people a short distance in either direction. [...] Viewed from the main body of the basilica, the image is located above and to the right of the altar and is retracted at night into a small vault (accessible by steps) set into the wall. [...] An intricate metal crown designed by the painter Salomé Pina according to plans devised by Rómulo Escudero and Pérez Gallardo, and executed by the Parisian goldsmith, Edgar Morgan, is fixed above the image by a rod, and a massive Mexican flag is draped around and below the frame.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviets {{stripped}} down their P-40s significantly for combat, {{in many cases}} removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40, which were superior {{to most of the}} Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: [...] "The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> and armored seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not have hand microphones but throat microphones. These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable." [...] The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. [...] VVS pilots usually flew the P-40 at War Emergency Power settings while in combat, bringing the acceleration and speed performance closer to that of their German rivals, but could burn out engines in a matter of weeks. They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines. A fair number of burnt out P-40s were re-engined with Soviet Klimov engines but these performed relatively poorly and were relegated to rear area use.|$|E

50|$|On {{display at}} the museum is the Academy Award that Shelley Winters won, and later donated to the museum, for her {{performance}} as Petronella van Daan in the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank. The award now sits in a <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> case in the museum.|$|E
5000|$|The Caravelle Hotel {{is located}} in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The hotel was {{opened to the public}} on Christmas Eve 1959, when the city was known as Saigon. Contemporary journalists noted its use of Italian marble, <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> and a “state-of-the-art {{air-conditioning}} system and a Berliet private generator.” ...|$|E
50|$|The Japanese ambassador's {{residence}} {{had been}} converted into a fortress by the Japanese government. It was surrounded by a 12-foot wall, and had grates on all windows, <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> in many windows, and doors built to withstand the impact of a grenade. It was, therefore, an easy site to defend from the inside.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Honey Pie, who {{has spent}} the night trapped in a store, is ambushed by one of the monsters. She manages to knock it out and uses its claws to make a hole in the <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> of the store's door. As she is getting out, the monster regains {{consciousness}} and starts to chase her down the street.|$|E
5000|$|Revolving doors {{can also}} be used as {{security}} devices to restrict entry to a single person at a time if the spacing between the doors is small enough. This is in contrast to a normal door which allows a second person to easily [...] "tailgate" [...] behind an authorized person. Extreme security can require <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mo Mowlam broke {{new ground}} {{when she opened}} the {{extensive}} grounds of the castle to the public. Previous Secretaries of State had not done so because of the fear of Provisional IRA attack. The security impact on the castle can be seen (top photo) in the presence of <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> in plastic frames in front of the Georgian windows at the public front of the building.|$|E
5000|$|The {{canopy of}} the cockpit is {{specially}} treated to prevent glare from the sun, and, as an additional option, a tanned version is also available for camouflage purposes, though this is not standard. The <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> of the canopy may be as thick as 38 millimeters, {{and is able to}} withstand direct hits from shrapnel and rounds fired from machine guns up to [...]50 caliber size.|$|E
50|$|The then Deputy Inspector General of Police, Baramulla {{range in}} the Kashmir Valley, Vaid {{suffered}} a severe hand injury in March 1999 when 25 militants ambushed his car and two escort gypsies on the national highway, {{on his way to}} Baramulla after a review meeting at Srinagar where he was officiating as Inspector General. The militants, aware that his car was bullet-proof, hurled hand-grenades and used powerful universal machine guns which pierce through <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass,</b> instead of the commonly used AK-47s.|$|E

5000|$|Lipman {{expanded}} his business to home security in 1973, initially in Memphis, Houston, New Haven, Connecticut and Concord, California. Meanwhile, he also {{expanded his}} business to patrolling entire neighborhoods, {{the first of}} which was Belle Meade, Tennessee. By then, he had 3,500 employees active in 35 cities across the United States. A decade later, in 1983, Lipman argued that neighborhood security guards needed [...] "walkies-talkies, close-circuit cameras, electronic fences, <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass,</b> card-key systems", but no guns, adding [...] "They are more of a threat to society by having a gun.".|$|E
50|$|To {{commemorate the}} 400th {{anniversary of the}} arrival of the shroud in Turin, it was {{displayed}} to the public in Turin from 27 August to 8 October 1978, with about 3 million visitors attending the exposition under <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b> For the next 5 days after the exposition the STURP team analyzed the shroud around the clock at the royal palace adjoining Turin Cathedral, some scientists sleeping while others worked. A team of European scientists headed by Luigi Gonella supervised the activities. The team gathered sticky tape samples of material from several points {{on the surface of the}} shroud.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} {{incidents}} {{of violence against}} The Namibians offices, leased from anti-apartheid activist and architect Kerry McNamara, {{in the weeks after}} its foundation. Shooting at the building necessitated the installation of <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass,</b> and there were several firebombing and teargassing attacks. The newspaper offices were attacked by the Afrikaner Wit Wolwe vigilante group in October 1988. The newspapers offices were almost burned down. South Africas Civil Co-operation Bureau planned to poison editor Lister, the newspaper was boycotted by the white business community, and [...] "journalists and sympathisers" [...] of The Namibian were denied entry in shops all over the country.|$|E
50|$|The Plate Glass Group traced {{its roots}} to a British {{immigrant}} and entrepreneur who, in 1897, established a plate glass manufacturing operation in Cape Town, South Africa. Eventually the company became a leading producer {{of safety and}} <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass</b> for automobiles. In 1987 the company launched a new subsidiary in the United States in partnership with SAB and Anglo American. When Glass medic, a US-based windshield repair and replacement company, was acquired in 1990, the South African parent company merged the subsidiaries under the name Belron International. Belron became a base from which to launch further acquisitions. When SAB purchased Plate Glass in 1992, it was renamed Shatterprufe Limited.|$|E
50|$|The raiders {{planned to}} gain access through a window {{overlooking}} a courtyard at {{the centre of the}} office block, believing it would not be adequately protected as it was an old building. The raid was to last 8 minutes if all went to plan but it all began to unravel as it became clear the bank was protected by <b>bullet-proof</b> <b>glass.</b> To break the window, first a sledgehammer and a battering ram were used and then 113 shots were fired at the window with automatic weapons. During this time the employees escaped before seven gunmen finally gained access to the ground floor of the Nokas building.|$|E
