500|$|The {{audience}} reacted immediately; Charles {{could feel}} the room shaking and bouncing as the crowd was dancing. Many audience members approached Charles {{at the end of}} the show to ask where they could purchase the record. Charles and the orchestra performed it again several nights in a row with the same reaction at each show. He called Jerry Wexler to say he had something new to record, later writing, [...] "I don't believe in giving myself advance notices, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> this song merited it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. Probably I was surly--and foolish. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> {{there had}} to be ONE man in town {{independent}} enough to sass the banker!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I {{could afford}} it. I own some {{telephone}} stock, you know, so I may get {{part of that}} investment back. They have their own cows, and chickens—as Beth truly says—and any morning they can pick oranges and grapefruit from their own trees for breakfast.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm {{no expert}} on the Appalachians at all, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> there are {{similarities}} -- the economy and some traditions, logging and mining. So, as a songwriter, you focus on that. You take the human struggle to survive, particularly in a beautiful place they love, and you've pinned down a lot of artistic inspiration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you're talking," [...] and Steel smote a {{dilapidated}} saddle until the dust leaped forth from it. [...] "The law on debt liens is mighty mixed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> {{that the man}} who can keep hold has the best of it. Jacques, Gordon, and the rest will stand by us solid, and I'd work two years for nothing to get a fair chance at Lane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘The speculations of an Angular man,’ resumed Mr. Grewgious, {{still sitting}} and {{speaking}} exactly as before, ‘are probably erroneous on so globular a topic. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> to myself (subject, as before, to Mr. Edwin’s correction), {{that there can}} be no coolness, no lassitude, no doubt, no indifference, no half fire and half smoke state of mind, in a real lover. Pray am I at all near the mark in my picture?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We wrecked our canoe in a {{rapid and}} lost all the grub. There was some trouble about it, {{and when the}} others turned back to make the cache I allowed I'd follow you. Missed your trail once or twice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> on the line you'd take {{and picked it up}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I don't exactly know, but I have my views. I want to {{say that}} we picked up a black plug hat when we were coming back along the trail. The point is that the thing was new. Then we found a brown duck jacket with a tear in it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> the tear had been made quite lately." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{was going}} to save this for the next album <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I will {{dedicate}} this to the folks in Greece before they run out of steam.

6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} kinder tough {{to find a}} fortune, {{and not be able}} to take {{advantage}} of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>figure</b> out how we can turn it to account." ...|$|R
50|$|Jimmy D. former BenQ Canada’s GM {{has left}} the Canadian {{operation}} to become {{chief operating officer of}} BenQ North America. He was previously appointed the vice-president of sales and marketing for the U.S. region for BenQ. Davlouros said BenQ currently falls short on back end infrastructure in North America. Building the infrastructure to support a billion dollar organization will be his top priority as COO. He always believed he would be back in the U.S. “I had no idea that this opportunity would be available to me. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure,</b> <b>I</b> am 45 and I can probably take this company by the horns and make it a powerhouse”, he said.|$|R
5000|$|Rupert's {{stand-up}} {{routine is}} well {{received by the}} audience. In his act, he describes his troubled life (from {{growing up in a}} poor neighborhood with neglectful, alcoholic parents; to getting regularly bullied and beaten up during his adolescence) while simultaneously laughing at his circumstances. Rupert closes by confessing to the studio audience that he kidnapped Jerry Langford in order to break into show business. The audience laughs, believing it to be part of his act. Rupert responds by saying, [...] "Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll all think I'm crazy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> it this way: better to be king for a night, than a schmuck for a lifetime." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was just}} a simple swing pass to get an early completion. The guy came in, {{hit me in the}} knee," [...] said Losman, who stayed in the game for two plays [...] "I knew {{something}} was wrong from the get-go, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I'd play a few plays and maybe the pain would go away." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It had {{mine and}} Ian Hunter's lyrics originally. But {{in the end}} Bob looked through it and re-did the whole song. I put some stuff into the song that anybody can relate to. It has good ground, because it's one of the facts of life. There's always things you can't have. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> {{it also has a}} kind of humorous side to it. Laughter through tears. It's kinda bitter sweet." ...|$|E
5000|$|I was {{shooting}} in the '70s soon after I took up golf. I thought about trying to become a pro <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> there wasn't any money in it. That was true, back then.

5000|$|Duff is {{a strong}} animal rights {{supporter}} and commented when asked {{what she would do}} if she was not a celebrity, [...] "I {{always wanted to be a}} veterinarian when <b>I</b> was younger, <b>but</b> then <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> out that animals actually die there, so that was not the job for me.

5000|$|... ^^^This is all wrong. Cross fluids tend {{towards a}} zero shear {{viscosity}} and an infinite shear viscosity according to mu(gammadot)=mu_inf+(mu_0-mu_inf)/(1+(C*gammadot)^n). There are four parameters, not three; and the limiting behaviors are incorrect. Sorry {{that this is}} not formatted well at all, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>figure</b> out how to change the formula on my own. Hopefully someone else can!

5000|$|Hunter told Taste of Country {{about writing}} the song: [...] "At the time, I {{was trying to}} tell {{somebody}} something, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> couldn't <b>figure</b> out how to say it. So I wanted to say it in music because I knew it would be a little more impactful. I wanted to say we are great in this relationship together, and I feel like it could even get better." ...|$|R
5000|$|It was the {{experience}} of working on Great Expectations that caused her to pursue an acting career more seriously: I thought acting was just a lark, meeting all those exciting movie stars, and getting £5 a day which was lovely because we needed the money. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> Id just go off and {{get married and have}} children like my mother. It was working with David Lean that convinced me to go on.|$|E
5000|$|Jesse {{graduated}} from Snohomish High School, {{after which he}} spent one year studying {{the art of the}} Old Masters in Seattle's public libraries. In 1999, he was accepted into Cornish College of the Arts on a Nellie Scholarship. Cornish later threw him out of school for verbally abusing a professor. About being kicked out of Cornish, Edwards said, “I knew they wouldn't like what I had to say, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I would go out with a bang.” ...|$|E

40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s July and I am dumbfounded.

50|$|He couldn't speak much English but he'd {{picked up}} some musicians' slang {{and he used to}} say 'Where can I put my homp(amplifier)? or 'where do I put my rope (lead)?'. He knew a few chords and he was really {{enthusiastic}} and when he'd had his hair cut and stuff he really looked the part. I mean, he could play guitar better than I could and I could play guitar better than Joe Strummer... well, in those days. So I reckoned he'd be OK <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>figure</b> Sting would see it that way...|$|R
5000|$|Hackett was a {{prominent}} figure in college football {{for most of his}} adult life. He served as a member of football's rules committee and had officiated Big Ten Conference football games {{for the better part of}} 30 years when he decided to retire just before the 1935 season. [...] "I never missed a game, and was never late for a game," [...] he told the Detroit Free Press. [...] "I looked at that resignation letter a long time before I signed it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I had better quit...

5000|$|... "You know, sir, it's a funny thing. All my life I {{kept running}} into smart people. I don't just mean smart {{like you and}} the people in this house. You know what I mean. In school, there were lots of smarter kids. And when I first joined the force, sir, they had some very clever people there. And I could tell right away that it wasn't gonna be easy making detective {{as long as they were}} around. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> if I worked harder than they did, put in more time, read the books, kept my eyes open, maybe I could make it happen. And I did. And I really love my work, sir." [...] —Lieutenant Columbo in Season 6 episode 3 [...] "The Bye-Bye Sky High IQ Murder Case" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, former Scientologist Astra Woodcraft {{told the}} San Francisco Chronicle that {{she decided to}} attempt to get {{pregnant}} because she thought this would help her get out of Scientology, due to its practices with regard to abortion. [...] "If you get pregnant, they'll send you {{to one of their}} smaller, lower-level organizations. In reality, you're very heavily pressured to get an abortion , <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> it was my only way to get out," [...] said Woodcraft. A bio page on a website Woodcraft created in 2008 said she [...] "left Scientology for good when the church tried to pressure her to have an abortion". Scientology leaders told the San Francisco Chronicle that the organization does not have a policy on abortion, but instead leaves the decision up to the individual.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a fact," [...] {{said the}} agent. [...] "Larry was {{worrying}} {{me about it}} before it was light.

Of course," [...] he added thoughtfully, [...] "'most any one who had worked on a railroad would know the code, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>figure</b> why they should make so much fuss about a box that's scarcely worth a dollar." ...|$|R
5000|$|After Millie's perfect {{definition}} of [...] "true friend" [...] in that noble act, Emily {{is able to}} break her bonds with Julie and the Triple A's. [...] "I may have been slow, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>figured</b> out what a true friend is, and Julie never was one," [...] she declares. When Julie attempts to persuade Emily that what she has been doing for Emily is all for Emily's own good (e.g. the dieting), even meek Wendy sticks up for Emily. With one more true friend, Julie can't break her in school. That's another problem solved and just one more to go.|$|R
5000|$|Gary Lewis told {{interviewer}} Ray Shasho in 2013 that [...] "You know what's funny though, {{the largest}} selling internet tune of mine is [...] "Sure Gonna Miss Her," [...] even above [...] "This Diamond Ring" [...] and [...] "She's Just My Style."

5000|$|Upon {{entering}} the Chicago City Council, Gutiérrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington's unofficial floor leader, {{and leader of}} the Latinos in the council. Gutiérrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: [...] "There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five alderman that say anything. You could say there's only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> it out-there's only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have anything on, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't taken care of some problem, that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have some dirt on. So, when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{a further}} {{evaluation}} at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California, he was advised {{that there was}} a better chance of saving his penis and testicles, but that the procedure would cost a seven-figure sum, which he did not have. In the hope of raising the money, he went public in a segment on Howard Stern's radio and TV show and set up an address to receive offers of help or financial support. He said: [...] "I don't like being a freak, who would? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> that the Stern show is listened to by millions of people and they might want to help me. I hope some millionaire or billionaire will want to help me." [...] He acknowledged that the choice of address was not the classiest, but it was at least memorable, and noted that The Howard Stern Show was a good platform for him to make an appearance as its audience is predominately male.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} months of 2000, Wright began an affair with country singer Brad Paisley. Even though Wright and her female lover had moved in {{together}} earlier that year, and Wright admitted she felt no sexual attraction to Paisley, she recounted that [...] "he's wickedly smart, {{which is one of the}} reasons why I made the decision to spend time with him. I loved Brad. I never had the capacity to fall in love with him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> if I’m gonna live a less than satisfied life, this is the guy I could live my life with. If I’m gonna be with a boy, this is the boy." [...] She held him in high esteem and great affection in every way other than sexual attraction. In her autobiography she expressed remorse for how she treated him, and told Oprah Winfrey that [...] "I have a lot of regret for how that relationship began and had a middle and ended. I had no business being in a relationship with him".|$|E
5000|$|Later Joss Whedon gave an {{interview}} to TV Week's James Hibberd and was surprisingly non-committal about Ripper. Whedon stated that [...] "There isn’t anything new. It might become too problematic. The rights issue with 'Ripper' becomes complicated. There are other characters in the woods. We {{may have to do}} some fancy footwork. Obviously I’m committed to Dollhouse {{but that does not mean}} I’m not doing 'Ripper'". In {{an interview}} from [...] "The Write Environnement", Whedon reiterated: [...] "Well, Ripper fell victim to a lot of things, most of them contractual... at this point, all I know is I’m gonna do something with Tony for the BBC - and I don’t know what it is... Actually, I kinda do know what it is, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> haven’t <b>figured</b> it out enough to tell anybody... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think it probably won’t be Ripper." ...|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} about {{strategy}} generation and its {{importance for the}} company.

In the practical part, I worked out and evaluated the process of generation Mary Kay strategy. I was not trying to generate a new concept of the strategy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> tried to <b>figure</b> out why this strategy, which has been unchanged for many years, is so successful...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Grafton told an {{interviewer}} that she prefers to pick a title early {{in the writing process}} because that helps to direct her storytelling. [...] "For one book I had thought of [...] "E" [...] Is for Ever. I loved the play on words <b>but</b> <b>I</b> had to <b>figure</b> a better title. So I picked [...] "E" [...] Is for Evidence. If I know the title I can make sure the story I'm telling is pertinent." ...|$|R
