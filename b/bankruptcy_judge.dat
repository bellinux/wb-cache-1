Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judge</b> blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend our}} prior work on generalist judges to explore whether {{specialization}} leads to superior judicial decision making. To do so, we report {{the results of}} a study of federal <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges.</b> In one prior study of <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges,</b> Ted Eisenberg reported evidence suggesting that <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges,</b> like generalist judges, are susceptible to the 2 ̆ 2 self-serving 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 egocentric 2 ̆ 2 bias when making judgments. Here, we report evidence showing that <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> are vulnerable to anchoring and framing effects, but appear largely unaffected by the omission bias, a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s race, a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s apology, and 2 ̆ 2 terror management 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 mortality salience. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Because we do not directly compare generalist <b>judges</b> to <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> with the same materials, we are somewhat limited in the inferences we can draw about the advantages or disadvantages of specialization. On balance, the evidence we report below suggests that <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> perform at least as well as generalist judges. We also find evidence, however, of a correlation between the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> 2 ̆ 7 political views and the outcomes in some cases; namely, we find some evidence suggesting that Republican judges are more pro-creditor than Democratic judges. As we discuss, this result suggests one potential downside of specialization that we did not anticipate – it might politicize the bench...|$|R

40|$|A {{surprising}} number of courts believe that <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> lack authority to impose criminal contempt sanctions. We attempt to rectify this misunderstanding with a march through the historical treatment of contempt-like powers in bankruptcy, the painful statutory history of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code (including the exciting history of likely repealed 28 U. S. C. § 1481), and the various apposite rules of procedure. (Fans of the All Writs Act will delight in its inclusion.) But the principal service we offer to the bankruptcy community is dismantling the ubiquitous and persistent belief {{that there is some}} form of constitutional infirmity with 2 ̆ 2 mere 2 ̆ 2 <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> entering criminal contempt orders. This is likely false; at best, it is unsupported by relevant Supreme Court precedent. The shibboleth seems to find its primary roots in misperceptions about Article III, which we try to disabuse. To be sure, there are serious (albeit maddeningly underspecified) constraints on the contempt power that sound in constitutional provenance, mostly under due process, but they {{have nothing to do with}} the status of <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges.</b> This article’s overdue analysis (it is hoped) will aid courts having to confront this issue in the future...|$|R

Vick later discovered that Talbot's résumé contained numerous false statements. Talbot had been accused of defrauding church members in New Jersey. The New Jersey Attorney General started legal action against Talbot for securities fraud over an alleged scheme to defraud investors of more than $500,000 by offering them [...] "asset enhancement contracts" [...] to be used to build a new church.

40|$|One type of {{financial}} reform being proposed {{to deal with}} the aftermath of the housing crisis is allowing <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> the authority to modify residential mortgages in a way referred to as a stripdown. The reform is seen by some as a partial solution to the rise in foreclosures and as a Pandora’s box by others. But the debate is not new one. The 1980 s farm foreclosure crisis sparked similar proposals and concerns. Congress decided to enact legislation that contained a stripdown provision, resulting in the creation of Chapter 12 in the bankruptcy code. The effects of Chapter 12 stripdown authority after its enactment shed light on the efficacy of allowing <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judges</b> similar authority for housing loans.
