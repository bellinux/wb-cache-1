40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{relation of}} the infinite long rod model with a weak interface has been deduced via wave equation of the guided waves and <b>boundary</b> <b>spring</b> interface model. The dispersion characteristics of the rigid interface and the slip interface are calculated, while the effect of different axial stiffness coefficient is also discussed. The {{results suggest that the}} phase velocity of the slip interface decreases slowly with increasing frequency at the low frequency of the L (0, 1) mode. As for the weak interface, when the axial coefficient Kt is in the particular range of [1010, 1014]pa/m, the interface turns from the slip interface to the rigid interface. That shows the value of axial coefficient Kt is an essential prerequisite for the non-destructive evaluation to evaluate the interface cementation degree...|$|E
40|$|A Fourier-Ritz {{method for}} {{predicting}} the free vibration of composite laminated circular panels and shells of revolution subjected to various combinations of classical and non-classical boundary conditions {{is presented in}} this paper. A modified Fourier series approach {{in conjunction with a}} Ritz technique is employed to derive the formulation based on the first-order shear deformation theory. The general boundary condition can be achieved by the <b>boundary</b> <b>spring</b> technique in which three types of liner and two types of rotation springs along the edges of the composite laminated circular panels and shells of revolution are set to imitate the boundary force. Besides, the complete shells of revolution can be achieved by using the coupling spring technique to imitate the kinematic compatibility and physical compatibility conditions of composite laminated circular panels at the common meridian with &# 952; = 0 and 2 &# 960;. The comparisons established in a sufficiently conclusive manner show that the present formulation is capable of yielding highly accurate solutions with little computational effort. The influence of boundary and coupling restraint parameters, circumference angles, stiffness ratios, numbers of layer and fiber orientations on the vibration behavior of the composite laminated circular panels and shells of revolution are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this content is to {{investigate}} the free vibration of functionally graded parabolic and circular panels with general boundary conditions by using the Fourier-Ritz method. The first-order shear deformation theory is adopted to consider {{the effects of the}} transverse shear and rotary inertia of the panel structures. The functionally graded panel structures consist of ceramic and metal which are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness according to the power-law distribution, and two types of power-law distributions are considered for the ceramic volume fraction. The improved Fourier series method is applied to construct the new admissible function of the panels to surmount the weakness of the relevant discontinuities with the original displacement and its derivatives at the boundaries while using the traditional Fourier series method. The <b>boundary</b> <b>spring</b> technique is adopted to simulate the general boundary condition. The unknown coefficients appearing in the admissible function are determined by using the Ritz procedure based on the energy functional of the panels. The numerical results show the present method has good convergence, reliability and accuracy. Some new results for functionally graded parabolic and circular panels with different material distributions and boundary conditions are provided, which may serve as benchmark solutions...|$|E

40|$|A {{simplified}} method for finding rotational boundary stiffnesses, representing {{the foundations of}} a structure and its surrounding soil, is developed. This technique {{is applied to the}} Meloland Road overpass, for which records were obtained during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake. A system identification method was previously used to find the predominant modes of the structure. A very simple, finite element 3 ‐D beam model for the bridge is constructed, and the rotational stiffnesses are used to model the effect of the foundations. A dynamic analysis is performed, in which the recorded translational earthquake accelerations are used as input excitation to the structure, and the predominant modal frequencies of the model are shown to compare well with the results obtained through system identification, even though simplifying assumptions were made. A sensitivity analysis is also performed on the rotational <b>boundary</b> <b>springs</b> to study how much they affect the dynamic response of the structure. In further studies, these procedures could be used to gain more insight into the dynamic effects of soil‐structure interaction and should prove to be particularly useful for preliminary designs of structures...|$|R
