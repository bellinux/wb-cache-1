25|$|Cement-making and {{the mining}} of {{limestone}} and gypsum for Portland Cement are major exports of the area. Charlevoix's Medusa Cement Plant was bought by Cemex in the 1990s. Alpena {{is home to the}} Lafarge Company's holdings in the world's largest cement plant and is home to Besser Block Co. (Jesse M. Besser invented concrete block in 1904 and founded the Besser Block Co. in Alpena after making the concrete <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine).</b> USG Corporation, also known as United States Gypsum Corporation, operates several quarries, including one at Alabaster, and one in Rogers City. Rogers City is the locale of the world's largest limestone quarry, which is also used in steel making all along the Great Lakes.|$|E
40|$|Natural fibres {{reinforced}} cement-based {{materials have}} gain increasing application in residential housing components. One {{of the natural}} fibres considered is oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) fibres which offer advantages such as availability, renewability, low cost and the established technology to extract the fibres. This study investigates the properties of cement block incorporated with large amount of oil palm EFB fibres. The blocks were mixed with 10 to 30 % oil palm EFB fibres based on cement weight into the block. A total of 60 block samples of dimensions 100 mm x 200 mm x 400 mm were manufactured in this study using a high density operated <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> with a cement-sand ratio of 1 : 6. Among the tests conducted was compressive strength, density, water absorption, drying shrinkage and prism tests. It was found that high EFB fibres content lead to lower strength, higher absorption and drying shrinkage. The results also indicate that high EFB fibres contents reduced the self-weight of the blocks and the resulting blocks can be classified as lightweight cement blocks suitable {{to be used as}} lightweight walling materials...|$|E
40|$|The ambient {{temperature}} of tropical countries like Nigeria {{is as high}} as 40 oC during the dry season. This ultimately gives rise to increase in demand for ice which is used to reduce the temperature of water, soft-drinks as well as other uses. This increase in demand for ice block makes the design and construction of a machine which can be used for the production of ice within {{a short period of time}} in order to save energy and time imperative and a worthwhile venture. This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of a model ice <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine</b> that can freeze water quickly. In order to achieve quick freezing, certain design consideration, such as the quantity of water to be frozen, the choice of cooling system and the methodology of attaining the desired result. The methodology adopted involves increasing the area of heat transfer and employing a vapour compression refrigerating system to generate the refrigerating effect. The design analysis of the evaporator, compressor and condenser are presented in details. This paper also reports on the material selection, fabrication methods and the experimental procedures and results. A temperature of- 140 C was achieved in the freezing chamber and a freezing duration of 70 minutes for 1 kg of ice block as test results...|$|E

5000|$|In 1942, in {{settlement}} of patent infringement litigation with inventors Gelbman and Andrus, Besser and Stearns entered into an agreement under which Stearns and Besser were each {{given the right}} to use the Gelbman and Andrus patents, but exclusively to them, and it was agreed that they were to have the benefit of, and right to use, any and all future improvements and patents covering concrete <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machines</b> that Gelbman and Andrus might conceive. Not only were Gelbman and Andrus prohibited from licensing anyone else, but Besser and Stearns were each prohibited from licensing anyone else without the consent of the others. Besser continued to buy patents from others, and threatened patent infringement suit without even having seen the accused machines.|$|R

40|$|In the Nuraicholai {{coal fired}} thermal power plant, 7500 MT of coal per day is burnt {{producing}} 750 MT and 75 MT of two main waste products fly ash and bottom ash respectively. Fly ash {{is used in}} cement manufacture, but bottom ash is presently regarded as a waste material. However, {{there is a possibility}} to convert bottom ash to a value added material. This thesis presents findings pertaining to the feasibility of using bottom ash as a replacement of sand in producing light weight cement blocks. Chemical analysis carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy on Nuraicholai power plant bottom ash waste showed that the harmful elements present such as As, Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu, Ni and Se were within internationally specified toxicity limits for soil. It was found that bottom ash at oven dry condition had a loose bulk density of 600 kg/m 3, which is about 40 % that of river sand which has a nominal loose bulk density of about 1450 kg/m 3. Important physical and mechanical properties such as compressive strength, water absorption, density, accelerated erosion resistance and drying shrinkage & wetting expansion were tested for blocks produced by partly or fully replacing fine aggregate with bottom ash. Heat conductivity of blocks produced with bottom ash was found to be less than the good quality conventional cement blocks available in Sri Lanka. Comparatively, performance of the bottom ash blocks was very good and comparable with conventional cement blocks produced with river sand and quarry dust. Further, trials were carried out with river sand, crushed rock sand and coarse aggregate in order to find out optimum mix proportions and to investigate the feasibility of medium scale production of bottom ash blocks using a conventional type of <b>block</b> <b>making</b> <b>machine.</b> The optimum mixes which give strength, density and water absorption of desirable amount were found with Cement, Quarry dust, Bottom ash and 5 - 10 mm crushed rock aggregates...|$|E
