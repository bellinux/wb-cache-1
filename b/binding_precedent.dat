However, during the recess months of July through September, an alternating panel of three justices are allowed to hear cases and their decisions are considered <b>binding</b> <b>precedent.</b> However, in order for any law passed by the Legislative Assembly to be declared unconstitutional, it requires the votes of a majority of the total membership of the Court, therefore, a three-justice panel may not hear constitutional challenges to laws passed by the Legislature.|$|E
25|$|An analogy {{might be}} made to the issue of legal {{opinions}} from courts in common-law systems. Fatwās generally contain the details of the scholar's reasoning, typically in response to a particular case, and are considered <b>binding</b> <b>precedent</b> by those Muslims who have bound themselves to that scholar, including future muftis; mere rulings can be compared to memorandum opinions. The primary difference between common-law opinions and fatwās, however, is that fatwās are not universally binding; as Sharia is not universally consistent and Islam is very non-hierarchical in structure, fatwās do not carry the sort of weight as that of secular common-law opinion.|$|E

Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves. Trials are conducted solely by the judge, {{and there is no}} jury system. There is no pre-trial discovery process, and no cross-examination of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set <b>binding</b> <b>precedents</b> under the principle of stare decisis, and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally codified universal statutes.|$|R

25|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico {{is defined by the}} Constitution and the laws of Puerto Rico. In general, the jurisdictional structure parallels that of the state Supreme Courts in the continental United States. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts to interpret federal laws, unless the Supremacy Clause requires otherwise. Judgments that stand on federal law grounds may be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court, unless an adequate and independent ground for the decision based in Puerto Rico commonwealth law is also present. The Court has the power of judicial review and its decision are considered <b>binding</b> <b>precedent</b> within the {{jurisdiction of}} Puerto Rico. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico also regulates the practice of law in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that, through recusals or vacancies, the Court divides evenly on a case. If that occurs, then {{the decision of}} the court below is affirmed, but does not establish <b>binding</b> <b>precedent.</b> In effect, it results in a return to the status quo ante. For a case to be heard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices. If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the Court had been evenly divided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court, the Chief Justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there. This has only occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of United States v. Alcoa (1945).|$|E

Accordingly, Parliament began meeting on 17 March 1628, and [...] "immediately became locked into debates on English liberties", specifically relating to the forced loans, the trial of the five knights, the billeting of soldiers and martial law. Members of Parliament, already angry with Charles, were further enraged when Selden discovered that Heath had attempted to have the decision in the five knights case enrolled as <b>binding</b> <b>precedent</b> on the legality of the forced loans, pressuring the clerk of the King's Bench to do so; MPs reacted by declaring the judgment illegal.|$|E

The Supreme Court has continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education. [...] In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger, it reaffirmed Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that Bakke might not be <b>binding</b> <b>precedent</b> due to the fractured lineup of justices in a plurality opinion. The court's decision in the 2013 case of Fisher v. University of Texas made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge affirmative action programs, but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas.|$|E
500|$|The case {{fractured}} the court; {{the nine}} justices issued {{a total of}} six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. [...] Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. [...] The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or <b>binding</b> <b>precedent</b> were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{certainty}} and {{the orderly}} development of legal principles are {{promoted by the}} application of the doctrine of stare decisis, also known as the doctrine of <b>binding</b> <b>precedent.</b> According to this doctrine, the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts. Thus, judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court, and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts. A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level. Thus, a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions. Nonetheless, courts generally do so as a matter of comity, unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise. As the final appellate court in Singapore, the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council. However, the Court continues to treat such decisions as [...] "normally binding" [...] and only departs from them [...] "where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore". Only the ratio decidendi (that is, the legal principle that determines the outcome) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision (obiter dicta) are only persuasive.|$|E

Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Lawrence, ruling that Texas’s state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one’s home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause).

2500|$|Henry II {{developed}} {{the practice of}} sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an ad hoc basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be.

In time, a rule, known as stare decisis (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation {{of the law and}} apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be <b>binding</b> <b>precedent,</b> the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name [...] "common law." ...|$|E
