5000|$|<b>Broadbanding</b> {{is a job}} grading {{structure}} that falls between using spot salaries vs. many job grades to determine what to pay particular positions and incumbents within those positions. While <b>broadbanding</b> gives the organization using it some broad job classifications, {{it does not have}} as many distinct job grades as traditional salary structures do. [...] Thus, <b>broadbanding</b> reduces the emphasis on ‘status’ or hierarchy and places more of an emphasis on lateral job movement within the company. In a <b>broadbanding</b> structure an employee can be more easily rewarded for lateral movement or skills development, whereas in traditional multiple grade salary structures pay progression happens primarily via job promotion. In this way, <b>broadbanding</b> is a more flexible pay system. This flexibility, however, can lead to internal pay relativity problems as there isn’t as much control over salary progression as there would be within a traditional multi-level grading structure.|$|R

5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its <b>broadband</b> aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the <b>broadband</b> aggregation market.
