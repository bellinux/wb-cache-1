These fats are mostly mixtures of various vegetable fats often modified) and can consist of palm and palm kernel oil, illipe fat, shea butter, sal fat and kokum <b>butter.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> variety of other vegetable oils can be used.

None of the methods reviewed here, allows the unequivocal quantification or just detection of foreign fats in chocolate. It is proposed to combine a number of techniques with a chemometric approach to develop unique patterns allowing the unequivocal detection and quantification foreign fats without having prior knowledge regarding the kind of fat added.

50|$|The {{development}} of the yearly butter record is of more than passing interest. In 1813, Mr. Caleb Oakes, of Danvers, Mass., purchased a cow then five years old, of unknown stock, that in 1814 made 300 pounds of <b>butter,</b> <b>in</b> 1815 over 400 pounds, and in 1816, between May 15 and December 20. 484 pounds 4 ounces of butter. The largest amount made in one week was 19 pounds. The Oakes cow became famous and was given the prize of the Massachusetts State Agricultural Society in 1816. For years the yield of the Oakes cow was unsurpassed, {{so far as the}} public is aware. Finally the Jersey cow Eurotas made a sensation and excelled all previous records, by producing 778 pounds 1 ounce of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year. This set the Jersey world agog, and Mary Ann of St. Lambert went into a year's test to break the record of Eurotas, which she did by producing 867 pounds 14¾ ounces of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year. Then a challenge cup was offered to the Jersey who would excel Mary Ann <b>in</b> the <b>butter</b> yield, and Landseer's Fancy took possession of this, after demonstrating that she could make 936 pounds 14¾ ounces of butter to Mary Ann's 867 pounds 14¾ ounces. But after this, Eurotissima made 945 pounds 9 ounces and took the cup; then Bisson's Belle relieved her of it by making 1,028 pounds 15 ounces, and finally, in 1892, Signal's Lily Flagg, by producing 1,047 pounds ¾ ounce of <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year, led this list of celebrated Jerseys. But for greatest total <b>butter</b> yield <b>in</b> <b>a</b> year, it is said that the Jersey is not the champion, for the Holstein-Friesian cow Pauline Paul, in 1890 and 1891, in 365 days, produced 18,669 pounds 9 ounces of milk under test, from which was made 1,153 pounds 15¾ ounces of butter, worked and salted, one ounce to the pound.|$|R
