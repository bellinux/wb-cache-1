40|$|While a large {{literature}} has established that migration experience among an individual's {{family and community}} networks tends to encourage migration, there is little research investigating the mechanism by which networks exert such effects. This paper aims to determine {{the relative importance of}} three potential benefits provided by networks: information on <b>border</b> <b>crossing,</b> <b>information</b> on jobs, and credit. We develop empirical tests of these effects based on a simple model that allows individuals to choose between migrating alone or {{with the help of a}} border smuggler. Using a dataset of undocumented Mexican migrants to the United States, we find that larger family networks encourage both migration and coyote use, consistent with the job information hypothesis. In contrast, community networks appear to provide crossing information. The finding that family networks have a smaller impact for asset holders indicates that some of the benefit the family network provides is a source of credit.

40|$|With {{over one}} billion {{international}} tourist arrivals per year, forecast {{to rise to}} 1. 5 billion per year by 2020, transport is {{an essential component of}} the tourism system. Transport connects tourism generating regions (both domestic and international) to destinations, and facilitates the internal movement of visitors between attractions, accommodation, and commercial services. The location, capacity, efficiency and connectivity of transport can therefore {{play a significant role in}} how a destination develops, significantly influencing the mobility of visitors and the connectivity of tourist experiences within destinations. At the same time the growing number of travellers creates numerous challenges in terms of transport infrastructure and capacity, <b>border</b> <b>crossing,</b> intermodality, <b>information</b> for travellers and inter-operability of technologies with tourism service providers...|$|R

It forms a framework for several individual projects aiming to develop the requirements for international trade; projects involving <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> processes, <b>information</b> management in railroad transportation, Information management in sea transportation, logistics service networks and harmonization of the preconditions for business. It also serves as a co-ordination and discussion forum for its member countries Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Poland and Russia with Lithuania and Denmark as observers. The programme is developed in close co-operation with private companies and it strongly supports the public-private partnership concept.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Australia and the European Union (EU) have {{different}} structures of governance, histories, and cultures, both entities face remarkably similar problems in relation to police cooperation across borders. Australia is divided in nine different criminal jurisdictions, each of them policed by its own police force. Problems of <b>border</b> <b>crossing,</b> <b>information</b> exchange and joint investigations therefore arise {{similar to those in}} the EU. These problems have intensified in the 20 th century with globalisation and the increased mobility of offenders. Several strategies, both legal and administrative, have necessarily developed to secure inter-state borders. Many of these strategies, like joint investigation teams, common databases and mutual recognition can be compared to solutions developed in the EU. This article will analyse some of the strategies that have been developed in Australia and in the EU to out-balance the lack of borders within them. It will be discussed what the major common impediments to police cooperation are in both entities. As many problems of cross-border policing result from {{the fact that}} law enforcement strategies are purely regional, it will be explored how more advanced cooperation strategies could be harmonised at the EU and Australian Federal levels. The major inhibiting factor in relation to harmonisation of legal frameworks in both entities will be defined as ‘the fear of insignificance’ or the fear of state actors to lose their individual identities in the process of harmonisation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this era}} of globalization, the world has indeed shrunk, it {{is more and more}} {{apparent}} that pollution respects no boundaries and no borders. Corporate social responsibility and prevention of <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> pollution is a very emergent issue. The increase in the power of environmental groups, the ease of <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>information</b> flow, and the rising concern of the public with regards to global impact of environmental issues are motivating factors resulting in the need to undermine the lacuna that exists in regulating the transboundary pollution. This paper aims to present the status of the transboundary pollution and seeks to establish and quantify the liability of the corporations in such matters. The prime focus of the paper is on the public international law that puts a mandate on the parent company to indemnify the loss caused by them. The paper analyses the International regime of environmental law and highlights the principle under which the parent company becomes liable. The paper concludes with certain sets of recommendation that can be incorporated to effectively deal with such issues. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Corporate social {{responsibility}} {{and sustainable development}} are issues that {{been in the forefront}} of corporate strategy for several decades. The increase in the power of environmental groups, the ease of <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>information</b> flow, and the rising concern of the public with regards to global impact of environmental issues are motivating factors resulting in the establishment of environmental management systems. Many multinational chemical companies, threatened with the possibility of the establishment of new, stricter, environmental laws, are actively working to demonstrate their corporate {{social responsibility}} while operating in a global market with regards to developing and implementing voluntary programs to handle the increasingly important issues surrounding environmental responsibility and global sustainability. The integration of the environmental management system into the corporate vision, mission and strategic plan is demonstrated with the ultimate goal of changing corporate culture in the companies which have the power to affect international environmental policies...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{decision}} support system to help plan preventive border patrols. The system represents the interaction between defenders and intruders as a Stackelberg security game (SSG) where the defender pools local resources to conduct joint preventive border patrols. We introduce a new SSG that constructs defender strategies that pair adjacent precincts to pool resources {{that are used to}} patrol a location within one of the two precincts. We introduce an efficient formulation of this problem and an efficient sampling method to construct an implementable defender strategy. The system automatically constructs the Stackelberg game from geographically located past crime data, topology and <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>information.</b> We use clustering of past crime data and logit probability distribution to assign risk to patrol areas. Our results on a simplified real-world inspired border patrol instance show the computational efficiency of the model proposed, its robustness with respect to parameters used in automatically constructing the instance, {{and the quality of the}} sampled solution obtained.
