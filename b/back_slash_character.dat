5000|$|... 1961 September: ASCII - The ASCII {{character}} set, then in {{an early}} stage of development, had the \ (<b>Back</b> <b>slash)</b> <b>character</b> added to it in order to support ALGOL's boolean operators /\ and \/.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{hexadecimal}} code (in ASCII and Unicode) for the <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Around 1970, Unix {{introduced}} the <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> ("/") as its directory separator.|$|R
50|$|The <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (/), {{depending}} on its position, has different meanings within a file URL.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fraction}} <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (U+2044) {{has special}} {{behavior in the}} Unicode Standard: (section 6.2, Other Punctuation) ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (...) is now {{allowed in}} the NSS to {{represent}} names containing slashes from non-URN identifier systems.|$|R
5000|$|Currency pairs are {{sometimes}} then written by concatenating the ISO currency codes (ISO 4217) {{of the base}} currency and the counter currency, separating them with a <b>slash</b> <b>character.</b> Often the <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> is omitted, alternatively the slash may be replaced by and etc. A widely traded currency pair is {{the relation of the}} euro against the US dollar, designated as EUR/USD. The quotation EUR/USD 1.2500 means that one euro is exchanged for 1.2500 US dollars. Here, EUR is the base currency and USD is the quote currency(counter currency). This means that 1 Euro can be exchangeable to 1.25 US Dollars.|$|R
50|$|The {{fraction}} <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (U+2044) allows authors using Unicode {{to compose}} any arbitrary fraction {{along with the}} decimal digits. Unicode also includes a handful of vulgar fractions as compatibility characters, but discourages their use.|$|R
5000|$|When {{directory}} {{support was}} added to MS-DOS in version 2.0, [...] "/" [...] was kept as the switch prefix character for backwards compatibility. Microsoft chose the backslash character ("\") as a directory separator, which looks similar to the <b>slash</b> <b>character.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... basename is a {{standard}} UNIX computer program. When basename is given a pathname, it will delete any prefix {{up to the last}} <b>slash</b> (...) <b>character</b> and return the result. basename is described in the Single UNIX Specification and is primarily used in shell scripts.|$|R
5000|$|Armored Troopers Votoms: Lightning <b>Slash</b> (1999, <b>character</b> design) ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike in the Scandinavian vowel 'Ø' and the [...] "empty set" [...] symbol '∅', the slash of a slashed zero {{usually does}} not extend past the ellipse in most typographic designs. However, the slashed zero is {{sometimes}} approximated by overlaying zero and <b>slash</b> <b>characters,</b> producing the character [...] "0̸".|$|R
5000|$|Blekko used an {{initiative}} called slashtags, {{consisting of a}} text tag preceded by a [...] "/" [...] <b>slash</b> <b>character,</b> to allow ease of searching and categorise searches. System and pre-defined slashtags allowed users to start searching right away. Users could create slashtags after signup, to perform custom-sorted searches and to reduce spam.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, {{the first}} version of Microsoft DOS was released. MS-DOS 1.0 did not support file directories. Also, a major portion of the utility {{commands}} packaged with MS-DOS 1.0 came from IBM and their command line syntax used the <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> as a 'switch' prefix. For example, dir /w runs the 'dir' command with the wide list format option.|$|R
50|$|On some {{keyboards}} - {{including the}} original IBM PC/AT (and later) German keyboards - the asterisk (*) key on the numeric keypad is instead labeled with the multiplication sign (×), and the divide-key is labeled with the division sign (÷) instead of slash (/). However, those keys still generate the asterisk and <b>slash</b> <b>characters,</b> not the multiplication and division signs.|$|R
50|$|The {{abundance}} index was immediately adopted and extended {{to run from}} 1 to 10, differentiating abundances in SC stars. It was now quoted {{as part of the}} spectral type in preference to separate Zr and Ti abundances. To distinguish it from the earlier abandoned abundance class it was used with a <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> after the temperature class, so that the spectral class for R And became S5/4.5e.|$|R
500|$|On 1 October 2004, {{a central}} Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed ACDC Lane {{in honour of}} the band. The City of Melbourne forbade {{the use of the}} <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> in street names, so the four letters were combined. The lane is near Swanston Street where, {{on the back of a}} truck, the band {{recorded}} their video for the 1975 hit [...] "It's a Long Way to the Top".|$|R
50|$|When marking {{text for}} {{interlinear}} glossing, {{as in the}} third column in the chart above. simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a <b>back</b> <b>slash.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hamilton {{differs from}} other Unix shells {{in that it}} follows Windows {{conventions}} instead of Unix conventions for filename <b>slashes,</b> escape <b>characters,</b> etc.|$|R
2500|$|Many older {{typewriters}} did {{not include}} a separate key for the numeral 1 or the exclamation point, and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero. [...] Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l ("ell") for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. A cents symbol (¢) was created by combining (over-striking) a lower case 'c' with a <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (typing 'c', then backspace, then '/').|$|R
50|$|IPv4 {{addresses}} may {{be represented}} in any notation expressing a 32-bit integer value. They are most often written in the dot-decimal notation, which consists of four octets of the address expressed individually in decimal numbers and separated by periods. The CIDR notation standard combines the address with its routing prefix in a compact format, in which the address {{is followed by a}} <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (/) and the count of consecutive 1 bits in the routing prefix (subnet mask).|$|R
50|$|Many older {{typewriters}} did {{not include}} a separate key for the numeral 1 or the exclamation point, and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero. Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l ("ell") for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. A cents symbol (¢) was created by combining (over-striking) a lower case 'c' with a <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (typing 'c', then backspace, then '/').|$|R
50|$|By {{following}} this Unicode recommendation, text processing systems yield sophisticated symbols from plain text alone. Here {{the presence of}} the fraction <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> instructs the layout engine to synthesize a fraction from all consecutive digits preceding and following the slash. In practice, results vary because of the complicated interplay between fonts and layout engines. Simple text layout engines tend not to synthesize fractions at all, and instead draw the glyphs as a linear sequence as described in the Unicode fallback scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Relay ran on {{a special}} ID using several BITNET hosts. To use it, a message {{was sent to a}} user ID called RELAY. The Relay program running on that user ID would then provide {{multi-user}} chat functions, primarily in the form of [...] "channels" [...] (chat rooms). The message could contain either a command for Relay (preceded by the popular [...] "/" [...] <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> command prefix, still in use today), or a message at the remote host (typically a mainframe computer).|$|R
25|$|The {{routing prefix}} may be {{expressed}} in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 is the prefix of the Internet Protocol version 4 network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.|$|R
5000|$|The general {{form of an}} HTML {{element is}} therefore: [...] Some HTML {{elements}} are defined as empty elements and take the form [...] Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the [...] tag or the inline [...] tag.The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags.Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a <b>slash</b> <b>character,</b> [...] "/", and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed.If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.|$|R
5000|$|Number Forms. Number forms {{primarily}} {{consist of}} precomposed fractions and Roman numerals. Like {{other areas of}} composing sequences of characters, the Unicode approach prefers the flexibility of composing fractions by combining characters together. In this case to create fractions, one combines numbers with the fraction <b>slash</b> <b>character</b> (U+2044). As {{an example of the}} flexibility this approach provides, there are nineteen precomposed fraction characters included within the UCS. However, there are an infinity of possible fractions. By using composing characters the infinity of fractions is handled by 11 characters (0-9 and the fraction <b>slash).</b> No <b>character</b> set could include code points for every precomposed fraction. Ideally a text system should present the same glyphs for a fraction whether {{it is one of the}} precomposed fractions (such as ⅓) or a composing sequence of characters (such as 1⁄3). However, web browsers are not typically that sophisticated with Unicode and text handling. Doing so ensures that precomposed fractions and combining sequence fractions will appear compatible next to each other.|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} {{allowed in}} a URI are either reserved or unreserved (or a percent character {{as part of}} a percent-encoding). Reserved characters are those characters that sometimes have special meaning. For example, forward <b>slash</b> <b>characters</b> are used to separate different parts of a URL (or more generally, a URI). Unreserved characters have no such meanings. Using percent-encoding, reserved characters are represented using special character sequences. The sets of reserved and unreserved characters and the circumstances under which certain reserved characters have special meaning have changed slightly with each revision of specifications that govern URIs and URI schemes.|$|R
50|$|Many older {{character}} encodings (unlike Unicode) {{suffer from}} several problems. Some code page vendors insufficiently document {{the meaning of}} all code point values, which decreases the reliability of handling textual data through various computer systems consistently. Some vendors add proprietary extensions to some code pages to add or change certain code point values; for example, byte 0x5C in Shift JIS can represent either a <b>back</b> <b>slash</b> or a yen currency symbol depending on the platform. Finally, {{in order to support}} several languages in a program that does not use Unicode, the code page used for each string/document needs to be stored.|$|R
5000|$|An {{acronym for}} FILe Generator and Editor, FILGE was a command-oriented text editor created by CompuServe {{in the early}} 1970s. Its many {{commands}} were preceded by a <b>slash</b> (/) <b>character.</b> For example, if a text file contained the line: ...|$|R
2500|$|The modern {{standard}} form of specification {{of the network}} prefix is CIDR notation, used for both IPv4 and IPv6. It counts the number of bits in the prefix and appends that number to the address after a <b>slash</b> (/) <b>character</b> separator: ...|$|R
2500|$|Slash is a pinball enthusiast and collector. [...] He {{has participated}} in the design process for the 1994 Data East GunsN'Roses pinball machine, and the 1998 Sega machine Viper Night Drivin'. Slash is a playable {{character}} in the video game , released in 2007. His performance was motion captured to record his movements for the game. <b>Slash's</b> <b>character</b> becomes playable after a player beats him in a one-on-one competition, which then leads to the player and Slash playing the master track of [...] "Welcome to the Jungle". Guitar learning game/simulator Rocksmith 2014 by Ubisoft released a Slash Song Pack with several of the latter compositions by the artist available to purchase as downloadable content and learn on the guitar.|$|R
5000|$|Chanslash is the {{portrayal}} of underage characters in sexual situations in slash fiction. The prefix chan most likely comes from the Japanese name suffix used as a term of endearment toward children or women. It may be a nod towards yaoi fandoms, in which underage pairings are more commonplace. Owners of the intellectual property rights to characters {{in this type of}} slash are often unhappy with chanslash because of the potential legal ramifications and concern over negatively affecting the popularity of the character. Some studios owning the rights to <b>slashed</b> <b>characters</b> have issued cease and desist orders in the past {{as a result of this}} type of slash. Chanslash is also called shotacon (abbreviated as [...] "shouta" [...] or [...] "shota") when dealing with anime fanfiction.|$|R

5000|$|A process {{connected}} to a D-Bus bus can request it to export as many D-Bus objects as it wants. Each object is identified by an object path, a string of numbers, letters and underscores separated and prefixed by the <b>slash</b> <b>character,</b> called that because of their resemblance to Unix filesystem paths. The object path is selected by the requesting process, and must be unique {{in the context of}} that bus connection. An example of a valid object path is [...] However, it's not enforced [...] - but also not discouraged - [...] to form hierarchies within object paths. The particular naming convention for the objects of a service is entirely up to the developers of such service, but many developers choose to namespace them using the reserved domain name of the project as a prefix (e.g. [...] ).|$|R
50|$|A {{key feature}} in Helios is its {{distributed}} name system. A Helios network implements a single unified name space, with a virtual root node, optional virtual network structuring nodes, nodes for each processor, and sub-processor name spaces provided by services. Names {{are similar to}} those in Unix, using a forward <b>slash</b> separating <b>character</b> and textual naming elements.|$|R
