Through analyzing the <b>brake</b> <b>regulations</b> and the vehicle dynamics, a control strategy was proposed to solve the problem on braking force distribution for the pure electric vehicle. The rate of regenerative braking [1], the rate of energy-saving and the rate of extended driving mileage were served as evaluating indexes of the control strategy. Finally the simulation was carried out by MATLAB/simulink and AVL-Cruise under different profiles. The control strategy was also validated by vehicle experiment. The results show that the strategy can distribute the brake forces rightly and recover relatively more energy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{brake pad}} wear control {{algorithm}} used under uncritical braking conditions is proposed to reduce the difference in {{brake pad wear}} between {{the front and rear}} axles caused by the difference in braking force and the type of brake. The algorithm regulates the distribution of braking force within the limits of certain <b>braking</b> <b>regulations</b> according to the wear conditions of the brake pads while deceleration control still functions properly. Computer co-simulations of braking with Trucksim and Matlab/Simulink was performed in which vehicle models with equal brake pad wear, greater wear on the front axle and greater wear on the rear axle were used. The results show that the difference in brake pad wear between the front and rear axles can be reduced by distributing the braking force according to the wear conditions of the brakes when braking uncritically to reduce the time and cost needed in repair and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Electric vehicle {{power train}} {{concepts}} with wheel-hub or close-to-wheel propulsion {{open up a}} whole new area of vehicle control possibilities. The DLR robotic concept vehicle ROMO allows the evaluation of these possibilities using integrated chassis control. With its electric drive train it is possible to recuperate kinetic energy during braking process. Using only the electric motors for braking, an increased mass of electric drives & energy storage would be necessary in order to comply to legal passenger vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>regulations.</b> Therefore, the combination of friction based brake and electric motor brake can be advantageous. In this paper, object oriented models (Modelica) of a permanent magnet synchronous machine driven electro-hydraulic disc brake and an in-wheel direct driven traction motor are presented. Furthermore, two torque blending algorithms of an electro-hydraulic disc brake and an in-wheel permanent magnet synchronous machine are evaluated. One algorithm is based on a dynamic control allocation using real-time capable quadratic programming, the other is a feed forward control based on heuristic considerations. Finally, four comparison methods are presented and applied to evaluate the performance of the used torque blending...|$|R

Each {{wheel torque}} can be {{controlled}} independently, so four-wheel-drive electric vehicle can not only control the vehicle stability through hydraulic <b>braking</b> pressure <b>regulation,</b> but also through controlling the motor driving and braking force to generate yaw moment, which are different with the conventional vehicles. 4 WD Evs have potential applications in control engineering. Both in-wheel motors and the EHB are actuators for vehicle stability control. In this paper, a vehicle co-simulation platform is constructed {{through the application of}} AMEsim and Simulink, additionally, a fuzzy controller is designed to generate yaw moment so as to compensate for deviations between CG slip angles and yaw rate. The simulation results show that the stability control system with motors and a mechanical load brake system can effectively improve the handling stability of the vehicle...|$|R

50|$|The use {{of engine}} torque and brake {{pressure}} {{information in the}} regulation of the ACD and AYC components allows the S-AWC system to determine more quickly whether the vehicle is accelerating or decelerating. S-AWC also employs yaw rate feedback for the first time. The system helps the driver follow his chosen line more closely by comparing how the car is running, as determined from data from the yaw rate sensors, and how the driver wants it to behave, as determined from steering inputs, and operates accordingly to correct any divergence. The addition of <b>braking</b> force <b>regulation</b> to AYC's main role of transferring torque between {{the right and left}} wheels allows S-AWC to exert more control over vehicle behavior in on-the-limit driving situations. Increasing braking force on the inside wheel during understeer and on the outer wheel during oversteer situations, AYC's new braking force control feature works in conjunction with torque transfer regulation to realize higher levels of cornering performance and vehicle stability.|$|R

40|$|Background: During {{operation}} of power systems {{there is the}} problem of synchronic transient stability of generators for nearby and prolonged faults. Possible control actions to ensure dynamic stability are the following: electric <b>braking,</b> emergency <b>regulation</b> of turbine, partial generation-shedding. However these control actions cannot be applied in all cases. Therefore, in this paper we consider another possible kind of the control actions - the phase control. To apply phase control for the transient processes it is necessary to solve the tasks: dosage of impacts by value of the phase shift and the time of control activation/ removal. Materials and methods: In the study we used the materials describing the technical means for the implementation of phase control and the publications of other authors. The impacts dosage in the form of phase control is modelled on the basis Mathcad and Mustang software package. Results: It is shown that for the successful phase control which maintains synchronic transient stability a certain range of the phase shift and the time for activation and removal of the control action are required. Conclusions: The phase control can be an effective tool for maintaining synchronic transient stability in some specific conditions. Further research of phase control should be directed to the development of its applications using specific hardware...|$|R

40|$|The present master thesis {{focuses on}} the study of brake lining wear calculation. This <b>brake</b> system <b>regulation</b> {{function}} is worldwide only provided in passenger cars of the BMW Group. It calculates continually the wear of brake linings and displays to the driver the kilometre availability, as part of the Conditioned Based Service. The task assignment consists in the analysis and improvement of the current brake lining wear monitoring function that is used by BMW. First of all, the preliminary required task would be to understand and analyse the current status of the brake lining wear calculation. For that purpose, {{it will be necessary to}} build up a simulation environment, in which the calculation algorithm could be tested. The virtual calculation results can be compared with available experimental data from brake test bench and vehicle tests. Furthermore, in order to understand wear process, a study of all possible influence variables on the brake lining wear will be required. The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings. Then, a method has to be developed to find out possible empirical equations of wear that fit the characteristic diagram obtained on the brake test bench. Finally, the models obtained must be tested and validated with real test bench wear measurements...|$|R
2500|$|The {{emergency}} brake was originally intended for one particular emergency {{and that was}} [...] "no other way to stop", {{as was the case}} when the footbrake suddenly failed. Drivers had to respond when brakes failed, so they were expected to learn how to stop a speeding vehicle using the emergency <b>brake</b> alone. Safety <b>regulations</b> became almost universal by 1980, so modern brake systems are very reliable, using dual-circuit hydraulics and more recently low-brake-fluid sensors. As modern brakes no longer cause emergencies (a brake warning light comes on after the first sign of trouble), it is no longer necessary for the average driver to learn to use this brake for emergencies. Some drivers benefiting from the [...] "park" [...] function on their automatic transmissions do not use this brake at all (daily use of the park brake is recommended). After a lack of recent braking emergencies, automakers stopped using the term and started referring it by its other use, the [...] "parking brake", even though the ability to function at a high speed was still there. On an increasing number of modern vehicles, the parking brake can only be engaged when the vehicle is at a stop, and they no longer have an {{emergency brake}}.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, the newly born Second Polish Republic had no common rail system, {{as it was}} made of rail systems of three powers that had divided Poland (Russian Empire, German Empire, Austria-Hungary). Different were tracks, signals, <b>brakes,</b> engines, cars, <b>regulations,</b> tariffs and tools. Rail {{transport}} suffered from World War One destruction, yet it not only had to support Polish Army units, but also civilian population. Everything was improvised, and in 1920, the nation was invaded. The Soviets were close to capturing 220 engines and 7,560 cars, which were being withdrawn westwards. In six weeks, Polish rail workers managed to turn 400 kilometers of Russian gauge track into the standard gauge (from Baranowicze to Dęblin), thus saving Polish rolling stock. In {{the first years of the}} Second Polish Republic, rail transport was very difficult; it took 22 hours to travel from Warsaw to Wilno, due to a destroyed bridge near Grodno: [...] "Now, the prophecy of Ferdinand de Lesseps is becoming reality.

50|$|Beginning around 1980, {{there are}} {{nominally}} strict cost-benefit ratio requirements for every safety device, system, or design feature NHTSA mandates for installation on vehicles. That is, the device, system, or design feature {{may not be}} made mandatory unless it will save more money (in property damage, health care, etc.) than it costs, or must cost {{no more than a}} specified amount of money per life saved. Such requirements may be subject to manipulation of estimated costs and estimated benefits to justify or reject almost any standard; FMVSS #208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal airbags in all new vehicles in the United States, for it is written such that no other technology can meet the stipulated requirements. It has been argued that even using conservative cost figures and optimistic benefit figures, airbags' cost-benefit ratio so extreme that it may fall outside of the cost-benefit requirements for mandatory safety devices. These same cost-benefit requirements have been used as the basis for lighting-related lags in American regulations; for example, virtually {{every country in the world}} has since at least the early 1970s required rear turn signals to emit amber light so they can immediately be discerned from adjacent red <b>brake</b> lamps. U.S. <b>regulations</b> still permit rear turn signals to emit red light on grounds of cost-effectiveness despite NHTSA research showing amber rear turn signals instead of red ones give a larger crash-avoidance benefit than the 3rd brake light.|$|R
40|$|Pre-activation before ground impact {{can play}} an {{important}} roles during drop jumps（ DJ）. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the regulation of triceps surae muscle activation during DJs. Seven healthy subjects dropped from 3 different heights, and were asked to not rebound （landing only: LAND） or rebound with maximal effort （RJmax）. Joint angular data, ground reaction force and electromyography of the lower leg muscles were simultaneously recorded during each DJ. With higher drop heights, agonist muscle activities （medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles） during the pre-activation phase were dramatically increased, while those did not show any differences during braking phase. The increased agonist muscle activation before touchdown（ pre-activation） was significantly decreased during the following <b>braking</b> phase for <b>regulation</b> of low stiffness in the LAND. The agonist muscle activities during braking phase were increased with stiffness index of muscle-tendon unit from LAND to RJmax during constant drop height. However, the pre-activation of the agonist muscle was not increased while that of the corresponding antagonist tibialis anterior muscle was significantly increased from LAND to RJmax. During the following braking phase, the antagonist muscle activities were not increased. These results suggest that the effects of agonist muscle pre-activation are mainly for the impact of touchdown, and not for the regulation of landing or rebound. Consequently, the antagonist pre-activation and the agonist muscles activation of braking phase may play important roles to control motion after landing, and regulate stiffness...|$|R
