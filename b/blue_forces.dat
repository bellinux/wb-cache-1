5000|$|At this point, the {{exercise}} was suspended, Blue's ships were [...] "re-floated", {{and the rules}} of engagement were changed; this was later justified by General Peter Pace as follows: [...] "You kill me in the first day and I sit there for the next 13 days doing nothing, or you put me back to life and you get 13 more days' worth of experiment out of me. Which is a better way to do it?" [...] After the reset, both sides were ordered to follow predetermined plans of action. After the war game was restarted, its participants were forced to follow a script drafted to ensure a <b>Blue</b> <b>Force</b> victory. Among other rules imposed by this script, Red Force was ordered to turn on their anti-aircraft radar {{in order for them to}} be destroyed, and was not allowed to shoot down any of the aircraft bringing <b>Blue</b> <b>Force</b> troops ashore. Van Riper also claimed that exercise officials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against <b>Blue</b> <b>Force,</b> and that they also ordered Red Force not to use certain weapons systems against <b>Blue</b> <b>Force</b> and even ordered the location of Red Force units to be revealed.|$|R

Given the task of capturing Arkansas and Louisiana, the 2nd's mission ended on 9 September with divisional elements at Chatham, Louisiana. During the next week the division became part of a second training operation. This time the division served with the Second Army's Red Force, now challenging the Third Army's Blue Force. Second Army's first goal was to defeat and remove the <b>Blue</b> <b>Forces</b> from southern Louisiana, and then to keep the enemy from capturing Shreveport.

The Strait of Malacca was the setting for several exercises. These included anti-submarine warfare, anti-air warfare, and gunnery exercises. One of the exercises was a semi-final battle problem, or night encounter exercise. The two navies’ task groups steamed together in formation for more than 25 hours. The Malaysian-U.S. naval task group was divided into two opposing forces. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Forces</b> consisted of Reuben James, , , and the Malaysian ships KD Sri Indera Sakti and KD Lekir. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Forces</b> were supported by U.S. helicopters from Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron (Light) HSL-37, Detachment Four, from Hawaii.

5000|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a {{commander}} of combined forces. The scope of each battle and the number and variety of military units available to fight with, increases as the game progresses. The game was marketed as gulf war themed, but gameplay is more consistent with potential cold war scenarios. There are two modes: short (which allows players to plan strategic battles without any tactical consequences) and long (which allows all units to participate in up to four rounds of constant warfare). [...] The <b>blue</b> <b>forces</b> are armed with American weapons while the red forces are armed with Soviet-made weapons.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the Cold War the {{exercises}} {{focused on the}} anti-submarine warfare threat and utilised a NATO vs. Warsaw Pact scenario. Mustardia (red forces) represented a communist dictatorship and Cyanica (<b>blue</b> <b>forces)</b> a stable democracy. Since the late 1980s exercises have changed to reflect modern threats and theatres of war such as the Balkans, the Gulf and Afghanistan. Prior to the current core scenario, exercises {{were based on a}} civil war which broke out in Britannica in 1972, with the country then splitting into five smaller nations (Brownia, Mustardia, Cyanica, Ginger and Emeraldia). In order to represent the threat posed by al-Qaeda, the fictional terrorist group an-Quaich was introduced to exercises in 2003.|$|E
