50|$|Hide glue regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the glue's open time does not allow the joint to be glued normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} to glue and clamp a top to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The top is then clamped to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the glue. When the glue is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the glue cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used to glue veneers to a substrate. The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide glue. Once the glue is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying glue. When the iron is removed, the glue cools, bonding the veneer to the substrate.|$|E

Using high-speed videography and differential interference contrast microscopy, the performance parameters involved in spit ejection by Scytodes thoracica (Araneae, Scytodidae) were measured. These will ultimately need to be explained in biomechanical and fluid dynamic terms. It {{was found that the}} ejection of “spit” from the opening of the venom duct (near the proximal end of the fang) was orderly. It resulted in a pattern that scanned along a lateral-medial axis (due to fang oscillations) while traversing from ventral to dorsal (due to cheliceral elevation). Each lateral-to-medial sweep of a fang produced silk-borne <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> that were not present during each subsequent medial-to-lateral sweep. The ejection of “spit” was very rapid. A full scan (5 – 57 fang cycles, one upsweep of a chelicera) typically occupied less than 30 ms and involved fang oscillations at 278 – 1781 Hz. Ejection velocities were measured as high as 28. 8 m/s. The “spit” was contractile. During the 0. 2 s following ejection, silk shortened by 40 – 60 % and the product of a full scan by both of the chelicerae could exert an aggregate contractile force of 0. 1 – 0. 3 mN. Based on these parameters, hypotheses are described concerning the biomechanical and fluid dynamic processes that could enable this kind of material ejection...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the strength properties <b>of</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber composed of edge-glued laminae and to investigate the influence <b>of</b> edge <b>gluing</b> on the strength properties. Glued laminated timber composed of multiple-grade laminae (symmetrical composition, strength grade E 95 -F 270, 10 laminations) was produced from karamatsu (Larix kaempferi) edge-glued laminae according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard. The bending, tensile, and compressive strengths <b>of</b> the <b>glued</b> laminated timber were measured. The average bending, tensile, and compressive strengths were 33.4, 24.5, and 35.9 MPa, respectively, and these values are almost equal to those <b>of</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber composed of karamatsu single-piece laminae.
