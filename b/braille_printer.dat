40|$|Tactile print {{has been}} used since the {{beginning}} of 1800, at first not for visually impaired but as an invention (called Sonography) for the artillery to read and write in darkness and for making several copies of a document at once, though it was never used as intended because of it’s complexity with characters representing sound and not letters. Sonography characters were also to big to be covered by a single finger tip wich made reading slow. Later on Sonography was presented at a school for blind students. It was first rejected by the teachers but the students pushed on. One of the first students to encounter the Sonography was Louis Braille. He reworked the 12 - dot Sonography to a six dot literal system. Over the years the Braille system has been improved and is now used for science, mathematics and also music purpose. With the possibility to connect <b>Braille</b> <b>printers</b> to personal computers even graphics can be made, making abstract tables of figures visualized by diagrams and charts. This master thesis is about optimizing hammers in <b>Braille</b> <b>printers.</b> There has been some problems with dot quality in <b>Braille</b> <b>printers.</b> The first problem is that some dots are not embossed to the same height. The problem is somewhat coupled to increased temperature in the printing head depending on low efficiency. An other problem is how to measure striking force. Dynamic laser measurement {{turned out to be the}} best method to measure the striking force. By knowing speed and mass of movement, energy can be calculated with ease. Optimization of the hammers striking force was made by static measurement and modelling using Femlab and Matlab. The Femlab static modell was verified by measurement with a force sensor at different displacement. Modifications modelled in Femlab and verified in static force measurement were then dynamically tested and measured with laser to make sure that they worked in reality. Finally hammers were tested in a printing head on different paper qualities. It turned out that the dot quality was highly dependent on the rubber shock absorbers in the hammers rather than solenoid efficency. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- When we ponder about {{technology}} {{for people with}} visual disabilities, two broad domains come to our mind: General technology and Assistive technology. General technology is inclusive of computers, smartphones and cell phones whereas Assistive technology consists of devices developed to help people with vision impairment or other visual disabilities. The Assistive technology comprises everything starting from screen readers for visually impaired people or screen enlargers for low vision PCs, to braille watches and <b>braille</b> <b>printers.</b> In most of the system, prototype has been developed which will ease the routine chores performed by the visually impaired individuals. We will provide most of their prototype details in this paper along with some other scenarios. There is some development in the specified field of reading printed as well as digital text. These technologies help visually impaired people to read normal text {{with the help of}} audio outputs. We will also focus our attention on those aspects which are still in development phase and are facing some critical problems. The primary motive of this technology is precise scanning and text-to-speech transformations in order to achieve efficient output.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the goal of}} providing transparent computer access to people with disabilities, especially those with visual impairments. First, four basic strategies to provide this population with access to technology are identified: (1) building features into the computer, operating system, or application programs; (2) using adaptive interfaces comprised of standard software or hardware products that provide modifications or alternate interfaces for accessibility; (3) establishing connectivity to personal assistive devices; and (4) developing custom adaptations. Application of these strategies is illustrated and discussed in case studies of people with visual impairments, physical impairments, and hearing impairments. Among the approaches reviewed in these case studies are <b>Braille</b> <b>printers</b> and computers, the Optacon, the Kurzweil Reading Machine, speech synthesizers, speech output software, magnification software, single-switch input systems, screen-based optical head pointing systems, voice recognition systems, StickyKey software, telephone devices for the deaf, the KEY plus keyboard system, and C-print.

Blind or visually impaired people have limited access to {{the internet}}; they may use screen readers, screen magnifiers, refreshable Braille displays or <b>Braille</b> <b>printers.</b> The level of user convenience provided by each tool is different and Braille display is found to be the most popular tool. Other tools have certain limitations on the speed of access and interaction. This paper presents a low cost novel tactile web navigator device aimed at enabling blind people to have feasible internet accessibility. This navigator design includes a microcontroller that communicates with the browser software running on the PC to acquire the text from a web page. The text is subsequently displayed using an array of solenoids which gives the required tactile sense. The blind user then uses his/her tactile sense to recognize the text in Braille language. It is recognized that {{only a small percentage of}} blind people are familiar Braille, another mode for output was developed which uses the English characters. The English characters may also appear in their conventional shapes to be sensed by the blind user. Many navigation functions like loading a webpage address, clicking on links and entering data (E-mails, passwords, etc) have been provided. The cost of the implementation is ~ 12 % of the commercial Braille displays. The navigator was tested with volunteer blind users and the results were good; they were able to read Braille characters.

40|$|Today's product {{development}} process should be rapid andcost-efficient, and should result in innovative and reliableproducts. A crucial factor is the dynamic behaviour of theproduct. This thesis focuses on theoretical, numerical andexperimental approaches to achieve a comprehensiveunderstanding of dynamical phenomena occurring in nonlinearproducts, especially in products with parts that includeimpacts. The aim is to show the usefulness of nonlineartheories to better understand and optimise the dynamicbehaviour of products and thereby account for nonlinearphenomena already in the {{product development}} process. This is achieved through an investigation of researchefforts {{in the field of}} nonlinear dynamics; identification ofimportant research directions; a study on the effect ofcouplings between nonlinear parts; a detailed study on thedynamic behaviour of a product component; investigations oflow-cost strategies for controlling the dynamics of a nonlinearsystem; and the design and implementation of experimentalset-ups of two studied products. The investigation of research efforts shows that nonlinearparts are frequently included in products. Most common areparts that are nonlinear due to impacts and friction. Twoimportant areas are identified; to study coupling effectsbetween nonlinear subsystems and to study how nonlinearanalysis can be used to improve existing designs. Considering the studied products; a pantograph on a trainand a <b>Braille</b> <b>printer,</b> it can be concluded that thecharacteristics of a part can largely affect the dynamicbehaviour of the product. Typical nonlinear behaviour, such ascoexisting solutions and irregular motions, do occur. Theanalysis of the pan- tograph motion shows important aspects toconsider in the modelling process; coupling effects. In thecase of the <b>Braille</b> <b>printer</b> it is shown possible to create alow-cost control, by taking advantage of an existingdiscontinuity, to achieve a desired motion. Altogether, this work contributes to improved understandingof the be- haviour of nonlinear parts in products, especiallythose including impacts, pro- viding greater knowledge aboutaspects to consider in the design process.

40|$|The {{ability for}} blind people {{to read and}} write Braille aids {{literacy}} development. A good level of literacy enables a person to function well in society in terms of employment, education and daily living. The learning of Braille has traditionally been done with hard copy Braille produced by manual and more recently electronic <b>Braille</b> writers and <b>printers.</b> Curtin University is developing an electronic Braille writer and the research on an interface for Braille keyboard devices, presented in this thesis, forms part of the Curtin University Brailler project. The Design Science approach was the research method chosen for this research because of the flexibility of the approach and because it focuses upon the building of artefacts and theory development. The small sample size meant that both individual interviews and a focus group were employed to gather relevant data from respondents. The literature review covers a variety of areas related to computer interfaces and Braille keyboard devices. A key finding is that the interaction paradigm for Braille keyboard devices needs to differ to interfaces for sighted individuals because of the audio, tactile and serial nature of the information gathering strategies employed by blind people as compared with the visual and spatial information gathering strategies employed by sighted individuals. In terms of usability attributes designed to evaluate the interface consistency was found to be a key factor because of its importance to learning and memory retention. However, two main functions carried out on a computer system are navigating and editing. Thus the model of interface for Braille keyboard devices presented in this thesis focuses upon navigation support and editing support. Feedback was sort from by interviews with individuals and a focus group. Individual interviews were conducted face to face and via the telephone and the focus group was conducted via Skype conference call to enable participants {{from all over the world}} to provide feedback on the model. The model was evaluated using usability attributes. Usability was important to the respondents, in particular consistency, learnability, simplicity and ease of use were important. The concept of rich navigation and infinitely definable key maps were understood by respondents and supported. Braille output is essential including the ability to show formatting information in Braille. The limitations of the research included the few respondents to the interviews and the choice to focus upon a theoretical model rather than implementing the model on an actual device.
