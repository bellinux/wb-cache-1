5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This martin is often seen perched on wires, and sometimes rests on sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as <b>blue-cheeked</b> <b>bee-eaters</b> in the Seychelles.|$|R
5|$|Depictions in {{classical}} art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian {{example is a}} relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut's mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting <b>blue-cheeked</b> <b>bee-eaters</b> {{was found in the}} villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue-cheeked</b> <b>bee-eaters</b> may nest solitarily or {{in loose}} colonies {{of up to}} ten birds. They may also nest in colonies with European bee-eaters.

500|$|Prey can {{be spotted}} from a distance; European bee-eaters {{are able to}} spot a bee [...] away, and <b>blue-cheeked</b> <b>bee-eaters</b> have been {{observed}} flying out [...] to catch large wasps. Prey is approached directly or from behind. Prey that lands {{on the ground or}} on plants is usually not pursued. Small prey may be eaten on the wing, but larger items are returned to the perch where they are beaten until dead and then broken up. Insects with poisonous stings are first smacked on the branch, then, with the bird's eyes closed, rubbed to discharge the venom sac and stinger. This behaviour is innate, as demonstrated by a juvenile bird in captivity, which performed the task when first presented with wild bees. This bird was stung on the first five tries, but by ten bees, it was as adept at handling bees as adult birds.|$|R

40|$|Aim. Over {{the last}} twenty years the {{abundance}} of migratory populations of the European Bee-eater and <b>Blue-cheeked</b> <b>Bee-eater</b> on their migration routes in the region of the western coast of the Middle Caspian Sea, Daghestan has decreased. The goal of this research is to assess the current status of two studied taxa of bee-eaters and determine reasons inducing long-term fluctuations in their numbers {{in different parts of the}} range. Methods. The number dynamics of European and Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters was detected by long-term rows of observation data (1995 - 2015) in key points of their major flyways. The current status of European and Blue-cheeked  Bee-eaters in different parts of their range, including Daghestan, was identified by means of published data, personal observations and inquiries. Results. Their habitats, abundance trends, timing of migration and characteristics of migration behaviour in plain and mountainous areas of the republic were identified. It has been established that Daghestan is traversed by three independent and stable migration flows of bee-eaters, crossing this transit region along different migration channels. The studies showed that the aridization of climate has lead to the reduction of the bee-eater abundance on their major flyways. Main conclusions. Deterioration of habitats caused redistribution of the Daghestan population of the <b>Blue-cheeked</b> <b>Bee-eater</b> to the north of its range and changed migration routes of the European Bee-eater. A fact of fishing is described for both bee-eater species, which is for the Blue-cheeked  Bee-eater is an unprecedented case in the world science. </p...|$|E
40|$|Part 3 of {{the study}} of loess ground and {{bee-eater}} birds concerns birds and ground in the north-western part of the Indian Sub-continent. Three species of bee-eaters are considered, relative to the Indus region: the Green bee-eater, the <b>Blue-cheeked</b> <b>bee-eater</b> and the European bee-eater. Loess in the Indus region is considered via the deterministic approach to loess deposit formation; the P events occur in the mountains of the western part of High Asia, particles are formed by the action of mountain glaciers. Major T actions involve the five rivers of the region which carry loess material into the Punjab plains. Subsequent T actions deliver loess material to local deposits, which provide nesting grounds for bee-eaters. To some extent the bee-eaters define the loess. The Green bee-eater is small (16 – 18 cm long) and lives over all of India and Pakistan-nesting ground is available everywhere. The larger bee-eaters (European and Blue-cheeked: (25 cm)) are more constrained by ground properties-they require the ideal properties of loess ground (an ideal positioning relative to the Heneberg compromise) for nesting, and thus tend to define loess extent. Soil mechanics requires that more exact stress conditions are achieved when a relatively large nest tunnel is being constructed...|$|E

The recording of wetland winter visitor birds during 2005 - 08 in winter season included atleast 58 species of birds belonging to 10 orders and 18 families. It is important to mention that 29 species of wetland birds were winter migratory, 17 residents, 9 local migratory and three species of wetland birds like Lesser-whistling Duck Dendrocygna javanica, Pheasant-tailed Jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus and <b>Blue-cheeked</b> <b>Bee-eater</b> Merops persicus were summer migratory.

The first three papers in the Loess and Bee-eaters series sought to establish links between the nesting of bee-eater birds (family Meropidae) and the occurrence of loess deposits. For the European bee-eater there is a close and fairly obvious relationship; for the Carmine bee-eater nesting in the 15 N band of Africa more assumptions and adjustments have to be made, and for the <b>Blue-cheeked</b> <b>bee-eater</b> nesting in the Indus region the relationship is becoming vague and more speculative. The trend continues with the Australian bee-eater- the rainbowbird (Merops ornatus). We lack precise maps of loess distribution in Australia and there is an equal lack of detailed and accurate maps of the distribution of rainbowbird nesting. Loess in Australia is elusive; the maps of Kriger and Scheidig show little detail and are essentially contradictory. If the deterministic theory of loess deposit formation were applied, it would suggest that loess should be found in the region where Pleistocene cold-phase mountain glaciers occurred. In the last glacial phase there was very little glacial occurrence in Australia; probably a limited region near Mount Kosciuszko. This places some glacial activity in the extreme southeast of the country. This agrees, more or less, with the data on the Kriger map. Fry has mapped the breeding zones of the rainbowbird and they are concentrated in the southeast and southwest. The maps are not precise but there does seem to be indications of co-existence of bee-eater nests and loessic regions. This is not the clearcut relationship which has been observed with the European bee-eater but it is suggestive. The ill-defined loess/dust regions and the poorly demarcated nesting zones of the rainbowbird do seem to be coincident. Better mapping is urgently required for loess in Australia, and nesting zones of M. ornatus. It may be that dust rather than loess is the ground material to be observed in Australia. There are still problems of integrating the dust and loess concepts, but mapping of dust deposits does produce some coincidence with rainbowbird nesting. The region of Vertisol occurrence appears to be a barrier to the spread of rainbowbird nesting. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E
