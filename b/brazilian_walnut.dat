50|$|In {{the early}} stages the economy of Fraiburgo's region was based on sawmills. The former dense forests {{consisted}} mostly in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>walnuts,</b> Cedars, Cinnamons, Yerba maté, and the exuberant Brazilian Pines. These forests still represent the typical Southern Brazilian landscape in spite of ruthless deforestation in the past decades. A significant turnover in the economy took place due to the shortage of wood, implementation of Brazilian environmental laws and environmental consciousness. As a result, agriculture became the predominant source of wealth alongside the production of paper, cellulose, and furniture derived from extensive reforestation areas. The reforestation projects introduced the Pinus elliottii to the region.|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} oil fraction of 8 types of edible nuts available on the Polish market. All tested nuts were characterized with high content of dry matter. Fatty acid and sterol composition was analyzed by GC-MS. Squalene and tocopherol profiles were examined by HPLC with diode array (DAD) and fluorescence detectors (FLDs). The highest level of fat was found in macadamia (75. 4 g/ 100 g) and the lowest in cashew nuts (46. 9 g/ 100 g). Fatty analysis showed that nuts were rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fatty acids were predominant in most cases, {{with the exception of}} <b>Brazilian</b> nuts, <b>walnuts</b> and pine nuts which were richer in polyunsaturated fatty acids. β-Sitosterol was the main sterol of nuts, and its content ranged from 96. 9 mg/ 100 g of oil (in macadamia) to 474. 8 mg/ 100 g of oil (in pistachio). γ-Tocopherol homologue was predominant among its fraction with the largest content determined in pistachio (8. 3 mg/ 100 g of oil) and walnuts (8. 6 mg/ 100 g of oil). The presence of squalene was confirmed in seven types of nuts, and the richest source of it were Brazilian nuts (145. 8 mg/ 100 g of oil). The study proofs the variation of nut oil composition, especially phytosterol and tocopherol content and can be used for better characterization of nuts derived from different geographic areas or cultivars...|$|R

50|$|Along the Blue Water River Walk {{is an old}} {{railroad}} ferry dock. This ferry dock {{has been}} completely restored and made available {{as a place to}} view the St. Clair River. The decking is made of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>walnut</b> and new railings, lighting, and stairs have been added. An old functioning railroad signal light welcomes visitors to the ferry dock.|$|E
5000|$|The wood is very hard, {{measuring}} 5.6 on the Brinell {{scale and}} [...] on the Janka scale, approximate measurements of hardness.

5000|$|The {{acoustic}} {{project was}} carefully designed to neutralize vibrations {{caused by the}} constant movement of trains. For this reason the main hall's 15 centimeter-thick floating floor was built on an immense neoprene slab which functions like a massive wedge between two concrete layers lined with <b>Brazilian</b> <b>walnut,</b> ideal material for absorbing noise. The floor was also lowered 1.22 m to respect acoustic requirements and avoid esthetic disfigurement.|$|E
50|$|From the 1920s to today, Boynton Beach Oceanfront Park {{has been}} popular with {{residents}} and visitors alike. In the mid-1990s, the park underwent a major renovation {{during which the}} boardwalk was rebuilt out of recycled plastic. Boynton Beach's Oceanfront Park was voted the best family beach in Palm Beach County by The Palm Beach Post in 2001. In 2011 the boardwalk was renovated again, replacing the plastic with Ipe (pronounced ee-pay) wood (commonly known as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Walnut).</b> In 2012 improvements {{were made to the}} buildings along the boardwalk, including total refurbishment of the restrooms.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} covered in mixed montane rainforest, {{but due to}} human exploitation little of the original coverage remains.It is presently {{in the process of}} regeneration.There are fragments of the original Araucaria Forest, which contain species such as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>walnut</b> (Ocotea porosa), Paraná pine (Araucaria angustifolia), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis), cedar (Cedrela fissilis) and Brazilian oak (Roupala brasiliensis).Fauna include crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), brocket deer (Mazama species), Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), azure jay (Cyanocorax caeruleus), jacu (Penelope species) and endangered species such as lowland paca (Cuniculus paca) and oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus).|$|E
50|$|Ocotea porosa is {{a species}} of plant in the Lauraceae family, often placed in the related genus Phoebe. It is {{commonly}} called imbuia or <b>Brazilian</b> <b>walnut</b> because its wood resembles that of some walnuts (to which it is not related). The tree is a major commercial timber species in Brazil, used for high-end furniture, mostly as decorative veneers, and as flooring. The wood is fragrant with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon (also {{a member of the}} Lauraceae). The tree is also a popular horticultural tree in subtropical regions of the world. In its native habitat it is a threatened species.|$|E
40|$|Wood {{presents}} different {{pattern of}} variation in its properties from pith to bark. It is necessary to know wood workability variation to formulate alternatives to improve surface quality. Thus, this research aimed to identify the variation of wood machining properties in Eucaluptus grandis Hill ex. Maiden, according to ASTM (1995), from pith to bark and to compare results with mahogany and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Walnut</b> woods. The results showed that different patterns of variation were found from pith to bark. Although cut conditions have been considered inadequate to improve surface qualities, which generated preliminary cleavage, the Eucalyptus grandis wood presented satisfactory surface quality. However, these results were poorer than those of mahogany and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Walnut...</b>|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi estudar a influência da relação do fósforo com o zinco sobre o crescimento, teor e conteúdo de nutrientes em plantas de freijó (Cordia goeldiana Huber). Utilizaram-se amostras de um Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro, da camada de 0 - 20 cm de profundidade do campus da Universidade Federal de Lavras, que apresentava 1 mg de P (Mehlich 1) e 0, 9 mg de Zn por dm³ de solo. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial 4 x 3, sendo quatro doses de P (0, 150, 300 e 450 mg dm- 3) e 3 de Zn (0, 5 e 10 mg dm- 3), com quatro repetições. Aos 12 meses após o plantio, foram colhidas as plantas e a matéria seca das folhas, caules e raízes, moídas separadamente, para as determinações químicas. A aplicação do fósforo promoveu aumento no crescimento das mudas e nos teores e conteúdos de P nas diferentes partes da planta de freijó e provocou redução nos teores de zinco nas folhas. Nas raízes, na presença de doses de zinco a interação do fósforo com o zinco reduziu o teor de zinco. As doses de zinco proporcionaram aumentos tanto no teor quanto no conteúdo deste nas folhas e raízes diminuíram os conteúdos de P nas folhas e caules das plantas. O efeito sobre os demais macronutrientes foi variado em função da parte da planta analisada. The {{objective of}} this work was to study {{the influence of the}} zinc-phosphorus relationship on the growth, content and accumulation of nutrients in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>walnut</b> (Cordia goeldiana Huber). Samples of Dark-Red Latosol, 0 - 20 cm depth, from the campus of the Federal University of Lavras, with 1 mg P (Mehlich 1) and 0. 9 mg Zn per dm³ soil. The experiment was arranged in a complete randomized factorial design 4 x 3, with 4 P doses (0; 150; 300 and 450 mg dm- 3) and 3 Zn doses (0; 5 and 10 mg dm- 3), with 4 repetitions. At 12 months after planting, plants were harvested, and dry matter of shoots, roots and leaves were ground separately for chemical analysis. Phosphorus application promoted increase in seedling growth and in the contents and accumulation of P in the different plant parts, but caused reduction in leaf zinc contents. The zinc-phosphorus interaction caused reduction in the zinc content in the roots, when {{in the presence of the}} different zinc doses. The zinc doses provided increases in both the level and content of zinc in the leaves and roots and reduced P contents in the leaves and shoots. The effect on the other macronutrients varied with the plant part...|$|E
