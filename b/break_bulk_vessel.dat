40|$|This {{report is}} an {{exploratory}} {{statistical analysis of}} the Norwegian Maritime Authority’s database, using data on groundings, collisions, allisions fires/explosions and some data on capsizings in Norwegian waters from 1981 through 2014. The analysis {{is part of the}} Norwegian Ship Risk Model project. The statistical analysis is divided into two parts. The first part is a descriptive analysis, which identifies common traits in accidents. Vessel types are broken down into 12 categories. Fires/explosions are most common on small fishing vessels in outer coastal waters in Northern regions, with a notable proportion happening in dock. Groundings are most common on cargo vessels in narrow coastal waters in Northern regions, and in the dark. Capsizings typically involve small fishing and cargo vessels in outer coastal waters, and feature strong winds and higher seas. Collisions are most frequent among fishing and <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>vessels</b> in outer coastal waters. Allisions are common among medium sized passenger vessels in the harbour area. The second part of the analysis uses multinomic regression to describe variation between accidents. Accident types vary modestly between vessel types, gross tonnages and length, but substantially between waters. Groundings are associated with narrow coastal waters, collisions with outer coastal, allisions with port areas, and fires/explosions are associated with vessels in dock. Weather has limited effect, although collisions are ten times more likely than other accidents under no visibility. High vessel damage severity was primarily associated with shorter vessels. We were not able to explain much variation in injuries and fatalities. The results indicate a strong need to connect accident data with normalized traffic data to identify risk influencing factors with more certainty...|$|R
50|$|<b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo is {{typically}} material stacked on pallets and lifted {{into and out}} of the hold of a vessel by cranes on the dock or aboard the ship itself. The volume of <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo has declined dramatically worldwide as containerization has grown. One way to secure <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> and freight in intermodal containers is by using Dunnage Bags.|$|R
50|$|<b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> was {{the most}} common form of cargo for most of the history of shipping. Since the late 1960s the volume of <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo has {{declined}} dramatically worldwide as containerization has grown. Moving cargo on and off ship in containers is much more efficient, allowing ships to spend less time in port. <b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo also suffered from greater theft and damage.|$|R

And the same court, who shall have final jurisdiction of any libel or complaint of any capture, as aforesaid shall and may decree restitution, in whole or in part, when the capture and restraint shall have been made without just cause, as aforesaid and if made without probable cause, or otherwise unreasonably, may order and decree damages and costs to the party injured, and for which the owners, officers, and crews of the private armed vessel or vessels by which such unjust capture shall have been made, and also such vessel or vessels shall be answerable and liable.|$|R

50|$|In shipping, <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo {{or general}} cargo are goods {{that must be}} loaded individually, and not in {{intermodal}} containers nor in bulk as with oil or grain. Ships that carry this sort of cargo are called general cargo ships. The term <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> derives from the phrase breaking bulk—the extraction of {{a portion of the}} cargo of a ship or the beginning of the unloading process from the ship's holds. These goods may not be in shipping containers. <b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> cargo is transported in bags, boxes, crates, drums, or barrels.
