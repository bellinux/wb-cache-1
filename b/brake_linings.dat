25|$|Natural {{amorphous}} {{and fine}} flake graphite {{are used in}} <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> or brake shoes for heavier (nonautomotive) vehicles, and became important {{with the need to}} substitute for asbestos. This use has been important for quite some time, but nonasbestos organic (NAO) compositions are beginning to reduce graphite's market share. A brake-lining industry shake-out with some plant closures has not been beneficial, nor has an indifferent automotive market. According to the USGS, US natural graphite consumption in <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> was 6,510 tonnes in 2005.|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{operation}} of the brake is characterized by the conversion of mechanical energy into heat which results in an increase of temperature on contact's surface of sliding parts. Increased temperature affects the reliability of the brake and reduces the <b>brake</b> <b>lining's</b> life time. It is therefore very important to the design or selection of the brake to know the heating level for the assumed operating conditions. This paper presents an example for checking the temperature of the cranes brake. The set up mathematical model was solved numerically (finite volume method). The used method was tested on examples that have an analytical solution and it can be used for an arbitrarily long period of cranes work...|$|R

40|$|Asbestos is a naturally-occurring {{mineral fiber}} with a silky texture whose {{distinctive}} properties-high mechanical strength, even at high temperatures; incombustibility; good insulating qualities; durability; flexibility; indestructibility; and low cost- have caused its widespread use in industry. 4 Brazil {{is among the}} world's five greatest producers of asbestos and {{is also an important}} consumer of the mineral. There is, therefore, {{a great deal of attention}} being paid by the world scientific community to Brazilian practices now that most European countries have prohibited the use of asbestos. The largest asbestos mine in Brazil at the present time is located in the Municipality of Minaçu in the State of Goiás. The mine is managed by subsidiaries of the French multinational Saint-Gobain, whose home country has prohibited asbestos since the beginning of 1997. Asbestos is used in thousands of products in Brazil, especially in the construction industry (roof tiles and water tanks) and in other sectors and products such as <b>brakes</b> (<b>linings</b> and pads), joints, gaskets, clutch plates, cloth, and in special coatings and coverings such as paints and floor tiles, among other uses (Giannasi, 1995).

Our study dealt with elucidating the antibacterial effect of AlcellRTMlignin. It would appear that adsorbance of E. coli cells to AlcellRTMlignin particles is not essential for destruction of the organism. The antibacterial activity was delayed by the inclusion of Mg 2 + ions in the AlcellRTMlignin filtrate or in the enumeration medium (BHIA). Addition of bile salts to the enumeration medium (BHIA) enhanced the culturability loss of E. coli cells suspended in the filtrate of AlcellRTMlignin. Using FTIR methodology, it appears, that compounds of AlcellRTMlignin affect phospholipid-phospholipid and/or phospholipid-protein interactions in bacterial membranes, causing the patching of membrane phospholipids and proteins.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Increased machine {{performance}} through reduction of drivetrain power losses {{is an important}} goal in powertrain engineering. One key area of power loss in the driven axles of heavy on-road vehicles and off-highway vehicles is the disengaged wet brake conjunctions. The resultant power loss, particularly under cold start conditions, can be quite significant. The addition of patterned grooves into the <b>brake</b> friction <b>linings</b> assists lubricant flow to dissipate heat during contact, which complicates the prediction of performance, making design improvement a multi-variate problem. A Reynolds-based numerical model with the inclusion of lubricant inertial terms is developed, allowing time efficient prediction of the conjunctional torsional viscous losses. The numerical model is validated with CFD as well as experimental measurements, using a developed component based test rig. Good agreement is found for predictions against measurements for lower viscosity lubricant flow at higher bulk oil temperatures. The results show deviations at lower temperatures promoting higher viscosity inlet starvation, which is not taken into account with the assumed fully flooded inlet...|$|R

There are the {{analysis}} and estimation of disc <b>brake</b> friction <b>linings</b> deformation value and impact on the friction body (friction lining on steel base) loading given in this article.

2500|$|Though not {{as obvious}} as the car's radical styling, the new chassis {{was just as}} {{important}} to the Sting Ray's success. Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster recirculating ball, or [...] "Ball-Race", steering, and a shorter wheelbase. The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride, but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it. Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering, and with some 80 additional pounds on the rear wheels, the Sting Ray offered improved traction. Stopping power improved, too. Four-wheel cast-iron 11-inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider, for an increase in effective <b>braking</b> area. Sintered-metallic <b>linings,</b> segmented for cooling, were again optional. So were finned aluminum drums, which not only provided faster heat dissipation (and thus better fade resistance) but less unsprung weight. Power assist was available with both brake packages.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesTwo magnesium/silicon {{aluminium}} alloys each reinforced with 20 vol. % SiC particulates have been worn against three different automobile friction <b>linings</b> (<b>brake</b> pads). Two of the friction linings {{are commonly used}} against cast iron brake rotors while the third has been formulated for use against aluminium MMC brake rotors. Wear processes at the interfaces of the specific rotor - pad combinations have been characterised through the analysis of friction traces {{and the use of}} optical and electron microscopy. Models on the interdependence of friction and wear, and models of wear mechanisms for aluminium MMCs and cast iron sliding against friction materials have been proposed and discussed. For an aluminium MMC sliding against an organic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are low and friction is constant due to the formation of a solid lubricant layer at the wear interface. When this MMC is worn against a semi-metallic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are extremely high due to two and three body abrasion which lead to subsurface delamination and early melt wear in the MMC. For an aluminium MMC developed for its use in automobile brake rotors sliding against a semi-metallic pad specifically formulated for its use against MMC brake rotors, wear rates at low loads are low although friction traces are irregular and fracture of the SiC particulates occurs at the lowest load and sliding velocity. This fracture of SiC is caused by the abrasive action of hard alumina particles within the pad. At high loads and sliding velocities cohesiveness of materials within the pad is poor and the wear rate of the MMC is extremely high. At the highest load/sliding velocity combination, the wear resistance of the MMC is inferior to that of its unreinforced matrix. If the structure and composition of friction linings are arranged correctly, the wear resistance and frictional performance of aluminium MMC brake rotors are superior to those of cast iron brake rotors. In addition, the lower density of aluminium MMCs provides for an economic advantage over cast iron with respect to efficient use of fuel, and fabrication expenses...|$|R
