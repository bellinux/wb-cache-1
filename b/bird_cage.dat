5|$|Borden {{launches}} a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingénieur. Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and that sometimes he is lying {{when he says he}} loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a bench chair inside a pale-blue room, {{surrounded}} by interior waterfalls. Glitches of Hamasaki appears, and she starts singing the song while seated. The next scene features damaged–archive footage of a destroyed town, fenced in with barbed wires. A young boy, with pale white skin, blonde dreads, and angel wings, appears in the distance. Several scenes features the boy looking towards the camera, which then inter cuts to scenes with Hamasaki singing the song in the room. The young boy wonders through the destroyed town, observing damaged homes and objects. The boy places his hands upon a dying tree, where he envisions the events of how the town became destroyed and dismantled. These scenes include burning flowers, falling construction, and broken religious statues. The second chorus has Hamasaki singing, and the song break shows the boy observing a blossoming flower which hasn't died. Smiling, he walks towards it, unbeknown that there is sharp barbed wire surrounding it. Scenes features Hamasaki singing, and shows brief inter cut scenes of barbed wire wrapped around the young boy. Struggling to become free from the wire, the young boy dies and leaves behind a large pile of angel feathers. The final scene features Hamasaki wearing exactly the same outfit as the angel, trapped in a large <b>bird</b> <b>cage,</b> in the room the video started with. The video zooms out on the overall appearance of her.|$|E
25|$|Local {{architect}} Louis John Gill {{designed the}} original buildings, cages and animal grottos {{and later in}} 1926, the Spanish Revival-style research hospital, for which Gill received an Honor Award from the San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

40|$|ABSTRACT Red x Rock {{sex-linked}} {{females were}} used in an experiment in which the birds were transferred from floor rearing facilities to laying cages at 6, 11, 16 or 21 weeks of age. Commercial-type starter, grower and layer diets were fed ad libitum to all birds. The feed efficiency, hen-day and hen-housed egg production of the <b>birds</b> <b>caged</b> at 16 or 21 weeks of age {{were significantly higher than}} that of those caged at 6 weeks of age and their hen-housed egg production was significantly higher than that of those caged at 11 weeks. Livability of the <b>birds</b> <b>caged</b> at 11 weeks was significantly lower than that of the <b>birds</b> <b>caged</b> at all other ages...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{the larger}} {{and the more}} active the bird, the larger the cage one should use. The amount of time the bird will spend in the cage each day is also a factor. A <b>bird</b> that is <b>caged</b> {{most of the time}} {{requires}} far more space than a <b>bird</b> <b>caged</b> only at night.|$|R

25|$|The 1904 St. Louis World's Fair is {{credited}} {{for the birth}} of the Saint Louis Zoo. The fair brought the world's attention to St. Louis and Forest Park. The Smithsonian Institution constructed a walk-through <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> for the World's Fair. Ten days after the World's Fair closed, the citizens of St. Louis chose to buy the 1904 World's Fair Flight Cage for $3,500, rather than have it dismantled and returned to Washington, D.C. This was the first piece of what would become the Saint Louis Zoo.|$|E

His work with Ringling Bros. has been described as [...] "reinvent the aerial ballet". The <b>Bird</b> <b>Cage</b> Girls, The Swing High Girls, The Whirl Girls and the Cloud Swing Girls were among the female aerialist troupes whose routines were Barbette's specialty. He created the circus sequences for the Orson Welles-produced Broadway musical Around the World.|$|E
500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics; some reviewers criticised {{its lack of}} originality, while others praised its production and lyrics. The song peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number three on the Irish Singles Chart. It also charted on the singles charts in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden and Turkey. The song's accompanying music video was directed by Emil Nava and features the group's members in a house of mirrors, a <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> and a room covered in graffiti.|$|E

500|$|Within King's Cross, a {{cast-iron}} [...] "Platform 9¾" [...] plaque was erected in 1999, initially in a passageway connecting the main station {{to the platform}} 911 annexe. Part of a luggage trolley was installed below the sign: the near end of the trolley was visible, but the rest had disappeared into the wall. The location quickly became a popular tourist spot amongst Harry Potter fans. The sign and a revamped trolley, complete with luggage and <b>bird</b> <b>cage,</b> were relocated in 2012, following {{the development of the}} new concourse building, and are now sited next to a Harry Potter merchandise shop. Because of the restrained facade of the real King's Cross station, the Harry Potter films showed St. Pancras in exterior station shots instead.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in November 2012 and premiered on 5 December 2012. The video has a metaphorical theme, and features Lewis {{in a giant}} <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> in a dimly lit room, wearing the long ivory sleeved dress and [...] "jewelled eye decorations". Some scenes show the singer in a shadow and darker settings, while others are light and colourful. For most of the video, Lewis ponders {{about being able to}} escape her cage and experience freedom. At the end of the video, she realises that the cage is in fact unlocked and she is able to leave her confine, and leaves. Lucy Buckland for the Daily Mail felt that Lewis looks [...] "positively mournful" [...] in the video, and that while {{it may not be the}} best advert for feminism, she looks [...] "beautiful".|$|E
500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her third studio album Glassheart (2012). It was written by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and produced by Josh Abrahams, Ammo and Oligee. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles and is a power ballad, incorporating a piano and synth-driven melody. The lyrics consist of Lewis informing her past lover that enough time has passed since their relationship {{for her to have}} moved on and to have developed as a person. Critics praised Lewis' vocal performance, likening her technical abilities to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. The musical structure of the song was heavily compared to one of her previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", along with songs performed by Adele. The accompanying music video shows Lewis trying to escape from a giant <b>bird</b> <b>cage.</b>|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{studio in}} the low-budget field {{remained}} a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing Sisters, Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter {{to the people who}} want their gratuitous gore.... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make a}} simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big <b>Bird</b> <b>Cage</b> (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974).|$|E
500|$|The video itself {{includes}} shots {{taken in}} both color and black-and-white. It drew heavy {{inspiration from the}} arts and featured references to Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Andy Warhol's Marilyn Diptych. The video included artistic and complex scenes such as Gaga's head on a swan, a scene in a <b>bird</b> <b>cage,</b> and the singer seated in a large top hat, {{as well as more}} simplistic scenes including Gaga walking in a black outfit wearing a headscarf, and the singer dancing with a white cloth in bright make-up, in a scene similar to the cover art of the single. Throughout the video bursts of color are shown theatrically. As Gaga sings the line [...] "One second I'm a Koons then suddenly the Koons is me", she is transformed into a black swan/human hybrid. Gaga also wears hand-shaped lingerie and a seashell bra with matching shell decoration. Near the climax, the singer features in a violet, crystal-like scene, and at the end, Artpop is spelled using hand gestures.|$|E
500|$|While at Leavenworth in 1920, Stroud found a nest {{with three}} injured sparrows {{in the prison}} yard, and raised them to adulthood. Prisoners were {{sometimes}} allowed to buy canaries, and Stroud had started to add to his collection to occupy his time raising and caring for his birds, which he could sell for supplies and to help support his mother. According to Stroud, he used a [...] "razor blade and nail for tools" [...] and made his first <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> out of wooden crates. Soon thereafter, Leavenworth’s administration changed, and the prison was then directed by a new warden. Impressed {{with the possibility of}} presenting Leavenworth as a progressive rehabilitation penitentiary, the new warden, William Biddle, furnished Stroud with cages, chemicals, and stationery to conduct his ornithological activities. Visitors were shown Stroud's aviary, and many purchased his canaries. Over the years, he raised nearly 300 canaries in his cells, and wrote two books, the 60,000-word treatise Diseases of Canaries (1933), which had been [...] smuggled out of Leavenworth, and a later edition, Stroud's Digest on the Diseases of Birds (1943), with updated, specific information. He made several important contributions to avian pathology, most notably a cure for the hemorrhagic septicemia family of diseases. He gained respect and also some level of sympathy in the bird-loving field.|$|E

500|$|Alongside Aladdins {{other main}} characters, Jasmine embodies the film's {{central theme of}} longing for freedom from some form of {{confinement}} or oppression. Both the film and its characters are influenced by Jasmine's [...] "power of choice". The character's desire for both freedom {{and a sense of}} agency is constantly threatened by other characters and situations; the sole decision Jasmine maintains complete agency over during the entire film is who she falls in love with – aided by the Genie's refusal to use his magical powers to force characters to fall in love – although not who she marries. Although Jasmine yearns to explore her kingdom beyond the confines of her palace, she only gets as far as the marketplace before returning home. Jasmine explores [...] "the idea that enclosing yourself behind walls can make you more vulnerable, not less", as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} character is unprepared and knows little about money when she ventures into the marketplace for first time. In the film, Jasmine releases a flock of birds from their cage, which serves as a metaphor for her own situation, being [...] "caged from a world she has never seen and yearns to be released." [...] Jasmine's bedroom is also shaped like a <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> to represent her own confinement. Jasmine's story also explores themes such as civil rights, racial tolerance, social hierarchy, and Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, 1842, after {{exhausting}} {{his final}} appeal, Colt {{was sentenced to}} death by hanging and remanded to New York City's infamous prison, the Tombs. His sentence was to be carried out on November 14, 1842. Colt asked that he be allowed to marry Caroline Henshaw on the morning of his hanging. While imprisoned, Colt lived luxuriously in his prison cell, receiving daily visits from friends and family, smoking Cuban cigars, sleeping in an actual bed instead of a mound of straw and wearing silk dressing gowns inside and a seal skin overcoat for his daily walks in the prison yard. [...] His cell contained the latest novels, a gilded <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> with a canary and fresh flowers brought to him every day by Henshaw. [...] He dined on meals from local hotels such as quail on toast, game pates, reed birds, and ortolans. [...] Several attempts were made to break him out of the prison by dressing him in women's clothing but all these efforts were foiled. [...] A doctor was hired who claimed he could resuscitate Colt from the hanging, providing the body did not remain suspended long, as he believed Colt's neck to be of such thickness that strangulation would be impossible. [...] Colt's friends put the doctor up in the Shakespeare Hotel {{on the morning of the}} scheduled hanging and planned to bring the body there from the Tombs for resuscitation.|$|E
500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... I {{was fascinated by the}} mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a <b>bird</b> <b>cage</b> and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E
